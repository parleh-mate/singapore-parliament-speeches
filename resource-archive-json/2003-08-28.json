Of  these,\r\n\r\n221,400  members  (17.4%  of total  active  members)  had\r\n\r\nmonthly  mortgage payments that were equal  to,  or  more\r\n\r\nthan,  their monthly Ordinary Account (OA) contributions.\r\n\r\nThis  represents the number of members who currently  use\r\n\r\nall  their  incoming CPF contributions to pay  for  their\r\n\r\nmonthly housing loan instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's question on the amount of cash\r\n\r\nrequired to top up their housing loans once the CPF rates\r\n\r\nare  cut  and the estimated impact of reduction  in  cash\r\n\r\ncirculation based on the CPF cuts, as the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\n(PM)  has yet to announce the changes, I will not be able\r\n\r\nto provide the specific details.  I suggest to the Member\r\n\r\nthat he may defer the questions after the PM has made the\r\n\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INVESTMENT IN AND OUTFLOW FROM SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry since 1997 (a) how many companies have\r\n\r\nmigrated  from  Singapore to lower  cost  countries  each\r\n\r\nyear;  (b) what is the amount of investment outflow  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  to these countries; and (c) what will  be  the\r\n\r\nestimated investment in and outflow from Singapore if the\r\n\r\nemployer CPF contribution rate is cut by 6%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurvey  companies  that  are set up  overseas  without  a\r\n\r\npresence in Singapore.  As companies cease operations for\r\n\r\nmany different reasons, the number of companies that have\r\n\r\nleft Singapore for lower cost countries is not tracked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, information on relocations is obtained from\r\n\r\nsurvey  data  in the Labour Market Survey,  which  covers\r\n\r\nprivate  sector establishments with at least 25  workers.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  this  survey, between 1998  and  2002,  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  66  establishments each year had  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  due  to  relocation.   However,  most  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies retained a presence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Companies' Investments in Lower-Cost Countries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked for the amount of investment\r\n\r\noutflow  from  Singapore  to lower-cost  countries.   The\r\n\r\nstock  of  total  direct  investment  by  Singapore-based\r\n\r\ncompanies  in China stood at $16.5 billion  in  2001,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $6.1 billion from that in 1997.  For  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries,  Singapore companies' total  stock  of  direct\r\n\r\ninvestment was $26.8 billion in 2001, an increase of $8.1\r\n\r\nbillion from that in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to highlight that Singapore-based companies invest overseas for a variety of reasons,\r\n\r\nwith cost-saving being one of them. A recent survey by IE\r\n\r\nSingapore suggests that, in addition to cost saving, much\r\n\r\nof the outward investment by Singapore-based companies is\r\n\r\nto increase sales by serving the growing customer base in\r\n\r\nthese markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, investment outflows do not necessarily\r\n\r\nreflect   `hollowing out' due to high  costs.  Often,  it\r\n\r\nreflects  the drive of our companies to internationalise.\r\n\r\nThis drive will benefit Singapore firms in many ways - to\r\n\r\nexpand into overseas market, to diversify their risk  and\r\n\r\nrevenue,  and to upgrade their offerings of services  and\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some companies have scaled back operations in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there have also been investment inflows.  For\r\n\r\nexample, between 1997 and 2002, EDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  attract  net investment commitments  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector worth $51.7 billion, of which  $38.3\r\n\r\nbillion  was foreign investment. Total business  spending\r\n\r\nby  foreign  services firms was $7.4  billion  over  this\r\n\r\nperiod.  As a result of these inflows, there has  been  a\r\n\r\nrise   in   the  stock  of  net  inward  foreign   direct\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia, however, has raised a very important\r\n\r\nissue  of  the  competition  from  lower-cost  economies.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  many new emerging economies, such as  China  and\r\n\r\nIndia, have improved their capabilities and the skills of\r\n\r\ntheir   workers.   Although  our  workers   have   better\r\n\r\ncapabilities  in  many  instances,  if  our   costs   are\r\n\r\nuncompetitive, many companies will relocate operations to\r\n\r\nlower-cost countries, and new investments would not  come\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.  We would then eventually see a hollowing\r\n\r\nout of the Singapore economy. Jobs would be lost, and new\r\n\r\njobs would not be created. It is therefore vital that  we\r\n\r\nrestructure our economy to meet these challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact of CPF Cut on Investments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia asked what the estimated investment in and\r\n\r\noutflow  from  Singapore would be  if  the  employer  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate is cut by 6%. A CPF cut alone will  not\r\n\r\nensure  that  Singapore  stays competitive.  Nor  can  we\r\n\r\nquantify  the  impact of a cut in CPF rates in  isolation\r\n\r\nfrom other measures to boost investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee has addressed a wide\r\n\r\nrange    of    issues   that   impinge   on   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.    These   measures   include   external\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  enlarge  our economic  space,  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninternal  measures to build new capabilities,  invest  in\r\n\r\nour  people through education and training, and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat our overall costs are competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several measures have already been taken to lower\r\n\r\ncosts.  These  include  cuts in  corporate  and  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax rates, competition in the energy market and  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  industrial land sales to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nland  costs  are  kept internationally competitive.   The\r\n\r\ncorporate tax\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrate has been cut to 22%, and will be brought down to 20%\r\n\r\nby  2005.  Last year, the price of industrial space  fell\r\n\r\nby 8%, while industrial space rentals fell by 7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages constitute, on average, over a quarter of\r\n\r\ntotal business costs excluding the cost of materials  and\r\n\r\npurchases.   A reduction in CPF would lower the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing business here. It would be an integral part of  the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive strategy to attract and retain  investments\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. More importantly, it would make  our  wage\r\n\r\nsystem  more  flexible,  thereby  making  it  easier  for\r\n\r\nemployers to hire workers when conditions improve.  Taken\r\n\r\ntogether,   these   measures  will  enhance   Singapore's\r\n\r\nattractiveness to investors. This will lead to  more  and\r\n\r\nbetter jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DISCONNECTION OF UTILITIES SUPPLIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Assistance schemes for affected households)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Trade and Industry (a) what is the breakdown of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  households whose utility supplies  have  been\r\n\r\ndisconnected in the last six months, by flat size and the\r\n\r\naverage period and amount for which these households have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  arrears; (b) whether SP Services Ltd will  work\r\n\r\nwith  the Community Development Councils (CDCs) in making\r\n\r\na  proper  assessment  of the family's  situation  before\r\n\r\ndeciding  to  disconnect  their  utility  supplies;   (c)\r\n\r\nwhether  for genuine financial hardship cases as assessed\r\n\r\nby  the CDCs and social service agencies, SP Services Ltd\r\n\r\nwill  consider deferring their payments for  the  arrears\r\n\r\nand  allow  them  to only pay the current  charges  until\r\n\r\ntheir financial situation improves or a reasonable period\r\n\r\nof  time  has elapsed; (d) whether SP Services  Ltd  will\r\n\r\nconsider introducing a stored value system like those  in\r\n\r\nthe  US  and  Britain to help Singaporeans take  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their utility usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for water utilities, PUB's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolicy,  since late 2002, has been to thimble  the  water\r\n\r\nsupply  instead of disconnecting it. There have therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  no  disconnections for occupied households  in  the\r\n\r\nlast six months. This practice will be extended until the\r\n\r\neconomic situation improves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For electricity utilities, from January 2003 to June\r\n\r\n2003,  there  have  been  a  total  of  24,786  cases  of\r\n\r\nelectricity disconnections.  This works out to an average\r\n\r\nof  4,131  cases per month.  The House would be  glad  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  households in 1- and 2-room flats make  up  a\r\n\r\nvery  tiny  proportion of these disconnection cases.   In\r\n\r\nfact, they constitute only 0.06% of those that have  been\r\n\r\ndisconnected.  This reflects the fact that such  families\r\n\r\nare  helped,  to  a  very large extent,  by  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunity  assistance schemes that are already  in  place\r\n\r\nand act as a safety net for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, electricity accounts get reconnected\r\n\r\nafter  12  to 15 days. This happens when households  make\r\n\r\narrangements  with  SP  Services  to  pay  up  on   their\r\n\r\naccounts. Households will get reconnected when  they  pay\r\n\r\noff  their  current bill. Previous arrears  can  then  be\r\n\r\nrepaid through instalments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Working with CDCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP Services takes disconnection of the utilities\r\n\r\nseriously. Before disconnection, SP Services delivers  at\r\n\r\nleast two reminders (pink notices) and a final notice  of\r\n\r\nintended  disconnection.  SP Services works very  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  CDCs. When customers inform SP  Services  that\r\n\r\nthey are facing financial hardship and are unable to make\r\n\r\nany  payments, SP Services will recommend them  to  their\r\n\r\nrespective CDCs for financial aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deferring Payment for Genuine Hardship Cases</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After CDCs or social agencies have assessed cases as\r\n\r\nfacing  genuine hardship, SP Services will not disconnect\r\n\r\nbut  allow deferment of payment of the arrears, up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of three months, until the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousehold's   financial  situation   improves.   However,\r\n\r\nhouseholds  must pay their current charges.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent a snowballing of debt. At the end of the day, the\r\n\r\narrears in utilities charges have to be paid. The crux of\r\n\r\nthe matter is that households in difficulty will have  to\r\n\r\nmake  attempts to reduce their consumption of electricity\r\n\r\nand  water.   Those  in hardship should  seek  assistance\r\n\r\neither  from within their family circle or from the  CCCs\r\n\r\nand CDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has multiple schemes to help low\r\n\r\nincome  households  in financial hardship  to  pay  their\r\n\r\nutility  bills. The Rent and Utilities Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(RUAS)  helps households renting 1-, 2- and 3-room flats.\r\n\r\nThe Interim Short-Term Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS)\r\n\r\nis applicable to households owning 1-,  2-, 3- and 4-room\r\n\r\nflats.  If  eligible, the CDCs administering the  schemes\r\n\r\nwill  help  households pay for up to six  months  of  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds' utilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stored Value Metering System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stored value meter system which Dr Maliki\r\n\r\nproposed has in fact been considered in the past.  It  is\r\n\r\na  very  expensive system. The average cost of  a  normal\r\n\r\nelectricity meter for individual households is  $35.   In\r\n\r\ncomparison,  a  basic stored value metering  system  will\r\n\r\ncost  about  $500 per household. For stored  value  water\r\n\r\nmetering system, a normal water meter costs an average of\r\n\r\n$18;  a  stored  value water meter would cost  more  than\r\n\r\n$1,500. If the cost of the stored value metering were  to\r\n\r\nbe borne by only those households opting for it, it would\r\n\r\nbe  an  expensive burden for them. If the cost is  spread\r\n\r\nacross  the whole system, we will be raising the  overall\r\n\r\nsystem cost and electricity tariffs will have to rise  as\r\n\r\na result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will continue to track developments\r\n\r\non  this and if there are other cost-effective solutions,\r\n\r\nwe will certainly be prepared to re-consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, point\r\n\r\nof   clarification  and  supplementary   question.

Would  SP\r\n\r\nServices withhold any action with regard to disconnection\r\n\r\nor  impending disconnection until the CDCs have completed\r\n\r\ntheir  investigations  and  assessments  and  made  their\r\n\r\nrecommendations?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, once a household has\r\n\r\nmade  contact  with  the relevant  agency  and  is  being\r\n\r\nevaluated,  SP  Services will not rush in to  disconnect.\r\n\r\nThe  crux of the point here is to ensure that efforts are\r\n\r\nbeing  made  to  moderate usage and to restructure  their\r\n\r\nfinances  so that this debt can be repaid.

The rise  of  China,\r\n\r\nIndia  and  other  emerging  economies  has  created  new\r\n\r\nchallenges  for  us. The competition for investments  has\r\n\r\nbecome  more  intense.  But  there  are  also  many   new\r\n\r\nopportunities  not  available  to  us  before.  We   have\r\n\r\ntherefore  to reappraise our strengths and weaknesses  in\r\n\r\nthe light of this new situation and reposition ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy to attract investments and create jobs\r\n\r\nhas  two  components  - the external  component  and  the\r\n\r\ninternal component.  First, our external strategy  is  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  the economic integration of ASEAN,  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  linkages to the advanced economies and  develop  new\r\n\r\nlinks  to China, India and other emerging economies.   To\r\n\r\ndate, we have already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsigned  Free  Trade Agreements (FTAs) with  New  Zealand,\r\n\r\nJapan, the European Free Trade Association, Australia and\r\n\r\nthe  US.   We are currently negotiating FTAs with Mexico,\r\n\r\nCanada,  India  and  Jordan.  We are  also  part  of  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for an FTA between ASEAN  and  China.    We\r\n\r\nhave  commenced negotiations with New Zealand  and  Chile\r\n\r\nfor  a  trilateral  FTA.  We are  also  likely  to  start\r\n\r\nnegotiations with South Korea soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these FTAs expand our economic space,\r\n\r\nimprove our connectivity to the major economic centres in\r\n\r\nthe world, and strengthen our position as a major hub for\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  services.  Our  FTAs  complement  our\r\n\r\nInvestment  Guarantee  Agreements  and  Double   Taxation\r\n\r\nAgreements   and  reduce  the  friction  to   trade   and\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of our strategy is internal.\r\n\r\nThere  are many things that we have to do to upgrade  our\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of   our\r\n\r\neconomy.   These  were  covered  comprehensively  by  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee.  Let me summarise  the  four\r\n\r\nmain thrusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must ensure that our infrastructure and\r\n\r\nfactors   of   production   are   priced   competitively.\r\n\r\nCorporate  and  personal income taxes  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreduced.  Our CPF contributions should be restructured to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  statutory burden on employers while  meeting\r\n\r\nbasic retirement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will develop the services sector as a\r\n\r\nmajor  growth engine of our economy.  The services sector\r\n\r\nwill   create  jobs  both  in  traditional   areas   like\r\n\r\nlogistics, ICT, financial services and tourism,  as  well\r\n\r\nas  in  new  areas  like healthcare,  education  and  the\r\n\r\ncreative industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have to push for greater creativity and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   We  have  deep  strengths,  and   our\r\n\r\ninternational reputation has never been higher.  We  need\r\n\r\ncreativity and entrepreneurship to convert our  strengths\r\n\r\nand  reputation  to economic value.  We  need  many  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and Singapore companies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto exploit new opportunities in the region, China, India,\r\n\r\nthe Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will upgrade our human capital by\r\n\r\ninvesting  heavily  in  the  education  and  training  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   and  by  attracting  global   talent   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong also asked about the progress made\r\n\r\nin our investment promotion efforts.  Notwithstanding the\r\n\r\ncompetition    and   the   uncertain   global    economic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  EDB  has  managed to  bring  in  last  year\r\n\r\nmanufacturing fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments of\r\n\r\nS$9  billion, and services total business spending  (TBS)\r\n\r\ncommitments of S$2 billion.  These investment commitments\r\n\r\nwould create 21,000 jobs when fully implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2003, EDB secured S$3.7 billion\r\n\r\nworth of manufacturing FAI commitments, and S$1.1 billion\r\n\r\nof  services total business spending commitments  despite\r\n\r\nSARS.  These would create an additional 9,000 jobs.   EDB\r\n\r\nis on track to bringing in S$7.5 billion of manufacturing\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments this year and  S$1.9  billion  of\r\n\r\nservices  total  business spending  commitments  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> The\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned  that one of the  strategies  was  to\r\n\r\npromote the services sector.

Our  goal is to anchor our  airline  partners\r\n\r\nhere,  attract  more airlines to use Changi  Airport  and\r\n\r\nposition Singapore for the long haul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me stress to Members that an airport does\r\n\r\nnot  exist purely on its own merits.  What do I  mean  by\r\n\r\nthis?   Let  me  illustrate.  If tomorrow, we  are  given\r\n\r\npermission to build an equivalent of a Changi Airport  at\r\n\r\nthe  South  Pole  and we offer airlines all  the  airport\r\n\r\nservices  free  of charge, can that airport automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  a  hub airport?  I think the answer is  obviously\r\n\r\nno.  Airports succeed only when there is enough passenger\r\n\r\ndemand in the locality that the airport is located.   And\r\n\r\nairlines will always fly to airports\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere  there are passengers to be served.  Changi Airport\r\n\r\nhas  grown over the years because Singapore is a  tourism\r\n\r\ncentre and a regional business hub.  The large number  of\r\n\r\nMNCs  located  here, the significant number of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and  professionals who travel  regularly  to\r\n\r\nserve their regional customers, the many Singaporeans who\r\n\r\ntravel  abroad each year on holiday and the seven million\r\n\r\ntourists we attract every year, all add up to a huge base\r\n\r\nload  of  air  travellers.  As long as the base  load  is\r\n\r\nhere,  airlines will continue to serve us  regardless  of\r\n\r\ncompetition from other airports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is how to remain as a key hub airport\r\n\r\nfor  the region.  Here, connectivity and quality  of  the\r\n\r\nairport  are vital factors.  International airlines  that\r\n\r\nserve  the  region  in a limited way  will  look  for  an\r\n\r\nairport  that  has a good base load and good connectivity\r\n\r\nto  the  key cities and attractions in the region.   This\r\n\r\nallows  them  to  fly into the selected hub  airport  and\r\n\r\ndistribute their passengers through other airlines to the\r\n\r\nfinal  destination in the region.  They also look for  an\r\n\r\nairport  that their passengers will feel comfortable  and\r\n\r\nhappy transiting or transferring through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of connectivity, Changi Airport ranks very\r\n\r\nhigh.   Today, Changi Airport serves 63 airlines  and  is\r\n\r\nconnected  to  137 airports in the region and  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  world.   We  will continue our efforts  to  increase\r\n\r\nChangi's  connectivity, both in terms of  attracting  new\r\n\r\nairlines  as well as actively working with them to  serve\r\n\r\nmore destinations.  In terms of passenger comfort, Changi\r\n\r\nAirport  enjoys significant competitive advantage through\r\n\r\nstate-of-the-art   infrastructure   that    is    managed\r\n\r\nefficiently  and  effectively.  Passengers  using  Changi\r\n\r\nfind the speedy clearance, the shopping mall environment,\r\n\r\nthe friendly service and the various passenger facilities\r\n\r\nprovided a very pleasant experience.  Many contrast  this\r\n\r\nwith  the  experience  in other airports.   We  therefore\r\n\r\ncoined  the term \"the Changi Experience\" to describe  our\r\n\r\nairport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lead in terms of comfort and service level,\r\n\r\nhowever,  has  been  narrowed in recent  years  with  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of newer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregional airports.  We must therefore continue to upgrade\r\n\r\nour  facilities,  raise productivity, improve  operations\r\n\r\nand enhance our customer orientation.  As our competitors\r\n\r\ncatch up, we have to learn from them as well.  The Changi\r\n\r\nExperience  is  a  unique  one and  we  must  continually\r\n\r\nrevitalise and enhance it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Changi remains ahead of our\r\n\r\ncompetitors,  we have set up a 3-year S$210  million  Air\r\n\r\nHub  Development  Fund in January this year.   Under  the\r\n\r\nscheme, we have launched a number of initiatives targeted\r\n\r\nat  our  industry  partners  which  will  further  anchor\r\n\r\nChangi's  position as the premier regional air hub.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  CAAS, the Singapore Tourism Board  and  various\r\n\r\nagencies  are  collaborating  with  airlines  to  further\r\n\r\nstimulate  demand  for air travel to,  through  and  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cost competitiveness is another relevant\r\n\r\nfactor.    We   will  keep  our  costs   competitive   by\r\n\r\nbenchmarking internationally and regionally.   Where  the\r\n\r\nsituation  demands it, we have not hesitated to  step  in\r\n\r\nearly.   For  example,  CAAS was  one  of  the  first  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  S$45  million  SARS  relief  package   and,\r\n\r\nsubsequently,  a  S$10  million air  traffic  development\r\n\r\nscheme.   Both schemes help the industry to  lower  their\r\n\r\noperating  costs.  We will continue to look at  our  cost\r\n\r\nstructure  to  ensure that our airline partners  find  it\r\n\r\nprofitable to operate at Changi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also developed the Airport Logistics Park,\r\n\r\nor  ALPS.   Located strategically in Changi's Free  Trade\r\n\r\nZone,  ALPS  leverages on the excellent connectivity  and\r\n\r\nsuperior  handling  efficiency of  Changi  Airport.  This\r\n\r\nenables the logistics companies to enjoy rapid turnaround\r\n\r\nwith  minimal  customs formalities thereby  strengthening\r\n\r\nour position as a leading air logistics hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the longer term, I have tasked my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to look at how we can further develop Singapore\r\n\r\nas  an International Aviation Centre.  Working with other\r\n\r\nagencies,  our vision is to create a vibrant  cluster  of\r\n\r\naviation  and  aerospace companies and activities.   This\r\n\r\nwill then provide another engine of growth for our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naviation sector.  I can therefore assure Members that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry and the CAAS will proactively ensure that Changi\r\n\r\nretains its competitive position in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, the success of\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport, in short, boils down to satisfaction  of\r\n\r\npassengers and our ability to connect with other airports\r\n\r\nand  anchor airline partners.  In the Minister's plan  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to develop the vibrancy of Changi Airport,  how\r\n\r\ndoes  he  propose  to incorporate programmes  that  would\r\n\r\ncontinue to enthuse the service providers to continue  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  excellent  service, which is  a  very  important\r\n\r\nfactor  in attracting tourists and passengers to come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the CAAS engages in close\r\n\r\nconsultation with all their airline partners.  From these\r\n\r\nconsultations, they get a better understanding of what is\r\n\r\nneeded  by not just the airlines but the travel  industry\r\n\r\nas  well.  So, by having all these dialogue sessions,  we\r\n\r\nare  able to formulate programmes to address areas  where\r\n\r\nfurther improvements are needed.  And I think that is how\r\n\r\nChangi Airport has managed to achieve continual progress,\r\n\r\nand we will continue to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

But they are complaining that the cost\r\n\r\nof  hubbing  in Singapore is too high.  Are  we  reacting\r\n\r\nfast enough to ensure that we are able to attract them to\r\n\r\nhub  in  Singapore?   Or are we going  to  wait  until  a\r\n\r\nsituation arises like PSA where we lose the customers and\r\n\r\nthen  we take measures to attract them back to Singapore?\r\n\r\nI would like to get the Minister's input on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I explained just now, if\r\n\r\nthe passenger load is here, airlines will want to operate\r\n\r\nthrough Singapore.

We are  in  discussions  with\r\n\r\nairlines   that  are  interested  in  operating   through\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  I  mentioned just  now,  Changi  Airport\r\n\r\nserves over 60 airlines, and they have operated here very\r\n\r\nprofitably.   If  the budget airlines are  interested  in\r\n\r\noperating  here,  I  am  sure they  will  find  Singapore\r\n\r\nequally profitable for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB RENTAL FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development (a) what is the number of  one,\r\n\r\ntwo  and three-room rental flats currently available; (b)\r\n\r\nhow  many  appeals have been received by the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board (HDB) from single mothers with  custody\r\n\r\nof children who have been barred from renting a flat from\r\n\r\nHDB arising from a sale of their flats due to divorce and\r\n\r\nhow  many  of  these  appeals have been  successful;  (c)\r\n\r\nwhether  HDB  will consider reviewing the income  ceiling\r\n\r\nfor   eligibility   for  rental  flats   to   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration   the  total  number  of  people   in   the\r\n\r\nhousehold,  such as the per capita income  instead  of  a\r\n\r\ngeneric household income ceiling of $800; and (d) whether\r\n\r\nHDB  periodically  reviews  the  financial  situation  of\r\n\r\ntenants  such  that  those whose  incomes  have  improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly can be encouraged to purchase  flats,  thus\r\n\r\nmaking  more  rental  flats  available  for  those   more\r\n\r\ndeserving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  end July 2003, HDB has 3,100 1-room, 2,600 2-room and\r\n\r\n1,800 3-room vacant rental flats which can be let out.  1- and  2-room flats are rented out to families earning $800\r\n\r\nor  less a month under the Public Rental Scheme;  and  3-room  flats  to  households with monthly incomes  between\r\n\r\n$800 and $2,000 under the Rent and Purchase Scheme.   The\r\n\r\nrents are heavily subsidised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing policy, HDB lessees who have sold\r\n\r\ntheir flats are not eligible to rent a flat from HDB  for\r\n\r\na period of 30 months from the date of sale.  The purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  is to ensure that subsidised rental housing  is\r\n\r\ntargeted at those who are genuinely unable to afford home\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for cases where the flat is sold due to\r\n\r\ndivorce, HDB will waive the 30-month debarment and  allow\r\n\r\nthe divorced mother who has custody of at least one child\r\n\r\nto  rent  a  flat  from HDB if she meets the  eligibility\r\n\r\nconditions.  Over the past three years, HDB has  assisted\r\n\r\nabout 1,000 divorced mothers who were granted custody  of\r\n\r\ntheir children to rent flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB have just conducted a review of our\r\n\r\nrental housing policy.  The review addresses, among other\r\n\r\nissues, the MP's questions on whether the current  income\r\n\r\ncut-off  of  $800  per  month  is  relevant  and  how  to\r\n\r\nencourage rental tenants whose financial situations  have\r\n\r\nimproved  over  time to buy a home ownership  flat.   The\r\n\r\noutcome of the review will be announced shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, if there are more\r\n\r\nthan 4,000 rental flats that are available right now, why\r\n\r\nis  it  that  a lot of my residents keep telling  me  the\r\n\r\nresponse  from HDB is that there is a long waiting  list?\r\n\r\nIs there really a long waiting list?  And would the cases\r\n\r\nof  single  mothers  who  have a tendency  to  live  like\r\n\r\nnomads,  unless they get housing, because they have  been\r\n\r\nchased out of their homes, be given priority based on the\r\n\r\ncircumstances that they face?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I get the Minister correct, the single mothers\r\n\r\nare  helped.  Under what circumstances are single mothers\r\n\r\nnot given\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrental housing or told that they have been debarred,  and\r\n\r\nsome  of  them have been debarred permanently?  For  such\r\n\r\ncases, will HDB also consider their circumstances?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is with regard to single mothers\r\n\r\nwho are permanent residents (PRs).  I know the policy  is\r\n\r\nthat  PRs are not eligible for rental flats, but some  of\r\n\r\nthese  single  mothers do have custody of their  children\r\n\r\nand their children are Singaporeans.  But yet, because of\r\n\r\nthe  policy, they are not allowed to rent those flats and\r\n\r\nthey are still moving around looking for housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, yes, there are 5,700 1- and 2-room flats which are available for renting. However, on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, there is a huge number of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  also  asking  for such rental  flats  and  they\r\n\r\ninclude  not  just the single mothers, which  the  Member\r\n\r\ntalked  about, but senior citizens who have  been  chased\r\n\r\nout   of  their  homes  by  their  children,  and   other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have sold their flats  and  because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial hardship are not able to purchase another flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is indeed a long waiting list of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans wanting to rent flats from HDB.  And that is\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why  some of the requests  or  appeals  from\r\n\r\nMembers  may  not have been acceded to.   There  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   eligibility  criteria  which  HDB  applies   in\r\n\r\nprocessing   these  appeals.   For  example,  citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus,   because  we  do  make  a  distinction   between\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  permanent  residents,  and   household\r\n\r\nincome.    There  are,  of  course,  other  disqualifying\r\n\r\ncriteria,  for example, debarring Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\nalready   benefited  from  two  or  even  three   housing\r\n\r\nsubsidies  from  applying  for  rental  flats.    It   is\r\n\r\nimportant and necessary for HDB to have these eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria   and   debarment  criteria  because   subsidies\r\n\r\ninvolved  in public housing are huge, and we have  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to direct the subsidies to those people who require\r\n\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member would understand why there is a\r\n\r\nneed  for such criteria and also why the supply of rental\r\n\r\nflats is less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  the demand for such flats and for that reason,  not\r\n\r\nall  eligible  Singaporeans can be given  a  rental  flat\r\n\r\nimmediately upon request.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, given the\r\n\r\nlong  waiting list for rental flats, is there a case  for\r\n\r\nincreasing  the number of rental flats, especially  given\r\n\r\nthe   fact   that  there  is  an  increasing  number   of\r\n\r\ndowngraders as a result of economic hardship?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Budget debate, I have also asked for a\r\n\r\nreview  of the income ceiling of $800.

What\r\n\r\nproportion  of  it is currently available or  vacant  for\r\n\r\npeople to rent?  And, at the same time, can I also ask if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister can provide information on what is the size\r\n\r\nof the waiting list for us to know the extent of the wait\r\n\r\nthat  our residents will have to endure?  Also, based  on\r\n\r\nthe  waiting  list, has HDB certain kinds  of  assessment\r\n\r\ncriteria  to  look  at the seriousness  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nurgency  of the needs of such families, for example,  the\r\n\r\nsingle  mothers  who really do not have anywhere  to  go,\r\n\r\nexcept  to  rely  on the sympathies of  friends  and  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill of others?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not have the exact number of\r\n\r\nflats that are currently vacant, but I will check up  and\r\n\r\ngive the Member the number.  But I think that is not  the\r\n\r\npoint.   The  point  really is  that  our  rental  scheme\r\n\r\ncarries  a  heavy  subsidy.  And, because  of  that,  not\r\n\r\neverybody who shows up at his meet-the-people session who\r\n\r\nasks  for a rental flat will automatically be given  one.\r\n\r\nThat  is not possible.  However, there are those who  are\r\n\r\neligible.   As I said, for those eligible and  when  they\r\n\r\ncome  to  us, we will offer them these flats  when  their\r\n\r\nturn is due on the queue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are two separate matters. One is the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  flats which are currently in stock under  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Rental Scheme.  There is a separate matter  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member is alluding to, that is, we should change our\r\n\r\ncriteria and we should be more generous in allowing, say,\r\n\r\nsingle mothers to rent HDB flats.  I think that is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na separate matter.  It is a policy issue.  I have earlier\r\n\r\nexplained why we have to have certain criteria,  and  not\r\n\r\neverybody  who  sells  a  flat straightaway,  or  who  is\r\n\r\ndivorced  and  applies for a flat, will be  automatically\r\n\r\ngiven a flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a Singapore permanent resident with a child who\r\n\r\nis  a  Singaporean is in need of a flat.  But  under  our\r\n\r\ncurrent  criteria, we would not give that family  a  flat\r\n\r\nautomatically.    However,  if  there   are   extenuating\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  if  it is a matter  of  severe  financial\r\n\r\nhardship,  we would consider it on a case-by-case  basis.\r\n\r\nBut, as a general policy, the answer is no, we would  not\r\n\r\ngive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would also consider renting flats  to  those\r\n\r\nyoung couples who may not want to commit to buy new flats\r\n\r\nwhen  they  get married due to the trend of  unemployment\r\n\r\nand the prospects of the present job market?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, currently we do not cater to\r\n\r\nthis  group  of  people  because  our  rental  flats  are\r\n\r\nsubsidised flats and they are really meant for  those  in\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income groups.  However, I do recognise  that\r\n\r\nwhat the Member has suggested is something that we should\r\n\r\nlook  into  and HDB is looking into it, and  we  will  be\r\n\r\nmaking some announcements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Could I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister?  Obviously, there is so much mismatch  -  there\r\n\r\nis  a queue, there are vacant flats.  Would HDB, in fact,\r\n\r\nbe  doing a review?  Because the Minister is saying  that\r\n\r\nright now there are certain criteria and because of that,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  accommodate a lot of people.  But  it  would\r\n\r\nappear that there is quite a need out there.  Would there\r\n\r\nbe  a  review  done?  Is there review in the  works?   If\r\n\r\nthere  is not, would he consider that it might be  timely\r\n\r\nto  do a review?  I think for many of the criteria put in\r\n\r\nplace  in  years  past, circumstances  have  changed  and\r\n\r\nsociety  has changed to some extent.  So, would a  review\r\n\r\nnot be timely?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am not exactly sure what the\r\n\r\nMember has in mind when she talks about a review in terms\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neligibility  criteria.  We have certain very  fundamental\r\n\r\ncriteria.    For  example,  the  criterion  on  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   I think that is a very fundamental  point.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans enjoy significant public housing  subsidies;\r\n\r\npermanent  residents do not.  That is a distinction  that\r\n\r\nwe  have made and we are sticking to that distinction for\r\n\r\ngood reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other eligibility criteria are we talking\r\n\r\nabout?   The  30-month debarment which many  Members  are\r\n\r\nfamiliar with.  Why do we have a 30-month debarment?  For\r\n\r\nthe  simple  reason that we do not want to have  somebody\r\n\r\nwho is not deserving of this subsidy, or somebody who has\r\n\r\njust  sold the flat, or somebody who has sold his private\r\n\r\nproperty  and  comes  on  to the HDB  queue  straightaway\r\n\r\novernight.   We say, \"No.  If you have sold your  private\r\n\r\nproperty and you are eligible for HDB flat, you  wait  30\r\n\r\nmonths.\"  I think that is a reasonable criterion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any specific areas where the Member\r\n\r\nwould   like  us  to  review,  in  terms  of  eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria, we would be pleased to consider it.  But as  it\r\n\r\nstands at the moment, the criteria are very simple.  Over\r\n\r\nand above that, I have said many times in this House that\r\n\r\nHDB  is  always willing to look at specific  cases  where\r\n\r\nthey   pertain  to  individual  hardship,  or   financial\r\n\r\nhardship, where it is due to unforeseen circumstances, or\r\n\r\ndemise  of  a  family  member,  etc.   So  there  are  no\r\n\r\nsituations,  as  far as I know, where we have  absolutely\r\n\r\nsaid no, where severe individual circumstances warrant us\r\n\r\nto look at those cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether he will consider converting some\r\n\r\nof  the  unsold  new flats, for example, in  Jurong  West\r\n\r\narea,  as  temporary rental flats for those  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho need to rent the flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Is the Member talking about\r\n\r\nsubsidised or non-subsidised rentals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Subsidised rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> In other words, it is an extension\r\n\r\nof the rental scheme.

The Committee, which completed its report\r\n\r\nearlier   this  year,   concluded  that   there   was   a\r\n\r\nsufficiently  large pool of good students  to  sustain  a\r\n\r\nhigh-quality public university sector catering to 25%  of\r\n\r\nour  primary  one cohort, higher than the 21%  currently.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Committee also pointed out that a new fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity will find it difficult to attract good quality\r\n\r\nstudents  and  faculty staff.  The commitment  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds is likely to yield far\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter  results if we were to leverage on the  value  and\r\n\r\nreputation   already  created  in  our   three   existing\r\n\r\nuniversities - NUS, NTU and SMU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By expanding NTU to become a comprehensive\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  by transforming NUS into a  multi-campus\r\n\r\nuniversity,  we  are  setting out  to  achieve  what  the\r\n\r\nearlier  fourth university proposal aimed to  accomplish,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  creating university capacity for  25%  of  our\r\n\r\nprimary one cohort, while maintaining high quality.   The\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  also supported  allowing  a  few  good\r\n\r\nquality  private  universities to  provide  undergraduate\r\n\r\neducation   in   Singapore   beyond   the   25%    cohort\r\n\r\nparticipation   rate.   The  Government  accepted   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations in May this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign university that EDB plans to attract is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  a  substitute  for  the  earlier   fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity  idea.  A foreign university, if  established,\r\n\r\nwill  be  privately-funded.  It would provide  access  to\r\n\r\nuniversity  education in Singapore  over  and  above  the\r\n\r\ntarget  cohort participation rate of 25% in our publicly-funded  universities.  And it will not detract  from  the\r\n\r\ninitiatives that our own universities are taking to build\r\n\r\nexcellence.   Instead, a Singapore campus of a  reputable\r\n\r\nforeign university, by expanding the choices available to\r\n\r\nstudents  and  faculty, can add to the  vibrance  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity sector as a whole.  To support this objective,\r\n\r\nMOE  will  work  closely with EDB  to  ensure  that  only\r\n\r\nquality  universities with good academic credentials  are\r\n\r\ninvited to establish a campus here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mdm Ho's query on scholarships, PSC\r\n\r\nor  MOE  does  not  decide on the  universities  for  our\r\n\r\nscholars.  It is the scholar who decides where  he  wants\r\n\r\nto study.  The scholar is allowed his choice provided the\r\n\r\nuniversity   is   of  good  standing,  known   to   offer\r\n\r\nsufficiently rigorous curricula to its students, and  the\r\n\r\ncourses pursued meet the needs of the organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister\r\n\r\nelaborate on what he meant by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquality students and quality staff in the context of  the\r\n\r\nanalysis?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> The Committee, in its\r\n\r\nstudy, had assessed the pool of students coming out  from\r\n\r\nour  schools  and  polytechnics and  had  concluded  that\r\n\r\ncatering to 25% of Primary 1 cohort will not diminish the\r\n\r\nquality   we   expect  to  see  of  our   publicly-funded\r\n\r\nuniversities in Singapore.  As for staff, it  is  a  more\r\n\r\nfluid  matter because the universities can attract  staff\r\n\r\nfrom  around the world.  So the key criterion  is  really\r\n\r\nthe   students.    Establishing   quality   undergraduate\r\n\r\ntraining  in Singapore requires that you ultimately  have\r\n\r\nstudents   who  are  able  to  benefit  from  a  rigorous\r\n\r\nuniversity education and meet the graduate manpower needs\r\n\r\nof the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister.

I think  rather\r\n\r\nthan  set  up  an  elaborate system for  accrediting  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  universities, it is more useful  if,  first,\r\n\r\nwithin  our publicly-funded universities, MOE works  with\r\n\r\nthe  universities  to establish that  they  have  a  good\r\n\r\nquality  assurance  system in place.   There  is  a  high\r\n\r\ndegree  of  transparency about the quality of degrees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Employers know the universities,  they  know\r\n\r\nthe different faculties in the universities.  We have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  do  not  spare  resources  on  ensuring\r\n\r\ncontinued improvement on quality within the universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> May I seek\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister?  I believe  we  classify\r\n\r\nSMU  as  a private university, but yet we have subvention\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government.  Can I understand that this concept\r\n\r\nof  the  fourth university with international  university\r\n\r\nwould  be  truly a private university, in the sense  that\r\n\r\nthere is no Government subvention, or would there be  any\r\n\r\nGovernment subvention of some kind?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> MOE would not provide\r\n\r\nsubventions   to   a  privately-funded  university,   for\r\n\r\ninstance, a foreign university attracted by EDB.  Whether\r\n\r\nEDB  provides some incentives for this university or  any\r\n\r\nother  educational institution that they seek to  attract\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  is a separate matter.  That is  a  broader\r\n\r\nmatter of investment promotion and building Singapore  as\r\n\r\nan  education hub.  MOE does not intend to subsidise  the\r\n\r\neducation  provided  by  any private  university  or  any\r\n\r\nprivate education provider generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n(a)  what  are  (i)  the  reasons  for  keeping  so  many\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  the Prime Minister's Office and  (ii)  the\r\n\r\nduties  and responsibilities assigned for each  of  these\r\n\r\nMinisters; and (b) whether the number of senior political\r\n\r\nappointments   in  Government  can  be  cut   to   reduce\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are seven Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\n(PMO),  excluding  the  Prime  Minister.   Each  one  has\r\n\r\nspecific duties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Cabinet taps\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister's  wealth of experience,  knowledge  and\r\n\r\ninsights  on a wide range of issues.  Senior Minister  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  Chairman  of  GIC, the  Government  investment\r\n\r\nmanagement  company  which  invests  Singapore's  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  and  Chairman  of  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore.  He is under PMO because he  also\r\n\r\nlooks  after  the Public Service Division, which  handles\r\n\r\nthe personnel matters and policies of public officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan is the Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence. We created\r\n\r\nthis new appointment because of the grave threat posed by\r\n\r\nterrorism.   The  threat cuts across  the  work  of  many\r\n\r\nMinistries, and requires overarching supervision.  Dr Tan\r\n\r\nchairs  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Security  and\r\n\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan is also in charge of university education.\r\n\r\nIn addition, he chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee on\r\n\r\nDeveloping Research and Professional Manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Minister Lee Yock Suan, as Second Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs,  helps the Foreign Minister  in  policy\r\n\r\nissues  as well as some of his many overseas travels  and\r\n\r\nmeetings.   The  Ministerial appointment  in  PMO  is  to\r\n\r\nreflect  Mr  Lee's  status as  a  senior  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet.   It  carries  more weight  when  he  represents\r\n\r\nSingapore overseas than the title of Second Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Minister Lim Boon Heng is the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  NTUC.  Because of the important role our workers\r\n\r\nplay in the economy, the NTUC Secretary-General holds  an\r\n\r\nappointment in PMO.  He reflects the views of workers  to\r\n\r\nthe Cabinet.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nturn,  he  transmits the thinking of  the  Government  on\r\n\r\neconomic and labour-related issues to the unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the same reason, Mr Matthias Yao Chih,\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary-General of NTUC, is a Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState in PMO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Minister Lim Hng Kiang is Minister in PMO\r\n\r\nand  Second Minister for Finance.  Within PMO,  he  looks\r\n\r\nafter  the  issues  of  aging  population,  marriage  and\r\n\r\nprocreation,  and the attraction of international  talent\r\n\r\nto   Singapore.   These  population-related  issues   are\r\n\r\ncrucial to the long-term survival and prosperity  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, and they cut across several Ministries.  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nalso  runs  the  day-to-day affairs of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no immediate plans to reduce the number of\r\n\r\nsenior political appointments in the Government.

Mr Shanmugaratnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the incidence of\r\n\r\nteenage pregnancy and abortion among school-going teenage\r\n\r\ngirls  is  not  rising.  The number has, in fact,  fallen\r\n\r\nslightly  over the last three years for all females  aged\r\n\r\n17 and below, and remained fairly constant for those aged\r\n\r\n18-19.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexuality education provided in our schools aims\r\n\r\nto   provide   pupils  with  essential  knowledge   about\r\n\r\nsexuality  matters,  including  consequences  of  teenage\r\n\r\nsexual activity, pregnancy and abortion.  It equips  them\r\n\r\nwith  the skills to make informed and responsible choices\r\n\r\non sexuality matters.  It also challenges teenagers to re-examine their values and attitudes on issues and persuade\r\n\r\nthem to adopt a more value-based standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality education in schools should help, but will\r\n\r\nnot  be  a  panacea.  There are many factors involved  in\r\n\r\nteenage  pregnancy and abortion.  They include a lack  of\r\n\r\nfamily support and cohesiveness, sexual abuse and a  lack\r\n\r\nof  understanding  of responsibilities in  relationships.\r\n\r\nIt is a complex issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is early days to assess the impact of the\r\n\r\nsexuality   education  programme.   But   teachers   have\r\n\r\nreported  that  our pupils have responded well.   Pupils'\r\n\r\nresponses   to  pre-  and  post-programme  questionnaires\r\n\r\nindicate  significant increase in their understanding  of\r\n\r\nsexuality matters, including the negative consequences of\r\n\r\nteenage sexual activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also getting good support from our parents.\r\n\r\nAlthough  parents have the choice to opt  their  children\r\n\r\nout  of  the  sexuality education programme, the  opt-out\r\n\r\nrate  is  less than 1%.

What kind\r\n\r\nof  advice does the teacher give, and what happens to the\r\n\r\ngirl?   Is  she  allowed to continue schooling?

The people  must\r\n\r\nthen  decide which road to take, to continue the journey.\r\n\r\nOne  road  may lead them up to the sunny highlands.   The\r\n\r\nother road may go deeper into the gloomy valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at such a crossroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down one road, the view is familiar. We see, as part\r\n\r\nof  the landscape, our present policies and practices and\r\n\r\nour  high wage and CPF systems.  This is the easiest road\r\n\r\nto take.  Politically too, it is the most convenient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maintaining the status quo means carrying a\r\n\r\nheavy  load of costs, and relying on outdated  models  of\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.   This  will weigh  us  down.  We  will\r\n\r\ndescend into the gloomy valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the second road, which leads to the\r\n\r\nhighlands, we will have to shed some of our load, through\r\n\r\nwage and CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreforms  and  other measures.  We will then  be  able  to\r\n\r\ntravel lighter, and move more nimbly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But shedding our load will involve sacrifice and\r\n\r\npain.   We  may  have  to  adjust  our  aspirations   and\r\n\r\nlifestyles.  Moreover, there is no guarantee of  success.\r\n\r\nHow  we progress will depend on what our competitors  do,\r\n\r\nand the state of the world economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second road of reform and restructuring is\r\n\r\nunpaved  and  difficult  to  travel.   It  will   be   an\r\n\r\nuncomfortable journey, even painful at times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I know that taking the first road will lead us\r\n\r\ndeeper and deeper into gloom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I want Singaporeans to come along with\r\n\r\nme  on  the  road of reform and restructuring.   On  this\r\n\r\nroad,  we stand a much better chance of economic recovery\r\n\r\nand sustained growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we in this tough spot? The reason is\r\n\r\nglobalisation.     Products   and   services,    capital,\r\n\r\ninvestments,  companies  and  people  are  moving  across\r\n\r\nborders more and more freely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has benefited Singapore immensely. We\r\n\r\nhave attracted many MNCs to Singapore, created many jobs,\r\n\r\nand  sold  our products and services to the rest  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these same forces of globalisation can also work\r\n\r\nagainst us.  Globalisation is not just about exports.  It\r\n\r\nis  about  producing goods and services wherever  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  it  can  be done most cheaply and efficiently.  So\r\n\r\nwhen   lower-cost  players  emerge,  and   we   are   not\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  investments will  flow  into  these  places\r\n\r\nrather than to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation of the global economy has been\r\n\r\ngoing  on for some time.  But the process has accelerated\r\n\r\nin  recent  years.   Jobs  are migrating  from  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  to  developing  countries  faster  than   ever\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore too has been affected. For example,\r\n\r\nMaxtor,  a disk drive manufacturer, will be reducing  its\r\n\r\nSingapore workforce once its China plant comes on-line in\r\n\r\n2005.  Maxtor will produce entry-level disk drives in the\r\n\r\nChina  plant,  while  keeping  its  production  of  high-capacity drives here.  Maxtor's competitors, Seagate  and\r\n\r\nWestern  Digital,  have also reduced  their  presence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Seagate has shifted its manufacture of low-end\r\n\r\ndrives to China.  Over the last five years, its Singapore\r\n\r\nworkforce has been reduced from a high of 25,000  workers\r\n\r\nto  9,000  workers today.  Western Digital shifted  2,500\r\n\r\njobs to Malaysia in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just blue-collar jobs that are moving\r\n\r\noffshore.  White-collar jobs are also migrating  to  low-cost  countries like the Philippines, Thailand and India.\r\n\r\nOur  graduates  and yuppies are feeling the  heat.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  for  the first time, more professionals, managers,\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  technicians  (PMETs)  were   laid   off,\r\n\r\ncompared  to production and related workers.  PMETs  form\r\n\r\n43%  of  all  local workers retrenched.   Production  and\r\n\r\nrelated  workers  form  34%, while  clerical,  sales  and\r\n\r\nservice workers made up the remaining 23%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The migration of white-collar jobs will pick up\r\n\r\nspeed in coming years.  Analysts expect many jobs in data\r\n\r\nentry, data reconciliation, call centres and other  back-end functions to move to lower-cost countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, our economy is restructuring\r\n\r\nrapidly, whether we like it or not, whether we are  ready\r\n\r\nfor  it  or not.  It is, therefore, important for  us  to\r\n\r\nhave  some  levers  to pull, to influence  the  pace  and\r\n\r\ndirection of this restructuring. Then we can minimise the\r\n\r\nnegative impact on Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These levers include reforming our tax regime,\r\n\r\nmoderating  our  land  prices and rentals,  investing  in\r\n\r\neducation  and skills training, moving into research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  constructing the Biopolis  to  nurture  the\r\n\r\nlife   sciences   and  pharmaceutical   industries,   and\r\n\r\ndeveloping   other  growth  sectors  like   medical   and\r\n\r\neducational services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these changes will not be enough to stem the\r\n\r\noutflow  of  jobs.  We will also have to  keep  our  wage\r\n\r\ncosts competitive, and not too far out of line with those\r\n\r\nin  the  region.    Presently,  for  every  manufacturing\r\n\r\nworker  in Singapore, a company can hire 13 in China  and\r\n\r\n18  in  India. For every accountant in Singapore, a  firm\r\n\r\ncan  hire two in Malaysia and six in Thailand.  The large\r\n\r\nwage  differential will push jobs out of  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\ndiscourage new investments from coming in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we must go beyond the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Review Committee (ERC), and  make  further\r\n\r\nchanges to the CPF scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF retuning will affect all Singapore workers.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  painful, which is why  I  have  decided  to\r\n\r\npresent  the  CPF  changes myself.  At the  National  Day\r\n\r\nRally, I outlined the changes. Today, I will lay out  the\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social objectives</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is Singapore's most important social safety\r\n\r\nnet.  Its first and principal objective is to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  retirement needs of Singaporeans.  Later,  we  added\r\n\r\nother  social  objectives like saving for home  ownership\r\n\r\nand healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives remain valid today. In fact, the\r\n\r\nneeds have grown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, retirement expenses will go up because\r\n\r\npeople  are  living longer.  An article in the  New  York\r\n\r\nTimes talked about the possibility of living to 600 years\r\n\r\nold,  because  of the promises of genetic  medicine.   It\r\n\r\nexplained   that  our  organs  might  break  down.    But\r\n\r\nscientists  were now breeding special animals that  could\r\n\r\ngrow replacement human hearts and lungs.  Scientists have\r\n\r\nalso  found a chemical in red wine - for those  who  love\r\n\r\nred  wine, please note - which may slow down ageing.  And\r\n\r\ngene  therapy  will allow us to conquer  many  previously\r\n\r\nincurable diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think many people relish the idea of living\r\n\r\nto  600.   Can you imagine having to face your enemy  for\r\n\r\n600 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut I think most people would not mind living to 100.  In\r\n\r\nfact, a good number of Singaporeans are already living to\r\n\r\nnear  a  century. Today, 40,000 Singaporeans are over  80\r\n\r\nyears old.  Of these, 5,000 are over 90!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonging lives will lead to new social problems,\r\n\r\nand  certainly, a need to save more for a longer old  age\r\n\r\nand higher medical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the social perspective, the higher the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic concerns</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But increasingly, we must also consider the impact\r\n\r\nof the CPF on our cost competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s, 80s and 90s, cost competitiveness was\r\n\r\nnot an overriding concern.  We had good growth year after\r\n\r\nyear. During those 30 years, we grew by 8% annually.  Our\r\n\r\nsalaries  too  rose by an average of 8%  every  year.  We\r\n\r\ncould afford to put a lot into the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business costs then were lower than those in\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  And we faced limited  competition.\r\n\r\nMany  of  today's emerging economies were under communist\r\n\r\nregimes  at  that time. Others were highly regulated  and\r\n\r\nprotectionist.  China and India, for instance,  were  not\r\n\r\nopen and attractive to foreign investments. Singapore, in\r\n\r\nfact, was one of the earlier and most ardent advocates of\r\n\r\nan open, MNC-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. China and India, with a\r\n\r\ncombined population of more than two billion people, have\r\n\r\nentered  the  economic  race.  So  too  have  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries, like in Central and Eastern Europe.  They  are\r\n\r\nfollowing  our  MNC-based strategy for  economic  growth.\r\n\r\nTheir  low cost of doing business is extremely attractive\r\n\r\nto investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the cost of doing business in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  reached First World levels,  as  has  our\r\n\r\nstandard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cost competitiveness is a key worry for Singapore today.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, from the economic perspective, we should\r\n\r\nkeep  the  CPF contribution rate as low as possible.  The\r\n\r\nlower  we go, the less the pressure on companies to  move\r\n\r\nout  because  of high wage costs.  Wages account  for  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  20-30%  of  total  business  costs  in  certain\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A new balance is needed</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we need to retune our CPF scheme - to\r\n\r\nstrike a better balance between our social objectives and\r\n\r\nour economic concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to address four aspects of the CPF\r\n\r\nsystem:  the contribution rates, the salary ceiling,  the\r\n\r\nCPF  and Medisave Minimum Sums and the withdrawal at  age 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF contribution rates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF contribution rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF rate is currently 36%: 20% from the\r\n\r\nemployee  and 16% from the employer.  The Government  had\r\n\r\nintended  to  restore the CPF rate to 40%  when  economic\r\n\r\nconditions permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking forward to the future competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment, this is no longer advisable.  It would price\r\n\r\nus  out of the market. We would lose more jobs. We should\r\n\r\ngive up the 40% target, to save jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not rush into this decision. We\r\n\r\nstruggled between our commitment to restore the CPF  rate\r\n\r\nto  40%  and  the economic reality.  You see,  the  trust\r\n\r\nbetween  the people and the Government is paramount.   It\r\n\r\nis  the  basis upon which we have carried out many  tough\r\n\r\nbut  necessary  measures  to improve  the  lives  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   It  is therefore not an easy decision  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to give up a commitment it has made.  It risks\r\n\r\nbreaking the trust between the people and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have no choice. If investors think that we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  restore the 40% rate in the future,  they\r\n\r\nwill  factor this into their cost calculations. They  may\r\n\r\nnot  come. Even those who are here may make plans to move\r\n\r\nout to cheaper locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Singaporeans understand why we are not\r\n\r\nrestoring  the 40% contribution rate.  Our priority  must\r\n\r\nbe to save jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Longer term variable rate of 30-36%</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what CPF contribution rate is\r\n\r\nappropriate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the world economy changes rapidly. It is\r\n\r\nnot  practical to try to identify a single  number  as  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  rate.  No one can be sure how the  competitive\r\n\r\nsituation will evolve. We must also expect our economy to\r\n\r\nrun into rough weather from time to time.  We should thus\r\n\r\nmake  our  system flexible, so that we can put more  into\r\n\r\nthe CPF in good years and cut the rate in bad years. This\r\n\r\nwill  give  us  room to respond quickly to  the  changing\r\n\r\neconomic environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, therefore, that it is better to set an upper\r\n\r\nlimit and a lower limit for the CPF contribution rate for\r\n\r\nthe long-term, instead of a single rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose that this range of rates be from 30% to 36%. The employee contribution rate will be fixed at 20%. The employer contribution will vary between 10 and 16%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not have any formula to decide what the\r\n\r\nactual CPF rate should be at any point in time.  We  will\r\n\r\nlook  at  the prevailing economic conditions, and  assess\r\n\r\naccordingly.   If there is to be a rise  or  cut  in  the\r\n\r\nrate,  we will give as much notice as possible, to  allow\r\n\r\nfor  advance planning.  I do not envisage fine-tuning the\r\n\r\nrate  every  year.  We will only adjust it from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime, when conditions have changed significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our analysis shows that even at a 30% contribution\r\n\r\nrate,  the large majority of Singaporeans will  still  be\r\n\r\nable to save\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenough  for  their retirement needs, healthcare  expenses\r\n\r\nand  housing.   For  instance, a worker  earning  a  50th\r\n\r\npercentile income, or $2,000 per month, will be  able  to\r\n\r\npurchase a 5-room HDB flat.  This is provided we  tighten\r\n\r\nthe withdrawal rule at age 55, as I will explain later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Long-term variable rate of 24-30% for workers aged  above 50 to 55</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers, we will set a lower range of\r\n\r\nrates.  Last year, the ERC established the principle that\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  contribution rate for older workers  should  be\r\n\r\nlower  than  that for younger workers.  This is  to  help\r\n\r\nolder  workers  keep their jobs, and for  those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed, help them find new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those aged 50 to 55, we will set the long-term\r\n\r\nrange  for  the  CPF  rate at 24% to 30%.   The  employee\r\n\r\ncontribution will be 18%.  The employer contribution will\r\n\r\nvary between 6% and 12%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No change in CPF rates for workers above 55</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not change the CPF rates for workers above\r\n\r\nage  55.  The rates are already low.   They are 18.5% for\r\n\r\nthose  aged  55 to 60; 11% for those aged 60 to  65;  and\r\n\r\n8.5% for those above 65 years old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now ask the Clerk of Parliament to\r\n\r\ndistribute a Table, and further Tables later on,  showing\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  target  CPF contribution  rates  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious age groups.

Is our current CPF rate\r\n\r\nof  36%  appropriate?   Is it the  best  rate?   Is  that\r\n\r\noptimal?   If not, what should it be?  The Cabinet  spent\r\n\r\nmore  than  two months grappling with this question.   We\r\n\r\nalso brainstormed with the PAP Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Ministers and MPs felt that the current CPF\r\n\r\nrate  of  36% should remain.  They were of the view  that\r\n\r\nthe external outlook was brightening. Singapore companies\r\n\r\nwere feeling more upbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a cut in the CPF would not solve our\r\n\r\nimmediate problem, which was the lack of demand.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  it would dampen domestic demand  further.   It\r\n\r\nmight also have a negative effect on property prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second group of Ministers and MPs argued that our\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulties had dragged on for far  too  long.\r\n\r\nThe competitive landscape had changed fundamentally.  Our\r\n\r\ncosts   were   now  much  higher  than  our  competitors.\r\n\r\nSingapore needed to respond quickly and decisively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Ministers were also worried that if our wage\r\n\r\ncosts  were  too  high, we might see a jobless  recovery,\r\n\r\nlike  in  the US.  This is a situation where the  economy\r\n\r\ngrows, but few jobs are created.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second group of Ministers and MPs felt,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that we should cut the CPF rate immediately to\r\n\r\n30%.   It would save many companies from going under,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, SMEs.  It would draw in more investments.  It\r\n\r\nwould spur job creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third group of Ministers and MPs agreed that\r\n\r\ndemand  was the immediate problem.  But they argued  that\r\n\r\ncost  competitiveness was a problem  that  we  must  also\r\n\r\nstart to fix now.  They felt that we should bring the CPF\r\n\r\nrate down to 33%, and even lower later, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a vigorous debate, the Cabinet decided that\r\n\r\nthe  best way forward was a moderate cut to the CPF.   It\r\n\r\nshould be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenough  to help companies save costs, but not so  drastic\r\n\r\nas   to   puncture  domestic  consumption.   The  Cabinet\r\n\r\nconcluded that the more immediate problem was a  lack  of\r\n\r\ndemand  for our goods and services.  This is the external\r\n\r\ndemand   for   our   goods  and   services.    But   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  was also a problem,  and  it  would  get\r\n\r\nworse in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st October 2003, the CPF rate will\r\n\r\nbe  lowered  from 36% currently to 33%.   Employees  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  contribute 20%.  Employers will  contribute\r\n\r\n13%,  3  percentage points less than now.  Table 2  shows\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rates for workers aged 50 and below.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nTable 2:  CPF Contribution Rates for Workers Aged 50 and\r\n\r\n                          Below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Date     Total     Employee  Employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         1 Oct 03 33%       20%       13%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers aged 50 to 55, we will bring the\r\n\r\nCPF  rate  down  to  27%, ie, 6% lower than  for  younger\r\n\r\nworkers.   But to cushion the impact, we will not  do  it\r\n\r\nimmediately.  Their CPF rate will come down to 33% on 1st\r\n\r\nOctober  2003, the same as for younger workers.   On  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2005, it will be reduced further to 30%: employee\r\n\r\ncontribution  will  be  cut by  one  point  to  19%,  and\r\n\r\nemployer contribution by 2 points to 11%.  On 1st January\r\n\r\n2006,  the contribution rate will be reduced by a further\r\n\r\nthree  percentage points: again, one point from employees\r\n\r\nand   two  from  employers.   This  will  bring  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate to 27%: 18% for employees  and  9%  for\r\n\r\nemployers.

It  will  boost  our  efforts  to  draw   in\r\n\r\ninvestments, and create jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revised Special and Medisave Accounts Contribution Rates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the contribution rates for the Special and\r\n\r\nMedisave Accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC had earlier recommended higher Special\r\n\r\nAccount rates for CPF members.  The proposal was  5%  for\r\n\r\nCPF members aged 35 and below, 7% for those aged 35 to 45\r\n\r\nyears,  and 9% for those aged 45 to 55 years,  ie,  three\r\n\r\nsteps, 5%, 7% and 9%.  This was to help members set aside\r\n\r\nmore cash savings for their retirement.  Higher rates are\r\n\r\nneeded  if  we  allow  members to  withdraw  50%  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary and Special Accounts at age 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we change the policy on CPF withdrawal\r\n\r\nat age 55, as I will explain later, we can afford to have\r\n\r\nthe  Special  Account  rates lower than  the  ERC  target\r\n\r\nrates.  The new target Special Account contribution rates\r\n\r\nwill  therefore be 5% for members aged 35 and  below,  6%\r\n\r\nfor  those aged 35 to 45 years, and 7% for those aged  45\r\n\r\nto 55 years.

The Medisave Account contribution\r\n\r\nrates  will  remain  at 6% for CPF members  aged  35  and\r\n\r\nbelow, 7% for those aged 35 to 45, and 8% for those above\r\n\r\n45  years  old.  We had earlier planned to  increase  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  Account  contributions, up to  the  ERC  target\r\n\r\nrates  of  7, 8 and 9%, but we will now defer this  move.\r\n\r\nThe figures are given in Table 5.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Table 5:  Medisave Account Target Contribution Rates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 35 and Below  Above 35 to 45  Above 45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Old1          7%             8%           9%\r\n\r\n       New           6%             7%           8%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     1Existing contribution rates are 6%, 7%, 8% for\r\n\r\nrespective age groups.  The Government had\r\n\r\n      earlier accepted the ERC recommendation to change\r\n\r\nto target rates of 7%, 8%, 9%.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF Salary Ceiling</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the CPF salary ceiling. The ERC\r\n\r\nestablished  the  principle that the  CPF  scheme  should\r\n\r\nfocus  on  workers  earning between  the  10th  and  80th\r\n\r\npercentile incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest 10% of wage earners cannot rely on the\r\n\r\nCPF  alone  for their retirement needs.  They  will  need\r\n\r\nother social support schemes.  On the other hand, the top\r\n\r\n20%  of  wage  earners  should  be  able  to  look  after\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If they want to save more for their old age,\r\n\r\nthey  should do so on their own.  We should not  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  through the CPF scheme.  Otherwise,  it  will\r\n\r\nadd  rigidities to our wage system, and impose additional\r\n\r\ncost burden on businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lower Salary Ceiling to $4,500</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the ERC review last year, we had already\r\n\r\ndecided  to  reduce the CPF salary ceiling in two  steps.\r\n\r\nFirst,  from a monthly salary of $6,000 to $5,500 on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2004.   Second, from $5,500  to  $5,000  on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, $5,000 is still higher than the 80th\r\n\r\npercentile monthly salary, which is currently $3,700.  We\r\n\r\nwill,  therefore, lower the salary ceiling  further  from\r\n\r\n$5,000  to $4,500 on 1st January 2006.  It is $4,500  and\r\n\r\nnot  $3,700, and there is a reason for this.  Assuming  a\r\n\r\nreasonable rate of wage increase and inflation, by  2006,\r\n\r\n$4,500  will  be just a little above the 80th  percentile\r\n\r\nincome.   The  phasing in of the CPF  salary  ceiling  is\r\n\r\nshown in Table 6.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     Table 6:  CPF Salary Ceiling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent         $6,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2004      $5,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2005      $5,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2006      $4,500\r\n\r\n</pre>     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary ceiling for additional wages, consisting\r\n\r\ntypically of bonuses, will be adjusted proportionately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensionable civil servants have lower CPF rates and\r\n\r\na  higher  salary  ceiling than non-pensionable  workers.\r\n\r\nTheir salary ceiling will also be adjusted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan to reduce the CPF salary ceiling\r\n\r\nfrom $6,000 to $5,000 will save businesses $260 million a\r\n\r\nyear.   The  additional reduction  to  $4,500  will  save\r\n\r\nbusinesses   another  $137  million.    In   total,   our\r\n\r\nbusinesses will save $400 million in wage costs annually,\r\n\r\ncome 1st January 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reward workers through variable pay</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in this difficult economic environment, some\r\n\r\ncompanies  are doing well.  The cut in the CPF rates  and\r\n\r\nthe  lowering  of  the  salary  ceiling  will  give  them\r\n\r\nwindfall  profits.   I urge these companies  to  use  the\r\n\r\nsavings to reward their workers through the variable  pay\r\n\r\ncomponent.   This could be in higher performance  bonuses\r\n\r\nor monthly variable components.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the CPF rate and salary ceiling will\r\n\r\ngive  employers substantial wage savings.  But they  will\r\n\r\nmean  less CPF savings for workers.  This makes  it  even\r\n\r\nmore important that the savings be used only for housing,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and  retirement  expenses.   To  ensure  that\r\n\r\nmembers  have  enough for healthcare and  retirement,  we\r\n\r\nmust  adjust  the  CPF  and Medisave  Minimum  Sums,  and\r\n\r\ntighten up the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  rules  at age 55.  These are  the  third  and\r\n\r\nfourth areas of change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Raise CPF Minimum Sum to $120,000</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Minimum Sum gives CPF members a monthly\r\n\r\npayment after their retirement at age 62 a certain sum of\r\n\r\nmoney.   It  is  the nest egg that will see them  through\r\n\r\ntheir old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Minimum Sum is $80,000. Half of this\r\n\r\ncan  be  in a property pledge.  So most CPF members  have\r\n\r\nonly  $40,000 in cash in the Minimum Sum.  This will fund\r\n\r\na  monthly payment of only $252 from age 62 to 80.  It is\r\n\r\na  small fraction of most workers' last drawn pay, and is\r\n\r\nnot enough for their basic needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, therefore, increase the Minimum Sum from\r\n\r\n$80,000 to $120,000 in today's dollars.  As before,  half\r\n\r\nof  this  can be in a property pledge.  The other $60,000\r\n\r\nin  cash  will yield a monthly payment of $378.  This  is\r\n\r\nstill not much, but more adequate than $252 presently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 7 gives the details of the phasing in of the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum.\r\n\r\n<pre>                      \r\n\r\n     Table 7:  CPF Minimum Sum (in today's dollars)\r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\nCurrent           $80,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2004        $84,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2005        $88,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2006        $92,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2007        $96,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2008       $100,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2009       $104,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2010       $108,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2011       $112,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2012       $116,000\r\n\r\n1 Jul 2013       $120,000\r\n\r\n</pre>     \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Minimum Sum will be raised by $4,000 a year,\r\n\r\nand  adjusted for inflation, starting 1st July 2004.   It\r\n\r\nwill reach $120,000 (today's dollars) by 2013.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the life expectancy of Singaporeans is about\r\n\r\n80 years.  We will, therefore, adjust the monthly payment\r\n\r\namounts,  to make the Minimum Sum savings last around  18\r\n\r\nyears  for most members, from retirement at age 62  until\r\n\r\nthey are 80 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintain purchasing power of Medisave Minimum Sum</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the CPF Minimum Sum, there is also a\r\n\r\nMedisave   Minimum  Sum.   This  is  currently   $25,000.\r\n\r\nMinister  Khaw  Boon  Wan  will  do  his  best  to   keep\r\n\r\nhealthcare costs reasonable.  But we should still  expect\r\n\r\ncosts  to  increase over the years.  We will,  therefore,\r\n\r\nadjust  the Medisave Minimum Sum every year to take  into\r\n\r\naccount   inflation  of  healthcare  costs.   This   will\r\n\r\npreserve its purchasing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforce Medisave Minimum Sum</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, under current rules, a CPF member who has less\r\n\r\nthan  $25,000 in his Medisave Account is not required  to\r\n\r\ntop  it  up to $25,000.  This is the case even if he  has\r\n\r\nexcess  balances  in  his Ordinary and  Special  Accounts\r\n\r\nwhich he can withdraw at age 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Medisave Minimum Sum is to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  we  have  enough  money  set  aside  to  meet\r\n\r\nhealthcare  expenses  in  our  older  years.    As   life\r\n\r\nexpectancy  increases, Singaporeans will  spend  more  on\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   Furthermore, on average,  someone  aged  80\r\n\r\nspends  three  to  five  times more  on  healthcare  than\r\n\r\nsomeone  aged  62.   Each additional year  of  life  adds\r\n\r\nconsiderably to healthcare expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, unsatisfactory to allow CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  with excess balances in the Ordinary and Special\r\n\r\nAccounts to withdraw the money at age 55 without  topping\r\n\r\nup  the  Medisave  Minimum Sum.   We  will  progressively\r\n\r\nrequire them to do so, as shown in Table 8.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>     \r\n\r\n\tTable 8:  Medisave Minimum Sum to be Topped Up\r\n\r\n  Before CPF Withdrawal at Age 55 (in today's dollars)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent             $0\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2004        $2,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2005        $5,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2006        $7,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2007        $10,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2008        $12,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2009        $15,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2010        $17,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2011        $20,000\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2012        $22,500\r\n\r\n1 Jan 2013        $25,000\r\n\r\n</pre>     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 2004, we will require CPF members\r\n\r\nto  top  up their Medisave Minimum Sum to $2,500,  before\r\n\r\nthey  make any CPF withdrawal at age 55.  Over  the  next\r\n\r\nten  years,  we  will increase the top-up requirement  by\r\n\r\n$2,500  every  year,  adjusted for inflation.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  on  1st January 2005, Singaporeans  must  top  up\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave  Minimum Sum to $5,000;  on  1st  January\r\n\r\n2006, it will be $7,500; and so on.  By 1st January 2013,\r\n\r\nCPF  members  will have to top up their Medisave  Minimum\r\n\r\nSum to $25,000 (today's dollars), before making their CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Withdrawal rule at age 55</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final area of change is the CPF withdrawal rule\r\n\r\nwhen   a  member  turns  55.   This  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  have  enough  for  their  retirement,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and housing expenses, despite the  lower  CPF\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Meeting Minimum Sums before cash withdrawal</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, at age 55, CPF members can withdraw 50%\r\n\r\nof their combined Ordinary and Special Accounts balances.\r\n\r\nThey can do so even if this leaves them with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nless than $40,000 in the CPF, which is supposed to be the\r\n\r\ncash portion of the current CPF Minimum Sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50% withdrawal rule will leave many members with\r\n\r\ninsufficient CPF balances to see them through  their  old\r\n\r\nage.   Now  that  we  have to lower the CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate, the problem will be even more acute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will amend this rule. We will still allow\r\n\r\nmembers  to withdraw their CPF at age 55, but only  after\r\n\r\nthey meet the CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, CPF members will continue to be able to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the first $5,000 in their CPF accounts,  as  is\r\n\r\nthe  case now, even if they have not met the Minimum Sums\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No change for next 5 years</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the changes to the CPF withdrawal rule\r\n\r\nwill  upset  many plans.  Older Singaporeans are  looking\r\n\r\nforward  to  a tidy sum of money at 55, to do  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  yearned for a long time.  Some will use it  to  pay\r\n\r\noff  outstanding mortgages, or their debts.  Others  will\r\n\r\nuse  it to go on a long holiday, or to invest in business\r\n\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will not make any changes to the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  rule for the next five years.   We  will  not\r\n\r\nupset the plans of those who are over 50 today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Phase out 50% withdrawal by 2013</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will start to phase out the 50% withdrawal rule\r\n\r\nonly from 1st January 2009, and then do so over a further\r\n\r\nperiod  of five years.  This is shown in Table  9.   From\r\n\r\n1st  January  2009, members turning 55 can only  withdraw\r\n\r\n40%  of their Ordinary and Special Accounts, and then the\r\n\r\nremaining balances, if any, after they have met  the  CPF\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  and the Medisave Minimum Sum  requirements.\r\n\r\nThis  percentage  of  withdrawal  will  go  down  by   10\r\n\r\npercentage  points  each year.  In other  words,  30%  in\r\n\r\n2010, 20% in 2011 and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>  \r\n\r\n\tTable 9:  Withdrawal of OA and SA Balances at Age 55\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil 31 Dec 08        50% (unchanged)\r\n\r\n2009                         40%\r\n\r\n2010                         30%\r\n\r\n2011                         20%\r\n\r\n2012                         10%\r\n\r\nFrom 1 Jan 2013               0%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come 1st January 2013, CPF members who reach 55 can\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the  balances  in their  Ordinary  and  Special\r\n\r\nAccounts only after setting aside the CPF Minimum Sum and\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave  Minimum Sum.  This means  that  the  first\r\n\r\ngroup of Singaporeans to be fully subject to the new rule\r\n\r\nwill be those who turn 45 on 1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the worries of Singaporeans. From\r\n\r\nfeedback, I know that they have been anxiously re-looking\r\n\r\ntheir  finances  since I announced  the  changes  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Day Rally.  Most Singaporeans will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncope.  But many may have to do some belt tightening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help ease their adjustment pain.\r\n\r\nWe  have  put  together an assistance package.   It  will\r\n\r\ninclude measures to help homeowners cope with their  loan\r\n\r\nrepayment, which may be affected by the cut in CPF.   The\r\n\r\npackage  will also contain further measures to  help  the\r\n\r\nlow  income and unemployed, and tide businesses over this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  slow economic growth.  DPM Lee will  announce\r\n\r\nthe details later in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been speculation whether the Government\r\n\r\nwill  postpone  the  implementation  of  the  one-percent\r\n\r\nincrease in GST scheduled for 1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we will not. We will be proceeding as planned.\r\n\r\nWe  have  delayed it by one year already.  We should  not\r\n\r\ndelay the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincrease  any further.  The GST increase is part  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic restructuring.  It is to make up for the loss of\r\n\r\nrevenue  from our lowering of income taxes.  The Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares will enable Singaporeans  to  offset\r\n\r\nthe GST increase for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion - Teamwork</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes I have announced are the most drastic we\r\n\r\nhave  ever  made to the CPF system.  They  are  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause we are seeing the most drastic changes yet in our\r\n\r\nexternal  environment.  China and India especially,  pose\r\n\r\nformidable competition, with their abundant, skilled  and\r\n\r\nlow-cost manpower.  We have to lower our costs to  remain\r\n\r\nattractive  to investors, even as we embark  on  a  wider\r\n\r\nexercise to lift our economy to a higher plane.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singaporeans are worried about the\r\n\r\nfuture.  They wonder whether we can ever return to  sunny\r\n\r\ndays, given the strong competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, we transformed ourselves from Third\r\n\r\nWorld  to  First in just 38 years, against all odds.   We\r\n\r\nhave  developed many strengths and advantages  along  the\r\n\r\nway  -  the  common  use of English,  the  rule  of  law,\r\n\r\nharmonious  labour  relations, excellent  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nand a good reputation.  These strengths will continue  to\r\n\r\nstand us in good stead as we face stronger competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, we have a strong team, working\r\n\r\ntogether for the success of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, our workforce is first class. We have\r\n\r\nestablished  companies  that  are  well-run,  financially\r\n\r\nsound   and  expanding.   At  the  same  time,  we   have\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who are starting a variety  of  businesses\r\n\r\nand  venturing  beyond  Singapore.   Our  grassroots  and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders help keep our nation united.   And  our\r\n\r\nmedia  plays  a constructive role in helping  our  people\r\n\r\nunderstand our surroundings and challenges better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe our past success to teamwork - the people,\r\n\r\nthe  employers and the Government working hand  in  hand.\r\n\r\nAs a team, we have won many matches for Singapore.  If we\r\n\r\ncontinue to pull together as a team, we will also triumph\r\n\r\nover the upcoming challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must also alter our strategy and improve our\r\n\r\ncapabilities,   because   the  competition   has   become\r\n\r\nstronger.   If  we do not, we will surely not  reach  the\r\n\r\nhighlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the changes to the CPF scheme are an\r\n\r\nimportant component of our wider re-strategising for  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   They  will go a long way to improve  our  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  We must implement the changes,  and  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, help those who are affected to adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the changes and your co-operation, I am\r\n\r\nconfident that we will not revert to being a Third  World\r\n\r\ncountry  again.  On the contrary, we will strengthen  our\r\n\r\nposition in the First World.

This move will further enhance  our  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  flexibility and thus help save jobs  and  sustain\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.   I  am happy that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nstruck a good balance with structural changes in the long\r\n\r\nterm  and softer impact on workers.  We are reassured  by\r\n\r\nPM  that most Singaporeans would be able to cope with the\r\n\r\nchanges  made to the CPF.  And the fundamental objectives\r\n\r\nof  financial  security in retirement and home  ownership\r\n\r\nwould not be compromised with the proposed changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that workers will applaud the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision  to take  a  gradual  approach  in\r\n\r\nimplementing these changes.  This is most welcomed as  it\r\n\r\nhelps workers to adapt to the changes and retuning of the\r\n\r\nCPF  scheme.   I am also pleased that the Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  shown  consideration  with  the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nchanges  made on the withdrawal age of 55.Those  who  are\r\n\r\nnow  51 years old need not have to worry that their plans\r\n\r\nafter 55 years old will be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope employers will respond positively to PM's\r\n\r\ncall  to plough back the savings, particularly for  those\r\n\r\ncompanies which are doing well, to workers in the form of\r\n\r\nvariable payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF changes this round would be most\r\n\r\ndrastic.    The   changes  will  affect  various   groups\r\n\r\ndifferently.  Based on the feedback I received  from  the\r\n\r\nunion  leaders,  the  main  concerns  across  the  entire\r\n\r\nworkforce  are that the cost of living is high and  their\r\n\r\ncommitment  on housing will be affected.  It  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult transition for many people, a large part of  it\r\n\r\nis  emotional.  Most people would require more  time  and\r\n\r\nmore help to face this hard reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union leaders, in general, agree that the CPF reform\r\n\r\nis  necessary at this point of time.  But they hope  more\r\n\r\ncould be done to help those who face difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, as we acknowledge the urgency to\r\n\r\nrestructure our economy and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreform  wages  and retune CPF, we also  need  a  thorough\r\n\r\nreview and reform in the way we address the social  needs\r\n\r\nof  the workers.  The Government needs to commit and take\r\n\r\nconcrete  efforts in refining the social  safety  net  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassroots and union leaders agree that wages are\r\n\r\nhigh.  However, they feel that the cost of living is also\r\n\r\ntoo   high  and  thus  it  would  be  difficult  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustments to the wages.  Whilst workers are prepared to\r\n\r\naccept restructuring and CPF reform, what they have heard\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Government  is:  be  prepared  to  pay  more,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  areas  such  as  public  transport  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   I am pleased that the Acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth has recently announced that MOH will take steps to\r\n\r\naddress  the issue of medical cost. But there is still  a\r\n\r\nstrong perception that the Government had not done enough\r\n\r\nto bring the other cost components down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take public transport as one example. The bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  to pay for the costs of maintaining  the\r\n\r\nbus  interchanges and terminals.  But the advertising and\r\n\r\nrental  revenue from these areas goes back to  LTA.   The\r\n\r\npublic  does  not understand why this revenue  cannot  go\r\n\r\ndirectly to the operator to help defray part of the costs\r\n\r\nso as to bring public transport costs down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the economic landscape is very much different\r\n\r\nfrom  that of the 1990s.  It is therefore timely for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  really consider doing another  review  to\r\n\r\nlook  into the cost of living again and the areas of  key\r\n\r\nconcern,   such  as  health,  education,  transport   and\r\n\r\nhousing.    More   importantly,   to   seriously   review\r\n\r\nGovernment policies, for example, rules and requirements,\r\n\r\nthat  have  an  impact on or are likely to  become  cost-driving factors to our cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes to the CPF will also affect many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   who  have.already  made   commitments   on\r\n\r\nhousing.  We have to have something more concrete to help\r\n\r\nthem.   As  the Government announces changes to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem, some union leaders have also asked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can also make it easier for  those  who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  economic  situation  to  downgrade  to\r\n\r\nsmaller  HDB flats.  The lower income workers  will  need\r\n\r\nmore help in such a difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the business community should do more,\r\n\r\nand  we  think they can contribute to and supplement  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  efforts to help the  needy.   For  example,\r\n\r\nNTUC FairPrice has given $1 million worth of vouchers  to\r\n\r\nthe Advisors of all the CCCs and grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nto reach out to their residents and help the needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the public transport operators gave a 5%\r\n\r\nrebate  to the commuters.  This time round, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  public  transport  operators  to  consider\r\n\r\nsharing the savings from the CPF cut with families  which\r\n\r\nare  facing  difficulties, especially those with  school-going  children,  in  the form of  vouchers  or  rebates,\r\n\r\neither  through  the unions or grassroots  organisations,\r\n\r\nfor  them  to purchase their monthly tickets.   Such  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings should not go to the shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving ahead, union leaders can play a part by\r\n\r\nadvocating our workers to face the challenges,  adapt  to\r\n\r\nchanges, and to opt for simplicity and affordability. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can further help by sending a  strong  signal\r\n\r\nthat  it  cares.   Our workforce is  the  world's  No.  1\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Thus,  I am very confident  that,  together,\r\n\r\nSingapore and Singaporeans will make this transition  and\r\n\r\nget through this difficult period to a better life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, this debate on the retuning of CPF is obviously very\r\n\r\nimportant as the policy statement itself is presented  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has said that\r\n\r\nwe are now at the crossroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I think the House should thank the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister for his decision to take personal responsibility\r\n\r\nto  carry  this  burden  of presenting  the  painful  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges to the people, and to see through its passage  on\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic of CPF changes is an emotional issue\r\n\r\nbecause they impinge on the livelihood of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe  pain  is  therefore felt at the  personal  level  by\r\n\r\nalmost every person and his family members, because every\r\n\r\nwage earner is affected.  However, at the national level,\r\n\r\nwe  unanimously agree that it is a crucial policy  change\r\n\r\nthat   has  a  deep  and  long-lasting  impact   on   the\r\n\r\nsurvivability  of  the  country, in  the  face  of  fast-changing   competitive  pressures  from   huge   low-cost\r\n\r\ncountries like China and India.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state that I support the proposed\r\n\r\nchanges,  as  they are much needed to ensure  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Fundamentally, what  are  these  CPF  changes\r\n\r\nabout?   They are about remaining competitive,  they  are\r\n\r\nabout  survival  and, ultimately,  it  is  about  jobs  - keeping our jobs.  Yes, it is painful to cut CPF,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink it would be more painful if we have to cut jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listening to the Prime Minister, I am\r\n\r\nvery  relieved.  As widely anticipated by the  press  and\r\n\r\nmany  corporations,  it was thought that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  implement a hefty 6% CPF cut.  The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  announced that there is a target of reaching the  6%\r\n\r\neventually.   But  according to the  table  that  he  has\r\n\r\ncirculated, there will only be a 3% cut in October  2003.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be a great relief to the people, as  a  6%  cut\r\n\r\nwould  have a tremendous shocking effect on the need  for\r\n\r\npeople to adjust their housing mortgages and livelihood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the next question. As the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said  that  the target  is  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution to 10%, the question  to  ask\r\n\r\nis:  when  will be the next 3% cut, because there  is  in\r\n\r\nthis Table 3 a mention of only one cut to 13%?  I do hope\r\n\r\nthat we would be able to survive the economic downturn to\r\n\r\nmaintain the status that there would be no further  cuts,\r\n\r\nif possible, that would affect the employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to pose, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat  looking  at Table 3, for those aged between  50-55,\r\n\r\nthere are actually proposed three cuts:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 3% in October 2003;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 3% in January 2005; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 3% in January 2006.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I note that those in the older age group\r\n\r\nare  probably worst affected.  For age 50-55 group,  they\r\n\r\nhave to endure three cuts over the next four years.   So,\r\n\r\nmaybe the Government would like to look into how to  help\r\n\r\nthis  group  of older workers.  What kind of reliefs  and\r\n\r\nassistance could be given to them to relieve them of such\r\n\r\nburdens?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Prime Minister, there will be a\r\n\r\nsaving   of   $1.3   billion,  ie,  savings   earned   by\r\n\r\ncorporations, employers and the public sector.  These are\r\n\r\nhuge  savings  of $1.3 billion a year.  In contrast  with\r\n\r\nprevious years, where the cuts are possibly one-time with\r\n\r\na  possibility of restoration, these are cuts  forever  - they  stay with us.  Therefore, in fact, the savings  are\r\n\r\nnot  just  $1.3  billion a year.  If we  take  a  10-year\r\n\r\ntimeframe and we multiply the $1.3 billion by 10,  it  is\r\n\r\n$13  billion savings for corporations and companies  over\r\n\r\nthe   next  10  years.   So,  these  hefty  savings  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely have a very stimulating effect on the economy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  almost like an off-Budget measure, much like  the\r\n\r\nstimulation  measures that were introduced  in  the  past\r\n\r\nwhen the domestic economy was in recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, I think not all companies are\r\n\r\ndoing  badly.  In fact, some companies, such as those  in\r\n\r\nthe  IT,  electronics, banking and several other sectors,\r\n\r\nhave been performing well.  Speaking for workers in these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  I  would  like  to  urge  employers  of  such\r\n\r\ncompanies that have done well to share their savings,  by\r\n\r\ngiving back either in the form of variable pay or as year-end bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF cut has the effect of taking\r\n\r\nabout $1.3 billion per year away from the pockets of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   This  is  not  a  puny  sum.   Naturally,  many\r\n\r\naffected  will  feel the pain.  I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  besides putting the burden of economic recovery  on\r\n\r\nthe people, the load should be shared amongst the people,\r\n\r\nthe Government and companies.  What I mean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis that, for the Government, there will be a need to look\r\n\r\nat  the  Government rates and fees so  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlowering  of  cost of doing business for companies.   For\r\n\r\ncompanies themselves, they would also have to look at how\r\n\r\nto  keep  themselves lean and trim.  So, they would  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  minimise  their  excesses  and  not  call  upon\r\n\r\nemployees to share the burden of their inefficiencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this debate, I would like to focus a bit\r\n\r\nmore  on  the impact of the CPF changes on older workers.\r\n\r\nI  would like to speak for those in the age group of  50-55,  because  I am myself in this age group,  ie,  in  my\r\n\r\nearly  50s.  I can feel for them.  I empathise with them.\r\n\r\nMany  of my friends and associates are in this age  band.\r\n\r\nBut  this  does  not  mean  that  I  do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of other age groups, such  as  the  younger\r\n\r\nworkers, are not impacted or are of lesser concern to me.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do  feel that those in the 50-55 age  group  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  a  lot in the last few years and, therefore,  a\r\n\r\nCPF  cut on them would make it worse.  In fact, as I said\r\n\r\nearlier,  they are going to suffer three cuts,  not  just\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate a bit further on these people in\r\n\r\nthe  50-55 age group.  They have suffered a lot in recent\r\n\r\nyears.    Some   have   lost  their   jobs   because   of\r\n\r\nretrenchments  or companies closing down.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they have to have heavier property mortgages,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the cost of their children's  education  as\r\n\r\nthey  grow  older.  Some of them even have to sell  their\r\n\r\nhouses  or their assets to support their children through\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Now, their employers' CPF contribution  will\r\n\r\nbe cut, especially when they go beyond 50 years old.  So,\r\n\r\nthese  CPF  cuts  are  eroding their savings,  and  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a need for us to look into how to  help  this\r\n\r\nparticular group of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, while the 3% cut would have a\r\n\r\nsaving of $1.3 billion for corporations, I would like  to\r\n\r\ncaution  about the dampening effect of this $1.3  billion\r\n\r\nbeing taken away from the pockets of the people.  It is a\r\n\r\nbit  of  a  plus  and minuses.  So, if we could  help  in\r\n\r\nintroducing some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkind of stimulating measures, such that at least the $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion  dampener  effect on consumer spending  could  be\r\n\r\nlessened,  it  would be helpful.  Perhaps, some  kind  of\r\n\r\nGovernment spending or pump-priming of projects would  be\r\n\r\nof help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to the 3% cut, for those workers who are\r\n\r\naffected  and  cannot manage their housing  mortgages,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to propose that workers be allowed  to  draw\r\n\r\nfrom  the  CPF  Special Account to top up their  mortgage\r\n\r\npayments,  if  they  have  insufficient  money  in  their\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account.  This is one measure  which  can  help\r\n\r\nthem to overcome their difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that I support the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that we should have clarity on our  longer-term\r\n\r\nCPF  rates.  The rate has been stated as between 10%  and\r\n\r\n16%  for  the  employers, and 20% for the  employees.   I\r\n\r\nconcur  that  the lower rate of 10% for the employers  is\r\n\r\nappropriate.  It will also give us more flexibility  that\r\n\r\nin  good  years  we can urge the employers and  introduce\r\n\r\nhigher  rates for employers, so that employees themselves\r\n\r\ncan benefit in good years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to express my keen\r\n\r\nsupport for these CPF changes.  I earnestly appeal to the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to look into some of the suggestions  that\r\n\r\nI have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said that Singapore is\r\n\r\nnow  at  the crossroads and is making important decisions\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to CPF.  He also says that the CPF  changes\r\n\r\nmade  are  the  most drastic to the CPF system.   In  the\r\n\r\nlight  of these comments, this topic that we are debating\r\n\r\non is of course very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I commend that, in future, if we do have such\r\n\r\nimportant debates, Members of Parliament, especially  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, have a look into the changes, so that we  can\r\n\r\nbe more prepared to debate them,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  not  be given at the last minute this table  and  we\r\n\r\nhardly know what it is all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1954, the PAP, when it was in the\r\n\r\nOpposition, stated in its Party Manifesto, that it  shall\r\n\r\nresist  any attempt to pass on to the workers by  way  of\r\n\r\nwage  cuts  the  burden of any economic  recession.   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour in the 1980s told this House that the\r\n\r\nCPF  was  sacrosanct.  They were the wages of the workers\r\n\r\nand that the CPF rate could not be cut.  He said that the\r\n\r\ncutting  of  CPF  rate  was  tantamount  to  cutting  the\r\n\r\nworkers' salary.  At that time, the CPF rate was  50%  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  salary.  Many, including  myself  at  that\r\n\r\npoint  of time, thought that the CPF rate of 50% was  too\r\n\r\nhigh.   I asked for the CPF rate to be lowered, with  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  take-home pay of  the  worker  might  be\r\n\r\nhigher.  I was roundly told off for recommending the  CPF\r\n\r\nrate to be cut.  It can be seen that the ruling party has\r\n\r\nsaid  many things about preserving the CPF rate, but they\r\n\r\nhave not been consistent with what they have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problems in Singapore today are, one, high\r\n\r\nunemployment  and,  two, high cost of doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Government proposes to take the easy  way\r\n\r\nout  by  slashing the CPF rate.   The question  is:   can\r\n\r\nthis  help? Wage cut is only one component of  the  total\r\n\r\ncost  structure.  The Government should look at the other\r\n\r\nfactors  which  keep  costs in Singapore  up.   They  are\r\n\r\nmostly  due to Government policies.  High wage  cost,  in\r\n\r\nthe  first place, was due to Government policy.   It  was\r\n\r\nthought in the early days that the Government should only\r\n\r\nattract higher value industries, but they did not come in\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  expected.   The  costs  in  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nremained high since then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up business in Singapore is also high.\r\n\r\nRentals,  land  cost,  transport and  utilities  are  all\r\n\r\nhigher than our neighbouring countries like China,  India\r\n\r\nor Vietnam.  However we cut the CPF rate, we still cannot\r\n\r\nmake our wages lower than the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this step of cutting the CPF rate can cause\r\n\r\ngrave hardship to our workers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not be implemented at one go.  It should be  made\r\n\r\ngradually.    The  Government should not again  make  our\r\n\r\nworkers bear the full brunt of reviving the economy.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  seriously  look  at  other  areas  of\r\n\r\nreducing costs, such as lowering of rentals, keeping land\r\n\r\nprices  affordable and keeping transportation, utilities,\r\n\r\nadministrative,  legal  services  and  other  operational\r\n\r\ncosts down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last elections in November 2001, there was\r\n\r\na   slew   of  price  increases  in  rentals,  transport,\r\n\r\nutilities, health and other operational costs.   None  of\r\n\r\nthose  price  increases have been trimmed  down  at  all,\r\n\r\nmaking   the   cost  of  doing  business   in   Singapore\r\n\r\nprohibitively  high.   It is high  time  that  Government\r\n\r\nrelooked  at those cost increases and trimmed  them  down\r\n\r\nwhenever it can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST is another high cost factor. The GST, as\r\n\r\noriginally  proposed, was supposed to be revenue  neutral\r\n\r\nand  not painful at all for the people to accept it.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  now no longer revenue neutral.  It has  become  a\r\n\r\nlucrative source of income for the Government, especially\r\n\r\nnow  that  we  hear  the Government  is  going  ahead  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the GST by a further 1% next year.  I  am  just\r\n\r\nwondering why the Government needs to build mountains  of\r\n\r\nsurpluses every year.   The surpluses are supposed to  be\r\n\r\nnational  savings for rainy days, but we are  now  seeing\r\n\r\nblack  clouds and showers thundering down on us.   Still,\r\n\r\nthe  Government wants to accumulate wealth,  all  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  our  workers.   Singapore's  surpluses   are\r\n\r\npurportedly estimated at about US$150 billion.   If  that\r\n\r\nis  truly the case and Singapore is such a small country,\r\n\r\nit has the world's second largest surpluses - second only\r\n\r\nto  Japan  -  which has about US$200 billion.   It  would\r\n\r\nappear that the Government's exercise of accumulation  of\r\n\r\nwealth is for its own purpose, and not for the purpose of\r\n\r\nhelping the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that even the interests accrued from the net\r\n\r\ninvestment income are untouchable.  SIA, DBS and  SingTel\r\n\r\nall  say that they shall benefit from the CPF cut.  Their\r\n\r\nsavings range from $18-$45 million.  It would appear then\r\n\r\nthat the biggest beneficiary of the CPF cut shall be the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment,  since it is the biggest owner of Government-linked companies in Singapore.  The Government must share\r\n\r\nits gains with the workers of Singapore.  I hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies will pay good  bonuses  this\r\n\r\nyear to the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CPF cut, originally touted at 6%, shall not solve\r\n\r\nour  cost  problem.  Someone wrote in the Today newspaper\r\n\r\nthat  a  6 percentage point cut in CPF would only  reduce\r\n\r\nour wage rate by 2%.  We still cannot compete with China,\r\n\r\nIndia or Vietnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now heard that the Government is not\r\n\r\nimplementing the 6% but only cutting it by 3%, from 36 to\r\n\r\n33 percentage points, and also on a staggered basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minimum Sum scheme, I see that the\r\n\r\ncash  component of $40,000 would eventually be  increased\r\n\r\nto  $120,000  by  2013.  My feedback  in  this  difficult\r\n\r\neconomic  climate is that, in fact, many CPF members  are\r\n\r\nclamouring to have their cash component paid out to them.\r\n\r\nThey said that they should be allowed to use their money,\r\n\r\nespecially  for legitimate purposes, such  as  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren's education, to pay their debts or even to start\r\n\r\na  business.   I hope something along this  line  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Political Economic Risk Consultancy\r\n\r\nLimited's  (PERC)  report,  I think  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  not be unduly disturbed by it when it  says  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's wage cost is higher than those of America and\r\n\r\nAustralia.  That report is not very accurate in  that  it\r\n\r\ntakes   into   account  the  higher  paid  workers,   ie,\r\n\r\nexecutives   and  white-collar  managerial   workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Those  people  are  paid  higher  than   the\r\n\r\nequivalent in America and Australia.  But the  pay  of  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  worker or a tradesman in America  and  Australia\r\n\r\nis,  on average, much higher than those in Singapore  by,\r\n\r\nat  least, I would estimate, 30%.  Those of us  who  have\r\n\r\nvisited  America and Australia know that the  workers  in\r\n\r\nthose  countries  are  definitely  paid  more  than   the\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers.   It is true that the cost of doing business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is high, but certainly not due to the  alleged\r\n\r\nhigh cost of wages of our factory workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for this opportunity to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PM spoke about more changes to the CPF at this\r\n\r\nyear's National Day Rally, there has been much discussion\r\n\r\nand  speculation on the ground as to the details. I  have\r\n\r\nmet  with  various groups of union leaders from different\r\n\r\nindustries, and listened to their feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the fear of job loss is topmost on workers'\r\n\r\nminds,  as  the economy continues to be weak.  Many  have\r\n\r\nbeen   retrenched,  or  know  of  people  who  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched.  Many have seen business being lost to lower-cost  competitors. They know that if the  situation  does\r\n\r\nnot  turn  around soon, more jobs will be at  risk.   And\r\n\r\nthey  themselves could be next in line to be axed. Hence,\r\n\r\nworkers  really hope that the Government would find  ways\r\n\r\nto boost prospects soon, and relieve their anxieties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union leaders understand the big picture. We know\r\n\r\nthat  unless jobs are saved, there will be no income  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and without an income, high CPF  rates  are\r\n\r\npurely academic.  So the priority is to save jobs, and to\r\n\r\nfoster  an  attractive environment to  create  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nLowering  business costs is an important part of  serving\r\n\r\nthis  purpose  and we accept that lowering the  CPF  will\r\n\r\nform part of such a package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, no worker likes a pay cut, no matter how\r\n\r\nnecessary  or  helpful  it may be because  it  just  goes\r\n\r\nagainst the grain to part with one's money this way,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have their practical concerns and worries.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould like to reflect these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said that they may run into immediate problems\r\n\r\nwith  their housing mortgage payments, and they  want  to\r\n\r\nknow  how they can get help.  Others wonder if they  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to save enough for their retirement years  after\r\n\r\nthese cuts and caps.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYet  others  wonder how they are going to cope  with  the\r\n\r\ncost of living, because Singapore is a city, and being  a\r\n\r\nsmall  city-state, there is really no way to go into  the\r\n\r\ncountryside  for a lower cost of living.  Therefore,  for\r\n\r\nlower-income people, I think they will find it harder  to\r\n\r\ncope, and they keep hearing that companies must make good\r\n\r\nprofits for their shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also workers who fed back that payroll is\r\n\r\nnot  the  only  cost  to  business,  but  they  have  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  payroll  is often  targeted  for  cost-cutting.   And they want to know what has the  Government\r\n\r\ndone about other fees and charges under its control,  and\r\n\r\nwhat more it is going to do to reduce its cost burden  on\r\n\r\nthe economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers feel that as the environment becomes more\r\n\r\nuncertain  and  volatile, people have  to  find  ways  of\r\n\r\nupgrading  and downgrading more flexibly alongside  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  fortunes.  So they ask that our policies,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in housing and medical services change faster to\r\n\r\naccommodate   this  reality.  There  may  be   a   larger\r\n\r\nproportion of people who need rental housing, instead  of\r\n\r\nbought  housing.  I think earlier, this  House  has  gone\r\n\r\ninto  quite a bit of questions and answers on that point.\r\n\r\nSome  others also feel that it would be good to  make  it\r\n\r\neasier   for  people,  whose  fortunes  have  waned,   to\r\n\r\ndowngrade  to a lower class ward more easily  within  our\r\n\r\nhospital system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those impacted by the across-the-board CPF rate\r\n\r\ncut,  the  lowering of the contribution ceiling  and  the\r\n\r\nconsequential  increase  in  taxable  income,  and   that\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  the  upper-middle and higher  income  group,\r\n\r\ntheir   feedback  has  been  that  they  hope  for   some\r\n\r\nconsideration to minimise the impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But overall, workers want to know if their\r\n\r\nswallowing  this  bitter pill will really  help  to  spur\r\n\r\neconomic recovery and improve job security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just as companies and shareholders expect a\r\n\r\ngood  return  on their invested funds, Singapore  workers\r\n\r\nare  also  looking  at  these  CPF  cuts  as  a  kind  of\r\n\r\ninvestment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  their collective security and prospects.  They do not\r\n\r\nwant  this opportunity created by the CPF savings  to  be\r\n\r\nsquandered  by companies merely enjoying a pause  in  the\r\n\r\npressure. They want to know, or at least have as  good  a\r\n\r\nsense as possible what the likely yields are going to be,\r\n\r\nand  how  these  yields are going to be achieved  by  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.   They  have expectations  of  the  employers.\r\n\r\nWorkers  want to know what are employers going to  do  to\r\n\r\nget  more  business because clearly, companies cannot  be\r\n\r\nprofitable  in  the  long run just  by  cutting  workers'\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they want to know what employers are going\r\n\r\nto do to restructure costs. Restructuring is not the same\r\n\r\nas merely cutting.  It means finding new ways to organise\r\n\r\ncost  drivers so that they are more responsive to changes\r\n\r\nin  competitive  landscape and market demand  conditions.\r\n\r\nIn  this,  they  want to see more leadership  and  useful\r\n\r\nideas coming out from the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have also asked if employers are alert to\r\n\r\nnew   opportunities.    Because  being   alert   to   new\r\n\r\nopportunities and being able to seize these opportunities\r\n\r\nis  a  critical  quality for success.  For instance,  how\r\n\r\nmany employers have plans to make use of the US-Singapore\r\n\r\nFTA  and  other FTAs that Singapore had signed to improve\r\n\r\ntheir  business?  According to a report  in  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  on  4th  July, a certain chamber  of  commerce  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  did  a  survey among its membership.   And  of\r\n\r\nthose  companies who responded, 71% said that they  could\r\n\r\nsee  no  gains  flowing from the US-Singapore  FTA.   The\r\n\r\nbusiness  community's response to the  latest  Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement is not\r\n\r\nany more reassuring.  A veteran businessman was quoted in\r\n\r\na  Channel  NewsAsia report dated 26th August as  saying,\r\n\r\n\"This is a weakness in our system.  Businessmen leave  it\r\n\r\nto  the  Government to decide everything. They should  be\r\n\r\npushing  for  what they want.  Some of them do  not  even\r\n\r\nknow what they want.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am saying this not because of any other\r\n\r\npurpose  than  to  say that this CPF  cut  gives  us  the\r\n\r\nsavings so that we could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprove  our  competitiveness, so that  our  economy  can\r\n\r\nrebound.  Workers hope for this to happen.  But in  order\r\n\r\nfor this to happen, employers must play their part and go\r\n\r\nand  get  that  business.   Otherwise,  it  is  a  wasted\r\n\r\nopportunity  and  it is a high price that  workers  would\r\n\r\nhave  paid  in  vain.  And we must not let such  a  thing\r\n\r\nhappen to sink our hopes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a no-holds-barred global and regional\r\n\r\nfight.   We  have  to  remove  our  gloves  because   our\r\n\r\ncompetitors are coming at us with bare knuckles,  if  not\r\n\r\nknuckle-dusters.  If we lose, we will have to accept much\r\n\r\nlower  conditions of living.  We therefore have no choice\r\n\r\nbut  fight.  So, I support these CPF changes, even  as  I\r\n\r\nfeel the pain together with all workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the NTUC, we will support\r\n\r\nconstructive  efforts to improve the  competitiveness  of\r\n\r\ncompanies because we want to save jobs and to attract the\r\n\r\ncreation of new and better jobs for Singaporeans.  And we\r\n\r\nwill  do so on the basis of fair play for workers.  Here,\r\n\r\nI  want  to  thank the Prime Minister for supporting  the\r\n\r\nstand  taken  by NTUC in asking that companies  that  are\r\n\r\ndoing  well be fair to their workers and share the  gains\r\n\r\nwith their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC cooperatives will continue to play their social\r\n\r\nrole and help hold down the cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Central Singapore CDC, besides\r\n\r\nthe  usual  assistance schemes, I  will  also  set  aside\r\n\r\nadditional  funding  to reinforce  the  accounts  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Resilience Fund at constituency level  so  that\r\n\r\nour MPs on the ground can offer help more responsively as\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of all, I urge immediate and clear action\r\n\r\nfrom  employers.  Do not waste the opportunity and become\r\n\r\ncomplacent just because the CPF savings have bought  some\r\n\r\ntime  and  offered some reprieve.  Show our workers  that\r\n\r\nyou   have   concrete  plans,  and  are  taking   active,\r\n\r\nsystematic and resolute action to improve the odds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in these days of intense competition,\r\n\r\nemployers  have  to  watch their  monthly  and  quarterly\r\n\r\nbottom lines like a hawk.  But I want to remind employers\r\n\r\nthat  the best companies that triumph in the end are  the\r\n\r\nones  who  not only know how to make big money,  but  who\r\n\r\nalso  know  how to treat their people right while  making\r\n\r\nbig money.

We may not have gone through\r\n\r\nthe  severe economic shock of the Asian financial crisis.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have weathered perpetual storms in the  form  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  11, global terrorism, SARS and the  gulf  war.\r\n\r\nThe  recent bombing in Jakarta, one year after  the  Bali\r\n\r\ntragedy,  underscores the fragile and uncertain world  in\r\n\r\nwhich we live.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic front, we face keener competition\r\n\r\nfrom  the  global marketplace.  Singaporeans,  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears, have had to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nface  wage  freeze, salary cuts and, most  unfortunately,\r\n\r\nrising  structural unemployment.  The picture  is  indeed\r\n\r\nnot a rosy one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there has been a pick-up in sentiment in the US\r\n\r\nand  Japan  economies, and the economic numbers following\r\n\r\nthe  slowdown  in  the second quarter of  this  year  are\r\n\r\nstarting to look up.  However, we must not be complacent.\r\n\r\nWithout clear and decisive actions to combat the costs of\r\n\r\ndoing  business in Singapore, or sending the right signal\r\n\r\nto  the international business community, we run the risk\r\n\r\nthat  any nascent economic recovery may pass us  by  this\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I feel that the proposed CPF\r\n\r\nchanges,  whilst they may appear untimely and harsh,  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I agree with many Singaporeans that  the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges  alone  will  not solve our  high  business  cost\r\n\r\nproblems and make Singapore competitive again.  Wage cost\r\n\r\nis   but  only  one  cost  component.   Our  other   cost\r\n\r\ncomponents, like land costs, rental, utilities, taxes and\r\n\r\nGovernment  rates  and  fees,  are  also  important.    A\r\n\r\nsimultaneous effort to review all these costs and  reduce\r\n\r\nthem  is  indeed necessary if we are to be successful  in\r\n\r\nmaking Singapore competitive again.  I therefore urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider measures  beyond  CPF  cuts  and\r\n\r\nimplement  these reductions if we are to  send  a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM mentioned that in the course of this debate, DPM\r\n\r\nLee  will announce a package of measures to alleviate the\r\n\r\nadverse  impact that the proposed CPF cuts  may  have  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    I   hope  these   measures   will   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans rework their cashflow on their mortgages and\r\n\r\nyet  leave  them  with  sufficient disposable  income  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a reasonable standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the CPF changes announced by the PM, I am\r\n\r\nglad  that  we stay focused on the retirement aspects  of\r\n\r\nCPF  in a way that there are enough retirement funds  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as  well  as help reduce  overall  cost  to\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support an immediate reduction of the employer's\r\n\r\nCPF contribution by 3% to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsend  the  right signal to companies and workers  on  the\r\n\r\nurgency  of wage reforms.

While  the  workers'  fixed   salary's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate will now be capped  at  30%  with  the\r\n\r\nproposed  changes, I propose that we consider allowing  a\r\n\r\nhigher  CPF  contribution rate for  the  variable  bonus.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we should encourage companies that are doing well\r\n\r\nand could afford to pay performance bonus to pay a higher\r\n\r\nCPF rate for their employees if they so choose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, together with a more flexible CPF rate, I urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to introduce tax incentives to  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  implement  a  wider  range   of   private\r\n\r\n\"retirement\"  plan  options for their  valued  employees.\r\n\r\nThrough  this  arrangement, the CPF can stay  focused  on\r\n\r\nproviding basic retirement needs, while employers  should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to develop individualised programmes  for\r\n\r\ntheir employees based on individual needs and abilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to CPF cuts, the proposal has the\r\n\r\neffect of reducing disposable income of Singaporeans.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that measures to reduce costs,  to\r\n\r\nfree  up  cash and improve cash flow for Singaporeans  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.   By  this, I refer  to  the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  review some of its rates  and  fees  that\r\n\r\naffect  household expenditures.  One specific area  would\r\n\r\nbe  the maid's levy.  A reduction in the maid's levy  may\r\n\r\nnot  fully  offset the cash depletion impact of  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts, but will serve to offset the inelastic costs due to\r\n\r\neconomic  needs imposed on families.  And in  this  case,\r\n\r\nthe  services of a maid.  I am, therefore, proposing that\r\n\r\nperhaps the Government could consider at least a $100 cut\r\n\r\nin  maid's  levy  to  make up for the reduction  in  cash\r\n\r\nfollowing  the CPF reduction.  This cut could be  limited\r\n\r\nto  one maid per household.  This would certainly go some\r\n\r\nway towards the cash top-up for mortgages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the maid's levy, I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto also consider other measures to assist Singaporeans in\r\n\r\ncash top-up following the CPF cuts.  I propose\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat the Government review its various rates and fees and\r\n\r\ntaxes  including utilities costs, property taxes,  petrol\r\n\r\ntaxes  and road taxes.  With the upfront cost of  vehicle\r\n\r\nownership  already  loaded in the COE  system  now,  such\r\n\r\nreduction  in petrol and road taxes would again  free  up\r\n\r\ncash for Singaporeans, who require vehicles as a means of\r\n\r\nfacilitating  business.   For Singaporeans  who  rely  on\r\n\r\npublic   transport,   transport   companies   should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged to pass on such savings to the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that many of the Government rates\r\n\r\nand   fees   were  imposed  to  achieve  various   social\r\n\r\nobjectives.   While  we  may  have  been  successful   in\r\n\r\nachieving   these  objectives,  they  have  inadvertently\r\n\r\nresulted  in higher costs of business and in higher  cost\r\n\r\nof  living in Singapore.  And as PM has mentioned in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  earlier, we need to strike a fine balance between\r\n\r\nthe  objective of economic survival versus social  needs.\r\n\r\nI  therefore suggest that it is perhaps timely  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment reviewed some of its social policies that  may\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in  higher  cost  of  doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the changes relating\r\n\r\nto   raising  the  threshold  of  the  Minimum  Sum   and\r\n\r\ntightening the rules concerning CPF withdrawal at the age\r\n\r\nof 55.  I appreciate the Government's effort to phase out\r\n\r\nthe  changes so that it minimises the impact it will have\r\n\r\non Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I support the need for Minimum Sum, I\r\n\r\nalways  question the need for lumpy adjustments to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum Sum from time to time.  Indeed, the  concept\r\n\r\nof  the  Minimum  Sum  may be a useful  one  in  that  it\r\n\r\nattempts to set a benchmark for what an individual  needs\r\n\r\nupon  retirement.   However, that magic  number  is  also\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  pin  down, as different  individuals  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  choices  and needs.  The revisions  to  adjust\r\n\r\nfor,  say, longer lives of Singaporeans from time to time\r\n\r\nmay be disruptive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the PM, I know of many Singaporeans planning to\r\n\r\nuse their CPF money\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupon  reaching the age of 55.  Some are planning to start\r\n\r\na  business,  some planning to use CPF  funds  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  tertiary education, some planning  to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir  money  in  various  investment  instruments,  some\r\n\r\nplanning  to go on a long holiday with their  family,  as\r\n\r\nthe PM has said, some planning to go on a pilgrimage, and\r\n\r\nso  on.   The impact of this change on the CPF withdrawal\r\n\r\nplans  on  individuals may thus be more  widespread  than\r\n\r\nenvisaged.   I  am however glad that the  Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  phase out the implementation of  the  higher\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum and tightening rules concerning CPF withdrawl\r\n\r\nat the age of 55.  Indeed, I feel that the 10-year phase-in  period  is reasonable.  But I feel that the  proposed\r\n\r\ngradual  adjustment of the CPF Minimum Sum of $4,000  per\r\n\r\nyear  appears  high  in the initial years,  because  this\r\n\r\nworks  out to an inflation rate of 5% per year, which  is\r\n\r\nvery   high,  given  the  record  of  our  inflation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer an automatic adjustment mechanism be\r\n\r\nbuilt  into  the  CPF system whereby the Minimum  Sum  is\r\n\r\nautomatically  adjusted  based  on  future   annual   CPI\r\n\r\nchanges.  This will avoid lumpy adjustments from time  to\r\n\r\ntime  as  has  happened in the past, and  will  certainly\r\n\r\nfacilitate planning by Singaporeans on the use  of  their\r\n\r\nCPF funds upon retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\neven  with these CPF changes and assuming other  business\r\n\r\ncost  components,  like land costs, utilities  rates  and\r\n\r\nfees  are being lowered, we must continue to expect lower\r\n\r\nend  company operations to continue to migrate  to  other\r\n\r\nlow  cost  countries like India and China.  We can  never\r\n\r\ncompete in those areas.  If we do, we will forever remain\r\n\r\na  third  world  country, as the PM has said.    What  is\r\n\r\nimportant is for our Government to continue to provide  a\r\n\r\nfavourable   environment  to  continuously  attract   new\r\n\r\ninvestments,   create   employment   opportunities,   and\r\n\r\ncontinue with our skills upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes and urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider  my  various  suggestions  on  a\r\n\r\nflexible  CPF rate and on measures to free  up  cash  and\r\n\r\nimprove cash flow for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I will never know whether the white wine\r\n\r\nwill allow me to live up to 100.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But I hope maybe Mr Chiam will be able  to\r\n\r\nuse  some  of the palliatives rather than to keep  asking\r\n\r\nthe same questions about our reserves.  Because I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  those  kinds of  reserves  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  our currency and our assets would  have  been\r\n\r\nhalved by now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I could not believe my ears when\r\n\r\nlast  night, a grassroots leader told me that he heard  a\r\n\r\nfriend using an old caricature in the 60s to express  his\r\n\r\nanxiety   about  CPF  changes  and  the  gloomy  economic\r\n\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caricature was about a lightning striking and\r\n\r\ncracking up a rice bowl.  I think some of you of  my  age\r\n\r\nwill remember that caricature.  I do not know who did the\r\n\r\ncaricature,  but  I  guess it  was  done  by  the  ruling\r\n\r\nAlliance Party then, which wanted to frighten voters from\r\n\r\nsupporting  the opposition PAP then.  Well, we  know  the\r\n\r\nstory.  PAP went on to win handsomely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this person must have exaggerated the\r\n\r\nposition but, nevertheless, to highlight his anxiety  and\r\n\r\nworries  about  the  proposed CPF cut  and  uncertainties\r\n\r\nregarding  employment and the economy.  After  all,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans now realise that the days of the  iron  rice\r\n\r\nbowl,  even in Government service, are over.  So, as  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister said just now, he knows the  feeling  and\r\n\r\nthus the compromises made in fixing the CPF cut from what\r\n\r\npeople expected to be 36% is now 33%.  Singapore workers,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure,  will feel very relieved.   I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the private sector will react the same way.   And\r\n\r\nI am sure they will say, \"Cut not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenough.\"   But, I am sure, for most workers,  \"Money  not\r\n\r\nenough\" is more supreme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, judging from the feedback and views expressed\r\n\r\nduring the dialogue sessions Malay MPs held for activists\r\n\r\nand  community leaders, the fears and concerns are  real.\r\n\r\nEven  though the recent announcement by the PM may  be  a\r\n\r\nrelief,  I  am sure many are still asking, \"What's  next?\r\n\r\nAnd  when  is the next cut?\"   Many are simply frightened\r\n\r\nby  what is to come.  One even described the dreams of  a\r\n\r\nSwiss standard of living Singaporeans were chasing for as\r\n\r\na nightmare now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, that was an exaggeration too, as I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Singaporeans have shown the steel they are  made\r\n\r\nof and the best is yet to be.  But no matter how much one\r\n\r\nhypes the mood or the challenges, it takes much more than\r\n\r\npromises  to  satisfy Singaporeans.   Many  Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nconfidence regrettably has been shaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am sure all is not lost. Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  track  record of overcoming  problems,  the\r\n\r\n1985  recession  for  one,  must  be  the  saving  grace.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was a problem by itself, as Singaporeans have\r\n\r\ngone  round to expect the Government to turn the  economy\r\n\r\nas  fast as it did a decade ago, the situation, as we all\r\n\r\nknow,  is  not  as  simple  as  before.   The  effect  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  has  cut  deeper  now.   China  and  India\r\n\r\nthreaten  to blunt further Singapore's competitive  edge.\r\n\r\nCyclical  changes and unemployment have gone  structural,\r\n\r\ndumping  thousands  of our workers as irrelevant,  unless\r\n\r\nthey retrain and upgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if we can convince and assuage Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers to accept that this is the new order of the  day,\r\n\r\nand change their mindsets, at peace with the need to make\r\n\r\nshort-term  sacrifices  for  the  long-term  gains,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel they need help, at least for the  short\r\n\r\nterm.   They fear the CPF cut will affect further   their\r\n\r\ncapacity to pay for their dream homes, and I do not  mean\r\n\r\njust the landed properties and condominiums but, in fact,\r\n\r\nthe  modest  `under one HDB roof'.  Many also fear  about\r\n\r\nwhat they see as escalating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealth  and  transport  costs, meaning  cost  of  living.\r\n\r\nHere, Acting Minister Khaw Boon Wan's strategy to look at\r\n\r\nthe  eight priorities, including cutting costs and making\r\n\r\nthe   medical  care  system  more  efficient   and   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitive, I am confident, will be well received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how convinced the Government is about\r\n\r\nthe  need for the CPF retuning, the Government should not\r\n\r\nrush  into  the  fast  lane of changes,  as  the  PM  has\r\n\r\nannounced  today, to avoid unexpected ramifications  that\r\n\r\nwill  upset  the apple cart.  Investors,  I  think,  have\r\n\r\nalways  had  tremendous  respect for  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  its hard-nosed and hard-headed  approach\r\n\r\nwhen  faced  with difficult decisions.   Send  the  right\r\n\r\nsignals  we must, but phase in the changes so as  not  to\r\n\r\nmake  the effects too razor-like and in the process bleed\r\n\r\nmany  people unexpectedly and the consequences  difficult\r\n\r\nto cope with.  On this note, the phased changes announced\r\n\r\nby the PM will be welcomed by many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the effect of the proposed changes in the mind of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  marginal or tolerable,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed to be told so and in clear terms.  Take some time to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the ground through more dialogues and information\r\n\r\nsessions.  I learned that the PM will also be having  his\r\n\r\nown  dialogue sessions with the ground.  I think that  is\r\n\r\nan excellent idea and I trust more people will understand\r\n\r\nfurther and appreciate those critical needs for change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think only the lower 10-15% of the population\r\n\r\nwill  face  the brunt of these challenges.  I have  heard\r\n\r\nsome  of  the concerns of the middle income squeeze  too.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  many of them feel that they are the  ones  who\r\n\r\nwill suffer most, and without much help from the existing\r\n\r\nprogrammes mostly catered for the needy, which the middle\r\n\r\nincome would not qualify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the proposed changes in\r\n\r\nthe CPF but would like to urge the Government and all its\r\n\r\nimplementing agencies to watch the follow-through\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevelopments closely and to give feedback that would help\r\n\r\nfine-tune the system further, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that the Government has said repeatedly\r\n\r\nthat  most, if not all, of the cost-cutting measures have\r\n\r\nbeen taken, including reducing other cost factors such as\r\n\r\nland  price, taxes and other measures, to help  alleviate\r\n\r\nthe interim pains felt by many, but the Government should\r\n\r\ngo  through  with a thin comb the cost of Government  and\r\n\r\ntrim  whatever else necessary.  MOH's recent announcement\r\n\r\nto  do  so  is  a good example.  This will reassure  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  Government is  not  too  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nhappy  elsewhere but indeed ready to work  hand  in  hand\r\n\r\nwith the people to overcome these challenges together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, first, allow me to thank the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand his Cabinet colleagues for having a lower CPF cut  by\r\n\r\njust  3%,  and  not  all  the way  to  6%,  and  bringing\r\n\r\nprogressive  changes  to  other  components  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to accept the fact that under the\r\n\r\ncurrent   economic  uncertainty  and  the   increase   in\r\n\r\nunemployment,  any  measure taken by  the  Government  in\r\n\r\norder to save jobs and maintain our competitiveness  and,\r\n\r\nin  this  instance,  to cut wage costs  through  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncomponent,  is done out of necessity.  The  workforce  is\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the volatile situation in the job market.\r\n\r\nWe  understand and fully comprehend how crucial it is  to\r\n\r\nact   now  and,  therefore,  I  sincerely  endorse  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday night we had a discussion and a dialogue\r\n\r\nwith  our  group of union leaders.  We had a  very  frank\r\n\r\ndiscussion  for  two  hours.  At  the  end  of  the  day,\r\n\r\neveryone  realised  how  bad the  situation  was  on  the\r\n\r\nground,  and  they  realised that changes  needed  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought  immediately, and they supported unanimously  the\r\n\r\nchanges.    But  they  also  highlighted  a   number   of\r\n\r\nviewpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express some of my viewpoints and their\r\n\r\nconcerns too:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It must be accepted that any cut in CPF would\r\n\r\ncause pain and hardship to workers.  Workers are required\r\n\r\nto  make  sacrifices to save jobs and  to  help  increase\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Workers understand these  reasons  and\r\n\r\nsupport  the steps taken.  But workers' sacrifice  should\r\n\r\nnot  go  to  waste  or  just to increase  the  employer's\r\n\r\nprofitability.  Workers wish to see a drastic drop in the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  workers  retrenched.   To  this   end,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies and large MNCs  must  set  an\r\n\r\nexample  in  not  resorting to  retrenchment  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government must go public on the full\r\n\r\npackage of cost-cutting measures and introduce additional\r\n\r\nmeasures, if necessary, that it needs to put in place  in\r\n\r\norder  to  maintain  our competitive edge  and  not  just\r\n\r\nhighlight  on  wage  cut, CPF cut and retrenchment  only.\r\n\r\nThe  ground must be given a full picture, only  then  can\r\n\r\nthey be convinced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Employers, on the other hand, must not take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the situation.  They must acknowledge  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice made by the workers during these hard times  by\r\n\r\ncompensating them equitably during good times.  Employers\r\n\r\nwho  are  currently profitable and accumulate  additional\r\n\r\ngains because of the CPF cut, should give back to workers\r\n\r\npart of the additional gains in the form of special bonus\r\n\r\nor  other methods.  Profitable MNCs and Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies should publicly support this call, rather  than\r\n\r\ngiving  lame  excuses.  In this context,  I  support  and\r\n\r\nfully  appreciate  the  Prime Minister's  call  for  such\r\n\r\ncompanies to come forward to reward such workers in these\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government must give a clear signal to MNCs\r\n\r\nthat they are really operating in our island state and to\r\n\r\npotential  investors that it is prepared to look  at  all\r\n\r\npossibilities  to  help  the  companies  maintain   their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and that they have a stake in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very reassuring to hear that\r\n\r\nthe  Government expressly states that no Singaporean will\r\n\r\nlose his or her home or be denied of medical care because\r\n\r\nof  the cut in CPF contributions, and that the banks have\r\n\r\nalso stated that they will be flexible if it affects  the\r\n\r\nservicing  of  the  housing loans.  The  Government  must\r\n\r\nintroduce  long-term  help to those with  mortgage  loans\r\n\r\nrather than deferring the payments.  Any deferment  would\r\n\r\ncost  additional  expenditure in the  form  of  interest.\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  consider the  reduction  of  interest\r\n\r\nrates  to  mortgage loans of HDB, and  I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the  capacity of the Government.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  always  shown  a lot of concern  for  our  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come back to the announcement made by the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  earlier  on  on  contributions   rates,\r\n\r\nespecially  for workers aged 50 to 55.  In fact,  at  the\r\n\r\nNational Day Rally, the Prime Minister had again  made  a\r\n\r\ncall for employers to employ older workers.  But I do not\r\n\r\nlike  to  use the term \"older workers\" because  sometimes\r\n\r\nthat puts off a lot of employers also.  And I also belong\r\n\r\nto  that  age  group.   So I would rather  use  the  term\r\n\r\n\"workers aged 50 to 55 and beyond\".   The problem here is\r\n\r\nnot  just  cutting CPF.  Because if you can cut  CPF  and\r\n\r\nbring  results, we will support it.  If you want to bring\r\n\r\nit  lower,  that  is  a  three-step  reduction  for  such\r\n\r\nworkers.  And if it brings the desired results,  we  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  go all the way.  It is better to have  a  job\r\n\r\nthan not to have a job, and a lower CPF does not matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem here is because a lot of employers\r\n\r\nhave  a  cheaper  alternative, that is, foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nThey give all kinds of excuses in employing them.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  excuses  is  that they say the workers  are  choosy.\r\n\r\nThat  is  not true for every worker.  We should not  just\r\n\r\nacross-the-board label all Singaporeans as being  choosy.\r\n\r\nThere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  many workers who are desperately in need of  a  job,\r\n\r\nand  I  have  come across many in my work as a  unionist.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  really pains me because there are  a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  requesting and pleading for jobs,  and  they  are\r\n\r\neven  prepared  to  work  for $800  to  $900.   But  many\r\n\r\nemployers  just give all kinds of excuses, and they  just\r\n\r\ngive  them  a very political answer, \"We will  definitely\r\n\r\ncall  you  back.\"  The answer is actually  they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing to call them back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think Government needs to do something drastic\r\n\r\nrather  than just make statements.  I really support  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's call.  I know he feels for such workers.\r\n\r\nBut  feeling  alone is not enough, he must do  more  than\r\n\r\nfeeling. So we hope that he would do more than that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum,\r\n\r\nI have a quick look at it.  By year 2013, a lot of lower-income workers will not be able to draw any sum when they\r\n\r\nreach  55 - it looks like that - unless there is a  hefty\r\n\r\nwage  increase.  For such workers, they depend a  lot  on\r\n\r\nage  55  to withdraw for their essential needs, and  they\r\n\r\nactually  postpone these essential needs  until  55.   So\r\n\r\nmaybe  the  Government should look at how it  could  help\r\n\r\nthem.   I am not suggesting help for those who are  going\r\n\r\nto  Batam or squandering their money with another family.\r\n\r\nI  am talking about those who really need the help.  So I\r\n\r\nthink  they have to take a look, and maybe the Government\r\n\r\ncan give projection figures - in 2013, how much will such\r\n\r\nworkers  be able to draw out.  That will give  them  some\r\n\r\nlevel  of  comfort.  So just figures alone would  not  be\r\n\r\nenough.    I  hope the Government will come up with  more\r\n\r\ninformation in these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore workers have stood by the Government\r\n\r\nthrough  a  number  of  crises, and  that  has  been  our\r\n\r\ngreatest advantage in attracting investments and  keeping\r\n\r\ninvestments in Singapore.  And we will continue to do so.\r\n\r\nThere   is   no  reason  that  the  workers  will   react\r\n\r\ndifferently.  We have the ground feel and we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknow that the workers will rally behind us.  But, at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, the workers would also like the Government  to\r\n\r\ndo  whatever it can to ease their pain.  It must look  at\r\n\r\nthe  current  costs of essential goods  -  medical  cost,\r\n\r\npublic transport, and the cost of education - and see how\r\n\r\nbest  it  could  be  adjusted to  defray  the  day-to-day\r\n\r\nexpenses of the workers in taking care of themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir   families.   To  what  extent  is  the  Government\r\n\r\nprepared  to absorb such costs?  This is what the  public\r\n\r\nexpects the Government to seriously think about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, this is a very painful\r\n\r\nadjustment and Singaporeans will definitely rally  behind\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Government must equally give  all\r\n\r\nthe  support.   The employers must not be  providing  lip\r\n\r\nservice  but really clear-cut support to workers who  are\r\n\r\nemployed under their hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  make two general comments relating to the CPF changes\r\n\r\nand discuss two specific implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as a supply-side measure - the CPF changes\r\n\r\nare  blunt but effective.  The PERC survey and other  job\r\n\r\ndata  comparisons, regardless of how one  would  like  to\r\n\r\ninterpret or qualify the results, with anecdotes, such as\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Chiam has done, point to the reality that we have\r\n\r\nindeed   priced  ourselves  out  of  the  global  market.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this reality, there are really no  two  ways\r\n\r\nabout  it  in  that we do not have the  luxury  of  time.\r\n\r\nThese  changes  would have an immediate  impact  on  wage\r\n\r\ncosts  unlike tax cuts, which are contingent on corporate\r\n\r\nprofitability.  Yet, we must be fully conscious that this\r\n\r\nmove  to  retune  the CPF scheme is no  panacea  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  challenge;  it  merely  seeks  to  mitigate\r\n\r\nfurther  loss  of  both blue and white collar  jobs  from\r\n\r\nuncompetitive wage levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues have emphasised, we\r\n\r\nmust  also recognise that a holistic approach is  needed,\r\n\r\nnot  just  a restructuring of wages, which is inevitable,\r\n\r\nbut  a  concerted  effort  to  lower  all  components  of\r\n\r\nbusiness costs, including\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment levies and charges and real estate  costs,  to\r\n\r\ncomplement  the  CPF changes and the tax cuts  that  have\r\n\r\nalready  gone before them.  Specifically, the  Government\r\n\r\nneeds  to address the rigid, seniority-based wage  system\r\n\r\nfor  the public sector, beyond these CPF changes,  since,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  the  public sector competes  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  for manpower during tighter employment situations\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, expenditure on manpower is a  significant\r\n\r\ncomponent  and  affords  room for  cost  cutting  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, dipping into reserves. Sir, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have asked why does the Government  not  dip\r\n\r\ninto  the  reserves  -  does the  present  situation  not\r\n\r\nconstitute a rainy day?  The Government needs to  explain\r\n\r\nmore.   Having  said that, unlike Mr Chiam,  I  recognise\r\n\r\nthat   the   current  unemployment  challenge   is   more\r\n\r\nstructural  than  cyclical.  Hence,  changes  are  needed\r\n\r\nrather than a dip into the reserves to help ride out  the\r\n\r\ndownturn.   However, it is still necessary  to  have  the\r\n\r\npackage  of measures to help cushion the otherwise  harsh\r\n\r\nimpact, especially for mortgage servicing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have accepted the need for\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts  not because they are not going to be adversely\r\n\r\naffected but because they see the wisdom of taking short-term  pain  for a long-term benefit, which is  ultimately\r\n\r\nthe survival of Singapore.  But they are also asking,  if\r\n\r\nthese changes are not sufficient and do not help to lower\r\n\r\nthe  unemployment  rate,  what is  next?   Another  three\r\n\r\npercentage  point reduction to 30%, and then  what  else?\r\n\r\nWhat  other  levers can we pull?  Sir,  it  is  important\r\n\r\ntherefore  to rally Singaporeans behind every effort  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  to continue to  instill  confidence\r\n\r\nthrough a clarity of purpose for each and every move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, talk about two of the more significant\r\n\r\nimplications of these changes for Singaporeans.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of negative equity for property assets  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, financial sufficiency for old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative equity and structural erosion of\r\n\r\naffordability.  Sir, unfortunately, many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   have   based  their  property   investment\r\n\r\ndecisions  on assumptions which were drawn up during  the\r\n\r\nheady growth phase of the 1990s, where we had a steady 5%\r\n\r\nto  10%  wage increase every year, continuous  employment\r\n\r\nand  frequently more than one income stream.  We now know\r\n\r\nthat   for  any  of  these  assumptions  to  fail,   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may no longer be able to hold  on  to  their\r\n\r\nproperty.   Wages  have  not only not  risen,  many  have\r\n\r\nactually  been  cut  - and these lower  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrates  would  aggravate  the  situation.   Besides,  with\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  contract work being  increasingly  the\r\n\r\nnorm,  Singaporeans now have to factor in periods  of  no\r\n\r\nincome in between contracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures that the Government would be announcing\r\n\r\nwould  hopefully help many, even if they  have  currently\r\n\r\nnegative  equity on their property, that  is,  where  the\r\n\r\nloans  they have taken out far exceed the current  market\r\n\r\nprice,  if  they were to sell the property on the  market\r\n\r\nnow.   However, the larger issue is whether  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreal threat that we would end up with negative equity for\r\n\r\nproperty, like Hong Kong or Japan.  If so, these are  not\r\n\r\njust  problems for the affected Singaporeans,  they  also\r\n\r\nspell challenges for our banks as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about those who have made the wrong\r\n\r\nassumptions  and  who  have  found  their  purchasing  or\r\n\r\nservicing  ability  so impaired that they  simply  cannot\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  ownership?  For those who  have  borrowed\r\n\r\nfrom  banks, I guess this is an issue that banks have  to\r\n\r\naddress.   I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will  address\r\n\r\nthe  situation for those who have, for example, purchased\r\n\r\nbigger  HDB flats from the resale market at the peak  and\r\n\r\nwho  have simply no means of servicing these loans  right\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the implication on financial sufficiency\r\n\r\nfor  old age.  Sir, before these changes, we were already\r\n\r\nconcerned with there being financial insufficiency  post-retirement,  especially  in the  context  of  our  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  against  a  longer  life  expectancy.   These\r\n\r\nchanges would simply mean even less CPF contributions  on\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noverall  basis,  be  it in the Ordinary  or  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount    balances,   unless   income    levels    climb\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  But we know that that is unlikely because\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness will always check any steep rise  in  our\r\n\r\nincome level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the radical changes to the CPF scheme,\r\n\r\nwe  have,  if I may suggest, one more sacred  cow  to  be\r\n\r\nslaughtered, that is, the management of the CPF balances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has shied away from managing CPF\r\n\r\nbalances, preferring to allow individual Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ndecide  their own risk levels and allocation  strategies,\r\n\r\ndown  to  picking  their own stocks.  Thankfully,  we  no\r\n\r\nlonger allow investment gains to be withdrawn.  But there\r\n\r\nare  still  some  gaps and I would like to  elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, by guaranteeing a minimum interest rate on\r\n\r\nboth   Ordinary   and  Special  Account   balances,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  already managing CPF monies  by  default.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  there  is  sufficient  anecdotal  evidence  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  a  balanced portfolio, including  all  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  asset classes, would generate, on  average,  a\r\n\r\nhigher  return in the longer term.  Sir, we need to  grow\r\n\r\nthe  nest egg, not through higher contributions  in  good\r\n\r\ntimes,  or  distributions of New  Singapore  Shares,  but\r\n\r\nthrough  the  compounding effect  of  a  higher  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a diversification across different\r\n\r\nmarkets would reduce the incidence of double jeopardy  in\r\n\r\nthe   event  of  a  slowdown  in  Singapore.   Currently,\r\n\r\nindividual  Singaporeans do not have  the  motivation  to\r\n\r\nattempt  any  diversification as they  have  a  risk-free\r\n\r\nalternative  and they simply have no scale.  And  neither\r\n\r\ndo  fund managers have the scale to mount such aggregated\r\n\r\nproducts as they have no assurance that CPF members would\r\n\r\nwant to take the risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am proposing once again that Government\r\n\r\nseriously  consider, firstly, managing CPF on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nmembers,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenlisting the help of fund managers where necessary, and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  over time, to have the minimum  interest  rate\r\n\r\nmore  reflective of prevailing market trends.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot   proactively   ensure  that  CPF   balances   return\r\n\r\nattractively,  lower  contribution  rates  would   almost\r\n\r\ncertainly aggravate our ageing challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, I am optimistic that the changes\r\n\r\nwill   send   the   right  signals,   boost   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and investors' confidence in our  resolve\r\n\r\nto  tackle  economic challenges.  Already, analysts  have\r\n\r\napplauded  the  move  and  are expecting  on  average  an\r\n\r\nencouraging 1%-3% point boost in margins, to as high as a\r\n\r\n10%   jump   in   profits   for  the   manpower-intensive\r\n\r\nindustries.  The move will also better position Singapore\r\n\r\nfor the economic recovery, signs of which, though patchy,\r\n\r\nare nonetheless encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the overall intent of\r\n\r\nthe CPF revisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the scenario painted by our Prime Minister\r\n\r\na  moment ago at the introduction of his speech  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  also the report in yesterday's Straits  Times\r\n\r\nwhere  DPM Tony Tan registered his alarm about  the  PERC\r\n\r\nreport citing Singapore's labour costs being ahead of the\r\n\r\nUnited States and Australia are clear indications that we\r\n\r\nreally  have  a wage cost burden that needs  to  be  very\r\n\r\nquickly  addressed.  Not taking immediate action will  be\r\n\r\nirresponsible on our part as it would mean that more jobs\r\n\r\nwould  eventually  be  lost as our  cost  competitiveness\r\n\r\nfurther erodes.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.26 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore of the view that a number of drastic\r\n\r\nmeasures  need  to  be taken quickly to  bring  down  our\r\n\r\noverall  business costs, including wage costs, to  remove\r\n\r\nrigidity so that the market can more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflexibly   find  its  equilibrium.   This  understandably\r\n\r\nincludes  retuning our CPF contribution rates  along  the\r\n\r\nlines  which the Prime Minister has outlined.   Based  on\r\n\r\nseveral  dialogue  sessions which  I  attended  and  also\r\n\r\nconducted,  I  believe this message has sunken  in  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and they understand that we must act quickly\r\n\r\nto prevent more job losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, Singaporeans have been nervously and\r\n\r\nkeenly awaiting for the final prescriptions of what  they\r\n\r\nare expected to swallow, the extent of bitterness and how\r\n\r\nthis is going to impact on their livelihood.  It pains me\r\n\r\nto  think about citizens who have gone through thick  and\r\n\r\nthin  with us all these years, perhaps more of  the  thin\r\n\r\nside  of things these last few years who will be impacted\r\n\r\nby the CPF changes.  As we act for the collective good of\r\n\r\nSingapore and all of us, it is imperative that we provide\r\n\r\nlifelines  and help for those who are particularly  going\r\n\r\nto be affected by what the Government finally decides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are many MPs who are speaking on this\r\n\r\nsubject,  allow  me  to just focus  on  two  points  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the imminent changes to the CPF  model.   My\r\n\r\nfirst concern is the ability of Singaporeans to meet  the\r\n\r\nobligations of housing loans as a result of the  changes.\r\n\r\nThe  measures proposed are a necessary requirement in our\r\n\r\nquest for competitiveness internationally.  However,  the\r\n\r\ntrade-off on a social scale would be quite onerous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government must balance its move with one that\r\n\r\nwill   help  reduce  the  hardship  our  residents  might\r\n\r\npotentially face. As mentioned by the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  earlier in this House today, a large number  of\r\n\r\nour  active workforce, 577,000, or approximately  45%  of\r\n\r\nthem,   service   their   housing   loans   through   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   From  this, there  will  be  a  sizeable\r\n\r\nnumber  that will find it difficult to meet their monthly\r\n\r\nobligations  although  the 3%  imminent  cut  is  not  as\r\n\r\ndrastic as anticipated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest, Sir, that a tax relief be\r\n\r\nconsidered for home owners on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest  paid on mortgages on homes used  as  a  primary\r\n\r\nresidence.   This will supplement the burden on  existing\r\n\r\nhome owners affected by the CPF changes while encouraging\r\n\r\npotential buyers to also not distance themselves from the\r\n\r\nmarket.   A  tax  relief would not  only  encourage  home\r\n\r\nownership  but  also  help spur growth  in  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  Tax relief of such nature is not new and  exists\r\n\r\nin countries, such as the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the CPF changes, our society should\r\n\r\ngradually  move  from dependence on a managed  retirement\r\n\r\nplan  that  was started in the late 50s to  one  that  is\r\n\r\ntailored  individually.  Perhaps, there is a lesson  from\r\n\r\nour  early  years of self-government and nationhood  when\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  rate was a mere 10% as we struggled to  find  a\r\n\r\nbalance between savings and competitiveness.  Times  have\r\n\r\nchanged,  but  our  commitment to  our  citizens  remains\r\n\r\nsteadfast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping them overcome the double blow of lower\r\n\r\nCPF  rates  and  higher Minimum Sums,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npropose  the  consideration to include  monies  saved  in\r\n\r\nindividual retirement schemes as part of the overall pool\r\n\r\nof savings to meet the requirements of retirement and old\r\n\r\nage.  Doing so could perhaps justify a review of the need\r\n\r\nto  progressively raise the Minimum Sum from the  current\r\n\r\n$80,000 to $120,000 by 1st July 2013.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a part\r\n\r\nof our Government's multi-pronged strategy to address the\r\n\r\nfinancial  needs  of  a  growing  population,  which  was\r\n\r\nhighlighted   in  the  report  of  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on the Ageing Population released in  November\r\n\r\n1999.  As it stands, the SRS complements the CPF.  As  we\r\n\r\nknow,  the  CPF savings are meant to provide for  housing\r\n\r\nand  medical  needs  and  for basic  living  needs  after\r\n\r\nretirement.     Unlike   the   CPF    scheme,    however,\r\n\r\nparticipation in the SRS is voluntary.  Participants  can\r\n\r\ncontribute a varying amount to the SRS, subject to a  cap\r\n\r\nat  their own discretion.  The contributions may be  used\r\n\r\nto  purchase various investment instruments, and it  also\r\n\r\noffers  attractive tax benefits as it defers tax  payment\r\n\r\nupon retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are retirement plans that\r\n\r\nare offered by insurance companies, banks and independent\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers  that work  on  the  same  principle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  awareness of  the  SRS  is  low.   As  of\r\n\r\nDecember  2002, there were less than 17,000  SRS  account\r\n\r\nholders.  Our citizens have depended excessively  on  the\r\n\r\nCPF  to finance their retirement needs and have not  seen\r\n\r\nthe  incentive for alternative planning.  We can do  more\r\n\r\nto  encourage  this and other schemes  to  highlight  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  along  with the risks of independent  financial\r\n\r\nplanning.  With the change in our CPF model in  the  push\r\n\r\nto  encourage  greater  self-reliance,  I  suggest  going\r\n\r\nfurther  to fine-tune the SRS as well, to enable  greater\r\n\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Government's\r\n\r\nproposal to retune the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, Singaporeans intuitively understand that their wages\r\n\r\nare  high  in  comparison  with the  countries  that  are\r\n\r\ncompeting  with  us  for  the  same  investment  dollars.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  a rational lot.  They  travel  to  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring ASEAN countries, China and India.  They know\r\n\r\nthat, like water seeking the lowest point, investments go\r\n\r\nto  the  location yielding the best returns.   They  know\r\n\r\nthat we have a high standard of living not simply because\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  by nature somehow better  or  cleverer\r\n\r\nthan  others.   We  managed  because  we  have  a  better\r\n\r\nGovernment in Singapore.  The Prime Minister had  earlier\r\n\r\nmentioned  about India and China, and why these countries\r\n\r\nwere  not competing in the world a decade ago.  Now  that\r\n\r\nthese countries have adopted identical strategies that we\r\n\r\nhad  pursued  successfully in the past,  the  competitive\r\n\r\nscene  has  changed completely.  So, Singaporeans  accept\r\n\r\nthat,  one  way  or  another, the  cost  base  for  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore must be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reflected in the findings of the Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit.   70% of a group of respondents, representative  of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  population,  supported   the   idea   of\r\n\r\nrestructuring the wage system for Singapore to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremain competitive.  71% supported the idea of setting  a\r\n\r\nrange  of CPF rates to allow for flexible adjustments  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  changing economic conditions.   61%  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the  CPF system should be changed to help Singapore\r\n\r\nremain  competitive.  64% agreed to the retuning  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore CPF system to save jobs.  Only 56% agreed  that\r\n\r\nin  order to keep business costs low, CPF should be  cut.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, Singaporeans are in support of retuning\r\n\r\nthe CPF to remain competitive and to save jobs.  However,\r\n\r\nto  keep business costs low, most believe that more  than\r\n\r\njust a cut in wages is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to go beyond a CPF cut has been raised by\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  spoken ahead of  me.   They  have  also\r\n\r\ntouched   upon   how   to  deal  with  the   difficulties\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will face in their housing mortgages  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of these cuts.  I am confident that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  have considered all these and would have  counter-measures in place to deal with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would focus instead on the question of what\r\n\r\nwe are trying to achieve in this cost-reduction exercise.\r\n\r\nAre  we,  firstly, attempting to stem  the  tide  of  job\r\n\r\nlosses?   Or are we trying to turn around the job  losses\r\n\r\nand  try to entice industries that have already left  for\r\n\r\ncheaper locations to come back to Singapore?  Or  are  we\r\n\r\ntrying  to  prepare ourselves to catch the  wave  of  the\r\n\r\nrecovery when it surely would eventually come?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the proposed reduction in the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution rate from 16%  to  13%,  an\r\n\r\neffective  reduction of only 2.6% of the payroll  burden,\r\n\r\nis,  by  itself,  unlikely to swing  things  one  way  or\r\n\r\nanother.  While this small reduction is a relief  to  all\r\n\r\nworkers  in Singapore, I must confess that I am  not  too\r\n\r\nclear what the Government is trying to achieve with  this\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint a scenario. Consider a gymnast on a\r\n\r\ntrampoline.   In order to reach a higher point,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe gymnast would press the spring harder, go down lower,\r\n\r\nso  that, on the rebound, he would reach higher.  So, let\r\n\r\nus assume that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs a system-wide reduction of at least  10%\r\n\r\nto  make  the world sit up and take notice.  Where  would\r\n\r\nthe   balance   come  from?   That  is  a  billion-dollar\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we have done something about land cost, which\r\n\r\nis  of  course,  as we all know, a major  cost  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore?   The  Government  has   already\r\n\r\nindicated  that if we were not careful in our attempt  to\r\n\r\nreduce  land cost, we could bring about asset  deflation.\r\n\r\nAs  we  know,  more  than 80% of Singaporeans  are  home-owners.   Asset  deflation would surely adversely  affect\r\n\r\nall  of  us.   Already, bankruptcies have hit an  18-year\r\n\r\nhigh,  as reported in the news media.  If asset deflation\r\n\r\nwere to happen, the evaporation of billions of dollars in\r\n\r\nthe  value of assets will surely put our economy  into  a\r\n\r\ntailspin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we profess that we could not readily\r\n\r\nreduce  high land cost, I thought it would be  useful  to\r\n\r\npoint  out that the Government's land sales in  the  past\r\n\r\nhave  actually accumulated some surpluses from  the  high\r\n\r\nvalue  of  land.  In fact, if we recall, Government  land\r\n\r\nsales  were timed to maximise revenues.  By our budgetary\r\n\r\nprocess, the proceeds from these land sales are below the\r\n\r\nline  when  the  Budget is presented to Parliament  every\r\n\r\nyear.  Therefore, it becomes part of our reserves.  After\r\n\r\nthe  dissolution  of every Parliament,  these  land  sale\r\n\r\nproceeds  could no longer be touched without  the  second\r\n\r\nkey.   However, the impact of these sales at a high value\r\n\r\nlingers  on, as leaseholds of these lands are either  30,\r\n\r\n60  or 99 years.  Thus, we pay in advance for the use  of\r\n\r\nland  and  we are now living with the aftermath  of  high\r\n\r\nland cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my view that the way we manage our\r\n\r\nsurplus   from   the  land  sales  puts  an   unnecessary\r\n\r\nconstraint on the way we manage the economy.  The life of\r\n\r\nevery  government  is  at most five years,  but  property\r\n\r\ncycles  are typically 10 years.  The economic cycles  are\r\n\r\nshorter at three to four years, but they are not in  sync\r\n\r\nwith  our  political cycles.  Thus, what we put  away  in\r\n\r\nboom  times, we cannot use in lean times.  Even if  there\r\n\r\nis a willingness today in the Government to explore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeans to help businesses to deal with high land cost, the\r\n\r\nGovernment might not have the means to do so,  as  it  is\r\n\r\nreported  in the press that we are encountering a  Budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  of close to $3 billion for the first six  months\r\n\r\nof this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government is known to loathe using the\r\n\r\nsecond  key, unless the situation is truly desperate.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the question: is it possible  that  we\r\n\r\nhave forsaken some policy options that could help in this\r\n\r\nrecession  because  of  this budgetary  constraint?   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  have  we  considered  capital  allowance   for\r\n\r\ncommercial  properties?  Capital allowance  is  now  only\r\n\r\ngranted to plants and machinery that generate income  for\r\n\r\na company.  Except for hotels, most commercial properties\r\n\r\ndo not qualify for capital allowance.  On the other hand,\r\n\r\nif  a  company uses a commercial property to operate  its\r\n\r\nbusiness, then it claims rental expense as a reduction in\r\n\r\nits tax computation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, recent corporate governance\r\n\r\nguidelines  also  require  diminution  of  the  value  of\r\n\r\ncommercial properties be provided in the profit and  loss\r\n\r\nstatement.  With the decline of the property market since\r\n\r\n1997,  this  has  been a drag on the performance  of  all\r\n\r\ncompanies owning commercial properties.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nif  we do not deal with the drag of high land cost on our\r\n\r\neconomy, we are like a boxer jumping into the boxing ring\r\n\r\nwith one arm tied behind our back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to add that I am not suggesting that\r\n\r\nwe  raid the reserves the moment we run into trouble.   I\r\n\r\nam  just pointing out that the unnecessary constraint  we\r\n\r\nput  ourselves  into by locking away the  reserves  every\r\n\r\nfour  or  five years while the other components affecting\r\n\r\nour  economy have longer life cycles.  During  the  times\r\n\r\nwhen our economy enjoyed 8-10% per annum growth, that was\r\n\r\nnot an issue.  But, today, I believe, it stares us in the\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has also touched upon the\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects  of  changing the CPF  scheme  affecting\r\n\r\nolder  workers.   At  this point  in  our  recession,  an\r\n\r\nimmediate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissue  of  addressing  how  we  can  help  the  long-term\r\n\r\nunemployed, ie, people who have been unemployed for  nine\r\n\r\nmonths or more and have very little prospect of finding a\r\n\r\njob in the immediate near term, we might have to face the\r\n\r\nfact  that  jobs would be hard to come by  for  a  while,\r\n\r\nespecially for these older workers, even though there are\r\n\r\nthose who do not like the words \"older workers\".  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  our assistance to these long-term unemployed  is\r\n\r\nthrough providing training opportunities and, if they  do\r\n\r\nshow  up at the MPS of PAP Members, we will provide  them\r\n\r\nthrough   some  cash  disbursements  using  our   welfare\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question many of these affected persons have\r\n\r\nbeen  asking is: why can they not draw on their CPF money\r\n\r\nto  make ends meet if they have already enough savings in\r\n\r\ntheir accounts to look after their old age?  Since we are\r\n\r\nchanging the CPF scheme - quite drastically I must say  - maybe we should consider this one change.  There is  this\r\n\r\nprovision of a Minimum Sum in the CPF scheme and which is\r\n\r\nbeing  adjusted  upwards year by  year.   For  those  few\r\n\r\nindividuals - I am not sure if there are many of  them  - but  for  those  few  who have amounts  larger  than  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum, maybe we should look at the possibility  of\r\n\r\nallowing  them  to withdraw the balance  from  their  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme  before  reaching the age of 55 years  old.   This\r\n\r\nwill  alleviate their pressing needs when they hit a long\r\n\r\nperiod of unemployment.\r\n\r\nTo  prevent  abuse, we could put a limit  to  the  amount\r\n\r\nwithdrawable  or  consider this  withdrawal  as  deferred\r\n\r\nincome  from  previous years and render them  liable  for\r\n\r\nincome tax.  If we are truly prepared to let Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntake  greater ownership of their own lives, as the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  urged in his National  Day  Rally  speech,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we should consider this one option.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is a withdrawal of their old-age savings if they\r\n\r\nhave met their Minimum Sum requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as the world recovery takes place and the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy returns\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  positive  growth,  together with  this  recovery,  we\r\n\r\nshould  take  the  challenge that we face  today  as  the\r\n\r\nharbinger  of  things yet to come.  The  world  has  been\r\n\r\nchanged  by  IT and the Internet. The historical  hurdles\r\n\r\npreventing  free flow of knowledge and services  such  as\r\n\r\ntime,   distance   and  geography  have   been   rendered\r\n\r\nirrelevant.  By allowing the individuals to tap into  the\r\n\r\nworld  market,  even  Government is becoming  less  of  a\r\n\r\nconsideration.   Witness the success  of  the  Indian  IT\r\n\r\nindustry  despite  the same old Indian  political  system\r\n\r\nthat  hampers  the other aspects of the  Indian  economy.\r\n\r\nSo,  in  the  case  of  Singapore, while  having  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment  allows us to enjoy a premium, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  quantum  of this premium is reducing and diminishing\r\n\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government remains important, but in exploring\r\n\r\nnew  frontiers,  the  individual is now  the  key  motive\r\n\r\nfactor.   I  am glad to note that the Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nhis  National  Day Rally speech, has indicated  that  his\r\n\r\nGovernment  is now prepared to change to a  new  mindset.\r\n\r\nHe said that only what is prohibited in the future is not\r\n\r\nallowed.  Everything else is fair game.  While the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not use the term \"No U Turn  Syndrome\"  or\r\n\r\nNUTS, in effect, this is what he was talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in my view, we must go beyond getting\r\n\r\nrid  of  NUTS.  We must become a fun city with creativity\r\n\r\nand  vibrancy.  Only then would the Singapore  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices command a premium in the world market.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Government must relax and allow our people  to  have\r\n\r\nmore   fun.   The  uncertain  response  of  the   various\r\n\r\nregulators on the issue of bar-top dancing indicates that\r\n\r\nthe  old  mindset dies hard.  I call this old mindset  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants, the \"NO VOWels After S (NOVOWAS)  on\r\n\r\nlicence plates syndrome\".  Let me elaborate.\r\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Members notice that as our car licence plate\r\n\r\nnumbers changed, running through the series of \"SDZ\", the\r\n\r\nnext  series  actually started with  the  letters  \"SFA\"?\r\n\r\nWhat  has  happened to the \"SEA\" series?  The  answer  is\r\n\r\nthat years ago, we changed from the SY series to the SBA\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseries,  skipping  the SAA series.  This  was  presumably\r\n\r\nbecause  someone  in  the  decision-making  position  had\r\n\r\ndecided  that there should be no vowel after \"S\"  on  our\r\n\r\nlicence  plates. The question is:  why?   No  reason  was\r\n\r\noffered  except perhaps the civil servant in  charge,  or\r\n\r\neven  the Minister in charge, looked into the future  and\r\n\r\ndecided  that  it  was  no good  to  have  \"SEX\"  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  licence  plates.   So to  avoid  the  fuss  of\r\n\r\nhaving  to deal with SEX, it was decided to do away  with\r\n\r\nall  the  vowels after S.  In so doing, the decision  has\r\n\r\ndeprived Singaporeans some opportunities to have fun with\r\n\r\nour  licence  plate numbers and it has also deprived  the\r\n\r\nLTA  some  opportunities to make some money from  selling\r\n\r\nsome  interesting  licence plates.   For  instance,  some\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners will be very willing to pay a high  price\r\n\r\nfor a licence plate such as SEX 999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while this is not a life and death issue, it\r\n\r\ndoes represent the mindset in the civil service and maybe\r\n\r\neven  ultimately, in the Cabinet itself.  Is it  possible\r\n\r\nthat  this  mindset in our decision-makers  has  deprived\r\n\r\nSingapore of innumerable opportunities to take our  place\r\n\r\nin  the  sun, because we do not want to deal with one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  possible  occurrences of unpleasant events?   If  we\r\n\r\ntruly  want  a  breakthrough into the next phase  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment, not only do we need to get rid of  NUTS,  we\r\n\r\nalso need to get rid of this \"NO VOWels After S (NOVOWAS)\r\n\r\nsyndrome\".   Let us start by putting back the  vowels  in\r\n\r\nour  licence plates and have SADs, SEXs and SOBs  on  our\r\n\r\nvehicles  running  around in our city roads.   When  that\r\n\r\nhappens, we could shake off the straitjacket that we have\r\n\r\nstrapped  on ourselves and truly liberate the  creativity\r\n\r\nand energy in our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this recession presents\r\n\r\ndaunting  challenges  to the Government.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, it is comforting that the same Feedback Unit survey\r\n\r\nindicates that eight out of 10 Singaporeans believe  that\r\n\r\nSingapore can overcome the current challenges.  67%  have\r\n\r\nfaith in the new team of leaders and 69% are upbeat about\r\n\r\nthe Singapore future.  Therefore, Sir, if this Government\r\n\r\ncould provide the leadership, our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  rally around and Singapore will come through  this\r\n\r\nvalley  of gloom.  The retuning of CPF is just the  first\r\n\r\nstep in this journey of recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for the opportunity of  allowing\r\n\r\nme to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I considered the CPF cuts, I asked myself:\r\n\r\nwould  I support it?  After some thought, the answer  was\r\n\r\nyes.   The reason is that doing nothing is not an option.\r\n\r\nIf  doing nothing is not an option, then the question is:\r\n\r\nhow do we move forward?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My position on the CPF cuts is that I support it,\r\n\r\nbut  wish to sound a cautionary note and to say that  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts are not the be-all and the end-all.  There are other\r\n\r\nthings  that have to be considered and I would  touch  on\r\n\r\nthat in a moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just coming back to the cautionary note, when we\r\n\r\nstarted off with the CPF scheme, its original purpose was\r\n\r\nfor  social  security  -  savings  for  retirement,  home\r\n\r\nownership,   medical  expenses  and,  to   some   extent,\r\n\r\neducation.  That was its original purpose and remained so\r\n\r\nfor  a long time until the mid-1980s when we had to  make\r\n\r\nthe  first  CPF  cut.   In  the  1980s,  because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of remaining competitive, we had to do a cut\r\n\r\nand,  more  recently, in the late 1990s, we had  done  it\r\n\r\nagain twice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the significance of the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nannouncement today actually marks a fundamental shift  in\r\n\r\nwhat we have done before.  By saying that CPF rates would\r\n\r\nbe  a range between 30-36%, we are formally endorsing the\r\n\r\nuse  of  cutting our CPF rates or using CPF  rates  as  a\r\n\r\nmacro-economic  tool.   It may  move  from  its  original\r\n\r\npurpose   of  purely  social  security  to  an   economic\r\n\r\ncalibrator.  The two purposes are very different and they\r\n\r\nserve different purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not oppose the usage in the new way simply\r\n\r\nbecause  circumstances have changed and  we  are  plugged\r\n\r\ninto  the global economy.  And because the global economy\r\n\r\nmoves so quickly and it is so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvolatile, we have to be able to react quickly.  But  what\r\n\r\nthese  changes mean is that, in good times,  the  savings\r\n\r\nfunction of CPF takes precedence because you put in more,\r\n\r\nbut  in  bad  times,  the macro-economic  function  takes\r\n\r\nprecedence because you try and retune the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These have certain consequences for the average\r\n\r\nSingaporean in the street because he is at the  receiving\r\n\r\nend  of this.  At the Government level, when we tune  the\r\n\r\neconomy using CPF, we can see from an economic level  why\r\n\r\nit is necessary.  But from the poor guy in the street, it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult for him to adjust  to  this  because,\r\n\r\ngoing  forward in the long-term, it is difficult for  him\r\n\r\nto  plan.  So the consequences would be the difficulty in\r\n\r\nlong-term   planning.   It  also  means   that   when   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  buys  a property, he should  never  use  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  amount allowable because he must always  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  buffer, as he cannot tell, going forward, whether\r\n\r\nor not this rate is going to go up or down.  That message\r\n\r\nneeds to go out to Singaporeans because for decades, they\r\n\r\nhave  planned on the basis of a reasonably certain  rate.\r\n\r\nBut  now,  going forward, he is not certain and  he  must\r\n\r\nallow himself a buffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next consequence of this is that, given that the\r\n\r\nrate  is  fluctuating and given that in 10-20 years,  the\r\n\r\namount that you have in CPF is subject to inflation,  the\r\n\r\n$30,000  today would not be worth $30,000  in  10  years'\r\n\r\ntime.   There is then an urgent need for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the importance of financial planning.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, they have depended on their CPF and looked to  that\r\n\r\nas  something that would take them through their old age.\r\n\r\nNow, this is no longer possible.  CPF would take care  of\r\n\r\nsome  part of it, but they certainly have to see how they\r\n\r\ncan   provide  for  themselves  in  terms  of   financial\r\n\r\nplanning.   We would think that this is an obvious  thing\r\n\r\nand  that Singaporeans understand that.  Let me tell  you\r\n\r\nthat   some   Singaporeans  understand   it,   but   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not see the importance, or understand the\r\n\r\nurgency  or  need  for  it.  All Singaporeans  are  equal\r\n\r\ncitizens. All\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have equal rights under the law, but not all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have equal understanding of the economy, the\r\n\r\nfinancial  consequences of what we do, or the  importance\r\n\r\nof financial planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important, therefore, for the Government\r\n\r\nto   get   this  message  out,  especially   to   younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  and make them aware of the  importance  of\r\n\r\nit.  I would go so far as to suggest that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation actually look to introducing this as a subject,\r\n\r\nbut not as an examinable subject, as students have enough\r\n\r\non   their   plate,  to  make  students  understand   the\r\n\r\nimportance of this, going forward, so that we educate  an\r\n\r\nentire  new  generation of Singaporeans on  the  need  to\r\n\r\nsupplement their CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now from the consequences of this to some\r\n\r\nof  the  feedback that I have received in respect of  the\r\n\r\nproposed CPF changes.  I spoke with my grassroots leaders\r\n\r\na  couple  of  days back in anticipation of this  debate.\r\n\r\nThe  first and most important piece of feedback that came\r\n\r\nin  was  that  it  is  really the  middle  income  group,\r\n\r\nespecially the lower-middle income group, that  would  be\r\n\r\naffected.   I  think  my  Parliamentary  colleagues  have\r\n\r\nalready  touched  on the points about housing  loans  and\r\n\r\nrepayment of mortgages. So it would not be necessary  for\r\n\r\nme  to  elaborate  on  that.  But I would  just  like  to\r\n\r\nhighlight that this is a strong feeling on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other strong feeling on the ground is the cost\r\n\r\nof living.  Singaporeans, as a whole, can accept the need\r\n\r\nfor  CPF  cuts.   As a general rule, when  faced  with  a\r\n\r\nproblem, Singaporeans will rally round together.  But  in\r\n\r\norder  for them to feel that they are really part of  the\r\n\r\nteam,  they also need to feel that if we are asking  them\r\n\r\nto  accept the pain of CPF cuts, why is it, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  the cost of living is not going down but, in fact,\r\n\r\nit seems to be going up?  A few days back, in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes and, I think, in Streats, it was reported that  the\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price Index has reported a jump.  One  of  them\r\n\r\nreported a 0.4% jump in prices and the other a 0.6%  jump\r\n\r\nin prices.  I am not sure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  indicators they were referring to, but it is clear\r\n\r\nthat there has been a jump in prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from the grassroots leaders is whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can  look  at the  costs  of  utilities,\r\n\r\ntransport and rentals to see whether these can be brought\r\n\r\ndown.   When  we  talk about the cost of doing  business,\r\n\r\nthere  is also an urgent need to see whether the cost  of\r\n\r\nrental of commercial properties can be brought down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, at the end of the day, if\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel that they are being asked  to  make  a\r\n\r\nsacrifice, they can appreciate that, but they would  also\r\n\r\nappreciate  it if something can be done to alleviate  the\r\n\r\npain.  In this connection, I would like to mention that I\r\n\r\napplaud  the  announcement  by  the  Acting  Minister  of\r\n\r\nHealth, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, about cost cutting measures for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health in order to reduce  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nproviding healthcare.  That was a very important  message\r\n\r\nto  send  to  Singaporeans that at least one Ministry  is\r\n\r\nlooking   at  reducing  costs.   What  about  the   other\r\n\r\nMinistries?   We have not heard anything from  them.   It\r\n\r\nmay well be that the other Ministries are looking at cost\r\n\r\ncutting.  If they are, Singaporeans need to hear it,  and\r\n\r\nif  they  are not, then they should hurry up  and  do  it\r\n\r\nstraightaway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need to have intelligent cost\r\n\r\ncutting  that would translate into savings  that  can  be\r\n\r\npassed on to the average Singaporean in the street.   Not\r\n\r\nall  cost  cutting is good.  If a Ministry  spends  on  a\r\n\r\nproject  which results in a contract being  awarded,  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  get the job, the contractors' employees  get\r\n\r\njobs  and  they get their salaries, income is  generated,\r\n\r\nthat  is fine.  That is why I say there is an urgent need\r\n\r\nto look into intelligent cost cutting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not just be the average man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nwho  pays  this price because it should be  a  collective\r\n\r\neffort.   Employers, obviously, need to play their  part.\r\n\r\nThey  should pass on the savings that they get  from  the\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts.   The banks and HDB should seriously  look  at\r\n\r\nwhat can be done\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  either convert payments to only interest payments  or\r\n\r\ndeferment  of  repayment of instalments  in  cases  where\r\n\r\nthere is difficulty in making repayment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, I would just stress that the CPF cut\r\n\r\nis  only one part of a much wider issue and a much  wider\r\n\r\ndebate.   The wider issue really is how to make Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  competitive,  how  to  generate  business,  how  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  jobs.  The CPF cut is not, by itself, going  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  magic  formula that immediately solves  all  our\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obviously many other things that we have\r\n\r\nto  do.   And  one of the things that I would suggest  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  be  a new policy introduced across-the-board\r\n\r\nfor  all  the  Ministries, which I call the common  sense\r\n\r\npolicy.  Basically, how it works is:  when in doubt,  use\r\n\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just take an example. I read in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  the  other day that there  was  this  company\r\n\r\ncalled  Wash  Wash  that had applied to  the  HDB  for  a\r\n\r\ncorporate licence to do car washing in a HDB multi-storey\r\n\r\ncar  park.  When they first broached the idea to the HDB,\r\n\r\nit  was reported that HDB rejected them giving, among the\r\n\r\nlist  of  reasons,  \"no  such licences  have  been  given\r\n\r\nbefore.\"   What kind of reason is that?  If we  use  that\r\n\r\nkind of reason, we will never be able to do anything new.\r\n\r\nAnd there was also, \"car washing is only permitted at the\r\n\r\ncar washing bay.\"  I really like this one, \"the detergent\r\n\r\nrun-off will weaken the concrete\".  It was only after the\r\n\r\nowners  of  Wash  Wash appealed to their  MP,  Dr  Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan, who is also the Minister of  State  of  MND\r\n\r\nand   the  Government  pro-enterprise  panel,  that  they\r\n\r\neventually succeeded in getting their licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this. It should not take all this\r\n\r\nconvulsion  of  effort in order to get  a  licence.   The\r\n\r\nbottom  line is:  every Ministry, every statutory  board,\r\n\r\nevery  Government agency should have a policy that if  an\r\n\r\nidea generates jobs, if an idea can generate business, if\r\n\r\nan  idea can do something to boost the economy, it should\r\n\r\nbe given serious consideration.  Do not make the poor guy\r\n\r\njump through so many hoops\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  hurdles before he eventually gets to it.    But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, we are happy to say that in that case, there  was\r\n\r\na  happy  ending.  And I read in the newspapers that  128\r\n\r\nlicences have been issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, CPF cut is only one part of\r\n\r\nit.   There  are many other things that we  have  to  do.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans need to feel that we are all part and parcel\r\n\r\nof  the  common  enterprise.  When we fought  the  battle\r\n\r\nagainst SARS, everybody had their part to play.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  average Singaporean in the street needs to feel that\r\n\r\nhe is not the only one bearing the brunt in the battle to\r\n\r\nrevive  the  economy.  The average Singaporean  needs  to\r\n\r\nfeel  that he is part of the team.  He will feel that  he\r\n\r\nis  part  of the team if we hear that the Ministries  are\r\n\r\ndoing  various  things, if we hear  that  Government  and\r\n\r\nother agencies are doing various things, if we also  know\r\n\r\nthat  employers are on board, if the banks are on  board,\r\n\r\nif  the  property owners are on board.  And if we can  do\r\n\r\nthis, there is no reason why we cannot pull ourselves out\r\n\r\nof our economic doldrums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\nLooking at the number of speakers, I would just deal with\r\n\r\ntwo or three points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, understandably, many employers I spoke to\r\n\r\nwelcomed  the  CPF  cuts, although I am  sure  they  were\r\n\r\nhoping  for a 6 percentage point reduction as opposed  to\r\n\r\n3.   But  to them, I have this message.  I urge employers\r\n\r\nto  utilise  the  forthcoming savings  in  a  responsible\r\n\r\nmanner.  To companies who are doing well, I urge them  to\r\n\r\nreturn  their  savings,  or at  least  a  part  of  their\r\n\r\nsavings,  to  their workers  -  this return made  in  the\r\n\r\nform   of   bonuses,  higher  budget  for  upgrading   or\r\n\r\nretraining or other schemes that suit the peculiar  needs\r\n\r\nof their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such savings, I also urge companies to\r\n\r\nrefrain from resorting to retrenchments.  I do appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  some  companies do have to downsize notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe CPF retuning.  But I do hope\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   retrenchment  is  done  only  where  it  is  truly\r\n\r\nunavoidable.   I  believe these  points  were  raised  by\r\n\r\nspeakers  before and, in fact, even by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think employers owe it to the country and to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  to  do  their part in  this  exercise.   If\r\n\r\nemployers do not act responsibly by utilising the savings\r\n\r\nin a responsible manner, they would undermine the efforts\r\n\r\nof  the Government and the sacrifice of the workers.   We\r\n\r\nneed to remind employers of this obligation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a report in a recent edition of the\r\n\r\nNTUC  News, union leaders call on employers to share  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of savings with their workers.  And I understand\r\n\r\nthat union leaders would continue to remind employers  of\r\n\r\nthis  call.   I  applaud  this  effort  and  I  ask   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to use its influence and good office to remind\r\n\r\nthe employers of their role in this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the workers, I have this message - the unions\r\n\r\nhear  you, your MPs hear you, your Government hears  you.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure the Government and all of us will do all we\r\n\r\ncan  to help where it is proper to do so.  But such  help\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that all the workers' problems  will  be\r\n\r\nsolved.   That  certainly is not  the  intention  and  it\r\n\r\nshould   not  be.   In  this  exercise,  no  one  escapes\r\n\r\ncompletely unscathed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of the CPF contribution by 3\r\n\r\npercentage points is not that devastating to most people.\r\n\r\nAnd  even as of now, various schemes are already in place\r\n\r\nto  assist Singaporeans who are in need, and I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  ensure that these schemes  continue.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  there  is the HOPE scheme, which  will  be  of\r\n\r\ngreat  help  to  poor small families to  get  out  of  an\r\n\r\notherwise intractable poverty situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also urge workers to maintain their\r\n\r\nproductivity  in spite of the CPF retuning.   If  workers\r\n\r\nrespond  otherwise, ie, they slacken  because  their  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  by  employers is reduced, then  it  renders\r\n\r\nthis exercise futile, as there would be no real advantage\r\n\r\nfor  employers or investors to come in.  All  workers   - and,  of  course,  this  includes those  working  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   -   have to moderate their expectations  and\r\n\r\nadjust their lifestyles.  Already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  are reconsidering our attitude towards work.  We  are\r\n\r\nreplacing the concept of life-long employment with  life-long  learning.   With  this CPF  retuning,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrethink our retirement plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF retuning is perhaps the most widely and\r\n\r\ndrastically  felt among a slew of reforms  undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the last couple of years.   The  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  strike  fear and worry among  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nuncertainty is quite disconcerting.  Speakers  before  me\r\n\r\nhave  elaborated on the kinds of uncertainty that workers\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people need to be reassured that although there\r\n\r\nare  many  things uncertain, that in spite of  the  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges,  many  things will remain the same.  Ironically,\r\n\r\nperhaps  many things need to be changed so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nensure the more fundamental things remain the same.   And\r\n\r\namong  the things that ought to remain the same and  have\r\n\r\nto remain the same and are intended to remain the same by\r\n\r\nthese steps are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That our system of governance and Government\r\n\r\nwill  remain, ie, we have a Government that listens, that\r\n\r\nhas foresight and that acts responsibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the future of our country and our economy\r\n\r\nremains  in  our hands, even though it is hot  at  times.\r\n\r\nThere is a Malay saying that goes:  gengam para api, biar\r\n\r\nsampai  jadi  arang.  It means that when we hold  burning\r\n\r\nember,  we  have to hold it until we snuff out the  fire,\r\n\r\nuntil  it returns back to charcoal.  If we let it go,  it\r\n\r\nwill  continue burning and become ash, which will not  be\r\n\r\nof much use to us anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Our country will remain a safe and peaceful\r\n\r\nplace for us to live in, even if we are going to be  less\r\n\r\ncash rich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our families will remain strong and that pro-family policies are firmly upheld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That we will continue to help those in need and\r\n\r\nthere will be policies remaining in place to ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean matters and every Singaporean is cared\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I am in support of the proposals\r\n\r\ntabled by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the retuning of our CPF\r\n\r\nsystem.  Although the medicine is bitter, it  has  to  be\r\n\r\nswallowed.   The proposed changes to the  CPF  may  bring\r\n\r\nfinancial pressure to our people.  But if we tighten  our\r\n\r\nbelts,  this  new  system will help us  to  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  save jobs, and  even  create  more  job\r\n\r\nopportunities.   Because  of  the  high  labour  cost  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, even higher than that in the United States and\r\n\r\nAustralia, we must make quick adjustment to adapt to  the\r\n\r\ninvestment changes in the international market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope that the Government will avoid\r\n\r\nmaking  too  many  changes to the CPF system  in  future.\r\n\r\nAlthough flexibility in the CPF system will enable us  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  investment trend more  nimbly,  frequent\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the CPF system will send unclear signals  to\r\n\r\nthe  business  community  and the  investors,  making  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for them to make long-term plans.  This  would\r\n\r\nalso  cause confusion to the investors, and give them  an\r\n\r\nunfavourable  impression of Singapore.  As  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, our CPF system has been subjected to many rounds of\r\n\r\nadjustments over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, salaries and remuneration should be\r\n\r\ndecided  between  the employers and  employees.  The  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  do not make any distinction  in  the\r\n\r\nindustries  and  companies.  The  performance   of   each\r\n\r\nindustry, company and employee is not uniform. If you cut\r\n\r\nthe  contribution rate of employers, it will amount to  a\r\n\r\npay cut to the employees.  This is unfair to the workers.\r\n\r\nNot  many  employers  will tell the  employees  who  have\r\n\r\nperformed  better  that,  \"This  time  round,  your   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate is reduced, let the  company  pay  you\r\n\r\ncash  every  month to compensate your losses.\"   Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  contribution  rate may  be,  the  employer  has\r\n\r\nalready provided for it in his budget.  Any change to the\r\n\r\ncontribution rate can only bring more procedural work  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers. I would suggest that the CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be  maintained at a low but reasonable level,  so\r\n\r\nthat the employees will have enough savings to look after\r\n\r\ntheir retirement and healthcare needs in their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will encourage those\r\n\r\ncompanies  which have done well to give more  bonuses  to\r\n\r\ntheir   employees,  through  the  grant   of   some   tax\r\n\r\nincentives.  The persuasive power of our leaders  is  not\r\n\r\nenough.   To  many  companies,  the  appraisal  of  their\r\n\r\nshareholders on them is of paramount importance, and  the\r\n\r\nremuneration of workers is secondary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sufficient provision for old age is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the individuals rather than that of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Although I understand  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants  to maintain relatively high CPF contribution rates\r\n\r\nto  ensure that every citizen has enough savings for  his\r\n\r\nold  age,  this has caused our labour cost system  to  be\r\n\r\ninflexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an illustration. A long time ago in\r\n\r\nancient  China, there was a rich merchant who made  every\r\n\r\neffort  to  cultivate his son and prepared him thoroughly\r\n\r\nfor  the Imperial Examination.  Unfortunately, when  this\r\n\r\nson of his sat for the examination, he failed to make the\r\n\r\ngrade.   The rich merchant asked to see his son's  answer\r\n\r\nsheet,  and was shocked to find that there was no writing\r\n\r\non  the  sheets, except for some watermarks.  It happened\r\n\r\nthat  in  the past the father would always grind the  ink\r\n\r\nslab to make the ink for the son to write with his brush-pen.  At  the  examination, the father was not  there  to\r\n\r\ngrind  the  ink  slab, so the boy did  not  know  how  to\r\n\r\ngenerate the ink from the ink slab, and he simply  wetted\r\n\r\nhis  brush with water and wrote his essay.  Thus, a blank\r\n\r\npaper was submitted as the answers were illegible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should set aside part of their monthly\r\n\r\nsalary  as  savings, and not depend  solely  on  the  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings for their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the package to buffer the impact of the\r\n\r\nCPF retuning exercise will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadequate  to  help our people deal with the  changes.   I\r\n\r\nhope   that   the   Government  will  help   the   poorer\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,    particularly    in    their     housing,\r\n\r\ntransportation and healthcare needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express my\r\n\r\nappreciation to Minister Khaw Boon Wan for his  announced\r\n\r\nintention to cut healthcare costs in Singapore.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat other Ministries will also do their best to cut down\r\n\r\nthe  various charges to lighten the burden of the  people\r\n\r\nin meeting the high cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, since the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is here, let me first congratulate him  on\r\n\r\nan  outstanding National Day Rally speech.  It  was  very\r\n\r\nheart-warming  and  inspiring  and,  indeed,   many   had\r\n\r\ncommented that it was his best speech ever.  As was  like\r\n\r\ngood wine, he gets better with age!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses and investors, of course, wanted to hear\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's views on the economy and the signals\r\n\r\nthat he was trying to send out.  So, it is not surprising\r\n\r\nthat  the  PM  concentrated much of  his  speech  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  economic  difficulties.   Yes,  very  true,  our\r\n\r\nlandscape  has changed dramatically.  Yes, we  took  away\r\n\r\njobs  from  others.  But, today, that fantastic  economic\r\n\r\nstrategy  is increasingly and ferociously being  followed\r\n\r\nby  even  more  lower  cost regimes in  the  region,  and\r\n\r\nspecially India and China.  Their economies are so  large\r\n\r\nthat  they can impact other economies in such a  big  way\r\n\r\nand  in  a  very  adverse way as  well.   Being  a  small\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  just  cannot escape the  onslaught.   Other\r\n\r\nskill  gaps  and  advantages have also been  eroded.   We\r\n\r\nseriously need to address our competitiveness and  revive\r\n\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the warnings of multi-national\r\n\r\ncorporations, like IBM, cannot go unheeded  because  they\r\n\r\nare  very  real.  In my  business too, I see  our  global\r\n\r\nclients   disappearing,   either   scaling   down   their\r\n\r\noperations  or just pulling out.  It is not because  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  find  us attractive anymore.  It  is  just  that\r\n\r\nglobalisation has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  it  unnecessary for them to be here.  This tide  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  is  very  real,  very  strong   and   very\r\n\r\npowerful.   And those of us who can ride this  tide  will\r\n\r\nprosper with this trend, and those of us who cannot  will\r\n\r\nsimply struggle against the current.  Therefore, we  need\r\n\r\nto change, and the business community really welcomes the\r\n\r\nproposal to retune our CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until the Prime Minister's National Day Rally\r\n\r\nspeech, the business community thought that it would just\r\n\r\nbe  a  maintenance  of  the rate.   And  after  the  PM's\r\n\r\nannouncement, there has been great debate - how far  will\r\n\r\nthis  go?   Of  course,  everybody  has  expected  a   6%\r\n\r\nreduction but the PM has just announced that it will be a\r\n\r\nmoderate  3%.  We respect the decision, and we appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  move.  The Prime Minister also touches on the  part\r\n\r\nof  home-owners,  what will this do  for  their  mortgage\r\n\r\npayments.   And  then  there  is  also  the  worry  about\r\n\r\nconsumption  and  its  effect on  other  sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy, calls for cuts in Government fees and taxes, and\r\n\r\nalso  even  for  the  size of the  civil  service  to  be\r\n\r\nreduced.   I  think  that  all these  are  not  frivolous\r\n\r\ncomments,  and  I am sure the Government  will  take  all\r\n\r\nthese in its stride.  And, in fact, the PM had said  that\r\n\r\nthe  CPF cut is just part of a large package of  business\r\n\r\ncosts which the Government will be seeking to reduce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to add to this debate. But I think it\r\n\r\nwould be helpful and valuable to recognise that the  PM's\r\n\r\nproposals are really steps in the right direction, and we\r\n\r\nshould fully support the proposals which have been  made.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister did mention Jack Neo  twice  in  his\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally speech.  So I might paraphrase  Jack\r\n\r\nand say, \"Prime Minister and the Government not stupid\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Prime Minister's track record has been a\r\n\r\nvery  excellent one, although we cannot say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nentirely  flawless.   It  is not possible  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nflawless  track record as well.  This move to modify  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system is, in fact, a recognition that the high wage\r\n\r\npolicy   has   contributed  to   our   present   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Also, many commentators have remarked that\r\n\r\nthe Government has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplayed  too big a role in our economy, too big a role  in\r\n\r\nour  society,  and that is why Singaporeans  are  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge  very reliant on the Government and run to  it  for\r\n\r\nsolutions to all problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, this is easy to say with the benefit\r\n\r\nof hindsight.  The high wage policy did serve us well for\r\n\r\na  long  time,  many  aspects of it, and  benefited  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as well.  Likewise, many Singaporeans  feel\r\n\r\nvery  comfortable to be hand-held, to be led  and  to  be\r\n\r\nmolly-coddled  by the Government.  But the circumstances,\r\n\r\nas said by so many people, have changed dramatically, and\r\n\r\nit  is  also  time for us, Singaporeans,  to  assume  new\r\n\r\nmindsets,   new  attitudes  and  really  be   much   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial,  much  more  self-reliant  and  also  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the real meaning of adding value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also enlightening to note that the Government\r\n\r\ntoo   has   changed  -  heeding  feedback,   looking   at\r\n\r\nshortcomings and being ready and willing to correct them.\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  amazed at how quickly the  PM  changed  his\r\n\r\nstance on bar-top dancing.  A lot has been done - undoing\r\n\r\nred  tape  and  bureaucracy; taking away  cumbersome  and\r\n\r\nstifling  regulations.  Of course, we continue  to  gripe\r\n\r\nthat  it is not far and fast enough.  But it will be fair\r\n\r\nto  say,  at  least, all these measures are  being  taken\r\n\r\nseriously  and there is no pretending that  it  does  not\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This CPF retuning is a classic example of a good\r\n\r\nsolution  -  breaking  down  the  rigidities,  making  it\r\n\r\nflexible,  and  taking  away  the  statutory  burden   on\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  also not putting our  older  workers  at\r\n\r\nrisk.   Of  course, it will produce uncertainty,  but  we\r\n\r\nlive in a very uncertain world.  Just the last six months\r\n\r\nalone,  we  had  been  wrecked by so  many  crises,  SARS\r\n\r\nincluded.   So, we need just to recognise that  certainty\r\n\r\nis  a  luxury which we cannot take for granted.  But  the\r\n\r\nCPF  retuning  will  produce a  lot  of  adverse  results\r\n\r\nbecause it is so linked to many aspects of our lives.  We\r\n\r\nare  glad that the Prime Minister has said and recognised\r\n\r\nthat this retuning is just not about re-scaling of dreams\r\n\r\nbut it will bring about real and considerable hardship to\r\n\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  are all looking forward to hear additional assistance\r\n\r\nmeasures that DPM would be announcing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few remarks about the HOPE programme which\r\n\r\nhas  been said to be comprehensive, and yet there  was  a\r\n\r\nStraits  Times' report about a family with an  income  of\r\n\r\n$680 who was not able to qualify because they had two \"0\"\r\n\r\nlevels  too  many.  So, here again, because  we  live  in\r\n\r\nexceptional  times, it is important that the  bureaucrats\r\n\r\nexercise flexibility and, as Ms Indranee has said, common\r\n\r\nsense in the implementation of policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said, but I would like to commend the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the courage shown, to take  on  difficult\r\n\r\nand   unpopular  decisions,  and  this  retuning  of  CPF\r\n\r\nsquarely  falls into it.  It will cost you votes  if  you\r\n\r\nhave  an  election  tomorrow.  Fortunately,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nhaving an election tomorrow.  It will not be until a  few\r\n\r\nyears'  time,  by  which time, the benefits  of  all  the\r\n\r\nchanges which are being proposed would have been felt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used a lot of tools already, but these tools\r\n\r\nhave  to  be relooked, like the tools relating to  taxes,\r\n\r\nlevies  and so on.  But the CPF is one far-reaching  tool\r\n\r\nthat  will  have immediate effect.  On hindsight,  again,\r\n\r\nperhaps we were too hasty in restoring the CPF cuts which\r\n\r\nwere  introduced  before.  As  I  said,  it  is  a  blunt\r\n\r\ninstrument  but  it is a very effective  instrument.   It\r\n\r\nwill  produce  a whole range of adverse effects  and  new\r\n\r\nsolutions have to be found.  I do not think we can tackle\r\n\r\nall  problems at the same time.  Some have to be  put  in\r\n\r\nthe parking lot.  The main thing is that there must be  a\r\n\r\nrecognition that we have a problematic situation here and\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to change, and new solutions got  to  be\r\n\r\nfound.   The  original objectives of the  CPF  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfully  met  by  the  old  model.   So  there  must  be  a\r\n\r\ntransition from the old model to the new model  and  help\r\n\r\nneeds to be injected here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future is never going to be certain. But there\r\n\r\nhave been a lot of debates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalready,  and a lot of time spent on debating about  what\r\n\r\nour  future should be and the solutions needed, like  the\r\n\r\nRemaking  Singapore,  the ERC, and the  debates  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   I  am confident we do have a blueprint  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  which looks promising.  In businesses, we  always\r\n\r\nsay  that  our competitors are also not stupid.   We  all\r\n\r\nhave  the  same strategies.  At the end of the  day,  the\r\n\r\nteam that comes together, the team that executes well, is\r\n\r\nthe  team  that  wins.  So, let us execute  together  and\r\n\r\nsupport the Prime Minister and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cuts are bitter but necessary medicine and,\r\n\r\nin  some  ways,  I believe that we can take  this  bitter\r\n\r\nmedicine  analogy  a little further.  The  challenges  we\r\n\r\nface are not going to be a simple flu.  Recovery can only\r\n\r\ncome  when  the patient, that is our people, acknowledges\r\n\r\nthe  problem  and  takes steps to  address  the  problem.\r\n\r\nAfter acknowledging the problem, the bitter medicine  may\r\n\r\nneed  to  be taken over a period of time, and  there  may\r\n\r\nneed  to  be more than one medicine with a bitter  after-taste,  no matter how sugar-coated.  And after that,  the\r\n\r\npatient  may  still need rehabilitation and physiotherapy\r\n\r\nto  recover  the use of flabby muscles, stiff joints  and\r\n\r\nmaybe  a  flabby mind.   Some medicine may appear  to  be\r\n\r\nless  painful but may not be so effective.   Just  as  no\r\n\r\nphysician  can  do a good job if he has an  uncooperative\r\n\r\npatient, I fear that the Government's fiscal measures and\r\n\r\nCPF  retuning  will  not bear fruits unless  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that we as a people and a  country  need  to\r\n\r\nrecognise we have a problem in competitiveness  and  take\r\n\r\nall necessary steps to address the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other MPs have spoken about the steps that the\r\n\r\nGovernment may need to take, but I would like to focus  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit differently and say that the onus is now  upon\r\n\r\nour  people  - our workers - to recognise the steps  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has done and to take their own  steps  to\r\n\r\nrecognise the problem.  My grassroots leaders still  keep\r\n\r\ntelling me how difficult it is to recruit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwaiters  and  waitresses, even when the pay is  $1,200  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   Singaporeans, it seems, are not prepared to  put\r\n\r\nup  with  split  shifts and having to work  on  weekends.\r\n\r\nOther grassroots leaders tell me about difficulties  with\r\n\r\nrecruiting for shipyards, even when they are prepared  to\r\n\r\noffer  training.   And when our Town Council  decided  to\r\n\r\nemploy more Singaporean workers for cleansing operations,\r\n\r\nresidents started complaining that actually local workers\r\n\r\nwere spraying water and not scrubbing, unlike some of the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  When the water dries up, the corridors\r\n\r\nare still dirty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upskill the younger and more educated workers,\r\n\r\nI  think the only way for us to maintain low unemployment\r\n\r\nfor older and less educated workers is for them to accept\r\n\r\nthe  manual  service and less convenient  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\ncurrently being taken by some of our foreign workers.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  need  to relearn the dignity of honest  manual\r\n\r\nlabour.  We can outsource a lot of jobs, but certain jobs\r\n\r\ncannot  be easily outsourced and have to be done  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry and onsite.  I do not think there is any shame in\r\n\r\nhonest labour, even when some aspects of the job may be a\r\n\r\nbit  demeaning.  As doctors and healthcare professionals,\r\n\r\nthis  is the creed which doctors and nurses have to learn\r\n\r\nto  accept  - unpleasant sights and smells, and sometimes\r\n\r\nunreasonable behaviour of people who are ill and need our\r\n\r\nhelp.   I  do  not  think people think any  less  of  our\r\n\r\nprofession  for the fact that we have to  deal  with  all\r\n\r\nthese unpleasant things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the Government to have a campaign to\r\n\r\nchange  societal values, to re-emphasise the  dignity  of\r\n\r\nlabour, the principle that any job is better than no job,\r\n\r\nand it is better to be at least partially employed and to\r\n\r\nreceive  some  help  financially than  to  look  out  for\r\n\r\nhandouts   alone.   We  manage  to  change  Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nattitude to a military career, and I think we can do  the\r\n\r\nsame  for manual labour and service sector jobs.   Having\r\n\r\nmisplaced pride and a handout mentality would not be good\r\n\r\nfor us in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of CPF cuts would be to lower our labour\r\n\r\ncost and make our labour more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  However, cost alone is not only the  issue.\r\n\r\nOur  products,  as  a  whole, as a country,  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncheaper and better, or at least give better value for the\r\n\r\nprice.   Factories in China, India and the former Eastern\r\n\r\nbloc  have found out that when cheaper and better quality\r\n\r\nforeign   goods  started  appearing  in  their   markets,\r\n\r\ndiscounting  obsolescent  product  lines  alone  did  not\r\n\r\nensure sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a potential employee, if what you have to offer\r\n\r\nis  a  set  of  old-fashioned and limited skills  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  an  easy  time  on  the  market  for  new   jobs.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans like ai pea ai chi.  Your potential employer\r\n\r\nis  also  looking  for a better, cheaper,  more  reliable\r\n\r\nlabour  product, just as you want to have it cheaper  and\r\n\r\nbetter.    Many of our citizens decry the fact that  many\r\n\r\nemployers  would like to have people to have facility  in\r\n\r\nChinese  or other languages.  Others find that  employers\r\n\r\nwant  to  have good looking frontline staff.  Instead  of\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that people are discriminating against  you,\r\n\r\nperhaps we should learn to give employers what they want.\r\n\r\nIf you read in today's papers, people in the call centres\r\n\r\nare  now  learning how to speak American English so  that\r\n\r\nthey  are actually able to do a better job even when they\r\n\r\nare far away from sight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way that many older workers embrace\r\n\r\ncomputers to deal with marketplace realities, I think the\r\n\r\nCDCs  can  help  non-Chinese Singaporeans get  a  working\r\n\r\nknowledge of Mandarin to make them more employable.   The\r\n\r\nMPs who are not so good in Mandarin manage to learn a bit\r\n\r\nmore too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a frontline counter job, you might want\r\n\r\nto  attend  a course that helps you project the  pleasant\r\n\r\npersonality and good inter-personal skills and also gives\r\n\r\ntips on dressing right.  If you look frumpy and you sound\r\n\r\ngrumpy,  do not blame people for not giving you the  job.\r\n\r\nAgain, CDCs can help in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bit is just a suggestion for HDB. As we\r\n\r\nhave asked the people to cut their cloth as they are able\r\n\r\nto  afford  it, and cut their clothes according  to  what\r\n\r\nthey can afford, perhaps now we are actually\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasking  people  to live more within their means.   People\r\n\r\nwho  are  downgrading and unable to service large housing\r\n\r\nloans   need  to  be  looking  at  cheaper  alternatives.\r\n\r\nBetween  a highly subsidised rental market with  arguably\r\n\r\nlots  of  necessary restrictions and the free  market,  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  lot  of  people in distress would  really  look\r\n\r\nforward  to an alternative where HDB will have  minimally\r\n\r\nsubsidised rental flats which are maybe a bit bigger  but\r\n\r\nwhich  would fill the need or gap, much in the  same  way\r\n\r\nthat  NTUC  FairPrice  supermarkets  manage  to  moderate\r\n\r\nprices.   Perhaps,  that  is one practical  measure  that\r\n\r\nwould help many hard-pressed Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me to join in this debate.  We were  geared  up\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon to hear drastic changes to CPF.   It  was\r\n\r\nthus  a great relief to hear from the Prime Minister that\r\n\r\nthe changes would be phased in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very reassuring that the Government leaders\r\n\r\nunderstand   and  acknowledge  the  pain  and  sufferings\r\n\r\nattendant  with  the  CPF changes and  have  taken  these\r\n\r\nconcerns   into   consideration  and  ameliorated   them.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the pain and sufferings are reduced,  they  are\r\n\r\nnot entirely eliminated.  I therefore urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  look  into  ways to help those who  are  affected  to\r\n\r\novercome these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear with me while I repeat a point made by other\r\n\r\nhon.  Members.   The  CPF is used by many  to  pay  their\r\n\r\nhousing  loans.   I  hope that the  Government  can,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  work  with the banks to extend  the  repayment\r\n\r\nperiod  and lower the monthly repayment in line with  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of the CPF contributions.  I look  forward  to\r\n\r\nhear the measures that DPM Lee Hsien Loong would announce\r\n\r\nshortly on how they can help the people who are affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this should not distract us from the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the challenges\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we  face  as  a  nation.  We must  therefore  brace\r\n\r\nourselves for the needed changes to remain competitive in\r\n\r\na  very  fast changing world.  It beholds us  to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is a small place where  the  margin  for\r\n\r\nerrors is also small.  If we miss the boat, it may  be  a\r\n\r\nlong  while before the next arrives or, worse  still,  it\r\n\r\nnever comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thus urge all Singaporeans to understand the\r\n\r\ngravity of the problems that confront us, to support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and to do whatever needs to be done to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  continues to prosper so  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  home  not only for us, but  also  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren and their children as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the proposed changes to\r\n\r\nthe CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Prime  Minister made the announcement  in  his\r\n\r\nNational  Day Rally that the CPF rates would be  reduced,\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans  were worried.  When  I  spoke  to  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots   leaders,   they  said   jin   cham   meaning\r\n\r\n\"Terrible!\"  But  today,  having  heard  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister announced, I called them up and  they said heng-ah, or \"Phew, lucky!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans understand the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe CPF reduction.  I believe this would be supported and\r\n\r\naccepted by the people in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reduction in CPF contribution rates, I\r\n\r\nhope,  would  help  to  reduce  the  business  costs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   On  the one hand, this would help  save  our\r\n\r\njobs  and  prevent further retrenchments.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,   we   would  be  able  to  attract  more   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments here, and thereby creating more jobs for  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a policy may be good, but it has to be\r\n\r\nimplemented effectively so as to obtain the best results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would suggest we set up a nation-wide\r\n\r\nunemployment  register.  We  can  make  use  of  all  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and community clubs in our 84\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to  effect  a  nation-wide   unemployment\r\n\r\nregistration exercise.  By so doing, we would be able  to\r\n\r\nbetter   understand   how  many  people   are   genuinely\r\n\r\nunemployed  and  what are their needs  and  requirements.\r\n\r\nThen,  we  can make a study of it and come out  with  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  measures  to  effectively  help  them.   The\r\n\r\nunemployed will have better chances of getting jobs  that\r\n\r\nare  available and suitable to them.  In this way, we can\r\n\r\nachieve the best results in combating unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also help those unemployed workers who are\r\n\r\nin financial difficulties.  We could perhaps give them  a\r\n\r\nonce-off unemployment benefit of, say, $2,000 or  $3,000.\r\n\r\nApart  from that, we should also try to reduce the  other\r\n\r\ncosts of living, such as PUB charges, and rentals.   Only\r\n\r\nthen, can we effectively help our workers to settle their\r\n\r\nproblems  while  making every effort to  attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to come in and create more jobs for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should step up our efforts to promote\r\n\r\nSingapore  overseas.  Here, we must commend our  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Trade  and Industry, BG George Yeo.   Under  such  a\r\n\r\ngloomy  global economic climate, he has still managed  to\r\n\r\nattract  a  lot of foreign investments to Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have some good incentive packages, and  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  civil servants to go overseas to promote  them   to\r\n\r\nthe  prospective foreign investors.  Nowadays, a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople  go  to China to invest.  The reason is that  many\r\n\r\nleaders  from  China  came to Singapore  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nvarious  investment opportunities in China.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  learn  from them, and encourage our senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants  to  go  overseas,  particularly  to  China  and\r\n\r\nIndia,   to  promote  our  incentive  packages   to   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  so  that they will come  to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ninvest.  Then we will be able to create more jobs for our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should work like the bees. Even when the weather\r\n\r\nis  bad,  the bees do not stop working. If the  immediate\r\n\r\nvicinity  is  no  good, they will  fly  further  away  to\r\n\r\ncollect  more pollen from the flowers there to make  more\r\n\r\nhoney.   I  think  we should also learn  from  them.   We\r\n\r\nshould go overseas to promote our incentive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npackages.   Only  then, can we link up with  the  foreign\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  persuade them to bring their  investments\r\n\r\nhere, and create more job opportunities for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should adapt to changes. No industry\r\n\r\ncan prosper forever and in every industry, there will  be\r\n\r\nups  and downs. Prior to the 60s, Singapore's main output\r\n\r\nwas  in farming and agricultural produce. In the 60s  and\r\n\r\n70s,  we  promoted industrialisation and concentrated  on\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive industries. In the 80s and 90s, we moved\r\n\r\ntowards  high  value-added industries which  paid  higher\r\n\r\nwages,  and our people enjoyed better standard of living.\r\n\r\nThat  has resulted in a very high wage level in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday, where the labour cost is significantly higher than\r\n\r\nthe  other  countries in this region. I think  we  should\r\n\r\nmake  use  of this period of economic downturn to  change\r\n\r\nthe  mindset of our people.  In the meantime, we have  to\r\n\r\nseek avenues for our businessmen to expand overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we should look into the field of education.\r\n\r\nWe  can promote our universities so that we can become  a\r\n\r\nhub  for  higher  learning and cultural activities.   Our\r\n\r\neducational standard is the envy of many countries in the\r\n\r\nworld.   I  think  our  NUS and NTU should  cooperate  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more opportunities for students to  study  here.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  a report, the President of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nManagement University, Mr Tan Chin Tiong, mentioned  that\r\n\r\nit  would  cost a Singaporean some $70,000 to  $80,000  a\r\n\r\nyear  to  study  in  a university in the  United  States,\r\n\r\nwhereas  he  needs to pay just $6,000 if  he  studies  in\r\n\r\neither  NUS or NTU in Singapore. At this time of economic\r\n\r\nrecession, we should encourage more Singaporeans to study\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   That would help to solve  the  financial\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, attraction of foreign students. We should\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore  into a hub for  higher  learning  and\r\n\r\nattract  foreign students to study here. In this way,  we\r\n\r\ncan  earn more foreign exchange too.  Recently, I was  in\r\n\r\nGanzhou City, Jiangxi Province. I had the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspeak to some high school  students there.  I asked  them\r\n\r\nwhere they would like to go for further studies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter  their  graduation. They named four destinations  - Canada,  United States, England and Singapore.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  very good brand that is well known overseas.   We\r\n\r\nshould  make use of this foundation to expand and improve\r\n\r\nour   university   education.   We  should   seize   this\r\n\r\nopportunity.   We  should not  wait.   I  think  for  our\r\n\r\neconomy  to  prosper, we should resume the  old  name  of\r\n\r\nNantah   for  our  NTU.    The  Nantah  spirit  is   very\r\n\r\nimportant.   With the new President, Prof. Su Guaning  at\r\n\r\nthe helm, we should be able to make further progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to tourism. Tourism is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  component of our economy.  The development  of\r\n\r\ntourism   will  bring  more  business  for  the   hotels,\r\n\r\nrestaurants, transport and retail business. These are all\r\n\r\ninter-linked   and   tourism  will   provide   more   job\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  Singaporeans.  The Government  should\r\n\r\ntry  to  establish more tourist attractions in Singapore,\r\n\r\nmake  use of our surrounding environment and improve  the\r\n\r\nservice quality of our workers in the tourism industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, with this announcement of CPF cut, some\r\n\r\npeople  will  naturally be worried.  Now,  the  repayment\r\n\r\nperiod for HDB loan is for only 30 years, and the lessees\r\n\r\nhave  a  rather short repayment period for  the  mortgage\r\n\r\nloan  they  took.  I  think we should grant  them  longer\r\n\r\nrepayment  period, say, 35 or even 40 years.   With  this\r\n\r\ndownturn, many HDB lessees could not service the loan for\r\n\r\ntheir  present flats.  Many of them wish to downgrade  to\r\n\r\nsmaller flats.   The HDB should consider building more 3-room flats to satisfy their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Prime Minister just now, the 3%\r\n\r\ncut  in  CPF  amounts  to a hefty $1.3  billion  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers  in Singapore. If we convert this to  Renminbi,\r\n\r\nit  amounts  to five Renminbi for every one  of  the  1.3\r\n\r\nbillion  people in China. This is indeed a  huge  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   Those  companies which are doing  well,  the  3%\r\n\r\nsaving  in the employer's CPF contribution is a windfall.\r\n\r\nThey should make full use\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof these windfall savings  to help their workers.  So,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  those companies which are  making  profits\r\n\r\nshould  set  aside at least 1% as a training  or  welfare\r\n\r\nfund for the workers.  This would enable  the workers  to\r\n\r\nshare the windfall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should change the work attitude of our\r\n\r\nworkers  so  that  they  can  keep  up  with  the  times.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower, some companies are\r\n\r\nstill having difficulty recruiting workers.  For example,\r\n\r\nnow  there are about 4,600 jobs where there is no  taker.\r\n\r\nYet,  we have 80,000 people who are unemployed.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should  change the attitude of our workers.   In  any\r\n\r\njob,  there is always dignity and professionalism in  it.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there is still a good number of jobs which  are\r\n\r\nshunned  by  Singaporean  workers.   As  a  result,   the\r\n\r\ncompanies have no choice but to employ  foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  more  than  30% of  our  bus  drivers  are\r\n\r\nforeigners.  Most of the Town Councils' conservancy works\r\n\r\nare  also taken up by foreign workers too.  Even  in  the\r\n\r\nhawker centres and factories, it is the same. So, I think\r\n\r\nour workers should be more realistic.  They should enrich\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  make  some  compromises  and   be   more\r\n\r\nflexible.   Only  then  can they survive  in  this  ever-changing environment and be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an example. When I completed my\r\n\r\nsecondary  school, I wanted to go to the  university.   I\r\n\r\nwas  worried that my family could not support me  for  my\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  So, I worked in a provision  shop\r\n\r\nin  Taman  Jurong to earn some money before I joined  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  While in the university, I spent my vacation\r\n\r\nworking  in a plywood factory. My employer told  me  that\r\n\r\nthe  only  vacancy was in the sawmill which was the  most\r\n\r\ndirty  and  dusty part of the factory, and I  had  to  do\r\n\r\nnight  shift.  I  took the job.  My nightshift  was  from\r\n\r\n<br>11.00 pm to 7.00 am. The proprietor of the plywood\r\n\r\nfactory was a Taiwanese.  He was in the habit of visiting\r\n\r\nthe  factory in the middle of the night to check  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were working.  At that time, I was a  young  man\r\n\r\nwho needed the money desperately, I dared not play truant\r\n\r\nand was always working. The proprietor saw that I was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  conscientious   worker and was also an  undergraduate.\r\n\r\nHe  recognised my efforts and promoted me to be a quality\r\n\r\ninspector, and my wages were raised from $2.50  to  $3.50\r\n\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are prepared to work hard and earn our\r\n\r\nkeeps,  there  is no need to feel ashamed. As  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said, we would not die when we lose face.  It is\r\n\r\nonly when we cannot breathe that we will die.  So, when a\r\n\r\njob  is  given to us, we should take it.  We  should  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  it is a lowly job and refuse   to  take  it.\r\n\r\nEvery  job is sacred, so long as it is a good and  proper\r\n\r\njob.   This  is  what  we call the \"Nantah  spirit\",  the\r\n\r\nspirit of self-reliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.
