An amendment to section 6,  subsection\r\n\r\n(4)  of  this Ordinance is now considered necessary\r\n\r\nto provide that small factories employing less than\r\n\r\nten   persons  will  only  be  exempted  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance if no mechanical power,\r\n\r\nsteam boiler, steam container, steam receiver, cast\r\n\r\niron    underfired   vulcaniser,   air    receiver,\r\n\r\nrefrigerating plant pressure receiver, or gas plant\r\n\r\nis  used, or where no highly inflammable or noxious\r\n\r\nsubstance is manipulated, used or created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Ordinance stands, no\r\n\r\nlegal  action can be taken against a small  factory\r\n\r\nemploying less than ten persons even though it uses\r\n\r\nthe  kind of machinery mentioned above. It has been\r\n\r\nfound  that  there are a large number of  factories\r\n\r\nhaving  less  than  ten persons  using  out-of-date\r\n\r\nmachinery  which  did  not originally  have  safety\r\n\r\nguards  incorporated, or where they have had safety\r\n\r\nguards, these could easily be removed, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is merely seeking power to take\r\n\r\npreventive action against serious accidents to life\r\n\r\nand limb in small factories employing less than ten\r\n\r\npersons  where  dangerous  machinery  of  the  type\r\n\r\nmentioned above is used, and which are now excluded\r\n\r\nfrom the Factories Ordinance, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, a locally assembled grinding\r\n\r\nmachine burst its grinding wheel, a piece of  which\r\n\r\nhit   the   operator  in  the  face,  killing   him\r\n\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment to the Factories Ordinance\r\n\r\nis   designed  to  enable  proper  control  to   be\r\n\r\nexercised  in  respect  of  such  activities  where\r\n\r\ndangerous  machinery  is used  in  small  factories\r\n\r\nemploying less than ten persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that the\r\n\r\noriginal  Factories Bill provided that premises  in\r\n\r\nwhich there were less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  six  employees should be  exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Ordinance. This Bill  was  later\r\n\r\nreferred  to a Select Committee of the  House,  and\r\n\r\nwas  discussed  in  Select Committee  on  the  15th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1958.  It  was first  proposed  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  that  the  exemption  should  be\r\n\r\nextended to premises in which there were less  than\r\n\r\n16  employees, and the Chief Minister, Tun Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock, agreed to a compromise by which premises with\r\n\r\nless  than  ten employees were to be exempted  from\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Factories Ordinance. It  was\r\n\r\nthought  that  such  an  exemption  would  make  it\r\n\r\nunnecessary for a lot of small businesses to comply\r\n\r\nwith the onerous provisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of confusion of thought as to\r\n\r\nwhat  the Bill was designed to do when it was  last\r\n\r\nbefore  this House. Members who spoke in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  mentioned that great hardship  would  be\r\n\r\ncaused  to  small businesses, in which no machinery\r\n\r\nwas  used,  if  they  were not  exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance. I would refer you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  to the proceedings of the 15th September,\r\n\r\n1958,   in  Select  Committee,  and  I  will  quote\r\n\r\nextracts  from  speeches which were  made  by  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what one hon.

The  people  know  that\r\n\r\nduring  this short period of six weeks,  many  acts\r\n\r\nand decisions were passed by this rump City Council\r\n\r\ndepleted  of any mandate or any authority to  carry\r\n\r\non.  It made important decisions which affected the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the nation for a long time,  in  some\r\n\r\ncases raising fundamental issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the question of tariff charges\r\n\r\nfor  electricity supplied to cinemas. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nduring the ten years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the Member for Farrer Park was in sole charge\r\n\r\nof the City Council, we the people of Singapore had\r\n\r\nto  pay  20  cents  a unit for electricity  charges\r\n\r\nwhile  cinema-owners had to pay only three to  four\r\n\r\ncents  a  unit  for their lighting. That  had  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on  for nearly ten years until we  found  it\r\n\r\nout.  The case they put up was to masquerade  under\r\n\r\nthe  so-called maximum demand tariff that,  without\r\n\r\nthese  cinemas, the electricity being  churned  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Pasir  Panjang Power  Station  would  be\r\n\r\nthrown into the sea. We know that this was far from\r\n\r\ntrue. We raised the cinema rates from three or four\r\n\r\ncents  to  20  cents per Unit. But during  the  six\r\n\r\nweeks that the watch-dogs of the nation were not in\r\n\r\nthe Council, the rump City Council of Tang Peng Yeu\r\n\r\nVasagar  rescinded  our  decision  and  decided  to\r\n\r\nconclude   an   agreement  with  the  cinema-owners\r\n\r\nproviding for a substantial reduction in the  rates\r\n\r\npayable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have in front of me a so-called agreement signed between the parties. This deed of\r\n\r\ncompromise  was made on the 29th day of May,  1959.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a  few  significant  features  in  this\r\n\r\nagreement.  One was that although it was  purported\r\n\r\nto  be  the  29th  of May, 1959, and  even  if  the\r\n\r\naccepted  date is truly the 29th day  of  May,  the\r\n\r\nstamp is on the 1st of June, 1959. The fact is that\r\n\r\nthe  29th of May, 1959, is a date which we call the\r\n\r\neve  of  a beautiful funeral. Because on the  30th,\r\n\r\nthe   electorate   condemned  the   Parties   whose\r\n\r\nrepresentatives had signed this agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second significant feature in this agreement\r\n\r\nwas  that  in the more than 100 years of  Municipal\r\n\r\nhistory,  as  I  have  been  told,  never  had   an\r\n\r\nagreement been concluded on duplicating paper.  All\r\n\r\nagreements  were printed and properly sealed.  That\r\n\r\nwas the first time in Municipal history that a very\r\n\r\nimportant  document  had been stencilled  on  cheap\r\n\r\nprinting paper, and with many typing mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just to give an instance of the typing mistakes. This deed of compromise made\r\n\r\nbetween  the City Council of the one part, and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  persons - 25 in number - of  the  other\r\n\r\npart;  the \"25\" was changed in handwriting to \"17\".\r\n\r\nApparently eight of them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  have had cold feet, knowing very  well  that\r\n\r\nwhen we came in we would rescind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 19th of April, 1959, the Chairman of my Party made this important\r\n\r\nannouncement.  This  is contained  in  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of the 19th April, 1959:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Toh also warned that the C.A.O. and the Minister for Local Government, Dato Abdul Hamid Bin\r\n\r\nHaji  Jumat,  would be held personally  responsible\r\n\r\n\"for  any acts committed in this interregnum  which\r\n\r\nis detrimental to the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Government will rescind and reverse any\r\n\r\ndecision  or  action which is not in  the  people's\r\n\r\ninterest,\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we gave due warning to all persons concerned who had dealings with this rump City\r\n\r\nCouncil  that their actions could be re-opened  and\r\n\r\nsubject   to   review.  And  we  have  here   eight\r\n\r\nenlightened cinema-owners who understood that  this\r\n\r\ndocument  was  a  document which was  going  to  be\r\n\r\nperpetrated  against the interests of the  country.\r\n\r\nThey  thus  refused to sign and, as a  result,  the\r\n\r\n\"25\"  had  been corrected in pencil to \"17\".  There\r\n\r\nare  also the initials of Mr P. C. Marcus  as  the\r\n\r\nC.A.O.,  Mr G. B. Armstrong, as a City Councillor,\r\n\r\nand one member representing the theatre and cinema-owners who initialled just behind the pencil mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill seeks to rectify, by legislation, this most unsatisfactory situation, by\r\n\r\ngiving powers to the Minister to invalidate any act\r\n\r\nor  proceedings of this rump City Council which  is\r\n\r\nnot  considered to be in the public  interest,  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  render  null and void all  contracts  and\r\n\r\nagreements  entered into on the authority  of  such\r\n\r\nacts  and proceedings. The people pay 20 cents  per\r\n\r\nunit for electricity. The cinema-owners should  not\r\n\r\npay only six cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, provision has also been made in the Bill for compensation to be awarded in cases where\r\n\r\nhardships may arise as a result of the invalidation\r\n\r\naction  taken.  I wish to make some explanation  on\r\n\r\nthis. There has been a contract on certain sewerage\r\n\r\nworks  of  the  City Council. The  lowest  tenderer\r\n\r\nwithdrew  for no reason whatsoever. In  the  normal\r\n\r\npractice in the City Council, they always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nre-tender.   But  in  this  case,  the   Committee,\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  the  residual  of  the  rump   City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  decided to give it to the  second  lowest\r\n\r\ntenderer and it cost a quarter of a million dollars\r\n\r\nmore.  After  we had been elected  in  as  the  new\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I received certain letters  explaining\r\n\r\nto  me  why  the  first tenderer withdrew  and  the\r\n\r\nreasons which they considered motivated the  giving\r\n\r\nof  the tender to the second lowest tenderer.  This\r\n\r\naction  was  against all previous  precedents.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we  have taken action on  this.  We  have\r\n\r\nfrozen  the contract - luckily the contract  was  not\r\n\r\nsigned yet. We were fast enough to take action and,\r\n\r\nalthough  the contract was not signed,  the  second\r\n\r\nlowest  tenderer  had  done  some  spade-work   and\r\n\r\nperhaps,  in  such cases, it might be necessary  to\r\n\r\npay a little bit of compensation to the contractor,\r\n\r\nalthough  it was not the fault of the City  Council\r\n\r\nthat he had proceeded with the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are many more instances\r\n\r\nof  actions  taken by this rump City Council  which\r\n\r\nare  against the interests of the country and which\r\n\r\nhave to be invalidated. This Bill will provide  for\r\n\r\nsuch powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development  paid  me  a\r\n\r\ncompliment by saying that I was in sole  charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  City Council for the ten years previous to his\r\n\r\nadvent  there. Now, if the Minister means  what  he\r\n\r\nsays - that  is,  that I was in sole  charge - then  he\r\n\r\nmust  necessarily imply that I was controlling  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and what I said then went in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil, in the same way that when he was the Mayor\r\n\r\nwhat  he said in the City Council went. Fortunately\r\n\r\nor unfortunately for me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that was\r\n\r\nnot  my  position. I was not in sole charge of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council. I was only one of the members of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Commissioners to begin with, and latterly\r\n\r\none  of the members of the City Council. I had  not\r\n\r\nthe powers that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nex-Mayor  had  when  he  was  there.  However,  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this debate, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  not who was in charge of the City Council,\r\n\r\nbut  the merits or demerits of the Bill now  before\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nstarted  off his speech by saying this Bill  raises\r\n\r\nfundamental issues. Mr Speaker, Sir, to  my  mind,\r\n\r\nit   also   raises  fundamental  issues,   but   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the fundamental issues  raised  is\r\n\r\nnot the same as that of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not known a Bill seeking\r\n\r\nto  do what this Bill is seeking to do. I have  not\r\n\r\nknown any legislation such as this enacted and  put\r\n\r\non  any statute book. This is something unique, and\r\n\r\nif  this Bill goes through this House, as I  expect\r\n\r\nit  will, I hope that this will be the last of such\r\n\r\nBills in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Speaker, Sir, the present\r\n\r\nGovernment in its policy speech said that the prime\r\n\r\ntask  for  Singapore is to build up  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence - confidence of such a nature that  people\r\n\r\nwill  have faith in this country and come here  and\r\n\r\ninvest  their money and carry on their business.  I\r\n\r\nventure to suggest, Mr Speaker, that Bills of this\r\n\r\nnature must surely destroy that confidence. If  one\r\n\r\ngovernment  disagrees  with  the  actions  of   the\r\n\r\nprevious   government,  surely  in   a   democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  Mr  Speaker,  the  answer  is   not   to\r\n\r\nlegislate  to  annul such actions of  the  previous\r\n\r\ngovernment  and this more so especially in  matters\r\n\r\nin  respect of which private citizens had  acquired\r\n\r\nrights.  If  our Government is going to  take  this\r\n\r\nsort  of  action,  then it  is  going  to  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for private individuals to carry on their\r\n\r\nbusiness with any sense of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill proposes to cancel off all\r\n\r\ncontracts entered into by the City Council during a\r\n\r\ncertain  period. No doubt the Mayor and  his  group\r\n\r\nwere not in the City Council then, but that did not\r\n\r\nmake  the  City Council an illegal institution.  It\r\n\r\nwas  a perfectly legal institution carrying out its\r\n\r\nduties in a perfectly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitutional manner, possibly not in the way that\r\n\r\nthe  Mayor and his group would have done, but still\r\n\r\ncarrying  out their duties in a proper  and  lawful\r\n\r\nway; and if contracts were entered into as a result\r\n\r\nof those lawful acts, is it moral Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nthe  present government should come along and upset\r\n\r\nwhat  was perfectly right, proper and legal at  the\r\n\r\ntime of decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more disturbing than that, Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nthis. Clause 4 of the Bill says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...no court shall entertain any claim to\r\n\r\ncompensation  damages  in  respect  of   any   such\r\n\r\ncontract or agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bill goes on to say that the Minister, if\r\n\r\nhe  so  desires, may award compensation.  Why  this\r\n\r\nattempt to oust the court of its rightful sphere of\r\n\r\naction? If compensation should be paid, why  should\r\n\r\nnot  the  court  decide  it,  and  why  should  the\r\n\r\nMinister  be  allowed to decide it?  Have  we  lost\r\n\r\nfaith in our courts that we must go to the Minister\r\n\r\nevery  time? It may be that the Minister may decide\r\n\r\nto  cancel  a  contract. Certain legal rights  will\r\n\r\narise  on  work done, on a quantum merit.  Is  that\r\n\r\nperson  to  be  denied access to  the  courts?  And\r\n\r\nshould  he  be  left to the tender mercies  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  not  the proper Bill  to  create  a\r\n\r\nclimate  of  confidence;  in  fact,  it  is  highly\r\n\r\nimproper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, and fellow Members-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

If we  go  deeply\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter as to how this Bill  was  brought\r\n\r\nabout resulting in it being moved today, I think it\r\n\r\nwill take a long time. However, I wish to reply  to\r\n\r\nhis queries one by one in order to satisfy him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has stated that it is not proper for the former City Council\r\n\r\nto discriminate against the people of Singapore who\r\n\r\npay  16  cents for a unit of electricity, and  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  reason why businessmen  or  cinema-owners  should pay only 6 cents per unit or even  a\r\n\r\nlower rate than that. I think this is not fair.  In\r\n\r\nmy  opinion,  there  must have been  some  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive behind that decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park stated just now that\r\n\r\nthis Bill will create an unhealthy climate for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore, that it will go  to  show\r\n\r\nthat its administration is not so perfect, and that\r\n\r\nit will result in the loss of confidence of cinema-owners in the Government of Singapore. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  loss of confidence will not be as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill. The loss of confidence resulted from the\r\n\r\nattitude  of the City Council during the  past  ten\r\n\r\nyears for its generous charge of six cents per unit\r\n\r\nof  electricity to cinema-owners, or even  a  lower\r\n\r\nrate than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly if we increase the charge to more than\r\n\r\nsix  cents,  or  18 cents a Unit, the cinema-owners\r\n\r\nwill be surprised, as they are paying six cents per\r\n\r\nunit now. Therefore, the loss of confidence was due\r\n\r\nto  the fact that the rate had been increased  from\r\n\r\nsix  cents to 18 cents per unit to bring it at  par\r\n\r\nwith the rate paid by the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said that he was not\r\n\r\nin sole control of the City Council. But he was one\r\n\r\nof  those  responsible for the running of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil during the past ten years. He played a  big\r\n\r\npart  in the City Council and he had powers.  As  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  City Council, I also  had  certain\r\n\r\npowers.  When we, the P.A.P., won the elections  to\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council and we checked the books,  there\r\n\r\nwas nothing to show that the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer Park opposed the low rate of six  cents\r\n\r\nper  unit  of  electricity levied  on  the  cinema-owners.  This  should  be a  guide  to  the  Member\r\n\r\nconcerned.  I am quite sure that he is fully  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the loss of confidence is not as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other examples which can be quoted\r\n\r\nhere.  For instance, the Victoria Theatre, and  the\r\n\r\nMurnane  Reservoir, but if I do  that,  I  will  be\r\n\r\nrunning away from the subject of the debate today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, among other things mentioned in this Bill are that the decisions of the previous City\r\n\r\nCouncil of Messrs. \"Vasagar/Tang Peng Yeu\" would be\r\n\r\nconsidered  unconstitutional and would  be  invalid\r\n\r\nand  rescinded. The reason why I support this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  that since members of the P.A.P. left the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, the Opposition Members acted like  thieves\r\n\r\nand  robbers  to satisfy their lust  and  ambitions\r\n\r\nwhich  were  opposed by the members of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwhen they were in the City Council. As mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development, normally  an\r\n\r\nagreement  is  signed on a standard type  of  paper\r\n\r\naccording  to  proper procedure but  the  agreement\r\n\r\nsigned  by  the  City Council of  Mr  Vasagar  and\r\n\r\nMessrs. Tang Peng Yeu and company were not so. This\r\n\r\nis  the  attitude I was referring to when I  talked\r\n\r\nabout  thieves  and robbers. There are  many  other\r\n\r\nacts  committed  by  them  which  are  not  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the State of Singapore. The reason  for\r\n\r\ntheir perpetuating these acts to satisfy their lust\r\n\r\nwas   prompted  by  the  support  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nMinister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the  Minister for Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands and Housing, who is Dato Abdul Hamid bin Haji\r\n\r\nJumat who-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the previous Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Local Government is now a Member of the  House\r\n\r\nand, therefore, he must not be referred to by name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\ntender my apologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this encouragement came from the previous\r\n\r\nMinister. How did he give that encouragement? There\r\n\r\nmight  be  many other reasons. The powers which  he\r\n\r\nhad delegated to himself was not in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe   Local   Government   Ordinance.   With   such\r\n\r\nencouragement,  the  ex-City Councillors  committed\r\n\r\nmany  acts, and made decisions at their  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies.  That  is  the reason  why  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintroduced today - so that the decisions taken  since\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  City Councillors left, and which  were\r\n\r\nnot in the interest of the people and of the State,\r\n\r\ncould be made null and void.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, I wish to say that this\r\n\r\nBill  has  been formulated in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, and should be supported by all\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member for Anson said\r\n\r\nthat  when I was the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands   and   Housing,  I  encouraged   all   these\r\n\r\ncommitments,  these unconstitutional  acts  in  the\r\n\r\nCity Council. This is completely untrue. I wish  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  here  that  when I  was  a  Minister,  I\r\n\r\ncarried out my duties constitutionally. The actions\r\n\r\nwhich   I   took  were  in  accordance   with   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Anson about the\r\n\r\nelectricity  agreement signed between  the  cinema-owners,  and the City Council, the present Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  just now that the agreement was made  on  the\r\n\r\n1st of June, 1959, i.e. after the elections. So  it\r\n\r\nis therefore not true to say that I was responsible\r\n\r\nfor  or  that  I  encouraged  acts  which  were  in\r\n\r\nviolation of the Constitution of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise just to clarify a few points. This question of\r\n\r\nelectricity rates has been confusing the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  electorate for some time, and I must say  that\r\n\r\nmy  mind  is  confused too. I have heard  divergent\r\n\r\nviews  on  these  electricity  rates.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to clear up, once and for all,  this\r\n\r\ndoubt  in  my mind and in the minds of  many  other\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says, I think, why should it be right and proper that cinema-owners should be\r\n\r\ncharged a lower rate than what the public is called\r\n\r\nupon  to  pay to the City Council? I too have  been\r\n\r\npaying  the  City Council rates for electricity.  I\r\n\r\npay  a  rate  for lighting, which is 20  cents  per\r\n\r\nunit, and I pay rates for power for my ironing,  my\r\n\r\nrefrigerator,  and  for  my air-conditioner.  If  I\r\n\r\nremember  rightly - I do not have  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nbill  with me - for my air-conditioning plant, I  pay\r\n\r\npower  at 6 cents per unit. Therefore, if such  are\r\n\r\nthe proper rates, where then is the right to charge\r\n\r\nthat cinema-owners are paying lower rates? In fact,\r\n\r\nby  this  Bill,  the Minister now proposes  to  re-assess the rates for cinemas and to call upon  them\r\n\r\nto pay more. Sir, it is confusing. As I do not have\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  bill with me,  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether it is right or wrong. But as far as I know,\r\n\r\npower  rates are at 6 cents per unit, and  lighting\r\n\r\nis  at  20  cents. May I repeat again,  Sir,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember  rightly,  the rate  for  air-conditioning\r\n\r\nplant is the same as for power; therefore, it is  6\r\n\r\ncents - I do not know, I stand subject to correction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point raised by the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark, Sir, is not whether the City Councillors, who\r\n\r\nremained  at  their posts after the resignation  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P Councillors, did right or wrong. That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  question.  The  question  is:  they  were\r\n\r\nlegally  constituted; they were  discharging  their\r\n\r\nduties  in a legal way; and since that is  so,  any\r\n\r\nact   that  they  did  was  done  legally.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was not satisfied with  the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  City  Councillors who had  remained  in\r\n\r\noffice  conducted their business, it is a  question\r\n\r\nof  dissatisfaction.  I do not  think  it  is  good\r\n\r\npublic policy for any incoming government to try to\r\n\r\nupset the decisions of a previous government.  That\r\n\r\nwould create a feeling of uncertainty. As the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park has pointed out,  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant thing in Singapore today is - and this  is\r\n\r\neven admitted by the Government - to create a feeling\r\n\r\nof confidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  And  the only way  to  create  such\r\n\r\nconfidence  is  for the Government  to  create  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of others in itself. But if such matters\r\n\r\nare  allowed to go on without any challenge,  where\r\n\r\nthen  is  that confidence? Moreover, it seems  that\r\n\r\nthis  is an important matter, and yet it is brought\r\n\r\nup on a Certificate of Urgency. We do not know what\r\n\r\nother  forms of contracts or what other actions  of\r\n\r\nthe  ex-City Councilors come within the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  this Bill. If we had time, we might be able  to\r\n\r\nknow  more  about  it. Apart  from  the  merits  or\r\n\r\ndemerits  of  the actions of those City Councillors\r\n\r\nwho  remained in office, I share strongly the  same\r\n\r\nview  as  expressed by the hon. Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark, that this is an immoral Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel that this Bill,\r\n\r\nintroduced    by   the   Minister   for    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, is clear and specific for the  reasons\r\n\r\nstated  therein. Mr Speaker, we know that  certain\r\n\r\nacts  committed  by certain City Councillors  after\r\n\r\nthe  resignation  of the P.A.P.  Councillors,  were\r\n\r\ndone  with the ulterior motive of safeguarding  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of vested interests. This is made  clear\r\n\r\nby  the  instances quoted by the Hon. the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerning  the agreements which were signed  in  a\r\n\r\nhaphazard way. I think, Mr Speaker, there  may  be\r\n\r\nmany  other reasons; for instance, they  knew  that\r\n\r\ntheir  powers  in  the  City Council  would  cease,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was clear, from the manifesto  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., that if the P.A.P. was returned to power it\r\n\r\nwould  dissolve the City Council. For this  reason,\r\n\r\nthey  knew that their fate was written on the wall.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they resorted to unconstitutional  acts\r\n\r\nin the interest of vested interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present Government of the people will not hesitate to act to safeguard the interest\r\n\r\nof the people as a whole. As has been stated by the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park, it appeared that he did not\r\n\r\nhave  power  in the City Council, but  that  was  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  matter.  He said that  this  Bill  would\r\n\r\ncause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubts  in the minds of those people who  think  of\r\n\r\ninvesting  capital in this country, and  that  this\r\n\r\nwould  create a policy of discrimination.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  question  of investment will not be  affected.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  need to fear that in this  Bill.  No\r\n\r\npolicy  of discrimination has been enacted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The previous Government in  power  fed\r\n\r\ntheir  cats  with meat, when actually  they  should\r\n\r\nhave  fed them with vegetables and rice. This means\r\n\r\nthat certain sections of the people during the last\r\n\r\nregime - and   this  also  happened   in   the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil - received  more benefits than  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople.  The  Member also denied that  the  actions\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the City Councillors who remained  after\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Councilors had left were illegal. We did\r\n\r\nnot  say that the actions were illegal, but we said\r\n\r\nthat   their  actions  were  detrimental   to   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people, and for that  reason  we\r\n\r\noppose.  Mr Speaker, there is no need to carry  on\r\n\r\nthis  debate at length. It is a waste of  time.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that this Bill, if approved, will give a fair\r\n\r\ndeal to all the people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

That is what we are proceeding  to  do\r\n\r\ntoday,  so that it would be most improper for  them\r\n\r\nnow  to  suggest  that  they  who  themselves  have\r\n\r\nbehaved  improperly before should now say  that  we\r\n\r\nare behaving improperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never interfered with anything that was\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  previous Government bona  fide.

The Cinema Owners Association was\r\n\r\nmade  to pay increased electricity charges. The  32\r\n\r\nCouncillors  with a majority passed the  Bill.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the people of Singapore are quite aware of\r\n\r\nthe  repercussions. A big noise  was  made  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   or   what  we  call   the   Rightwing\r\n\r\nreactionary   partisans   in   the   Council,    in\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with  the  capitalists  and   vested\r\n\r\ninterest people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinema-owners stopped their air conditioning\r\n\r\nplants,  saying that the P.A.P. had  increased  the\r\n\r\ncharges, and that they were running at a loss.  The\r\n\r\nCity  Council then told them plainly that  if  they\r\n\r\ncould  produce  their accounts for  the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears to the court and prove that they were running\r\n\r\nat  a  loss,  then  the P.A.P.

And  that  is  the  main\r\n\r\npurpose of introducing this Bill today, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even just now, the Member for Cairnhill, I\r\n\r\nbelieve - because   he   has   got   so   many    ex-wards - mentioned that he has got an air-conditioner,\r\n\r\na  refrigerator and some other things. We  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested whether the Member of the Opposition has\r\n\r\ngot  an  air-conditioner  or  a  refrigerator,   or\r\n\r\nwhether  he  uses gas or electricity,  charcoal  or\r\n\r\nkerosene.  We are not interested in this.  When  we\r\n\r\nintroduce  this Bill we are thinking of the  people\r\n\r\nof   the  country  as  a  whole,  and  not  of  any\r\n\r\nindividual. If he thinks he is being charged on his\r\n\r\nair-conditioner at six cents, I hope he will  write\r\n\r\nto  the  City Council to increase it to  20  or  30\r\n\r\ncents,  so that they can make money out of him.  If\r\n\r\nthis Bill is passed, and according to the Minister,\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to increase all the air-conditioner\r\n\r\nplants,  then I think the hon. Member will have  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  he  might want  to  have  an  air-conditioner or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a system of giving contracts in the\r\n\r\nCity  Council.  While we were in the City  Council,\r\n\r\nthe  principle  we  adopted  was  that  the  lowest\r\n\r\ntenderer would be given the contract, according  to\r\n\r\nspecifications. And even there are certain  tenders\r\n\r\nwhich  ought  not  to be revealed. And  Councillors\r\n\r\nlike Tang Peng Yeu and Vasagar made a big noise - the\r\n\r\nhero  or champion of the workers of Singapore! When\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. were there, they shed crocodile  tears\r\n\r\nand said that what the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas doing was not good for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt would only be helpful to certain P.A.P. chaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. resigned, they knew that even if\r\n\r\nall the Right-wing reactionary group lined up to go\r\n\r\nand  fight the P.A.P. in the general election,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would  come to power, and  afterwards  they\r\n\r\nwould not be able to sit in the City Council.  They\r\n\r\nknew  that  their only chance was  during  the  two\r\n\r\nmonths' time when they could do whatever they liked\r\n\r\nin  the  name of democracy, in the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and even in the name of God. And  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  they  did.  They expected  this  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had clearly stated its policy that whatever\r\n\r\ndecisions  made by the remaining Councillors  would\r\n\r\nbe  rescinded by the P.A.P. if they formed the next\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  will see that  all  contracts  and\r\n\r\nagreements  which they made and which went  against\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s decision are rescinded. And this Bill\r\n\r\nis  particularly  aimed  at  those  agreements  and\r\n\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, my point of view concerning this Bill\r\n\r\nis this. We positively support this Bill. There are\r\n\r\ntwo  important points in this Bill. When the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nCouncillors  were  not  in the  City  Council,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Councillors used  their  time  to  make\r\n\r\nirresponsible  contracts. Mr Speaker,  politically\r\n\r\nand  socially, it may be different. In the  present\r\n\r\nsociety, according to the P.A.P. point of view,  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  some just and fair work. Some  previous\r\n\r\nCouncillors  in  the  City Council  had  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical  points of view which are different  from\r\n\r\nours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Government was responsible for the rich\r\n\r\npeople to become richer and for the poor people  to\r\n\r\nbecome  poorer.  This  kind  of  society  and  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon  have been the same for the past  years.\r\n\r\nBut   our  Party  wants  to  reform  this  society.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I say we want to rescind the actions and\r\n\r\ncontracts made by the previous Councillors or  made\r\n\r\nwith  the  capitalists.  For  example,  about   the\r\n\r\nelectricity charges paid by the cinema owners.  The\r\n\r\npoor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  have to pay 20 cents per unit. But for  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists,   the  rich  people,   who   use   the\r\n\r\nelectricity to earn money, they get lower  charges.\r\n\r\nIs this reasonable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, therefore, I say that a Party which is for the welfare of the poor people should\r\n\r\nrescind  the  previous contracts made by  the  non-P.A.P.  Councillors. This is what we P.A.P. should\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, I wish all\r\n\r\nhon. Members will stretch their imagination back to\r\n\r\nthe  six weeks of the circus in the Tang Peng  Yeu-Vasagar  Council  when it was at  its  full  swing.\r\n\r\nImagine  there  was a roster system of  work  among\r\n\r\nthese  ex-Councillors and each one  took  turns  to\r\n\r\nsign as Chairman of the City Council! They occupied\r\n\r\nthe  former  Mayor's room, did full time  work  and\r\n\r\nsigned as Chairman of the Council, instructing  the\r\n\r\nformer Mayor's staff and behaving exactly like  the\r\n\r\nMayor!  Mr  Speaker,  this is  to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nremnants  of this Council in those six  weeks  were\r\n\r\nnot  acting bona fide. They were not acting in good\r\n\r\nfaith.  We are not going to rescind those decisions\r\n\r\nwhich  in  the  usual course of events  go  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the Committees for approval and  which\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with these Councillors. We  are\r\n\r\ngoing to consider only those decisions taken by the\r\n\r\nCouncil  which were either made for party  politics\r\n\r\nor  in  which  vested interests were involved.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill has mentioned  just  now  in\r\n\r\npassing  (not in discussing the Bill but in raising\r\n\r\ncertain queries) electricity tariffs. For the  past\r\n\r\nmany years - during which the Member for Farrer Park,\r\n\r\nI regret to say, was not in full charge, but he was\r\n\r\nabetting  the decadent old Council - the old  Council\r\n\r\nhad been charging the ordinary consumer 20 cents  a\r\n\r\nunit for lighting and 6 cents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  unit  for power. The cinema magnates  obtained\r\n\r\nbetween  three  and four cents per  unit  both  for\r\n\r\nlighting and for power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill was, like any other\r\n\r\nconsumer, paying 20 cents a unit for lighting and 6\r\n\r\ncents   a   unit   for   his  air-conditioner   and\r\n\r\nrefrigerator. But not so the cinema magnates.  They\r\n\r\npay  between three and five cents, depending  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain formula per unit both for lighting and  for\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to the polls during the City Council\r\n\r\nelections, we explained to the people the principle\r\n\r\nof discriminatory tariff. The old decadent Council,\r\n\r\nof which the Member for Farrer Park was not in full\r\n\r\ncharge  but  was only a symbol, had also  practised\r\n\r\nthe  principle of discriminatory tariff.  The  poor\r\n\r\npay  more  and the rich pay less. We also  believe,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  in  the principle of  discriminatory\r\n\r\ntariff. We believe the rich should pay more and the\r\n\r\npoor should pay less. So as a start we reduced  the\r\n\r\nelectricity tariff for those poor people  consuming\r\n\r\nelectricity under 20 units per month from 20  cents\r\n\r\nto  12 cents, and later those over 20 units from 20\r\n\r\ncents  to  18  cents. This was to help the  150,000\r\n\r\nconsumers  in Singapore. But, Mr Speaker,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, we do not only rectify the anomalies in\r\n\r\nthe  case of the big cinema magnates by making them\r\n\r\npay  the  same as the 150,000 other consumers  pay,\r\n\r\nbut  we  admit the fact that we have made them  pay\r\n\r\nmuch  more than the ordinary consumer who  pays  18\r\n\r\ncents, some 12 cents for lighting, while they  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  20 cents. The ordinary consumer  like  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill pays six cents for  his  air-conditioner  and refrigerator, while they  have  to\r\n\r\npay  20  cents. Mr Speaker, every economist agrees\r\n\r\nthat  taxation  must be based on the  principle  of\r\n\r\nability  to pay, and since the old Council did  not\r\n\r\nnegate  the principle of discriminatory  tariff  by\r\n\r\nexploiting  the poor to benefit the rich,  we  also\r\n\r\ndid  not negate the principle of taxing the rich  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit more in order to benefit the poor.  And\r\n\r\nso in October\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1958,  we decided to charge the cinema magnates  20\r\n\r\ncents a unit both for lighting and for power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have done some costing. All this is a little irrelevant to the Bill, but since the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill has brought it up, I think  I\r\n\r\nshould reply. We have done some costing and it only\r\n\r\ncosts  the  cinema magnate an extra five  cents  in\r\n\r\ncost  for a $3 seat, leaving him $2.95 to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of his expenses. We think this  is  very\r\n\r\nfair. Now, Mr Speaker, what this Bill purports  to\r\n\r\ndeal  today  is  with this particular  instance  of\r\n\r\ncinema  tariffs;  to  restore the  status  quo,  to\r\n\r\nrevert  back to the position which we think  is  of\r\n\r\nbenefit to the people. In this particular case,  it\r\n\r\namounts  to  this.  In  the  other  case  which   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now, it was only to  prevent,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  loss  of a  quarter  of  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars   in   public  funds  perhaps  going   into\r\n\r\nsomebody's pockets. Now, Mr Speaker, the role of a\r\n\r\ngood, honest and efficient government is to restore\r\n\r\nall those things which are beneficial to the nation\r\n\r\nas  a  whole.  And  in  this particular  case,  the\r\n\r\nChairman of our Party has given due warning. In The\r\n\r\nSunday  Standard  of the 19th  of  April  in  block\r\n\r\nletters, Dr Toh said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"We like to remind the Chief Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficer and the Minister for Local Government, Dato\r\n\r\nAbdul  Hamid,  that  they will be  held  personally\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   any  act  committed   in   this\r\n\r\ninterregnum  which  is detrimental  to  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also warned that the next Government would\r\n\r\n\"rescind  and reverse any decision or action  which\r\n\r\nis not in the people's interest\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have given due warning. In a company when most of the members of the Board of\r\n\r\nDirectors  have for some reason or other gone,  and\r\n\r\nhave  given due warning that anybody who buys goods\r\n\r\nstolen   by  the  store-keepers  could  have   full\r\n\r\nrestitution  in  Court, then,  Mr  Speaker,  those\r\n\r\npersons  who  buy stolen beer or stolen  cigarettes\r\n\r\ncould have their benefits restituted, and the Board\r\n\r\nof Directors who represent the shareholders (and in\r\n\r\nthis  case  represent the people) could have  every\r\n\r\nright  to  seek  restitution.  This  is  fully   in\r\n\r\nconformity  with justice and the theory of  British\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Eng Guan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the explanatory statement to this Bill shows,\r\n\r\nthe purpose of this Bill is three-fold. Clause 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  merely seeks to regularise what  is  the\r\n\r\npresent  procedure of the Board of Film Censors  in\r\n\r\nthe  matter of censoring duplicate films. The Board\r\n\r\nhas,  since the war, been regarding 16 m.m. and  8\r\n\r\nm.m. copies of censored 35 m.m. films and  8  m.m.\r\n\r\ncopies  of 16 m.m. censored films as duplicates  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect and has authorised screening of these\r\n\r\nduplicates  without  viewing  by  the  Board.  This\r\n\r\npractice,  however, is not strictly in accord  with\r\n\r\nsection  16  of  the  Ordinance  which  requires  a\r\n\r\nduplicate to be identical in detail, subject matter\r\n\r\nand  footage. A 16 m.m. film is, however, only one-third the length of an otherwise identical 35  m.m.\r\n\r\nfilm,   and  an  8  m.m. film  is  proportionately\r\n\r\nshorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, therefore, repeals and re-enacts section\r\n\r\n16  of  the Cinematograph Films Ordinance to enable\r\n\r\ncopies  of  different  sizes  to  be  regarded   as\r\n\r\nduplicates     for    purposes    of    censorship.\r\n\r\nAdministrative arrangements preclude the chances of\r\n\r\nevading censorship of duplicate films. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nyou  will note also that a proviso is added to this\r\n\r\nclause which prohibits a larger size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncopy  to  be regarded as a duplicate of  a  smaller\r\n\r\nsize  censored film. The reason is obvious  and  is\r\n\r\nmeant  to  prevent the evasion of proper censorship\r\n\r\nfees which are based on footage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second object of this Bill is to reconstitute\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Appeal and this is provided for in\r\n\r\nclause 3 of the Bill. The Committee of Appeal of 17\r\n\r\nmembers, as constituted by the existing section  21\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance, hardly exists at the moment  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the main reason for the urgency  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  There have been a number of vacancies  since\r\n\r\n7th  January this year. The abolition of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  which  appoints three  members,  and  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board, which appoints one member, has  added\r\n\r\nto  the  number of vacancies. In the light  of  new\r\n\r\nconstitutional  changes, this Government  considers\r\n\r\nthat  the composition of this Committee should  now\r\n\r\nbe  revised  and that it would be more  appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  all appointments to this Committee should  be\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Minister. Clause 3 therefore proposes\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a Committee of Appeal of nine\r\n\r\nmembers, including a Chairman and Vice-Chairman  to\r\n\r\nbe  appointed  by  the  Minister  annually.  It  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary and unwieldy to have a large  Committee\r\n\r\nlike  the previous one. A small Committee  will  be\r\n\r\nmore   effective  in  carrying  out   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  on film censorship  which  is\r\n\r\npart and parcel of the anti-yellow culture movement\r\n\r\ninitiated by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice in the past to permit\r\n\r\nexhibition of films whose underlying purpose is  to\r\n\r\nimpress  on  the subject peoples their  inferiority\r\n\r\nand  inadequacy. Films such as \"The Four  Feathers\"\r\n\r\nand  the numerous westerns showing the massacre  of\r\n\r\nthe  Red  Indians  by  the white  men  are  typical\r\n\r\nexamples. The P.A.P. Government has no wish to  see\r\n\r\nits  people conditioned to enjoy films which depict\r\n\r\ntheir  degradation. Hence early last month,  a  new\r\n\r\ndirective  was issued to the Board of Film  Censors\r\n\r\nthat   all  films  whose  primary  intent  is   the\r\n\r\nglorification or justification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonialism or which are calculated to bring Asians\r\n\r\nand   so-called  coloured  peoples  generally  into\r\n\r\ncontempt, ridicule and hatred should be banned.  In\r\n\r\nthese   days   of   national   awakening,   it   is\r\n\r\nparticularly important for the Government to  bring\r\n\r\nto our people a new sense of dignity and work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, over the last few years, there have been an alarming increase in sex crimes, assaults,\r\n\r\nextortions  and  murders. The well-informed  public\r\n\r\nand  the  law officers have repeatedly pointed  out\r\n\r\nthe  evil  influences  of  publications  and  films\r\n\r\nexhorting violence and sex in its debased  form  on\r\n\r\nthe young population. The colonial governments, and\r\n\r\nparticularly the Government led by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill opposite me, have completely ignored  the\r\n\r\nwarnings  of  the  public. No  one  can  deny  that\r\n\r\nwidespread publications and the screening of  films\r\n\r\nwhich emphasise sex, brutality and gangsterism over\r\n\r\nthe   years  have  left  a  lasting  mark  on   the\r\n\r\nimpressionable  youth  of today  and  the  mounting\r\n\r\nwaves  of crime lately involving a large number  of\r\n\r\nteen-age youths are a clear indication of the evils\r\n\r\nof   yellow  culture.  The  new  Government  cannot\r\n\r\ntolerate  this state of affairs to continue.  While\r\n\r\nthe  Board  of  Film  Censors is  well  advised  to\r\n\r\nimplement the directives of the Government on  film\r\n\r\ncensorship,  a  properly  constituted  Film  Appeal\r\n\r\nCommittee could assist tremendously in interpreting\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the Government. It is expected  that\r\n\r\nas film censorship is tightened in the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  people, there will be many appeals before  the\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Further,  the  reconstituted  Committee\r\n\r\nwill  have  to review many of the films  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  passed  before. A shorter term of  office  as\r\n\r\nproposed  would  also  enable more  public-spirited\r\n\r\npersons   to  become  members  of  this   Committee\r\n\r\nalthough  annual appointment does not preclude  re-appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third object of the Bill is contained in\r\n\r\nclause 4 which gives power to the Minister to  make\r\n\r\nregulations which include especially the  power  to\r\n\r\nimpose  film  quotas requiring or  restricting  the\r\n\r\nshowing of certain specified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses  of films or films originating from certain\r\n\r\nspecified countries of origin. The introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis  provision  makes it possible  to  repeal  the\r\n\r\nBritish Cinematograph Films Proclamation No. 54  of\r\n\r\n1946  (which  is  still and is the  last  remaining\r\n\r\nBritish Military Administration Proclamation to  be\r\n\r\nin  force)  and which prescribes, inter alia,  that\r\n\r\nall  first  and second run cinemas showing  English\r\n\r\nlanguage  films for more than 50 per cent of  their\r\n\r\nscreening time should devote ten per cent of  their\r\n\r\ntime to British made films. Although clauses 4  and\r\n\r\n5 provide for the power to make regulations and the\r\n\r\nrepeal  of the Proclamation, the intention is  that\r\n\r\nthese  clauses will not be brought into force until\r\n\r\nthe Government has considered in greater detail the\r\n\r\nquestion  of quotas, the requirements of the  local\r\n\r\nfilm   industry  and  the  regulations  which   are\r\n\r\nrequired.  As the House will observe, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nclause  1  provides for different sections  of  the\r\n\r\nBill to be brought into force separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  my colleague, the Hon. Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs, has already indicated to  the  House\r\n\r\nthe  desirability that certain amendments  must  be\r\n\r\nmade  to the exhibition of films in public. I would\r\n\r\nlike to add this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can amuse oneself either in the home or\r\n\r\noutside  the home. In Singapore in particular,  the\r\n\r\nsources  of  entertainment and amusement  are  very\r\n\r\nlimited and the cinema forms an important source of\r\n\r\nentertainment  for  the public;  but  it  would  be\r\n\r\nfoolish  for us to consider the cinema purely  from\r\n\r\nthe  entertainment  point  of  view.  We  all  must\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that  among  the  powerful  media   of\r\n\r\npropaganda we have besides the newspapers and other\r\n\r\nliterature,  the  cinema  too  constitutes  a  very\r\n\r\neffective medium of propaganda - in fact, I would say\r\n\r\na very important medium for conditioning. Memory or\r\n\r\nability to remember things depends on what we hear,\r\n\r\nsee  and feel. It is on these three sensations that\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremember  our  surroundings and also through  these\r\n\r\nthree different stimuli that it is possible for  us\r\n\r\nto  be  conditioned  to adopt  certain  behavioural\r\n\r\nattitudes. Our exhibitors should note in particular\r\n\r\nclause  4  of the Bill which the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs is introducing today, and that is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that all cinemas or any class of cinema shall\r\n\r\nshow  not  less  than  the prescribed  number  or\r\n\r\nprescribed  proportion of films  of  a  specified\r\n\r\nclass...\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  here I come to the very point which I wish  to\r\n\r\nbring out before the House:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or from a specified country of origin;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You  must admit that a very large proportion of the\r\n\r\nfilms  that are exhibited in public come  from  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States - Hollywood in particular.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese films have a certain educational value in the\r\n\r\nsense that they tend to bring out the background of\r\n\r\nthe  social life in the United States. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  a large number of films too have very little\r\n\r\nto teach the sociologists, because many of them are\r\n\r\nbased  on impossible events, romance, and so on.  I\r\n\r\ndo   not  say  that  all  those  who  go  to   seek\r\n\r\nentertainment are those who go to the cinemas to be\r\n\r\neducated.  I do not claim that we must be  prudish;\r\n\r\nwe  should acknowledge that when a film is suitably\r\n\r\npresented  it is not wise that it should be  banned\r\n\r\nor forbidden from screening purely because it comes\r\n\r\nfrom some particular country. What I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  is  this - that we all know that 50 per cent  of\r\n\r\nour population today are 19 years and under and  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  make a poll of those who  go  to  the\r\n\r\ncinemas, it would not be surprising to find that  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of the cinema audience come from  the\r\n\r\nteenagers.  In  fact,  our cinema  exhibitors  have\r\n\r\nexploited this point so that you have day shows not\r\n\r\nonly  during the weekends but also during weekdays,\r\n\r\nparticularly during school holidays. When films are\r\n\r\nscreened  at such times, the audience  is  not  the\r\n\r\nadult  working  population but it is  the  youthful\r\n\r\npopulation  who have left school and  who  have  no\r\n\r\nother  alternative to occupy themselves. So  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant, Mr Speaker, that what our youth see  or\r\n\r\nhear  should  be  such  that  they  should  not  be\r\n\r\nconditioned to imitate characters that are depicted\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  films. In the past, or even recently,  quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable  glorification has been  built  around\r\n\r\nyouthful film stars like the late James Dean and so\r\n\r\non and so forth. They depicted the youth as heroes,\r\n\r\nalthough  many of these heroes have, in the  films,\r\n\r\ntaken  on  the  role of an anti-social  element.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say, Mr Speaker, that part of the  reaction\r\n\r\nwhich  we see among our youth today derives  partly\r\n\r\nfrom  what  they  see in the films.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nthere  is the feeling among our youth that,  unless\r\n\r\nhe challenges his companion to be brave, to carry a\r\n\r\ndagger, or to perform some villainous deed, he is a\r\n\r\nchicken.  That,  Mr Speaker  is  not  apt  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety;  it is quite contrary to our cultures  and\r\n\r\nour customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this purpose that the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs   is  giving  fair  warning  to  our   film\r\n\r\nexhibitors  in  Singapore - that  while  they  cannot\r\n\r\npurely  exhibit films solely for profit, they  must\r\n\r\nconsider the effects of such films on our youth; in\r\n\r\nother words, cinemas have a very important function\r\n\r\nto play in our lives and our exhibitors should take\r\n\r\nan  important note that cinemas form  not  only  an\r\n\r\nimportant   medium  for  propaganda  but   a   very\r\n\r\nimportant stimulus for conditioning. We would  then\r\n\r\nadvise  our exhibitors not to confine the screening\r\n\r\nof  films  only  to those which are exclusively  or\r\n\r\nvery largely made in one country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, next to sight, we have sound as a very important stimulus for conditioning. In these\r\n\r\ndays of talkie films, the dialogue that we hear  in\r\n\r\na cinema is equally important to the senses. In the\r\n\r\nold  days when we had silent films, we were  solely\r\n\r\ndependent on vision and the ability to read, and to\r\n\r\nunderstand  what  was going on. But  with  dialogue\r\n\r\nbeing  introduced into films, it is important  that\r\n\r\nwhat  is  said should come under the close scrutiny\r\n\r\nof the censors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, I would like to add that it\r\n\r\nis  not  the  intention of our Government  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  act  as prudes, or that we wish to  control\r\n\r\nthe  thought  of our people. On the other  hand,  I\r\n\r\nwould   say  that  democracy  or  the  liberty   in\r\n\r\nscreening films would be totally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabused  if  there  were also no discipline  imposed\r\n\r\nupon this liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was listening to the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister with great interest, but it seemed  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  possibly he was going a little far away  from\r\n\r\nthe  Bill itself.

The  film\r\n\r\nindustry  is important for the country's education.\r\n\r\nIn   Singapore  in  the  past,  our  cinemas   were\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the  colonialists.  In  a  colonial\r\n\r\ncountry,  the people were subjected to the thoughts\r\n\r\nand  emotions  of the rulers. But  in  our  country\r\n\r\ntoday  this new Government has appointed  the  Film\r\n\r\nAppeal Committee for the purpose of controlling the\r\n\r\nfilm  industry, as against the Board  appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe Government previously. The film industry should\r\n\r\nbe  controlled  by the Ministers  of  the  people's\r\n\r\nGovernment, and this amending Bill is to meet  that\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that films have an educational\r\n\r\nvalue for the people of Singapore. We know that the\r\n\r\npast  colonial rulers colonialised us  through  the\r\n\r\nmedium of films - conditioned our thoughts so that we\r\n\r\nwere  without  self-respect, like colonial  people.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  old Government, we saw that  the  films\r\n\r\nexhibited  in Singapore were imported  from  Japan,\r\n\r\nHongkong or America. Those films were yellow films,\r\n\r\nsensational,  and  they  also  depicted  forms   of\r\n\r\nslavery,  shall we say. The present Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  that  it should control the film  industry\r\n\r\nfor  the sake of the people in Singapore. The  film\r\n\r\nindustry should not be controlled by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeigners.

In his speech the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said (I will quote him):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No legislation for minimum wages or benefits or\r\n\r\nworking   conditions  can  be  as   effective   and\r\n\r\nefficient   in   protecting   the   workers    from\r\n\r\nexploitation by bad employers as a good  union.  It\r\n\r\nis   the  right  of  the  workers  to  protect  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  their position by organising themselves\r\n\r\ninto  unions. And a P.A.P. government will  do  its\r\n\r\nutmost   to  facilitate  the  workers  to  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves  into  unions.

This  Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to  implement  the declared  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It will, as stated in the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement, enable the Registrar of Trade Unions  to\r\n\r\ncancel  the  registration of  yellow  and  splinter\r\n\r\nunions, and also to refuse to register such unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my duty now to point out\r\n\r\nthe trends which appear to have been overlooked  by\r\n\r\nthe previous Government. For years there has been a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  increase in the number of small  unions\r\n\r\nof employees or rival unions of employees, with the\r\n\r\nresult  that we have reached an unhealthy state  of\r\n\r\naffairs: too many small unions of employees in this\r\n\r\nsmall  island State of Singapore. Whilst the number\r\n\r\nof   small   unions  was  increasing,   the   total\r\n\r\nmembership was decreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer to extracts\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Labour  Department  Reports  which  were\r\n\r\npublished  year  by year from 1955 to  1958.  These\r\n\r\nreports  were published by the previous Government,\r\n\r\nand  it  appears to me, as I shall show later,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   that  the  same  Government   that   was\r\n\r\nproducing  these reports never took the trouble  to\r\n\r\nknow what they contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position as given in the 1954 Report was\r\n\r\nthat  there  were 136 unions in that  year  with  a\r\n\r\ntotal  membership of 76,452. If we turn to page  10\r\n\r\nof  the 1955 Labour Department Report, we see  this\r\n\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The growth of trade unions in the Colony during\r\n\r\nthe  year  was marked in the number of  unions,  in\r\n\r\nunion  membership  and  in union  activities.  More\r\n\r\nsmall  unions of clerical as well as manual workers\r\n\r\ncame  into  existence to heighten  further  rivalry\r\n\r\namong themselves and with general unions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to that report, the number of\r\n\r\nregistered  unions  of  employees  in   that   year\r\n\r\nincreased  from 136 to 187, while their  membership\r\n\r\nincreased  from 76,452 to 139,317.  Table  XXXI  of\r\n\r\nthat same report shows the breakdown. There were 20\r\n\r\nunions in 1955 with a membership of under 50. There\r\n\r\nwere  71  unions with a membership ranging from  50\r\n\r\nand  under  250; 68 with a membership ranging  from\r\n\r\n250  and  under 1,000; 25 with a membership ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  1,000  and  under 5,000;  one  union  with  a\r\n\r\nmembership ranging from 5,000 and under 10,000; and\r\n\r\n2  unions with a membership ranging from 10,000  or\r\n\r\nmore, making the total for 1955, 187 unions with  a\r\n\r\nmembership of 139,317, an increase over the figures\r\n\r\nfor 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we turn to pages 12 and 13 of the Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment Report for 1956, we see this note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The general tendency to form small unions\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  prevail.

The attempts at amalgamation begun in 1956 by\r\n\r\nthe  bus  and Harbour Board workers unions  fizzled\r\n\r\nout during that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employees unions in that year rose\r\n\r\nfrom  205 to 216, but the aggregate membership fell\r\n\r\nfrom 157,216 to 140,710.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table XXXIV of the 1957 Report gives the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  for that year: 20 unions with  under  50\r\n\r\n(there  were  22  in the previous  year);  81  with\r\n\r\nmemberships  ranging  from  50  to  250;  85   with\r\n\r\nmemberships  ranging from 250  to  1,000;  27  with\r\n\r\nmemberships  ranging from 1,000 to  5,000;  2  with\r\n\r\nmemberships  ranging from 5,000 and  under  10,000;\r\n\r\nand  one with a membership ranging from 10,000  and\r\n\r\nabove, so that the position was: 216 unions with  a\r\n\r\nmembership  of 140,710. That means a membership  of\r\n\r\n17,000 less than the year before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to refer you now to the 1958 Labour Department Annual Report, at pages 17\r\n\r\nand 18:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The tendency to form small unions continued in\r\n\r\n1958.  Out of the 18 unions of employees registered\r\n\r\nduring the year, 11 had a membership of 50 or less,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  rest varied from 68 to  350.  One  more\r\n\r\nunion  of  general employees came  into  existence,\r\n\r\nthereby increasing the number of such unions  to  6\r\n\r\nin the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were reports that several unions\r\n\r\nwere  considering amalgamation, by the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear  only one application for amalgamation of  two\r\n\r\nunions was received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that year the number of unions of employees\r\n\r\nincreased  from  216  to 218, but  their  aggregate\r\n\r\nmembership fell from 140,710 to 129,159.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the drop, Mr Speaker, Sir. From 157,000\r\n\r\nto  140,000  to 129,000 and the numbers  of  unions\r\n\r\nincreased from. 205 to 216 to 218.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown is also given for that year: 24\r\n\r\nunions  with  a membership of under 50;  84  unions\r\n\r\nwith a membership ranging from 50 to 250; 83 unions\r\n\r\nwith  a  membership ranging from 250 to  1,000;  24\r\n\r\nunions  with  a  membership ranging from  1,000  to\r\n\r\n5,000;  2  unions  with a membership  ranging  from\r\n\r\n5,000  to  10,000; and one union with a  membership\r\n\r\nranging from 10,000 and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to 1959. According to the Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment  monthly  report  there  were   on   the\r\n\r\nregister  on the 31st May this year, 226 unions  of\r\n\r\nemployees,  with  a  total membership  of  134,650.\r\n\r\nThere  were  also in the hands of the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  as  on the 31st May  this  year,  11\r\n\r\napplications for the registration of new unions  of\r\n\r\nemployees as on that date. Of these, one has  since\r\n\r\nwithdrawn its application. The membership  of  each\r\n\r\nof  the  remaining  10 unions as  stated  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective  applications is as follows:  one  union\r\n\r\nclaimed  a  membership  of 10  members;  one  union\r\n\r\nclaimed a membership of 11 members; two unions said\r\n\r\nthey  had not more than 30 members each; one  union\r\n\r\nhad a membership of 32; one claimed a membership of\r\n\r\n45   members;  one  a  membership  of  50,  one   a\r\n\r\nmembership  of  80,  and  two  unions  said   their\r\n\r\nmembership did not exceed 154 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given you a very\r\n\r\ndetailed  statement regarding the position  in  all\r\n\r\nthese   unions.  This  information  gives  a  clear\r\n\r\npicture   based  on  figures  and  facts   of   the\r\n\r\ncontinuous growth of the number of small unions  of\r\n\r\nemployees  during  the  last  4\ufffd  years,  causing\r\n\r\nrivalry  among  the registered unions  and  acting,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   against  the  general   interest   of\r\n\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now, Mr Speaker, Sir, come to the case of\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions.  I shall now  proceed  to  prove,\r\n\r\nagain  giving  figures and stating  facts,  that  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of these unions are splinter  unions,\r\n\r\ni.e. the unions that I have just been referring to.\r\n\r\nLet me give the House a few illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1947, there has been in existence a\r\n\r\nregistered trade union which caters for coffee-shop\r\n\r\nemployees. At the beginning of 1956, a small  union\r\n\r\nalso  claiming  to  cater for employees  of  coffee\r\n\r\nshops   suddenly  sprang  into  existence.  It   is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to note that the title  of  the  small\r\n\r\nunion  closely  followed  that  of  the  employers'\r\n\r\nassociation,   which   the  coffee-shop   employers\r\n\r\nthemselves  had  just  formed  less  than  a  month\r\n\r\nbefore.  Among  the  seven  persons  who  made  the\r\n\r\napplication for registration of the small union was\r\n\r\nthe  ex-president  of  the  registered  coffee-shop\r\n\r\nunion.  At the time of its registration, the  small\r\n\r\nunion  claimed to have a membership of 100,  whilst\r\n\r\nthe  registered union had a membership of 1,280.  A\r\n\r\nnumber  of  the  ex-officers of the  larger  union,\r\n\r\nprobably  because  they  were  not  re-elected   to\r\n\r\noffice,  have since joined this splinter union  and\r\n\r\nare  now  its president, vice-president,  secretary\r\n\r\nand treasurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out to me that if the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  had the power to examine  the  books  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  their  employers, he would most  probably\r\n\r\ndiscover that many of these union officials in  one\r\n\r\nway   or  another  have  some  interest  in   their\r\n\r\nemployers' shops. Even today, the membership of the\r\n\r\nlarger  union is many times more than that  of  the\r\n\r\nsplinter union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 1949, one of the officers of a\r\n\r\ncertain  registered  Chinese  Seamen's  Union   was\r\n\r\nconvicted  and  sentenced to six  months'  rigorous\r\n\r\nimprisonment  on  a  charge of criminal  breach  of\r\n\r\ntrust  of union funds. Some years later, this  same\r\n\r\nman formed yet another Chinese seafarers' union and\r\n\r\nhad   it  registered.  He  is  now  the  registered\r\n\r\nsecretary  of this union. Under the existing  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Ordinance, the Registrar has  no  power  to\r\n\r\nrefuse to register a union with such an undesirable\r\n\r\nperson as an official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in 1956, a Chinese union claiming to cater\r\n\r\nfor  hair-dressers with only 40 members  came  into\r\n\r\nexistence.  There  was  at  that  time  already  in\r\n\r\nexistence  a registered trade union of many  years'\r\n\r\nstanding  catering for the same class  of  workers.\r\n\r\nThree of the seven persons who made the application\r\n\r\nfor  registration of the splinter union were former\r\n\r\nofficials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the registered union who were not reelected  to\r\n\r\noffice. Even today, the membership of this splinter\r\n\r\nunion  is  less than 100, while that of  the  older\r\n\r\nestablished union is over 800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a direct result of the ease with which\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions  could be formed  and  registered,\r\n\r\nthere is today in existence in Singapore a total of\r\n\r\neight registered trade unions claiming to cater for\r\n\r\nthe workers in the food catering service alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that a number of\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions have their registered  offices  at\r\n\r\nthe  same address. There are many such unions which\r\n\r\nhave been formed on similar lines at the expense of\r\n\r\nthe   strength  of  the  bargaining  power  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting unions. But I do not think it necessary to\r\n\r\nwaste  the  time  of  this  House  by  giving  more\r\n\r\ndetails.  I  will now come to the case of  seamen's\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be interested to know\r\n\r\nthat among the 10 applications for the registration\r\n\r\nof new unions which I refered to earlier, and which\r\n\r\nare  still  pending,  two  of  them,  one  with   a\r\n\r\nmembership   of  50  and  another  with   30,   are\r\n\r\napplications to form unions to cater for seamen and\r\n\r\nmaritime  officers. These applications to  register\r\n\r\nnew  seamen's unions have been made in spite of the\r\n\r\nfact that there are already on the register a total\r\n\r\nof  10 registered seamen's unions, two of which are\r\n\r\nexclusively for maritime officers and the remainder\r\n\r\nfor  seamen. The 10 seamen's unions at  present  on\r\n\r\nthe  register  do  not include the  three  seamen's\r\n\r\nunions  and  two  maritime  officers'  unions,  the\r\n\r\ncertificates of registration of which have  already\r\n\r\nbeen cancelled by the Registrar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come now, Mr Speaker, to the case of the\r\n\r\nteachers'   unions.   Of   the   remaining    eight\r\n\r\napplications this year, three are to form unions to\r\n\r\ncater  for  teachers of one category or other.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  application  is  to  form  a  union  for  10\r\n\r\nteachers,  the second for 30 and the third  for  11\r\n\r\nteachers.  Meanwhile,  there  are  already  on  the\r\n\r\nregister 18 registered trade unions catering for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers of various categories. This number  of  18\r\n\r\nregistered  teachers' unions  does  not  include  a\r\n\r\nregistered  trade union, which although  it  caters\r\n\r\nfor  other  employees, has rules permitting  it  to\r\n\r\nenrol   teachers   as   members.   Of   the   three\r\n\r\napplications  to  form  new teachers'  unions,  one\r\n\r\nopenly admitted that it was to be a splinter  union\r\n\r\nfor teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come, Mr Speaker, to the position of\r\n\r\ngeneral unions. As on the 27th of May, 1959,  there\r\n\r\nwas  on  the  register  a  total  of  eight  unions\r\n\r\ncatering for general workers. With the exception of\r\n\r\ntwo,  which could claim to have some thousands  of\r\n\r\nmembers  each,  the rest have only  a  few  members\r\n\r\neach.   Mind  you,  they  call  themselves  general\r\n\r\nunions.  One of these general unions can  claim  to\r\n\r\nhave only 12 members, and another only 11. Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  general unions were registered between  June\r\n\r\n1955  and  February this year.  Among  the  10  new\r\n\r\napplications for registration this year,  there  is\r\n\r\none   applying  for  registration  of  yet  another\r\n\r\ngeneral  union. From its proposed rules,  a  person\r\n\r\nholding an administrative or managerial post  in  a\r\n\r\nshop  can  also  be enrolled as a  member  of  this\r\n\r\ngeneral  union. This general union is too obviously\r\n\r\na yellow union to deceive anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my association with\r\n\r\nGovernment unions, I found that there are  splinter\r\n\r\nunions  amongst  Government employees  as  well.  I\r\n\r\nremember   a  time  when  the  head  teachers   got\r\n\r\ndisgruntled.  They  broke away from  the  teachers'\r\n\r\nunion  and  formed themselves into a head teachers'\r\n\r\nassociation and had it registered as a trade union.\r\n\r\nWe  had  to do something about it, Sir. The Whitley\r\n\r\nCouncil  decided that they were not going to  allow\r\n\r\nany   splinter  union  to  participate  in  Whitley\r\n\r\nCouncil  procedure,  and  it  passed  a  resolution\r\n\r\nexcluding the splinter union from participation  in\r\n\r\nthe  Whitley system. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will  pass\r\n\r\nnow  from  splinter unions to the  case  of  yellow\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undesirability and, in fact, the danger of\r\n\r\nthe  existence of yellow unions was fully  revealed\r\n\r\nby the events of the Hock Lee Bus incident in early\r\n\r\n1955,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  was  sparked  off by the  formation  by  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of a yellow union known as the Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nBus    Employees   Union.   Thank   God,   on   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the arbitrator of the  Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nBus  dispute,  this yellow union  dissolved  itself\r\n\r\nvoluntarily, though after much harm had been  done.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I will quote  again  now  from\r\n\r\nparagraphs  1  and  2  of  page  2  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment's monthly report for May, 1955. This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Report  says  about  the  Hock  Lee  Bus\r\n\r\ndispute:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Industrial unrest during the month reached its\r\n\r\nclimax  on  the night of May 12, when violence  and\r\n\r\nrioting which had been worked up over the Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nbus  dispute  broke  out.  A  full  report  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial aspect of this dispute is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Bus Workers' Union for many years\r\n\r\nlimited  to the employees of the Green Bus  Company\r\n\r\nbegan  to extend its activities among other Chinese\r\n\r\nbus  companies in the Colony in the latter half  of\r\n\r\n1954.  Towards the end of February, 1955, a  branch\r\n\r\nof  the  union was established at the Hock Lee  Bus\r\n\r\nCompany,  and it seemed to be generally known  that\r\n\r\nit   would   find  great  difficulty   in   gaining\r\n\r\nrecognition from the management of this company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneous with the establishment of the union\r\n\r\nbranch,  two of the branch officials were dismissed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  company  for reasons, according  to  the\r\n\r\nmanagement,    unconnected   with    trade    union\r\n\r\nactivities.  This blithe assurance  was  of  course\r\n\r\nnever accepted by the Singapore Bus Workers' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, another union was formed known as\r\n\r\nthe  Hock  Lee Bus Employees' Union. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nBus  Workers' Union branded this rival union as  an\r\n\r\nemployers' or yellow union in disguise; whereas the\r\n\r\nmanagement  insisted  that  it  was  a  spontaneous\r\n\r\ncreation by a group of their own workers who viewed\r\n\r\nwith some alarm the irresponsible leadership of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Bus Workers' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fact, however, that supported the suspicions of\r\n\r\nemployer  sponsorship of the Hock Lee  Bus  Company\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union  was  the remarkable  speed  with\r\n\r\nwhich  demands were submitted and agreed to shortly\r\n\r\nafter its formation. On the 4th of March this union\r\n\r\nwrote  to  request a revision of pay and conditions\r\n\r\nof  employment.  On the 5th of  March  a  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors'  meeting  was  held  to  consider  these\r\n\r\ndemands,  and  on  the 6th a reply satisfactory  to\r\n\r\nboth sides was given. The new conditions of service\r\n\r\nwere made effective from the following day, the 7th\r\n\r\nof March.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since my assumption of office,\r\n\r\nnumerous  complaints  have  been  received  by   my\r\n\r\nMinistry   from   trade  unionists  regarding   the\r\n\r\nexistence of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyellow unions. One such union has for years had  an\r\n\r\nundisputed employer as its president. We traced the\r\n\r\nrecords. He has been signing records which  declare\r\n\r\nhim  as an employer. This man, who is an undisputed\r\n\r\nemployer, and several other agents of employees  as\r\n\r\nmembers,   have  decided  that  they   would   pull\r\n\r\nthemselves  out of this union and allow this  union\r\n\r\nto  reorganise itself. The employer and the  agents\r\n\r\nof  employees who used to control this  union  have\r\n\r\nnow expressed their willingness to relinquish their\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the union, and a general meeting  has\r\n\r\nbeen  called recently to elect a new committee from\r\n\r\nan  entirely  new  membership of  workers  hitherto\r\n\r\nuncatered for by this union. In the case of another\r\n\r\nunion  of  employees of restaurants,  some  of  the\r\n\r\nofficials and members of which have openly admitted\r\n\r\nbeing   shareholders  of  employers'   restaurants,\r\n\r\nappropriate  action to cleanse this  union  is  now\r\n\r\nproceeding.  There  is  yet  another   union,   the\r\n\r\npresident  of  which is also an employer.  He  has,\r\n\r\nhowever, recently resigned his office and  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  members  of  this union have  abandoned  their\r\n\r\nmembership and joined another union, the membership\r\n\r\nof which is strictly confined to employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to a clause of the\r\n\r\nBill  which might be criticised by Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition today. And that is clause 5 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nSir, which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"(2) The decision of the Minister on an appeal\r\n\r\nunder  section 16 of this Ordinance shall be  final\r\n\r\nand  shall  not  be  called into  question  in  any\r\n\r\ncourt.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision in the Bill that\r\n\r\nappeals  from the decisions of the Registrar  shall\r\n\r\nbe  heard  by the Minister whose decision shall  be\r\n\r\nfinal and shall not be questioned in any court, may\r\n\r\nbe  argued  to be an infringement of Article  4  of\r\n\r\nConvention   No.  87,  which  is  The  Freedom   of\r\n\r\nAssociation   and   of  The   Right   to   Organise\r\n\r\nConvention,   1948.  This  Article  provides   that\r\n\r\nworkers and employers' organisations shall  not  be\r\n\r\nliable   to   be   dissolved   or   suspended    by\r\n\r\nadministrative authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few months ago the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State  sought  confirmation from  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  the  law in practice here with  regard  to\r\n\r\ntrade unions conformed with the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nConvention  and with the provisions  of  Convention\r\n\r\nNo.   98,  which  is  The  Right  to  Organise  and\r\n\r\nCollective Bargaining Convention, 1949. In a  reply\r\n\r\nto  the  Secretary  of State, the  last  Government\r\n\r\npointed  out that there were many sections  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  which  infringed\r\n\r\nArticles  2,  3 and 4 of The Freedom of Association\r\n\r\nand  of The Right to Organise Convention 1948,  but\r\n\r\nthat  the law in practice here with regard to trade\r\n\r\nunions was in conformity with The Right to Organise\r\n\r\nand  Collective  Bargaining Convention,  1949.  The\r\n\r\nprevious   Government   replied   that   its   full\r\n\r\nlegislative  programme had unfortunately  prevented\r\n\r\nit  from giving early consideration to measures  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  Trade Unions Ordinance into  conformity\r\n\r\nwith The Freedom of Association and of The Right to\r\n\r\nOrganise Convention, 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, in their reply, the\r\n\r\nprevious Government set out the various sections of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Ordinance - I am not referring  to  the\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill - which conflicted with the provisions\r\n\r\nof  that Convention. The previous Government stated\r\n\r\nthat  the  present sections 14, 15, 26, 28  and  29\r\n\r\nconflicted  with  Article 2 of the  Convention  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Schedule under section 32, and  sections\r\n\r\n38,  39,  40,  41,  42 and 46 conflicted  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Article 3 of the Convention and  that\r\n\r\nsections 16, 17 and 29 (5) conflicted with  Article\r\n\r\n4  of  the Convention. Now for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  Sir,  I will proceed to read the  texts  of\r\n\r\nthese various Articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 2 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that workers and employers without distinction\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  shall have the right to  establish  and\r\n\r\nsubject  only  to  the  rules of  the  organisation\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  join  organisations  of  their   own\r\n\r\nchoosing without previous authorisation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 3 is in two parts. Part I provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that workers and employers' organisations shall\r\n\r\nhave  the right to draw up their constitutions  and\r\n\r\nrules,  to  elect  their  representatives  in  full\r\n\r\nfreedom,  to  organise  their  administrations  and\r\n\r\nactivities and to formulate their programmes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II of Article 3 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that the public authorities shall refrain from\r\n\r\nany interference which would restrict this right or\r\n\r\nimpede the lawful exercise thereof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Article 4 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that workers and employers' organisations shall\r\n\r\nnot  be  liable  to be dissolved  or  suspended  by\r\n\r\nadministrative authority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their reply to the Secretary of State, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, they also said that conditions  were\r\n\r\nnot  suitable  for any change to  be  made  in  the\r\n\r\npresent Ordinance because of the Government's  fear\r\n\r\nof   subversion  and  infiltration  by   subversive\r\n\r\nelements into the union organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, section 16 of the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  provides that appeals from the  decision\r\n\r\nof the Registrar should go to the Minister. I would\r\n\r\nsubmit,  Sir, that this is rightly so  because  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of whether the registration  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  should  be  cancelled  or  withdrawn  is  an\r\n\r\nessentially  executive  act.  The  new   power   of\r\n\r\ncancelling  the registration of yellow or  splinter\r\n\r\nunions  is  one, I submit, Sir, that  can  only  be\r\n\r\nexercised by an executive body. I submit  that  the\r\n\r\nmachinery of the courts is quite unsuitable to deal\r\n\r\nwith  such matters which hinge so much on questions\r\n\r\nof policy and executive action. The Bill therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  seeks to retain the provision for appeals  to\r\n\r\nbe  heard  by the Minister but it seeks to provide,\r\n\r\nas  is usual in other Ordinances, that the decision\r\n\r\nof  the Minister should be final. The purpose, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  frankly  to shut out any appeals to the  court,\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  believes  that  such  matters\r\n\r\ncannot  be  resolved  in  a  court  and  that  such\r\n\r\ndecisions   can   only  be  made  by   a   Minister\r\n\r\nresponsible to the Legislative Assembly and to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate. I am informed, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nalthough under the amendment to section 17  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  appeals to the court will be  shut  out,\r\n\r\nthis   amendment   however  will   not   shut   out\r\n\r\nproceedings by way of certiorari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case where the registration of the\r\n\r\nMalayan  National Seamen's Union was  cancelled  on\r\n\r\nthe grounds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the union had contravened section 44  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   by  failing  to  furnish   within   the\r\n\r\nprescribed  period  annual  returns  in  certiorari\r\n\r\nproceedings, the order of the Registrar  cancelling\r\n\r\nthe union's registration was quashed on the grounds\r\n\r\nthat the notice required for these proceedings fell\r\n\r\nshort  by  one  day  of the period  of  two  months\r\n\r\nstipulated in the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have extracted precedents\r\n\r\nfrom other Ordinances to show that there is nothing\r\n\r\nimproper in the Government seeking powers  to  shut\r\n\r\nout  appeals  to the High Court on the question  of\r\n\r\nthe cancellation of registration or the refusal  to\r\n\r\nregister  a trade union which is either a  splinter\r\n\r\nor  a  yellow  union. In fact, the last  Government\r\n\r\ntook   similar  powers  when  dealing  with   other\r\n\r\nmatters; and I shall now proceed to refer to a  few\r\n\r\nof  the  similar powers which the former Government\r\n\r\ntook  with  regard to other matters.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  Ordinance  No.  40  of  1958  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments   Ordinance   where   there   is   a\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of security, aggrieved persons  have  a\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal  to the Minister  whose  decision\r\n\r\nthereon  shall be final. That is the  provision  of\r\n\r\nsection   11(5)  of  Ordinance  No.  40  of   1958.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  section  13 (3) of the  same  Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides that an applicant aggrieved by the refusal\r\n\r\nof  his  application by the licensing  officer  may\r\n\r\nappeal  in  writing to the Minister whose  decision\r\n\r\nthereon  shall be final. Similarly, with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  cancellation  of  a  licence  under  the  same\r\n\r\nOrdinance - the  Public Entertainments  Ordinance - the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Minister shall be final. Again, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I refer you to the Nursing Homes  and\r\n\r\nMaternity  Homes Registration Ordinance (No.  5  of\r\n\r\n1959)  on  the  question  of  the  refusal  of   an\r\n\r\napplication  and the cancellation of an application\r\n\r\nfor  registration. Section 5 (4) of that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the  Minister's decision  shall  be\r\n\r\nfinal. Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer you  to\r\n\r\nthe  Planning Ordinance (No. 12 of 1959) to section\r\n\r\n13 (2) which deals with the enforcement of planning\r\n\r\ncontrol. That section provides for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeal and the Minister's decision thereon shall be\r\n\r\nfinal.  Similarly,  in the case of  development  of\r\n\r\nland  under the same Planning Ordinance,  there  is\r\n\r\nprovision  for an appeal. Section 14  (3)  provides\r\n\r\nthat the Minister's decision shall be final. And  I\r\n\r\nwould  refer  lastly to the Control of  Manufacture\r\n\r\nOrdinance  (No.  14  of 1958)  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of goods. Section 5 (6) provides  for\r\n\r\nan appeal and the Minister's decision on the appeal\r\n\r\nshall be final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has taken\r\n\r\nthe  stand that the plurality of small trade unions\r\n\r\nwould  work  to  the detriment of the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  as  a  whole. The Government  knows  that\r\n\r\ntrade unions have been fostered by employers - I have\r\n\r\nproduced  all  the  evidence before  this  House - in\r\n\r\norder  that  they  may split the workers  and  that\r\n\r\nthese  unions are used not to strengthen the  cause\r\n\r\nof  workers  but  to  make it easier  for  the  bad\r\n\r\nemployers  to  exploit  the  workers.  The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as has been said before by  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  does  not believe in the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe outward forms of democracy, or in this case the\r\n\r\noutward forms of trade union freedom, if the effect\r\n\r\nis to undermine the real essence of democracy or of\r\n\r\ntrade  union  freedom.  The  Government  does   not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  trade union freedom if it is  used  to\r\n\r\nkill the trade union movement itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in\r\n\r\nagreement with the principles outlined in the Bill,\r\n\r\nbut,  as  the Minister has pointed out,  he  has  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  that  an objection might be taken  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  clause 5 of the  Bill  and  he  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  attempted to reply  in  advance  to  the\r\n\r\nobjection that the Opposition might raise  on  this\r\n\r\nparticular clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I come to this clause, I would like\r\n\r\nto explain why so many trade unions were registered\r\n\r\nin  previous years. The Trade Unions Ordinance  was\r\n\r\npromulgated in 1941 just before the war, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  that  law  any  seven  persons  signing   an\r\n\r\napplication  form to have a trade union  registered\r\n\r\nshall  automatically have the application  approved\r\n\r\nunless the Registrar was satisfied that the objects\r\n\r\nof  the proposed union were not in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe law. The Labour Department even tried to assist\r\n\r\ntrade unions, to make their applications more  easy\r\n\r\nby  having model rules. Therefore, most sponsors of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions who wanted to have their applications\r\n\r\napproved quite quickly just adopted the model rules\r\n\r\nand  in  a  very short time the trade  unions  were\r\n\r\nregistered. I did mention, Sir, during  the  debate\r\n\r\nlast  month, that I had in my mind the same thought\r\n\r\nas  is now stated in this particular Bill, but then\r\n\r\nI  was in the position of having to deny, mostly to\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition, the right to  organise\r\n\r\nnew  trade unions. I felt that it was not  fair  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  the  Government  to  restrict   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of trade unionists. Now in this  desire\r\n\r\nnot   to   hinder  the  activities   of   political\r\n\r\nopponents,  it had also to give way  to,  shall  we\r\n\r\nsay, adventurers of the type that the Minister  had\r\n\r\nmentioned.  If  we were not firm on any  particular\r\n\r\nclass  of sponsors, we should not be firm  at  all.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have all listened to the figures given  by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  in  the  reports  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aware that such a situation was not a good\r\n\r\nthing,  but  then I was mostly guided by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  I  should  not do anything  to  restrict  the\r\n\r\nactivities of political opponents who in their  own\r\n\r\nendeavour desired to form trade unions to work  for\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the Members, and thus we have, shall\r\n\r\nwe say, a very unhappy situation today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that I support the Bill. It is a good\r\n\r\nthing. The Minister has pointed out how he proposes\r\n\r\nto  go  about in the consideration of yellow unions\r\n\r\nor splinter unions. I think the best way to achieve\r\n\r\nthis  is  to  allow the workers a free choice.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has mentioned the question  of  a  ballot\r\n\r\ntaken  of  employees in any particular industry  or\r\n\r\nplace  of  employment - to, give the workers  a  free\r\n\r\nchoice  to decide which particular union they  want\r\n\r\nto represent  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.  That  would make the position  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  a  little bit more tenable. He  need  not\r\n\r\nhave to be faced with a situation whereby two rival\r\n\r\nunions  come to claim his compassion, his sympathy,\r\n\r\nand  his understanding. That is the easiest way  to\r\n\r\ndecide   which   particular   organisation   should\r\n\r\nrepresent the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming now to clause 5. The Minister has\r\n\r\npointed  out that the previous Government had  also\r\n\r\ncontravened certain articles - Articles 2, 3, and,  I\r\n\r\nforgot the other one - and he has therefore said, \"It\r\n\r\nis  quite  all right. What was done previously,  we\r\n\r\nare  continuing  to  do now.\" And  he  also  quoted\r\n\r\ncertain  legislation whereby powers were  given  to\r\n\r\nMinisters to come to decisions which should not  be\r\n\r\nbrought to any Court of Law. Sir, in regard to  the\r\n\r\nother legislation - entertainment, business, and  one\r\n\r\nor  two  other  things - those are not  protected  by\r\n\r\nconventions  of  an international organisation.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case of workers' organisations, there  is  the\r\n\r\nInternational   Labour   Organisation,   of   which\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  member.  Resolutions  adopted  at\r\n\r\nconferences of the I.L.O. are, to a certain extent,\r\n\r\nbinding   on   all  member-countries.   Previously,\r\n\r\nSingapore was a colony and therefore came under the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom delegation. Now that Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nself-governing state, I think Singapore  can  claim\r\n\r\nto  become  a  full  member of the  I.L.O.  And  if\r\n\r\nSingapore were to be a full member of the I.L.O., I\r\n\r\nsubmit   that   Singapore   should   observe    the\r\n\r\nconventions and resolutions which were  adopted  in\r\n\r\nthe interests of the workers. And as the Government\r\n\r\nhas  claimed  that  it  is  a  government  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers, I submit that it would be in keeping  with\r\n\r\ntheir   declaration  if  they   were   to   observe\r\n\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, in dealing with the Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Ordinance, we on this side  are  very  much\r\n\r\nsurprised  that  the  ex-Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare and the present Opposition Members are  all\r\n\r\nagainst  it.

And why did the  past  Government\r\n\r\nnot   change   the  1941  Trade  Unions   Ordinance\r\n\r\nconcerning union by-laws?

And today we\r\n\r\nheard  from the hon. Member for Cairnhill, the  ex-Minister  for  Labour  and  Welfare,  advising  our\r\n\r\npresent  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  that  the\r\n\r\neasiest way is by ballot; it is the only thing. But\r\n\r\nI  would ask him that if he had the same idea, what\r\n\r\nhad  he done when the recommendations of the  Court\r\n\r\nof Inquiry were placed before this Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, on this matter of splinter and yellow\r\n\r\nunions,  since  the publication of this  report,  a\r\n\r\nfurther  two  new  unions in the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard were registered. One is the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  Mechanical Drivers' Union with a  membership\r\n\r\nof  45,  and the ex-Minister for Labour and Welfare\r\n\r\nand  the Registrar of Trade Union know that one day\r\n\r\nor  another a ballot will be taken, and  all  these\r\n\r\nunions would automatically be cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, we find that apart from these\r\n\r\nsplinter  and  yellow  unions,  there  is   another\r\n\r\ncategory   of  such  unions - unions  of  a  communal\r\n\r\nnature.  Communalism  is creeping  into  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement.  There  is the  Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard Malay Employees Union, which is only for  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  We have never heard in trade union history\r\n\r\nthat Malays must have one trade union, Indians must\r\n\r\nhave  one  trade  union, and  so  on  for  Chinese,\r\n\r\nEurasians  and  Europeans. We trade  unionists  are\r\n\r\ninterested  only in one community, a  community  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  The registration of that Malay  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion   has  clearly  violated  the  trade  union's\r\n\r\nfundamental principle, and the past Government  was\r\n\r\neven  willing  to  register this  union  which  was\r\n\r\ncompletely organised on a communal basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nhas  already  explained the  position  of  existing\r\n\r\ntrade  unions in Singapore today and the number  of\r\n\r\nworkers   they   represent.  In  introducing   this\r\n\r\namending Bill, this Government, or the Party  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  intends to have one union for one class  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  so that the unions can face the employers\r\n\r\nas  a  united  body representing all categories  of\r\n\r\nworkers. Thus the unions have more bargaining power\r\n\r\nand   more  strength,  and  the  employers   cannot\r\n\r\nvictimise the unions' active members. The  existing\r\n\r\ntrade  union law in Singapore more or less  follows\r\n\r\nBritish   trade  union  practice - the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill mentioned that seven members can  form  a\r\n\r\nunion!  Why  was the past Government  reluctant  to\r\n\r\ntake  a firm stand in implementing these laws? And,\r\n\r\nhe mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat he wanted his political opponents to form more\r\n\r\nunions  to fight him. Sir, if we draw up a list  of\r\n\r\nall  the small unions registered from 1955 to 1958,\r\n\r\nwe  will  find that none was P.A.P. registered;  it\r\n\r\nwas  the  S.P.A./Labour Fronters.  They  themselves\r\n\r\ninitiated  this because they knew that in Singapore\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  trade unions were powerful, and  in  any\r\n\r\ntrade  union disputes they were not going to follow\r\n\r\nwhat  the past Government was doing in the name  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. And so they thought it was best for them\r\n\r\nto  break  this union, and to find people who  were\r\n\r\nwilling  to  ally with the past Government  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the workers to form splinter  or  yellow\r\n\r\nunions. This is not the P.A.P.'s policy. From  1955\r\n\r\nwe believed that the trade unions should be strong,\r\n\r\nshould  be united, and they should stand  firm  for\r\n\r\nthe rights of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by this law we find that most\r\n\r\nof  the unscrupulous employers took the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  encourage  their  employees  to  form  splinter\r\n\r\nunions. To encourage this, the employers would make\r\n\r\ncertain  promises of jobs to certain employees  and\r\n\r\nthereby  encourage them to form a  union.  And  the\r\n\r\nemployers  knew that such a union would  be  easily\r\n\r\nregistered  without  any  enquiry  whatsoever.  And\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  usually find in Singapore  employers\r\n\r\nwho just stand up and tell the other unions, \"Look,\r\n\r\nwe have a new union registered which represents the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our workers, and I am  not  going  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  your  union.\" So instead  of  the  union\r\n\r\nfighting  against the employer for  better  working\r\n\r\nconditions for its workers, we find (and  this  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  last  four  years)  the   unions\r\n\r\nfighting  one  another, and  the  employers  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage of the situation. And to settle a dispute\r\n\r\nover   which  union  represents  the  majority   of\r\n\r\nworkers,  the  Government either  keeps  silent  or\r\n\r\ncollaborates  with the employers  and  says,  \"This\r\n\r\nsmall   splinter   union  really   represents   the\r\n\r\nworkers.\"  And  this  is  the  root  of   all   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest in Singapore for the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears.  Why?  The hon. Member for Cairnhill  is  so\r\n\r\nafraid that if the Minister were to make a list  of\r\n\r\nall the things which were hidden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  past Government, they might be exposed  to\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore  and  to  the   workers\r\n\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, in certain\r\n\r\nestablishments,   for   example,   the    transport\r\n\r\nindustry, which we shall take as a whole, after the\r\n\r\nHock  Lee  Bus  riots and the leaders  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers  were  detained,  the  past  Government-the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  Government-took advantage of the  situation\r\n\r\nand  encouraged  the formation of one  other  union\r\n\r\nwhich is now considered to be a yellow union, which\r\n\r\nrepresents only two bus companies, that is, the Tay\r\n\r\nKoh  Yat  Bus Company and the Hock Lee Bus Company.\r\n\r\nEvery trade unionist in Singapore and the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore   know  that  the  union  was   purposely\r\n\r\nregistered and encouraged by the past Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say that this Trade Unions (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  is  coming into force, we can  make  it  very\r\n\r\ncertain  and very clear to other trade unions  that\r\n\r\nwhat  the  present Government intends to do  is  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interests of the working class and to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  them  from  exploitation.  When  I   say\r\n\r\nexploitation,   Sir,  there  are   two   kinds   of\r\n\r\nexploitation  in  Singapore at the present  moment.\r\n\r\nThat  is, one is exploitation by the employers  who\r\n\r\ntake   advantage  of  the  situation,  and  second,\r\n\r\nexploitation by the self-styled trade union leaders\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  who,  in  collaboration  with   the\r\n\r\npolitical parties, have from the beginning tried to\r\n\r\nexploit the workers. Because from our experience we\r\n\r\nhave  found out that these trade union leaders have\r\n\r\neither  collaborated with the employers or  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey have shared the profits with the employers who\r\n\r\ndo  not  recognise  the  genuine  registered  trade\r\n\r\nunions in that establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when this law is implemented,\r\n\r\nit  is  quite clear that the employers cannot  play\r\n\r\nany  more  \"divide  and rule\"  tactics  by  saying:\r\n\r\n\"Look,  I  can  only  recognise  that  small  union\r\n\r\nbecause  I like the faces of the leaders. I  cannot\r\n\r\nrecognise your union because you people are  fierce\r\n\r\nand  of  the fighting type. So I cannot sit  around\r\n\r\nthe  table and discuss because all your demands are\r\n\r\nreasonable. I cannot make friends with you  because\r\n\r\nyou are not corrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is a good piece of legislation to tell\r\n\r\nthe  employers:  \"Look, it is  high  time  for  you\r\n\r\npeople  to  change your attitude and recognise  one\r\n\r\nunion  in one establishment and deal with that  one\r\n\r\nunion.\" Once they deal with that union it is  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that the workers of Singapore will  flourish\r\n\r\nbecause there is one union in one establishment, so\r\n\r\nthat when one employer makes an agreement with  one\r\n\r\nunion  that  agreement  is valid.  And  even  if  a\r\n\r\nhandful  do  not  like the union  leadership,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  just get about seven men and send in  their\r\n\r\napplication  for  registration.  If  this  law   is\r\n\r\nimplemented, it is my earnest belief that  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore will be happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to note one more\r\n\r\npoint - that  the  hon.  Member  for  Cairnhill   was\r\n\r\ntalking for the trade union movement. I should like\r\n\r\nto know, Sir, at the present moment, how many trade\r\n\r\nunions he represents? How many thousands of workers\r\n\r\nhe  represents and on whose behalf was  he  talking\r\n\r\nwhen he was talking about the trade union movement.\r\n\r\nEven  while he was the Chief Minister he  had  said\r\n\r\nthat  he was born as a clerk and he would die as  a\r\n\r\nclerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He is entitled to speak as a Member,\r\n\r\nand not as a representative of a trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I am not going to\r\n\r\nargue with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was trying to stress is this. He cannot be\r\n\r\nrepresenting  any unions. I just want  to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  we  on this side, at  least,  whatever\r\n\r\nopinions we express we can say that they have  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the  unions which we represent. So that  puts\r\n\r\nmore  value  and  more strength into  our  opinions\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know the feelings of the workers,  and\r\n\r\nhow they are eagerly awaiting the implementation of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I on this side am trying to make it\r\n\r\nclear  that  as soon as this Law is passed  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  a  big  hue and cry in Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nyellow unions which were once helping more or  less\r\n\r\nthe past Government to prevent the healthy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth of the trade union movement in this country.\r\n\r\nSo  once  this law is implemented we can  see  what\r\n\r\nthese self-styled trade union leaders, half of whom\r\n\r\nbelong to the gangster group and the other half  to\r\n\r\ncorrupted  people, are going to do.

Today we are very glad  to  hear  the\r\n\r\nviews from the same mouth of the Chief Minister who\r\n\r\nonce  refused to hold a ballot because he knew that\r\n\r\nonce this was taken, all these eight or nine unions\r\n\r\nwith his good old friends would be ousted from  the\r\n\r\ntrade union arena in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning\r\n\r\nthe Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill to give powers to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law to restrict  trade\r\n\r\nunions  which  are  considered  detrimental  to   a\r\n\r\nhealthy  trade  union movement,  I,  in  principle,\r\n\r\nagree,  so  that  we can organise the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  in Singapore as one which can  fight  for\r\n\r\nthe  interest of labour. But I would like to remind\r\n\r\nthe Assembly that with these powers, there must  be\r\n\r\nconsideration to the effect that there will  be  no\r\n\r\naction   taken  which  is  motivated   by   certain\r\n\r\nsections,  because from what we have witnessed  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  trade unions existing  today  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are mixed up in politics. Therefore, this\r\n\r\nconnection of theirs can be to the detriment of the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement which has, as its object,  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the  workers  and  which  has   no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  in relation to the  colour  of  the\r\n\r\nskin  or religion. We know that the labour movement\r\n\r\nin  Singapore can be considered a new movement  and\r\n\r\nthe  majority of the workers are not yet fully able\r\n\r\nto understand its true aims and why they should get\r\n\r\ntogether to face their employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as these workers are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyet  fully  conversant with the  principle  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement, it often happens that if they\r\n\r\nbecome  members of a certain trade union they  will\r\n\r\nbe  tied  to  a  political ideology  of  which  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  those trade unions are the  adherents,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is  a difference between  political\r\n\r\nideology  and  the  trade union  movement.

It is a trade union which has  a  great\r\n\r\ninterest  in the political movements in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  the  majority of the workers are  those  whose\r\n\r\nideologies do not fit in with the movement of  that\r\n\r\nparticular  trade  union which supports  a  certain\r\n\r\npolitical  organisation. I  remember  that  when  a\r\n\r\nstrike  was staged in the Singapore Harbour  Board,\r\n\r\nthose who were members of this union worked hard to\r\n\r\nconduct  the  strike with a view  to  making  it  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.  But  only  a  handful  of  other  workers\r\n\r\nactively participated. When the strike reached  its\r\n\r\nclimax, they realised that they were being  led  in\r\n\r\nthe  wrong direction, one not in keeping with their\r\n\r\npolitical  beliefs.  They then  decided  that  they\r\n\r\ncould not continue with the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I said just now, on the whole, I support this Bill and agree with it. But we must be\r\n\r\ncareful  as to how past happenings can be  improved\r\n\r\nupon,  so that a strong labour union can be created\r\n\r\nto   look   after  the  interests  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  their  political  ideologies   or\r\n\r\nreligious beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as members of the public know,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government is the people's Government.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  Government supported and backed  by  the\r\n\r\npeople;  a Government representing the poor  masses\r\n\r\nwho have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown-trodden  and exploited by the past  Government\r\n\r\nand  also exploited by employers who were protected\r\n\r\nby  the  last  Government. It  is  the  desire  and\r\n\r\nintention  of  my  Party to raise the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving of the masses, particularly the workers,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  who have, as I mentioned earlier,  been\r\n\r\nignored or suppressed by the last Government and by\r\n\r\nemployers  protected  by the last  Government.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is not only a Party which has not failed  in\r\n\r\nits  promises - it is one which highly  respects  the\r\n\r\npromises it has made. This is because we know  that\r\n\r\na government which does not fulfil its pledges will\r\n\r\ninevitably have its fate decided by the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one closely associated with the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement,   I   should   explain   something   here\r\n\r\nconcerning  this movement. As far as  I  know,  the\r\n\r\nconditions  for  the workers at the present  moment\r\n\r\nare still bad. This is because the laws promulgated\r\n\r\nby  the  last  Government were one-sided - they  were\r\n\r\nmore  on  the side of the employers. The reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  during  the  life  of  the  past  Government,\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions were established, the majority  of\r\n\r\nthem   to  split  the  unity  of  the  workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  addition, yellow unions  were  also\r\n\r\nused  by employers to break the solidarity  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. To fight for the interests of the workers,\r\n\r\nwe  will  amend  these laws and  will  take  proper\r\n\r\naction on employers who do not observe them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for yellow unions and those which do not\r\n\r\nrepresent   the  majority  of  workers,   we   will\r\n\r\nendeavour to have them dissolved. The policy of the\r\n\r\npresent  Government has the support of  the  entire\r\n\r\nlabour force in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important problem facing the Government at\r\n\r\npresent  is  unemployment, to  overcome  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  requires  large  sums  of  money.   But\r\n\r\nunfortunately when we examined the Treasury left us\r\n\r\nby  the  last  Government, we discovered  that  the\r\n\r\ncoffers  were  empty.  In spite  of  this,  we  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that with the efficiency and ability  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leadership, and with the  support  and\r\n\r\nbacking  of  the  people  of  Singapore,  we   will\r\n\r\novercome  difficulties and the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be led to the gate of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I should explain that a noble ambition\r\n\r\ncannot  be implemented overnight or in one  or  two\r\n\r\ndays, but that it may take 10 or 20 years. However,\r\n\r\nthat is our ambition. Whether it can be realised in\r\n\r\na  short  or long period rests with the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I say this because I know that only with\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation  of  the  people  especially  the\r\n\r\nlabour force can our ambition be realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be explained that the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  in  Singapore should not follow  communal\r\n\r\nlines. The welfare of the workers in Singapore does\r\n\r\nnot  depend  on  race, that is to say,  that  if  a\r\n\r\nChinese worker is exploited, his Malay or Indian co-worker  is  similarly exploited.  Therefore,  in  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement, communalism or race  should\r\n\r\nnot come into play. I appeal to the labour movement\r\n\r\nto  cease  communalism so that we  can  unite  that\r\n\r\nmovement   in   Singapore.  Although   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has the overwhelming support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  that does not mean that there are no  more\r\n\r\nelements   continually  trying   to   subvert   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes    of   the   Government.    In    these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  I  hope  that  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  on their guard  against  these\r\n\r\nelements,  so  that  our  ambition  will   not   be\r\n\r\nsubverted. Once again, therefore, I appeal  to  all\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to give all-out support  to\r\n\r\nthis Government so that we can, hand-in-hand, build\r\n\r\na nation in peace and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now I heard the Member for the Southern Islands state that he agreed with this\r\n\r\namending  Bill, but he thought the Minister  should\r\n\r\ngive  careful  and just consideration  when  he  is\r\n\r\npressed. I think the Member is not yet fully  aware\r\n\r\nof  the labour movement in Singapore. I myself know\r\n\r\nfor  a fact that the Member has no connection  with\r\n\r\nlabour  movements. The Member stated that political\r\n\r\nencroachment  is  taking place in the  majority  of\r\n\r\nlabour  unions. Once again, I say that  the  Member\r\n\r\nknows little about the trade union movement. In the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement there are members who play  to\r\n\r\nthe various political parties. From what I know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  large trade unions, members come from  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  S.P.A., U.M.N.O., and so on.

I personally\r\n\r\nhad  worked in the Harbour Board Union in  a  part-time  capacity. The Member for the Southern Islands\r\n\r\nalso    stated    that   the   members    of    the\r\n\r\nunion - especially the Malays - did not receive  proper\r\n\r\ncare and that they could not fit in their political\r\n\r\nbeliefs.  Mr  Speaker, what  the  Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  stated at the beginning  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech  is contradictory to what he stated  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  his speech. Earlier, the Member said  that\r\n\r\npolitics  should not be used in trade  unions,  but\r\n\r\nlater  on  the Member said that because the  Malays\r\n\r\ncould  not  fit  in their political  beliefs,  they\r\n\r\nformed other unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification?

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish  to  clarify  my  speech  which   was\r\n\r\nmisunderstood. It was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommented  by the Member for Kallang  that  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of my speech I stated that in the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  we should have no connection  with\r\n\r\npolitical  parties. The reason why I  say  this  is\r\n\r\nthat  a particular trade union was found to be  run\r\n\r\nin   accordance  with  the  beliefs  of  a  certain\r\n\r\npolitical party and some of the members were not in\r\n\r\nagreement  with these political beliefs. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  result  is that these members left that  union\r\n\r\nand  formed another union with the object of having\r\n\r\nnothing   to  do  with  politics  but   solely   of\r\n\r\nconcerning themselves with improving the conditions\r\n\r\nof their employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on clause 5 of the\r\n\r\nBill now under consideration, the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law somewhat anticipated the point I\r\n\r\nwish to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the existing Ordinance, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, although the Minister has a right to over-ride  the  decision of the Registrar, that decision\r\n\r\nof   the  Minister  over-riding  or  accepting  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Registrar does  not  prevent  an\r\n\r\naggrieved  party  from taking the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  into  court. Now, the Hon. Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat he has decided to introduce this amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  existing section 17 of the Ordinance primarily\r\n\r\nbecause  he  feels  that  such  matters  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsuitably resolved in court. I take it that his only\r\n\r\nexplanation  to  the  House  for  introducing  this\r\n\r\nproviso  is  because  he feels  that  such  matters\r\n\r\ncannot  be suitably dealt with in a court  of  law.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I am not an expert on trade union\r\n\r\nmatters,  as so many of us here claim  to  be.  So,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I went to the Trade Union Acts  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom  from  which  our   Trade   Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance is derived and on which it is based.  The\r\n\r\ninspiration for the trade union movement as we know\r\n\r\nit  comes  from the United Kingdom, and  our  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Ordinance is to a large extent based on  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Trade  Union Acts. I  was  surprised,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, to find that the Trade Union Acts  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom expressly and categorically preserve\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  aggrieved parties  to  take  their\r\n\r\ngrievances into court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, somewhat  at  a\r\n\r\nloss  to  understand how similar matters  could  be\r\n\r\nsuitably  aired in an English court  but  the  same\r\n\r\nmatters  cannot  be suitably  dealt  with  in  our\r\n\r\ncourts.  I do not for one moment believe  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law is suggesting that our courts  are\r\n\r\nless capable of dealing with a situation which  the\r\n\r\nEnglish courts seem to deal with fairly well.  Sir,\r\n\r\nleaving the ultimate decision on certain matters in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  a  Minister is necessary,  to  some\r\n\r\nextent,  to  carry  on an efficient  government.  I\r\n\r\nconcede, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Minister must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  certain  executive powers from  which  there\r\n\r\nshould not be an appeal; otherwise the courts  will\r\n\r\nbe flooded with niggardly and wanton appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister cited four Ordinances as\r\n\r\ngiving power to the Minister to do certain acts  on\r\n\r\nmatters - if  I  may  be permitted  to  say  so,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - which are not of general public importance\r\n\r\nbut  are  matters on which individual subjects  are\r\n\r\ninvolved with the Government and with the permanent\r\n\r\nofficials    of    the   Government.    In    those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is only right and proper that the\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  is  not a public official  in  that\r\n\r\nsense,  should  be  given the  right  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether  a licence should be given, or to  do  some\r\n\r\nsuch act which only affects the private individual.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision should rest with the Minister.  But\r\n\r\nthis,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is an entirely  different\r\n\r\nmatter. This is a matter which does not involve one\r\n\r\nperson.  It  involves  the  right  of  persons   to\r\n\r\nassociate themselves together in one group in order\r\n\r\nto    further   their   own   economic   interests.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, such matters are tied with political\r\n\r\nissues  sometimes.  I  was surprised  to  hear  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah (Mr John Mammen) in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  suggesting that the Minister for Law should\r\n\r\nuse  these  powers  to strike out  what  he  called\r\n\r\n\"S.P.A. splinter unions.\" If the Minister were  to\r\n\r\nuse  his powers with that end in view, I should  be\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy, but the mere fact, Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\na  responsible  Member of this House could  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister should use these powers  to  do\r\n\r\nthat leaves open the question that such an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment is fraught with danger. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nonly  right  and  proper that on a matter  of  such\r\n\r\npublic importance the ultimate decision should  lie\r\n\r\nwith the courts of law, as in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, cannot deny\r\n\r\nthat  the cancellation of yellow or splinter unions\r\n\r\nas they call them is a political matter. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is of importance that on an issue such as  this\r\n\r\nthe ultimate decision should lie with the courts of\r\n\r\nthis  country which are completely above suspicion,\r\n\r\ncompletely  neutral, and which will look completely\r\n\r\nobjectively  upon  such matters  according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules  framed by the Minister and not according  to\r\n\r\nany preconceived political ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Cairnhill suggested that when\r\n\r\ngiving  powers to the Minister for the cancellation\r\n\r\nor for the withdrawal of registration of yellow and\r\n\r\nsplinter unions it should be decided by means of  a\r\n\r\nballot.  Sir,  he was not of that same  opinion  in\r\n\r\n1957  when he appointed a Court of Inquiry to  look\r\n\r\ninto  industrial disputes in the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard.   A  Court  of  Inquiry  appointed  by   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  of  which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  was then the Chief Minister as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Welfare, did recommend\r\n\r\nthat a ballot should be held and that the result of\r\n\r\nsuch a ballot should be taken into account for  the\r\n\r\nrecognition of the most representative union in the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board. Unfortunately, these recommendations\r\n\r\ndid  not  suit  the  Chief Minister  in  1957  and,\r\n\r\ndespite  various appeals from the unions  connected\r\n\r\nwith  organising the workers in the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore Trades Union Congress, which  is\r\n\r\nthe   national  centre  for  unions,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nrefused to hold a ballot. That was the situation in\r\n\r\n1957,  but  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  has  since\r\n\r\nchanged  his  views. It does appear that  his  view\r\n\r\nwith  regard to ballots to decide or to assist  the\r\n\r\nworkers to decide which union they will support has\r\n\r\nnow changed according to the side of the House that\r\n\r\nhe finds himself in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  the  Member  for  Cairnhill   also touched   on   I.L.O. conventions,   international\r\n\r\nopinions with regard to the Amendment Bill that  is\r\n\r\nbefore   the   House.  The  present  Trade   Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was introduced in 1941, mainly  modelled\r\n\r\non   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  that  was  then\r\n\r\nexisting  in  Ceylon,  and  when  it  was   finally\r\n\r\nimplemented after the war, it was clear to all  who\r\n\r\nhad  the interest of the workers at heart that  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the Trade Unions Ordinance was to  show\r\n\r\nthe     world,    in    particular    international\r\n\r\norganisations  such as the I.L.O. and  at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage  the I.C.F.T.U. and so on, that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  did recognise the rights of workers  to\r\n\r\nform  unions; that it could not only show  this  by\r\n\r\nmeans  of  having legislation but also by having  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unions.  But the  legislation  made  it\r\n\r\nimpossible for effective trade unionism  to  exist.\r\n\r\nAt  the  last sitting, Sir, I did mention that  the\r\n\r\nTrade Unions Ordinance as it stands today makes  it\r\n\r\npossible  for a man, his wife and five children  to\r\n\r\nform  a  union. And it has become quite  a  fashion\r\n\r\namong persons who do not believe in the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  who do not believe  in  sound  trade\r\n\r\nunion  organisation, but who only believe in  their\r\n\r\nown  personal glory, to take advantage of this part\r\n\r\nof  the  legislation.  When  they  find  themselves\r\n\r\ndefeated in a democratic election within the  trade\r\n\r\nunions they decide to set up splinter unions.  This\r\n\r\nhas  become  quite a fashion. In private  industry,\r\n\r\nthis  move  of discredited union leaders  who  lose\r\n\r\nelections  and who want to form splinter unions  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  encouraged  by  employers  directly   or\r\n\r\nindirectly. The Minister for Labour and Law  quoted\r\n\r\nan  example of Hock Lee. Several other examples can\r\n\r\nbe  quoted. Political parties too have played their\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trade unions that do exist in\r\n\r\nSingapore - they number 225 - cannot be said  to  be  a\r\n\r\nmovement  that  is  united and cohesive,  that  can\r\n\r\noffer  adequate and complete service to the members\r\n\r\nthat they represent. We cannot do so because of the\r\n\r\nlimitations  imposed on the movement by  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Ordinance. The limitations are not expressed\r\n\r\nin  so  many  words  as appear  in  the  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nbecause   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  makes   it\r\n\r\npossible for splinter and yellow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions to grow. I myself, Sir, have for many  years\r\n\r\nbeen  associated  with  unions  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice.  Five years ago, there was only one  union\r\n\r\nfor  teachers, but now there are several unions for\r\n\r\nteachers.  There  was  one  union  in  the  medical\r\n\r\nservice;  now  there are various  splinter  unions.\r\n\r\nThere was one union catering for administrative and\r\n\r\nclerical  workers; now there are half a dozen  such\r\n\r\nunions.  It is the same in every industry,  whether\r\n\r\nit is in the Harbour Board, the Armed Services, the\r\n\r\nCity Council, or whether it is in private industry.\r\n\r\nWe have also a union which, strangely enough, calls\r\n\r\nitself the Professional Women's Association,  whose\r\n\r\naims  and  objectives are not very clear. But  that\r\n\r\nunion has managed to pull out some members from the\r\n\r\nteachers'  unions, some from the  Medical  Services\r\n\r\nUnion,   and   it   now  constitutes   itself   the\r\n\r\nProfessional Women's Association. We have had inter-union  rivalry as a result of splinter  unions  and\r\n\r\nyellow  unions. Some of these rivalries have  ended\r\n\r\nin  bloodshed and riot, as was seen in the Hock Lee\r\n\r\nriots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were to analyse the number of man-hours\r\n\r\nlost  as  a  result of strikes and  lock-outs,  one\r\n\r\nwould  be  surprised  to know  how  many  of  those\r\n\r\nstrikes  were  caused  directly  as  a  result   of\r\n\r\nstraightforward industrial dispute, and how many of\r\n\r\nthem  were  caused because the employer refused  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  a  legally constituted and proper  union\r\n\r\nbut desired to reach agreement with either a yellow\r\n\r\nunion or a small splinter union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrial relations are to be maintained at a\r\n\r\nhigh  level of understanding between employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees,  and if the present Government's  policy\r\n\r\nof  industrial peace with justice is to be  carried\r\n\r\nout,  then  a  climate  of confidence  between  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  their own organisations and employers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  good  employers  and  reasonable\r\n\r\nemployers,   must  be  established  so   that   any\r\n\r\nagreement  reached would be kept.  In  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation, it is not possible, for where  the  good\r\n\r\nemployer  wants  to maintain his agreement  with  a\r\n\r\nproperly  constituted  union,  you  have  the   bad\r\n\r\nemployers who are willing to subsidise or to assist\r\n\r\nthe  formation of yellow unions or reach  agreement\r\n\r\nwith splinter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions - agreements that are often to  the  detriment\r\n\r\nof   the   workers   organised  by   the   properly\r\n\r\nconstituted union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands, Sir, did\r\n\r\nmake suggestions that unions should not be involved\r\n\r\nin  politics. Yet in the same breath he spoke about\r\n\r\na  union in the Harbour Board, whose members had to\r\n\r\nresign  from  a properly constituted union  because\r\n\r\nthey  could  not  agree with the politics  of  that\r\n\r\nunion.  This  union, I believe,  is  organised  and\r\n\r\nconfines  its  membership to  a  particular  racial\r\n\r\ngroup. If the Member for the Southern Islands meant\r\n\r\nthat only unions subscribing to the politics of his\r\n\r\nown   political   organisation   could   exist   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, perhaps he would have been more  to  the\r\n\r\npoint.   But  he  confused  the  issue   by   first\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that all unions should keep  away  from\r\n\r\npolitics.  Sir, previously it was a  popular  thing\r\n\r\nfor  trade  union leaders to say that trade  unions\r\n\r\nshould  keep  away from politics. But  the  workers\r\n\r\nnever  at  any time believed that unions  could  be\r\n\r\nkept  away  from  politics.  The  progress  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the improvement of their standard  of\r\n\r\nliving   are  dependent  to  some  extent  on   the\r\n\r\nassistance  that they can provide or  the  pressure\r\n\r\nthat  they  can bring to bear on political  parties\r\n\r\nwhich are favourably disposed to the workers. It is\r\n\r\nonly  natural  that the majority of the  unions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  support the present  Government.\r\n\r\nThey  do so, because this Government, for the first\r\n\r\ntime  in  the history of Singapore, did put  out  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  and a positive labour policy  before  the\r\n\r\nworkers and got a mandate from the workers and  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The workers have faith in this Government.\r\n\r\nIt  is  by the overwhelming support of the  workers\r\n\r\nand the people of this country that this Government\r\n\r\nwas  elected.  The  workers have also  shown  their\r\n\r\nfeelings for the past Government. While it might be\r\n\r\nsaid - as  the  Member for Farrer Park  did  say - that\r\n\r\npolitical   considerations  would  come   in   when\r\n\r\nwithdrawals   of  registration  from   yellow   and\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions are made, it must be  made  clear,\r\n\r\nand  I  think the Minister did make it very  clear,\r\n\r\nthat  we  are not dealing with unions whose leaders\r\n\r\nsupport  this Party or that Party. We  are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith yellow and splinter unions. The definition  of\r\n\r\nthis term to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists  is very clear.  If  it  is  by  a\r\n\r\ncoincidence - and it has happened in Singapore  - that\r\n\r\nmany  splinter unions, strangely enough,  have  had\r\n\r\ntheir  offices, either temporary or  permanent,  at\r\n\r\none   spot,  I  may  say  that  quite  often  their\r\n\r\naddresses by a coincidence have happened to  be  at\r\n\r\nAllenby  Road.  But  it is a coincidence  that  the\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions gather strength from  one  another\r\n\r\nand  they  seem  to congregate in  one  place.  The\r\n\r\ncancellation  or the withdrawal of the registration\r\n\r\nof  those unions will take place. The motive is not\r\n\r\none  of  politics. The fact remains that  they  are\r\n\r\nsplinter unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one studies the Annual Reports of the Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment  during the last ten  years,  one  finds\r\n\r\nthat  on an average 20 unions are registered  every\r\n\r\nyear  and 11 unions lose their registration. Either\r\n\r\nthey  are  cancelled  because they  have  not  kept\r\n\r\nwithin  the  terms of the Ordinance,  or  they  are\r\n\r\ndissolved  because the members have lost  interest.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of this growth of unions on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand   and   de-registration  on  the   other - these\r\n\r\nconstant fluctuations - workers do lose some of their\r\n\r\nfaith in the trade unions that they have. They join\r\n\r\na  trade union today and they find that because  it\r\n\r\nis small and ineffective (they may not realise that\r\n\r\nit  is a company union), these unions are not  able\r\n\r\nto  look after their interest, as a result of which\r\n\r\nthe  workers  become disillusioned with  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement. If the workers are to  believe  in\r\n\r\nthe  democratic form of government, then the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement, as an institution in a  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety, must be made to succeed, must be  made  to\r\n\r\nwork,  and  it must produce results. If  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  fails  to produce results, then the  workers\r\n\r\nwill  lose faith in the trade union movement,  and,\r\n\r\nconsequently,   must  also  lose   faith   in   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment, Sir, is to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  trade union movement  and  not  to\r\n\r\nweaken  it.  It is to strengthen it by  doing  away\r\n\r\nwith  the  large  number  of  splinter  and  yellow\r\n\r\nunions, consolidating the workers into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperly constituted unions, and perhaps at a later\r\n\r\nstage reorganising them on an industrial basis. If,\r\n\r\nas  we  believe,  the  workers' organisations,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  should  be  protected,  should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged to be strong and powerful - because only a\r\n\r\nsound  trade union movement can properly look after\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the  workers - then,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nimperative that this amendment is accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, the Trade\r\n\r\nUnions (Amendment) Bill, which is being debated, is\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  safeguard  existing  trade  unions\r\n\r\nwhich  are  being  wrecked  by  yellow  unions   or\r\n\r\nsplinter  unions.  We discover  many  yellow  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  splinter unions which  are  constantly\r\n\r\ntrying to wreck the growth of a healthy trade union\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many yellow and splinter trade unions were formed\r\n\r\nwith  the  encouragement of  employers.  And  these\r\n\r\nemployers  who  encouraged  the  establishment   of\r\n\r\nsplinter and yellow trade unions are employers  who\r\n\r\nreceived  protection from the last Government.  The\r\n\r\nprevious   Government  constantly  protected   such\r\n\r\nemployers,  so that their workers or employees  who\r\n\r\nwere  members of the trade union movement could  be\r\n\r\nexploited. For instance, the employers know that  a\r\n\r\nhealthy trade union movement will submit claims for\r\n\r\nbetter   or   improved   conditions   of   service.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  these  employers  tried  to  use  these\r\n\r\nemployees to form another trade union whose  claims\r\n\r\nwould be considered by the employers. This state of\r\n\r\naffairs  has occurred in many instances, and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  my  colleagues  have  quoted  instances   and\r\n\r\nexplained the acts that had been committed  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  form  yellow  and  splinter  unions.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, is in accordance with the assurance  given\r\n\r\nby  the  People's  Action Party to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the electioneering. The  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party has stated its policy to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore - the   overwhelming   majority   of   them\r\n\r\ncomprise workers - that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  look  after the interest and welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement. With this Trade Unions (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill,  we  can give security to members of  healthy\r\n\r\ntrade  unions so that their interest will be looked\r\n\r\nafter  and  thus  they will not  be  victimised  or\r\n\r\nexploited  by  their employers through  yellow  and\r\n\r\nsplinter unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for the Southern Islands\r\n\r\nsaid  he  agreed with the Trade Unions  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  But he felt suspicious that this Bill  could\r\n\r\ninfluence   the  members  to  side   with   certain\r\n\r\npolitical  parties.  He also  mentioned  the  point\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Member for Telok Blangah,  that  a\r\n\r\nsmall  trade  union  based on  communal  lines  was\r\n\r\nestablished  because the Member for  Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nbelieved that the main object of establishing  this\r\n\r\nparticular small communal trade union was solely to\r\n\r\ninstil  political ideology. But the Member for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  has refuted the  statement  that\r\n\r\nthey  no longer had faith in the trade union  which\r\n\r\nrepresented them, on account of the fact that  they\r\n\r\nwere  misled to accept political beliefs, and  they\r\n\r\ntherefore formed a union for the genuine purpose of\r\n\r\nprotecting the workers' interest and members of the\r\n\r\nMalay  working  class. Therefore, it  is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat unions of this nature should be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as far as I know, the union which was formed, as explained by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  just now, was, in reality, to  consolidate\r\n\r\nor  enhance political ideologies. That is  to  say,\r\n\r\nthe  members  and officials who formed  this  union\r\n\r\nwere all U.M.N.O. members who at one time tried  to\r\n\r\nsabotage  the unions which represented  them.  When\r\n\r\nthe  union which represented them was faced with  a\r\n\r\ntrade   dispute,  however,  and  when   they   were\r\n\r\nunsuccessful  in  enhancing  their  position,  they\r\n\r\nformed  another trade union. Also, I still remember\r\n\r\nwhen   my  union,  that  is,  the  Telephone  Board\r\n\r\nEmployees Union, was faced with a trade dispute, we\r\n\r\nappealed to a Minister for assistance to settle it.\r\n\r\nBut the Minister stated that he tried to settle the\r\n\r\ndispute   because  the  members  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board  Employees Union  comprised  Malay\r\n\r\nmembers,  the  majority  of  whom  are  members  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  The  way in which he tried to  settle  it\r\n\r\ntook the form of political-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering how the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Ulu Pandan can relate all these matters to the\r\n\r\nBill.  I think he is quite in order to make passing\r\n\r\nmention of certain splinter unions, but to go  into\r\n\r\ndetails is a bit too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nshall  try to comment in detail on the speech  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for the Southern Islands  just  now\r\n\r\nconcerning the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill,  with\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member for the Southern Islands said  he\r\n\r\nagreed  in  principle provided that the Bill  would\r\n\r\nnot  jeopardise unions not involved with  political\r\n\r\nmovements  and  an  assurance  could  be  given  to\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are members of trade unions  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be implemented in a more suitable way. As for\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Farrer Park,  he  said  the  Bill\r\n\r\nfollows  the Trade Unions Ordinance in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, and that the members of trade unions there\r\n\r\ninvolved  in a trade dispute could have the  matter\r\n\r\nbrought to a civil court. He asked why we cannot do\r\n\r\nlikewise in Singapore - is it because the law  courts\r\n\r\nin Singapore are less capable? I would like to draw\r\n\r\nattention to the trade disputes which were  settled\r\n\r\nin  the  courts of Singapore. I believe the methods\r\n\r\nby  which  they were settled were colonial methods,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, they were one-sided affairs and the\r\n\r\nMinisters concerned, for instance the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare, did not  take  the  slightest\r\n\r\ninterest    in    the    Court's    decisions    or\r\n\r\nrecommendations. So what is the use if when a trade\r\n\r\ndispute is settled in the courts, its decisions  or\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are not heeded and  no  action  is\r\n\r\ntaken  in  the interests of the workers  concerned?\r\n\r\nWith the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, however,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  that  all  workers in Singapore  who  are\r\n\r\nmembers  of  healthy  trade  unions  will  have  an\r\n\r\nassurance that their conditions of work, etc., will\r\n\r\nbe improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, when a new system is born we naturally\r\n\r\nwant  to  revise the old one. To amend  legislation\r\n\r\npermitting yellow and splinter unions is  therefore\r\n\r\none  of our Government's policies, because we  want\r\n\r\nto unify the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  here  I would like  to  analyse  the yellow  unions. They are detrimental to the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  workers. Take, for instance, the Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nbus riots to show how yellow unions are detrimental\r\n\r\nto  workers - serious riots broke out when  a  yellow\r\n\r\nunion  was established. When this happened  was  it\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to the workers? They  wanted  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir three meals but, unfortunately, another union\r\n\r\nwas set up to destroy their legal union and against\r\n\r\ntheir   welfare.  While  negotiations  took   place\r\n\r\nbetween the employers and employees, a yellow union\r\n\r\nwas  set up. That was very bad for the workers. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  there are many other unions of a  similar\r\n\r\nnature  which  are not useful to good  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween employers and employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we settle the frictions between employers\r\n\r\nand   employees,  we  do  not  purposely  seek  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage   of  the  employers.   However,   the\r\n\r\nemployers purposely give a lot of reasons - illogical\r\n\r\nones - which  are not for the welfare of the  workers\r\n\r\nand  create  a lot of incidents. Under the  present\r\n\r\nOrdinance, some employers, although they knew their\r\n\r\nworkers  have  a legal union, purposely  got  other\r\n\r\nworkers to form a yellow union. This created a  lot\r\n\r\nof  friction between the workers and thus  gave  an\r\n\r\nadvantage to the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under the old system, the colonial rulers ruling us naturally liked to have many\r\n\r\nunions  for  the workers and thus create  friction.\r\n\r\nThere was friction between employers and employees,\r\n\r\nand   also   between   employees   and   employees.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I say that when a union truly represents\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the workers, the old system must  be\r\n\r\nreformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Farrer Park spoke about\r\n\r\nthe  system  in the United Kingdom. We  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment were elected by the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  we  are  responsible for the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we do not amend the legislation permitting yellow and splinter unions, and unify\r\n\r\nall unions for the sake of the country's economy we\r\n\r\nwill  suffer  much  serious  loss.  In  our  policy\r\n\r\nstatements, we have analysed the country's  economy\r\n\r\nand  stated the serious problems facing it.  If  we\r\n\r\nhave  yellow unions side by side with legal  unions\r\n\r\nand  creating  a lot of trouble among the  workers,\r\n\r\nthat  will  not  be advantageous for the  country's\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign, there were many\r\n\r\nfalse  unionists who shouted that they  would  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  welfare of the people and provide  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  the  unemployed. In fact,  that  will  not  be\r\n\r\npossible  if  the problems of the workers  are  not\r\n\r\nsolved. Mr Speaker, politically speaking,  we  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the Opposition Members.  Apparently\r\n\r\nthey are nonchalant about this problem. In order to\r\n\r\navoid  trouble between employees and employees,  we\r\n\r\nwant to unify all employees in Singapore and create\r\n\r\na  new  society. We know that all the goods in  the\r\n\r\nworld  were  created by the workers. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nsay  that we must look after their welfare.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot want to be used by other people. We do not want\r\n\r\ntrouble   created  between  workers  and   workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I positively support this Bill to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  legislation  permitting  yellow  and  splinter\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
