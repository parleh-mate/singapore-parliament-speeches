On the  issue\r\n\r\nof  merger,  this holds particularly  true  as  this\r\n\r\nGovernment was elected on a platform in which merger\r\n\r\nwith the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a  basic  issue.  We are  therefore  completely\r\n\r\njustified  if  we  proceed  forthwith  with   merger\r\n\r\narrangements. Indeed it has been represented  to  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  to  me that we should  do  so.  The\r\n\r\npeople  have  asked, \"Why have a referendum  at  all\r\n\r\nwhen  the Government was elected with a full mandate\r\n\r\nfor  merger?\" Though in constitutional principle our\r\n\r\nposition  would be unassailable if we  proceeded  in\r\n\r\nthis manner, politically such a move is unsound. The\r\n\r\nreason  is  that  we  would  then  be  evading   the\r\n\r\nchallenge  mounted  by  the  Communists  and   their\r\n\r\nstooges  in the Barisan Sosialis who claim that  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  against merger. It must, therefore,  be\r\n\r\ndemonstrated beyond all doubt that the  majority  of\r\n\r\nthe people want merger and it must be shown that the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Communists and their stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  to  fight  merger  will  come  to\r\n\r\nnought.  We  cannot  evade  the  challenge  of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists on this vital issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park referred to the under-currents which he detected in the course of the\r\n\r\ndebate  between the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  the  Members of the P.A.P. He  was  puzzled  by\r\n\r\nthese  under-currents. I shall refer to  this  at  a\r\n\r\nlater  stage because it is important that the  whole\r\n\r\nposition  should  be fully explained  both  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and to the public at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to deal with some issues raised by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Barisan Sosialis.  There  are  two\r\n\r\npoints of some importance. I will not deal with  the\r\n\r\ntrivial and carping criticisms of various clauses of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. These will be disposed of in the Committee\r\n\r\nstage  or in the final address by my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs. The first point  relates\r\n\r\nto  the  interval of time between the issue  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  notice  and the actual  holding  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  itself. Members of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  said  that the period allowed is  short.  They\r\n\r\nwant  a  long  referendum campaign. Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  this referendum will be on merger, and  merger\r\n\r\nhas  been the outstanding political issue before the\r\n\r\ncountry, even many months before the publication  of\r\n\r\nthe White Paper which was debated in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Assembly last November. In fact, merger was the\r\n\r\nissue  on  which  the  Communists  decided  to  part\r\n\r\ncompany  with the P.A.P. We wanted merger  and  they\r\n\r\nopposed   it  for  reasons  of  their  own  physical\r\n\r\nsurvival.  So  for  nearly  a  year  now  since  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  parted company with  us,  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nmerger has been put before the electorate. In  other\r\n\r\nwords, the political campaign on the issue on  which\r\n\r\na  referendum is to take place has been running  for\r\n\r\nnearly  one year. This being the case, the  argument\r\n\r\nthat  a referendum campaign is unduly restricted  in\r\n\r\ntime is sheer nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to blank and uncertain\r\n\r\nballot  papers.  The Government view  is  that  such\r\n\r\nballot  papers  should be considered to  indicate  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  mind  in  which  the  voter  himself   is\r\n\r\nundecided and will therefore be content to leave the\r\n\r\nissue to be decided in a manner in which the elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the Assembly had already decided.\r\n\r\nSome  Members  complain that this  is  undemocratic,\r\n\r\nsince there is no precedent for a procedure of  this\r\n\r\nkind  in the referendum practice of other countries.\r\n\r\nThis  does  not prevent the same hon.  Members  from\r\n\r\nmaking  a proposal which itself has no precedent  in\r\n\r\nthe  referendum laws of the countries they  mention.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, they want Opposition Members to have\r\n\r\na voice in the framing of the questions submitted to\r\n\r\nthe  referendum.  The detailed arrangements  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum are a matter for the Government  and  not\r\n\r\nfor   the  Opposition  in  Singapore  as  in   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Now why was the clause on  blank  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  introduced? The reason does not rest on  any\r\n\r\nconstitutional  or legal principle. This  clause  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  safeguard against the possibility  of\r\n\r\nabuse  of the referendum by the Communists and their\r\n\r\nstooges in the Barisan Sosialis. Let me explain what\r\n\r\nI  mean by this. These persons have been campaigning\r\n\r\nagainst merger ever since the idea was mooted at the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election. The Communists  know  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  oppose  merger because  it  is  historically\r\n\r\ninevitable and is in accordance with the  wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe people. So they try to confuse the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople by saying that they want more merger than the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  They  resort  to all manner  of  deceit  and\r\n\r\nduplicity  in  their  public  statements,  at   mass\r\n\r\nrallies  and in the newspapers. The lies  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  spread  in their propaganda campaign  are  now\r\n\r\ncoming  home  to roost on them as the Government  is\r\n\r\ntracking down each one of them and explaining to the\r\n\r\npublic  the  malicious falsehoods of the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  their  stooges  in  the Barisan  Sosialis.  The\r\n\r\nposition of the Communists on the merger issue is  a\r\n\r\ncompletely false one. They are opposed to merger but\r\n\r\nthey  pretend  that they want more merger  than  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. They have therefore not been able to get people\r\n\r\nto  oppose merger or to get excited over the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. The series of mass meetings  that\r\n\r\nthey have been carrying on for the last five or  six\r\n\r\nmonths to fight merger has been a series of complete\r\n\r\nflops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Minister indicate how\r\n\r\nthis particular part of his speech has any reference\r\n\r\nto the general merits and principle of the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am trying\r\n\r\nto   explain  why  the  clause  on  blank  votes  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It  is  because  of  the   Government's\r\n\r\nanticipation of what the Communists will  do  during\r\n\r\nreferendum  week. The Communists have  succeeded  to\r\n\r\nsome  small  extent  in confusing  some  people.  We\r\n\r\nexpect  that, during the referendum campaign proper,\r\n\r\nthey  will try to mount a sharp and intensive effort\r\n\r\nin  confusing  the  minds of the voters,  and  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  do so is quite considerable.  We  have\r\n\r\nnever  under-estimated the strength of their  ground\r\n\r\npropaganda  organisation. This last-minute  campaign\r\n\r\nwhich  they will mount will not succeed in  bringing\r\n\r\nthe  majority of voters against merger, but  it  may\r\n\r\nconfuse many people to such an extent that they  may\r\n\r\neasily be led into thinking that the best course  of\r\n\r\naction  for  them is to send in a blank paper  since\r\n\r\nthey are uncertain of the merits or demerits of  the\r\n\r\nissues  placed before them. They will  certainly  be\r\n\r\nencouraged by the Communists to do so,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  then the Communists will claim that this  blank\r\n\r\npaper  shows  support for the anti-merger  campaign.\r\n\r\nThe  truth,  of course, is that it shows nothing  of\r\n\r\nthe  sort. It merely shows that the people who  send\r\n\r\nin  blank  ballot papers are reduced to a  state  of\r\n\r\nindecision and that they are unable to make up their\r\n\r\nminds.  This  being  the case, it logically  follows\r\n\r\nthat  they are prepared to accept the decision which\r\n\r\ntheir  elected representatives in the  Assembly  had\r\n\r\nmade  on  the  main merger issue. There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nmorally  wrong  or constitutionally  wrong  in  this\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  blank  papers.  It  closes  a   vital\r\n\r\nloophole which the Communists can exploit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Nee Soon, in this connection,\r\n\r\nstated  that  if  a person were to draw  an  obscene\r\n\r\nmarking  on  a ballot paper, it would  be  wrong  to\r\n\r\ncount this as support for the Government. I heartily\r\n\r\nagree with him. The remedy is for him to propose  an\r\n\r\namendment whereby obscene markings on ballot  papers\r\n\r\ncan   be  considered  as  support  for  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis' point of view. Should he proceed with this\r\n\r\namendment, I would be gratified if he would indicate\r\n\r\njust  what kind of obscene symbol he considers  most\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  the  Bansan  Sosialis  anti-merger\r\n\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out yesterday the differences between a referendum and a general election. He pointed that in general the issues before a referendum are such that a decision one way or another cannot be construed as victory or defeat for the Government and, consequently, the Government does not resign on the result of a referendum. He has quoted examples - New Zealand and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThis  remark  has  been  distorted  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in the most mischievous way. They say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has stated that one of  the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  they  wished to resign after Hong Lim was  that\r\n\r\nthe  prospects  of  merger and  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nsolving  the basic problems of Singapore  were  then\r\n\r\nremote.  Consequently they claim that the Government\r\n\r\nshould resign when the referendum on merger is lost.\r\n\r\nThey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  went  further to insinuate that the Government\r\n\r\nhas lost confidence in itself and that we are merely\r\n\r\ntrying to hang on to power at all costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> How true!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is a tireless repetition\r\n\r\nof a falsehood that will deceive nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We can prove it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The people of Singapore do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  we  achieve any personal  benefit  by\r\n\r\nstaying  on  in  power.

We  remain  in\r\n\r\noffice  to  carry  out the pledge  we  made  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate, that we will reunify Singapore with  the\r\n\r\nmainland.  This is the basic political objective  of\r\n\r\nthe nationalist movement, and as nationalists we see\r\n\r\nthe great objective on the verge of realisation.  So\r\n\r\nwe shall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee merger through. The Communists and their stooges\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan Sosialis dread the moment of merger.\r\n\r\nWhat  misfortunes merger will bring upon their heads\r\n\r\nis  a matter that is now exercising their minds. The\r\n\r\nbrightest among them have a pretty good idea of what\r\n\r\nlies  ahead, and even the duffers are waking  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that something has gone awry  with  their\r\n\r\noriginal expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I return to the subject of the under-currents in this debate which have puzzled the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park. The hon. Member  is  not  a\r\n\r\nfool.  In  fact,  he  is,  I  understand,  eminently\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  his profession, and this  calls  for\r\n\r\nsome measure of ability. So if the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  is  puzzled, then it follows that  many  other\r\n\r\npeople  may  be puzzled. It is important, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  the position be clarified. One of the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is  unable   to\r\n\r\ncomprehend  the  position  is  that  he  takes   too\r\n\r\nlegalistic  a view of what this Assembly stands  for\r\n\r\nand  what  it  does  and how it should  do  it.  The\r\n\r\nconstitutional fiction is that this  Assembly  is  a\r\n\r\ngroup of honourable Members elected by the people to\r\n\r\ndeliberate  on  issues facing  the  country  and  to\r\n\r\narrive  at  the wisest decision in the interests  of\r\n\r\nall.  So  the Member for Farrer Park regards Members\r\n\r\nof  this  Assembly as a body of experts  and  laymen\r\n\r\nseriously   addressing  their  minds  to   a   legal\r\n\r\ndocument,  i.e, the  Bill  before  the  House.   He\r\n\r\nexpected  rational  arguments,  legal  analysis  and\r\n\r\nhonest debates. When he found that this was not what\r\n\r\nwas forthcoming, he was naturally puzzled. But if he\r\n\r\nwill  for  one  moment disregard the  constitutional\r\n\r\nfiction which I have described and instead look upon\r\n\r\nthe  present  proceedings in this House  as  another\r\n\r\nstep  in  the  fight between the nationalist  forces\r\n\r\nwanting  merger and the anti-nationalists - the  anti-merger  forces - represented  by  the  Communists  and their  stooges  in  the Barisan Sosialis,  then  the reason  for  the under-currents becomes obvious  and very clear. The anti-nationalist forces fight merger to  save  their own skins. But, as I have  explained before,   they  dare  not  oppose  merger  directly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have to resort to duplicity such  as\r\n\r\npretending they want more merger. Hence, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenormous  output  of double talk which  may  confuse\r\n\r\npeople  who accept what the Communists say at  their\r\n\r\nface  value. The simple fact of the matter  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have been fighting a losing battle  against\r\n\r\nmerger.  They have tried to undermine the Government\r\n\r\nthrough  all kinds of ways. I have already  referred\r\n\r\nto  Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in which they  suffered\r\n\r\nignominous  defeat  in  each and  every  round.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are now reduced to  such  a  state\r\n\r\nthat  they suspect a trap in each and every move  of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of the Member for Queenstown clearly\r\n\r\nshows his apprehensive state of mind. He sees poison\r\n\r\neven in the most innocuous clauses of the Bill.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is now like a frightened dog  that\r\n\r\nis  afraid even of its own shadow. This explains the\r\n\r\nquerulous, nervous and petulant approach to the Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the House. The Member for Farrer Park should,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not be misled by the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Nor by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He will have noted that the\r\n\r\nbouncing  confidence  of the early  days  when  they\r\n\r\nspoke  of  the  October  Revolution  has  completely\r\n\r\nvanished,  and we can hardly expect the position  to\r\n\r\nbe   otherwise,   for  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have\r\n\r\nblundered  from  one  debacle  to  another.

I hope that the Government\r\n\r\ncan at least show the minimum democratic spirit. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has made two points about this,\r\n\r\nand I regret it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the reason and motive of\r\n\r\nthe Government in introducing this Bill. We all know\r\n\r\nthat  the  reason  for the Bill  is  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment from the P.A.P. type of merger,  because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. type of merger has been strongly opposed\r\n\r\nby  Opposition Parties in this House, in  form,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type  of  merger has been approved  by  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The Minister for Finance made his speech  on\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  in a tone of regret. He also quoted  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park who spoke yesterday,  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Farrer Park had said that  even\r\n\r\nwithout  putting  the question to the  people  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, the Government had the right to carry on\r\n\r\nwith merger, since the Assembly had approved it.  He\r\n\r\nalso  said  that  that showed  the  courage  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the face of a Communist challenge.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that it is wrong, because as soon as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced the White Paper proposals  on\r\n\r\nmerger  and  asked for them to be  approved  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  the Government were faced with  criticism\r\n\r\nand  pressure  and opposition from  all  sides.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  found  it rather difficult  to  get  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper passed. That is why the Government  have\r\n\r\nthought of a new method, by bringing up this Bill to\r\n\r\ninform  the  people and to let them make  the  final\r\n\r\ndecision  on this question. That is the  motive  for\r\n\r\nbringing  up this Bill today, that is,  to  let  the\r\n\r\npeople  decide whether they want the P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  or  whether they do not want it.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Government should not ask the people  too  many\r\n\r\nquestions.

The first is that I hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will respect the spirit and principle\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill. In other words, the Bill is for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of letting the people decide whether or  not\r\n\r\nthey  like  the  P.A.P. type  of  merger,  and  the\r\n\r\nquestion  should  not include any irrelevancies.  If\r\n\r\nthey try to include other matters irrelevant to  the\r\n\r\nissue,  then  it will be contrary to  the  Bill,  in\r\n\r\nother  words,  they will be trying  to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople, i.e., they will be making things  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the  people, so that the people  will  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hope is that Government will withdraw\r\n\r\none of the amendments introduced by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs. The amendment says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose ballot paper -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is unmarked; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is uncertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall  be  deemed to be a person who accepts  or  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to  accept the decision of the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  very  unreasonable.

Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nU.P.P, supports the Referendum Bill  in  principle.\r\n\r\nThere  are  several undemocratic provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  which could be fought out if the Bill goes  to\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee.   Sir,  it   is   important   to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between these two issues. Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  to be put before the voter, and, secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  referendum machinery. We should not  waste  too\r\n\r\nmuch   time  in  discussing  the  details   of   the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  because that will  only  help  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P, to  confuse  the  people.  The  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Referendum Bill can be fought  out\r\n\r\nin  Select Committee. We should put all our energies\r\n\r\ninto  pressing the Government to set up an All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee to decide on the question to be put before\r\n\r\nthe people. The vital issue is, what is the question\r\n\r\nto be put before the people? If the people are asked\r\n\r\nby  the  Government to choose whether  they  like  a\r\n\r\nrotten duck egg or a rotten chicken egg, what is the\r\n\r\ndifference if the Opposition is allowed not one week\r\n\r\nto canvass but even one year to canvass? That is why\r\n\r\nmy colleague, the Member for Hong Lim, has asked for\r\n\r\ntwo things. First, an All-Party meeting to decide on\r\n\r\nthe  question  to  be put before  the  people,  and,\r\n\r\nsecond,  the details of the Referendum Bill  can  be\r\n\r\nthrashed  out in Select Committee. We can spend  two\r\n\r\nweeks  seeking publicity and, therefore, arguing  on\r\n\r\nthe  details of the referendum machinery. But if  it\r\n\r\nis  the Government which decides the question to  be\r\n\r\nput  before the people for a vote, what is  the  use\r\n\r\neven if we have the most democratic machinery in the\r\n\r\nworld?  Are Members of the Opposition going to  tell\r\n\r\nthe  people at mass meetings, over the radio and  to\r\n\r\nthe  Press,  and  by house-to-house canvassing  that\r\n\r\nthey  prefer  a rotten chicken egg to a rotten  duck\r\n\r\negg? The only provision in the Referendum Bill which\r\n\r\nrequires our present attention is the amendment  pro\r\n\r\nposed by the Government to consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  people  who abstain from voting  for  either  a\r\n\r\nrotten  duck egg or a rotten chicken egg  as  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  voted for a rotten egg, just because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  prefers a rotten duck egg. This  is  not\r\n\r\nonly absurd but stupid. Sir, the Bill should be sent\r\n\r\nto  Select  Committee so that we  do  not  help  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to confuse the real issue. The real issue is,\r\n\r\nwhat is the question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nBill before us is a Bill of vital importance.

That is not true,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  all  the amendments of the Opposition  were\r\n\r\nsubmitted before the postponement. He also said that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is not going to bear the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  any delay in passing this Bill. That is a  very\r\n\r\nirresponsible remark, because the P.A.P. has already\r\n\r\ndelayed the Bill for two months and is now trying to\r\n\r\nrefer  the Bill to a Select Committee. Now they  say\r\n\r\nthey want the Bill to go to a Select Committee. That\r\n\r\nshows  they are democratic enough. But the important\r\n\r\npoint  is not whether the Bill is going to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee or not. The important point is whether the\r\n\r\nviews  of the public will be accepted in the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. As we have seen before, the views of  the\r\n\r\npublic submitted to the Government are not accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says the P.A.P. can go on with its proposed merger. But he must remember that the people of Singapore want a true merger and not the P.A.P. type of merger. They want a merger whereby all the citizens of Singapore can become citizens of the Federation. But in the P.A.P. type of merger it is not so. Sir, during the last general election the people elected the P.A.P. but not\r\n\r\nbecause they supported the P.A.P. merger alone. They\r\n\r\nsupported the P.A.P. in many things. Sir, it is just\r\n\r\nlike  two eggs, one good and one rotten. During  the\r\n\r\ngeneral election the P.A.P. gave a good egg and sold\r\n\r\nto the people, saying, \"I'll give you the good egg.\"\r\n\r\nAfter  they were elected, they gave a rotten egg  to\r\n\r\nthe people, and the people certainly refused it.  If\r\n\r\nI  had  a rotten egg here, I would throw it over  to\r\n\r\nthat side and ask them to taste -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

What the P.A.P. wants in this\r\n\r\nBill  is  this. If the people fail to go  and  vote,\r\n\r\nthey  will be fined. If they go and vote, they  must\r\n\r\nvote   for  the  P.A.P. because  the  question   is\r\n\r\nsuch - whether they vote A or B; if they vote A,  they\r\n\r\nwill die; and if they vote B, they will also die. So\r\n\r\ntile people might choose to put a blank ballot paper\r\n\r\nin  the  box. But once they put blank ballot  papers\r\n\r\ninto  the box that also will support the P.A.P.  But\r\n\r\nif they are so angry that they tear the ballot paper\r\n\r\ninto two parts, they will be fined or imprisoned for\r\n\r\ntwo years. From this we can see how undemocratic the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

But\r\n\r\nyou  will agree, Sir, from what we have beard,  that\r\n\r\nthere  are many matters and clauses which  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  acceptable  to  the  Opposition.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  has  shown disagreement  in  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthings  and we too disagree with two amendments,  in\r\n\r\nspite of the Minister for Finance's attempt to prove\r\n\r\nto  us, in respect of the blank votes, that they are\r\n\r\nto prevent abuse of the referendum by the Communists\r\n\r\nand,  to  quote  him  also, by the  stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. We feel that whatever the excuses,\r\n\r\nit   will   not   justify   Government   introducing\r\n\r\nundemocratic  means of carrying out the  referendum.\r\n\r\nWe  have other objections, Sir, which we will  raise\r\n\r\nwhen the time comes, but I would like to remind  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  this  Referendum Bill will  become  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  not  only in respect of  the  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  questions, but also as  the  machinery  to\r\n\r\nfind  out the views of the public on other important\r\n\r\nnational  matters. Therefore, we must see that  this\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, when it becomes an Ordinance,  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  democratic machinery dealing out justice  for\r\n\r\nall  concerned. We have our chance here. We sat  for\r\n\r\ntwo  months or three months the last time,  debating\r\n\r\nmerger  and  airing our views. We  can  debate  this\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill thoroughly. Sir, the public too have\r\n\r\ntheir  objections and their views. They too want  to\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na say in this matter which is of national importance\r\n\r\nand  which is going to affect the lives of  everyone\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Therefore, I  do  not  see  why  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is against the idea  of  referring\r\n\r\nthis  Bill to a Select Committee in order  that  the\r\n\r\npublic may have a chance to air their views. I  will\r\n\r\nrepeat, we have our chance here, but the public  are\r\n\r\nnot entitled to come here and air their views unless\r\n\r\nwe refer this Bill to a Select Committee. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnormal  parliamentary  practice  that  Bills  of  an\r\n\r\nimportant and far-reaching character are referred to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committees.  I  cannot  understand  why  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis should be against this, especially\r\n\r\nwhen they are not satisfied with the Bill. Could  it\r\n\r\nbe  that  they  feel that the public should  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  chance to air their views, or  have  their\r\n\r\nviews  considered by the Select Committee? Or is  it\r\n\r\nthat  by  referring the Bill to a Select  Committee,\r\n\r\nthere  is  very  restricted opportunity  of  playing\r\n\r\npolitics? I am sorry to have to say that,  Sir,  but\r\n\r\nfrom  what we have seen last night, there have  been\r\n\r\nattempts made to exploit the plight of fire  victims\r\n\r\nfor  political propaganda. I am not surprised,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan Sosialis, as I have said before,  is  a\r\n\r\nsplinter  P.A.P. They have got their  training  from\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Therefore, they  play  the  same  game.\r\n\r\nWhatever  it is, no matter how important a  national\r\n\r\nproblem  it is, there will always be party  politics\r\n\r\nfirst.  The Barisan Sosialis say that if we  have  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, what is the use? Is the Government\r\n\r\ngoing  to  implement  or give consideration  to  the\r\n\r\nopinions  of  the public? If the public  give  their\r\n\r\nopinions,  would  the  Government  give   them   any\r\n\r\nconsideration? Sir, the point is to give the  public\r\n\r\na  chance  to air their views. When they have  aired\r\n\r\ntheir  views, those views will be published  in  the\r\n\r\nreport  of  the Select Committee.

He  has\r\n\r\nno views whatsoever on the amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for\r\n\r\nyour indication, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the debate on this Bill\r\n\r\nover  the  past  few  days has produced  two  facts.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the political principles of the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ngone  bankrupt. Secondly, the P.A.P. is  trying  to\r\n\r\nadopt cunning political tactics again to deceive the\r\n\r\npeople.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in order to substantiate\r\n\r\nthese  two  facts, I feel obliged to quote  passages\r\n\r\nfrom  the speeches made by Members in this House  in\r\n\r\nthe  past few days. In the first place, I would like\r\n\r\nto  say  that the political principles of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  al, ready gone bankrupt. How can I prove this?\r\n\r\nWell,  I  would like to quote from the Sin Chew  Jit\r\n\r\nPoh  as reported in page 1 concerning the amendments\r\n\r\nto be moved by the Minister for Home Affairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main point of these amendments is that if a\r\n\r\nblank  vote is cast by a voter, or if there  is  any\r\n\r\nuncertainty about the vote itself,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  if there is an uncertain mark on the vote,  then\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government will deem it to be a vote  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Government.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>From  this point, we can safely say that we must  do\r\n\r\nwhat  is right to get the support of the people  and\r\n\r\nthat   we   cannot  deceive  them  with   irrational\r\n\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said that the political\r\n\r\nprinciples   of  the  P.A.P. have  gone   bankrupt.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the P.A.P. have come to know that their\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  regard to merger and  other  deceitful\r\n\r\nactivities  relating thereto are really unreasonable\r\n\r\nand  cannot stand up to argument. So I feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for me to remind the P.A.P.  Members,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  leaders,  that  their  unreasonable\r\n\r\ntheories  and  reactionary  arguments  have  already\r\n\r\nestranged  them  from the people. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nadvise  them  that they should stop their  political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to expand my second point, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to quote the speech made by the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister yesterday. He raised certain  points\r\n\r\nto  show that the Government were trying to  play  a\r\n\r\ngame in order to achieve merger. He replied directly\r\n\r\nto  the  Chairman of my Party who said that when  he\r\n\r\nwas closely related to the P.A.P. leaders he knew of\r\n\r\ntheir  hypocrisy, and that was why he was keeping  a\r\n\r\nclose  eye  on  their behaviour.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  raised  certain points  in  reply  to  the\r\n\r\ndoubts  raised by my Party Chairman. He did this  in\r\n\r\norder  to  divert attention from the real issue.  My\r\n\r\nParty  Chairman  wanted to know  the  basis  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion  to  be posed to the people: whether  there\r\n\r\nwould  be one, two or three questions. He said  that\r\n\r\nit would be ideal for the House to study the wording\r\n\r\nof  the question to be put to the people in order to\r\n\r\nsatisfy all the Parties concerned and to hold a just\r\n\r\nreferendum  for  the people. But  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister refused to agree to our request. Instead he\r\n\r\nquoted  examples from other countries to  show  that\r\n\r\nthere had been no precedent where the wording of the\r\n\r\nquestion  was  the responsibility of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties.   He   said   it  has   always   been   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  Government  to   word   the\r\n\r\nquestion  that is to be posed to the people.  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  this is not right. It has been pointed out  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  that two questions may be  posed  to  the\r\n\r\npeople:  \"Do  the  people want the  P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger? Or do the people want a merger on the  basis\r\n\r\nof Penang or Malacca?\". If these questions are to be\r\n\r\nposed,  it will mean that the P.A.P. will be  placed\r\n\r\nin  a  very  advantageous position  over  the  other\r\n\r\nParties.  If  the people are to be asked  to  choose\r\n\r\nbetween  these two questions, they will very  likely\r\n\r\nwant  to  put in blank votes because, no matter  how\r\n\r\nthey  vote, they will be supporting the P.A.P. type\r\n\r\nof  merger. So it is important for me to expose this\r\n\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noticed that there is an issue arising\r\n\r\nout  of the two points raised by the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim.   At  the  last  sitting,  I  learned  from   a\r\n\r\nconversation  between some Members of the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower  and myself that it was most likely  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions would be framed in this manner. The people\r\n\r\nwould  be asked whether they want to have the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype  of merger or a merger in which Singapore would\r\n\r\nbe going in on the basis of Penang or Malacca. I say\r\n\r\nthat  in whatever form these two questions are  put,\r\n\r\nthey  mean the same thing. So I told them that  they\r\n\r\nwould be deceiving the people. In reply, I was  told\r\n\r\nthat  the  Barisan  Sosialis themselves  raised  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  Singapore going in  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  or Malacca. Then I told them that it is  our\r\n\r\nParty  stand to have a type of merger in  which  all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens will automatically become Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  after  Merger Day. I even told  them  that\r\n\r\nthere is some difference between the merger we  have\r\n\r\nin  mind  and  merger  on the  basis  of  Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it necessary to persuade the leaders of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to perform more good deeds for the people  so\r\n\r\nthat they can have a good name later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to deal with the points raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance. Two of  my  colleagues  have\r\n\r\ndealt  with certain points he raised, but I feel  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  that  I should deal  with  his  other\r\n\r\npoints.  The  Minister for Finance  touched  on  two\r\n\r\npoints  which  were more or less  similar  to  those\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Deputy Prime Minister. I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister is a more honest and  a  less\r\n\r\ncunning   person  than  the  Minister  for  Finance,\r\n\r\nbecause  the latter said that there were  Communists\r\n\r\nin   the   Barisan  Sosialis.  This   was   actually\r\n\r\nirrelevant  to the Bill, and I could see  that  you,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, were quite impatient with what  he\r\n\r\nwas saying and you even had occasion to pull him up.\r\n\r\nHe  is  very cunning but he can only fool the people\r\n\r\nonce,  and  not  all  the time.  If  any  Member  is\r\n\r\nsuccessful in fooling anybody once, then  the  other\r\n\r\npeople will be keeping an eye on him in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ngreatly exaggerated certain details. He says  he  is\r\n\r\nan   expert   in   law  and  he  knows   all   about\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. From my point of view,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view of the people, I say  it  is\r\n\r\nall  a  bluff.  Although it is true  that  a  lawyer\r\n\r\nshould know law, he should not play with the law.  I\r\n\r\ncan  point  out here that yesterday when the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park made his speech, he  attacked  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and distorted the worries  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis as a sort of under-current between\r\n\r\nus  and  the  P.A.P.  He  even  levelled  criticisms\r\n\r\nagainst  our representatives, especially the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon who said that the people  were\r\n\r\nawakened  politic, ally and so there  should  be  no\r\n\r\nfear on our part about the national referendum.  But\r\n\r\nwe are here to point out the Undemocratic provisions\r\n\r\nof  the National Referendum Bill. We feel it is  the\r\n\r\nduty  of  the people's representatives to do  so  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. The Member for Mount-batten also agrees\r\n\r\nwith   us   that   there  are  certain  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill. From this we can  see  that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park has the same attitude  as\r\n\r\nmost  reactionary people in the P.A.P, have. I would\r\n\r\nlike to prove my point in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year before last I was still in the P.A.P. At\r\n\r\nthat time the Member for Cairnhill was trying to get\r\n\r\nus around - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have, in fact, been very\r\n\r\npatient.

But in order to\r\n\r\nprevent the Minister for Finance from confusing  the\r\n\r\npeople,  I  will  say that when he  was  making  his\r\n\r\nspeech he was just rambling on about the Communists,\r\n\r\nthis and that, in order to confuse the people. So  I\r\n\r\nwas just trying to explain his intention so that the\r\n\r\npeople will not fall into his trap. At this juncture\r\n\r\nI  had to mention the Member for Farrer Park because\r\n\r\nthe  manner of his speech was the same as that of  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Member,  because they  have  already  become\r\n\r\nallies. We can see they always agree on major issues\r\n\r\nin this House. So I was just bringing up these facts\r\n\r\nto prove my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Up to that point, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu is probably just about in order. But\r\n\r\nif  he goes into instances of how, to his mind,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park is reactionary, then  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing completely far away from the Bill. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  has made his point. Will he please now  come\r\n\r\nback  to  the  general merits and principle  of  the\r\n\r\nBill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I will accept your ruling not to elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthis  point.  In  any case, I feel I should  explain\r\n\r\ncertain  points raised by the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nwhen he talked about the under-currents between  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the P.A.P. Let us now view  it\r\n\r\nthe  other way round. These so-called under-currents\r\n\r\nbetween the P.A.P. and the Barisan is a term used by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park. I say there are no under-currents  whatsoever  existing  between  these   two\r\n\r\nParties. It is a question of whether or not we  have\r\n\r\nthe  real intention of serving the people. We in the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis were formerly in the P.A.P. We were\r\n\r\nelected  by the people on the same platform  and  we\r\n\r\nmade many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection  pledges during the general  elections.  We\r\n\r\ntalked  about how to serve the people in their  best\r\n\r\ninterest.  All these are the pledges  we  made.  But\r\n\r\nsince  the P.A.P. came to power, they have  entirely\r\n\r\nforgotten about their election pledges. So if  there\r\n\r\nare  any  under-currents at all, these will  be  the\r\n\r\nunder-currents. The question is whether  or  not  we\r\n\r\nwant  to serve the people. If you want to serve  the\r\n\r\npeople, there should not be any unnecessary dispute\r\n\r\nor  argument. But the leaders of the P.A.P. have  no\r\n\r\nintention to serve the people.

Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, for the information of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, a referendum is a constitutional device by\r\n\r\nwhich a controversial issue of public importance can\r\n\r\nbe  put  by  the Government to the people for  their\r\n\r\nconsideration and decision. There must be  a  proper\r\n\r\norganisation   provided  by  law   to   enable   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  put the issue to the electorate  and\r\n\r\nthere  must be adequate safeguards provided  by  the\r\n\r\nlaw  to ensure that the vote of the people is  taken\r\n\r\nin  a fair and just manner. This is exactly what the\r\n\r\nBill  before the House sets out to do. Machinery  is\r\n\r\nbeing provided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  this  Bill to enable  the  referendum  on\r\n\r\nmerger to be held in a fair and just manner. But the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  are accusing  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nwanting to wreck the machinery of the referendum, to\r\n\r\nset  booby-traps  for them and for  the  electorate.\r\n\r\nThey  have demanded that the issue of the referendum\r\n\r\non merger should be set not by the Government but by\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly. The issue of  merger  has\r\n\r\nalready  been debated at very great length  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  On  the  Government's motion  asking  the\r\n\r\nHouse to affirm and declare that the first objective\r\n\r\nof  all  true  patriots of Malaya is to achieve  the\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories in a merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  moved an amendment calling for  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  for Singapore with the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  entering  the  Federation  as   the\r\n\r\ntwelfth    State   and   with   all   its   citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger\r\n\r\nDay.  On  the  6th  of December last  year,  as  all\r\n\r\nMembers  will remember, after the amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  was defeated in  the  House,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson moved for the adjournment  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  original  motion.  When  this   was\r\n\r\nrefused,  the  Barisan Sosialis walked  out  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly with the Member for  Anson  and\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of  the  United People's  Party.  They\r\n\r\nwalked  out  of  the Assembly in the knowledge  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  also on the Order Paper for  debate  the\r\n\r\nmotion  of  the Prime Minister on the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia and on the White Paper on the reunification\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and the Federation of  Malaya.  I  am\r\n\r\nmentioning  all  this, Sir, to show to  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   that  they  have  had  more  than   ample\r\n\r\nopportunity to say all that they had wanted  to  say\r\n\r\non  the issue of merger in this Assembly. It is  now\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  the Government to put  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nmerger  to  the  people  as clearly  and  simply  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  to ask them to make up  their  minds.\r\n\r\nSurely  the  Barisan Sosialis are not now  demanding\r\n\r\nthat  there should be yet a more lengthy  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  merger  in  this  House.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  why they should now seek to press  their\r\n\r\nclaims  for a further debate on this issue  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly when they themselves walked out when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion which I have just referred to was before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  It  is  now quite obvious that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have worked themselves into such a frame of\r\n\r\nmind  that they see booby-traps where none, in fact,\r\n\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, who is a very astute\r\n\r\npolitician, has reminded the House that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  in one of their many shifting  stands  on\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  merger,  have advocated  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be merger on the same terms as for Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca,  and that if they were to be held  to  this\r\n\r\nstand,  the consequences in the referendum  held  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue  might be rather unfortunate  for  them.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not be so. However, they cannot,  in\r\n\r\nall fairness, claim that where such stands were made\r\n\r\nof  their  own  volition on the  merger  issue,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have laid traps for them.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nlogic and sense in such imputations? In framing  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  merger,  it is quite legitimate  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to draw the attention of the  electorate\r\n\r\nin  very simple terms to what the implications would\r\n\r\nbe for themselves if they voted in a particular way.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing unconstitutional in providing  for\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to deal with the objections of the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson and the Barisan Sosialis to the two\r\n\r\nnew  provisions  of  the Bill, on  the  counting  of\r\n\r\nunmarked and uncertain ballots tendered by voters in\r\n\r\nthe  referendum, and on the presumption of law  that\r\n\r\npersons  entering  or seen to enter  more  than  two\r\n\r\nhouses  or  places of work of electors in  the  same\r\n\r\npolling  district  other than  their  own  homes  or\r\n\r\nplaces  of  work on polling day, shall, unless  they\r\n\r\nprove  to  the  contrary, be presumed to  have  been\r\n\r\nguilty   of  canvassing  on  polling  day.  In   the\r\n\r\nSingapore     Legislative    Elections    Ordinance,\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting has been provided for. The name of\r\n\r\na person whose name is in the electoral register and\r\n\r\nwho  fails to' vote on polling day is taken  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  electoral register and put in a separate  list.\r\n\r\nHe  has then to apply for restoration of his name on\r\n\r\nto  the  electoral register. If he has a good reason\r\n\r\nfor not voting in the general election, his name  is\r\n\r\nput  back  on the electoral register after  inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut if he has no good reason for having failed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  vote, he must first pay a fine of $5 before  his\r\n\r\nname  is  restored to the electoral  register.  Sir,\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting as such is against the  grain  in\r\n\r\nthe  liberal  tradition of democratic  parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocedures.  But  yet it has had  to  be  introduced\r\n\r\nlocally.  In the same way, the Government  would  be\r\n\r\nfailing  in  their duty to the people and  would  be\r\n\r\nacting foolishly if they did not take the elementary\r\n\r\nprecaution  of preventing the referendum from  being\r\n\r\nmanipulated by what would amount to a boycott of the\r\n\r\nreferendum  through  the  tendering  of  blank   and\r\n\r\nunmarked  ballot  papers which can be  organised  to\r\n\r\nserve the ends of those Communists and pro-Communist\r\n\r\ngroups  who  are hostile to merger.  This  issue  of\r\n\r\nmerger  is  of  vital concern to  every  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  on  such  a  vital  issue   it   is\r\n\r\nreasonable to provide that those who cannot make  up\r\n\r\ntheir minds will be deemed to accept the decision of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly on the matter referred for\r\n\r\nthe  referendum. Sir, all voters are completely free\r\n\r\nagents  to make up their minds as they please.  They\r\n\r\nare  free  to go to the polling station to  vote  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  or to keep away. They  will  not  be\r\n\r\npressured  into  voting in any particular  way.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  they cast their vote, they must make up  their\r\n\r\nminds.   It  would  be  making  a  mockery  of   the\r\n\r\nreferendum  procedure on such a  vital  issue  if  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  were  to  tender a ballot paper  indicating\r\n\r\nthat  he had no views of the issue or that his views\r\n\r\nwere  uncertain.  If that were truly  his  state  of\r\n\r\nmind,  there is nothing to prevent him from  keeping\r\n\r\naway from the polling station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the presumption of law, to which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has  taken exception, is  just  a  legal\r\n\r\npresumption  to  ensure that  there  can  be  proper\r\n\r\nenforcement of the law against canvassing on polling\r\n\r\nday.  Without such a legal presumption, it would  be\r\n\r\nmore difficult to enforce the law against canvassing\r\n\r\non  polling day. Sir, there is no intention  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Government  to  lay  booby-traps  for\r\n\r\nanybody.  I  commend this Bill to  the  House  as  a\r\n\r\nreasonable and fair measure providing the  machinery\r\n\r\nwhereby   the  views  of  the  electorate   can   be\r\n\r\nascertained,  in a just and proper manner  when  the\r\n\r\nreferendum on merger is held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have\r\n\r\nexplained  at  great length about  the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill and I am not going to  touch\r\n\r\non  them  again. Just now the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned  that we object to  this  Bill  being\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  a Select Committee. I  feel  she  has\r\n\r\nmisunderstood us. Our feeling is that if  this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  committed  to  a Select Committee,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nblamed  for  delaying its passage,  because  it  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  two months ago. Why was it not  referred\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee two months ago? It has  been\r\n\r\ndelayed for two months. We do not want the people to\r\n\r\nsay  that we are the cause of the delay of this Bill\r\n\r\nbeing  passed  in  this  House.  Secondly,  we   are\r\n\r\ndebating  the  merits and demerits of this  Bill  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  people could understand the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions  therein. There are  provisions  in  this\r\n\r\nBill  which are meant to deceive the people.  If  we\r\n\r\nrefer  this  Bill to a Select Committee, the  people\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to see the true picture  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  and  the  debate in this House as  to  who  is\r\n\r\nwrong. We know that if this Bill is committed  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, it means we will have to waste  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  time. If this Bill is committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, there will be a very thick report and the\r\n\r\npeople do not have the time to study the defects and\r\n\r\nthe  undemocratic provisions of this Bill,  and  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and Opinions advanced by  the  people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in this House. We welcome  reference\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill to a Select Committee so as to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  people  to air their views on it  provided  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can assure us that the views put  forward\r\n\r\nby  the  people  will  be  accepted  by  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Why did the Government delay  this  Bill\r\n\r\nfor more than two months? Why did the Government not\r\n\r\nrefer  this  Bill to a Select Committee earlier?  In\r\n\r\ndebating this Bill, we want the people to know  what\r\n\r\nwill  happen to their future if this Bill is passed,\r\n\r\nand to make sure that they are not being sold out by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. In principle, we do not oppose this\r\n\r\nBill being committed to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.

However, our Party Chairman has said  that\r\n\r\nwe will abstain from voting when the motion to refer\r\n\r\nthis  Bill to a Select Committee is put to the vote.\r\n\r\nFrom  talking about the merits and demerits of  this\r\n\r\nBill, we know that the Government did not originally\r\n\r\nwant  to introduce this Bill because the members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party  in power had conflicts among themselves.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the Back-benchers have been criticised  by\r\n\r\nthe  people.

This ought to be a  simple\r\n\r\nand  meaningful  Bill.  Its purpose  is  to  reunite\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya. This  Bill,\r\n\r\nlaying  down  the procedure for holding  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum, can be said to have been introduced  for\r\n\r\nthe  first time in the history of Singapore. If  the\r\n\r\nBill  is passed, we can use it as a means of getting\r\n\r\nthe  views  of the people. We can say it is  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  means  of testing the views and  sounding  the\r\n\r\nopinions  of the people. We can say that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  an  open-minded and responsible  Government.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  anything important which will affect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people, we will let them  decide.\r\n\r\nThat  is why today we have brought this Bill to this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech made by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs, we  can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have accepted various amendments  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties. The Member  for  Queenstown  is\r\n\r\nrather  worried, uncertain and unsafe when he  finds\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.  Government have  introduced  this\r\n\r\nBill. He will cast doubts and suspicions on anything\r\n\r\nwhich  is  introduced  by us for  the  good  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Actually this Bill is quite different  from\r\n\r\nthe   Legislative   Assembly  Elections   Ordinance.\r\n\r\nBecause of his worries and his disposition,  he  has\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary to propose some  amendments  in\r\n\r\norder  to  console his own spirit and soul.  He  has\r\n\r\nraised the point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  polling agents and counting agents  should  be\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the  political  Parties.  As  polling\r\n\r\nagents  and  counting  agents are  rather  important\r\n\r\npeople in a referendum, the Government have accepted\r\n\r\nthe amendments to effect this. The political Parties\r\n\r\nwill  have  a chance to nominate such people  to  be\r\n\r\nstationed  at the various polling stations  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can be rest assured that there will not be  any\r\n\r\nfoul play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has also suggested that\r\n\r\nthe  sealing of ballot boxes should also be done  by\r\n\r\nthe  agents  with their party seals. The  Government\r\n\r\nhave also accepted this suggestion. But the language\r\n\r\nused  by  certain Opposition Members in  criticising\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  rather  clever. They  can  give  very\r\n\r\neloquent  speeches in this House, but if we  analyse\r\n\r\nwhat they have said, we can see that they are merely\r\n\r\nshouting  empty  slogans. They hope to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople  on the question which will gradually  affect\r\n\r\nthe livelihood and future of the people. They try to\r\n\r\ncreate the impression that the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\nan   undemocratic  Government,  in  order  to  cause\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding among the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I remember there was a story prevailing among the Chinese folks. It tells of two painters. On a certain occasion they went to a temple to try and compete with each other to see who could draw a snake faster and more like a snake. This was to show who was better than the other. That was the chief purpose of the competition. They invited the elders of the village and many others to\r\n\r\nwitness their competition. One of the artists was an\r\n\r\nimpetuous  and  hot-tempered youth.  The  other  was\r\n\r\nrather  dispassionate  and  more  rational  in   his\r\n\r\nthinking.  When  the youth had completed  drawing  a\r\n\r\nsnake  on the wall, he found that the other  painter\r\n\r\nhad  not  completed his drawing. He found there  was\r\n\r\nample  time  to add four legs to the snake  to  show\r\n\r\nthat he could do better and that he had done it much\r\n\r\nfaster  than  the  other chap. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsimilarly  are also trying to show they  are  better\r\n\r\nthan  the  P.A.P.  Government by  doing  unnecessary\r\n\r\nthings.  Their attitude is just as what I have  just\r\n\r\nnow described. They are like the impetuous youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever  they may try to argue and to make speeches,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot hope to confuse and mislead the people.\r\n\r\nThey  will  never succeed. They brag about  theories\r\n\r\nand  principles. They say they support the  Bill  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,   but  certain  provisions  therein   are\r\n\r\nundemocratic. They have misunderstood the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of  this Bill.  If  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is  to  be  interpreted  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, they will say, \"We are the masters and you\r\n\r\nare  our subjects. We shall rule over you.\" That  is\r\n\r\ntheir  concept of parliamentary democracy. They  say\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  limiting the  people's  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech.  This  is a very strange argument.  How  can\r\n\r\nthis  be  possible?  If this were  so,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis would not have been able to speak  in  the\r\n\r\nmany  rallies  that they have held. There  are  many\r\n\r\ninstances to show how they have acted. The  property\r\n\r\nof some P.A.P. branches have been taken away and yet\r\n\r\nthey say the P.A.P. is undemocratic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The Barisan Sosialis think\r\n\r\nthat the people can be fooled by their lies. I think\r\n\r\nthis has something to do with principle.

Sir,  we\r\n\r\nknow that the debate on the merger motion took quite\r\n\r\na  long  time.  Many people outside the  House  were\r\n\r\nconfused  by the lengthy debate which took place  in\r\n\r\nthis  House so that in the end they were  not  clear\r\n\r\nabout the whole picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the criticism that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  be  giving the Opposition Parties insufficient\r\n\r\ntime,  the Member for Queenstown says that his Party\r\n\r\nwill  be restricted in their propaganda campaign  to\r\n\r\nprepare for the national referendum. I believe  they\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  show that they are  supporting  the\r\n\r\nprinciple,  but  in  fact  they  are  opposing  many\r\n\r\nthings. They have accused the P.A.P. of selling  out\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the people. The strange thing is that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis Members  speak  in  the  same\r\n\r\nfashion  as Mao Tse-tung who is thousands  of  miles\r\n\r\naway.  Even  Chairman Mao who had  sworn  under  the\r\n\r\npicture  of  Stalin  has never  dared  to  criticise\r\n\r\ncertain things.

That is why the  debate  on\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  has taken two days and it is  likely  to\r\n\r\ntake some more time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Home Affairs, the\r\n\r\ncontents   of  this  Bill  have  been   drafted   in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  spirit  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance.  We  have\r\n\r\nlooked  through  this Bill and  we  have  found  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  provisions to be quite  different\r\n\r\nfrom  those  in  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance.  We can  see  there  are  many\r\n\r\nundemocratic principles in the Bill before us today.\r\n\r\nThese  provisions  seek  to  restrict  further   the\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a national referendum is\r\n\r\ngenerally  taken as a good thing in other countries.\r\n\r\nThere  have been instances where national  referenda\r\n\r\nhave  been  held.  A  referendum  is  held  when   a\r\n\r\nresolution  has  been  passed  in  Parliament  whose\r\n\r\nMembers   themselves  are  not  sure  whether   they\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  people's opinion. That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nquestion  passed  in Parliament is referred  to  the\r\n\r\npeople for a final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of this Bill reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers\r\n\r\nthat it is in the public interest to do so he may by\r\n\r\norder  direct  that any matter he submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nelectors for a referendum.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>From  this  we are unable to know what  is  actually\r\n\r\nmeant by \"public interest\". Does the phrase refer to\r\n\r\nwhat is passed in this House or to a question to  be\r\n\r\nposed  by  the  Government for the decision  of  the\r\n\r\npeople?  So from this, we can see there has  been  a\r\n\r\ngreat  departure from the spirit of a true  national\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, there are\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the laws of other countries  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that if a resolution is passed in Parliament\r\n\r\nand  the people themselves feel that its passage  is\r\n\r\nnot  truly  representative  of  their  opinions  and\r\n\r\ndesires, they have the right\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  request  the  Governments  to  hold  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum.

I\r\n\r\nbelieve you know that in the history of Singapore  a\r\n\r\nBill    concerning   a   national   referendum    is\r\n\r\nunprecedented.  It is the first of its  type  before\r\n\r\nthis House. That is because we are an infant in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of democracy. The people are just beginning\r\n\r\nto experience a national referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in the Bill saying that\r\n\r\nwithin  a period of seven days, a decision  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  people.  I  say  this  provision  is\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  Let  me give an  example.  Under  the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution the people were given the  first\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  vote their own representatives  and\r\n\r\nthey  knew their sacred duty. But at that time there\r\n\r\nwere  still  some people who were not aware  of  the\r\n\r\nsignificance and the effect of their votes. So there\r\n\r\nwas the necessity for an explanation to be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  people over a long period of time - telling  them\r\n\r\nthe  importance and significance of the  votes  they\r\n\r\nwere  going  to cast, and which might  affect  their\r\n\r\ndestiny. So I say that this provision of seven  days\r\n\r\nis  far too short. There is no other provision as to\r\n\r\nwhether  there is any allowance for meetings  to  be\r\n\r\nheld. This is very undemocratic because it does  not\r\n\r\nenable  the people to understand and grasp the  real\r\n\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past three days, from\r\n\r\nthe  speeches made by Members of the Government  and\r\n\r\nMinisters,   we  are  unable  to  say  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have any intention of withdrawing  these\r\n\r\nunnecessary and undemocratic provisions contained in\r\n\r\ntheir   amendments.  If  the  Government   have   no\r\n\r\nintention    whatsoever   of    withdrawing    these\r\n\r\nunreasonable provisions, then I will say  that  this\r\n\r\nshow  of democracy by ascertaining the views of  the\r\n\r\npeople outside this House will not lead us anywhere.\r\n\r\nIt  does no good at all. If the Government insist on\r\n\r\nincluding    the   unnecessary   and    unreasonable\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill, it only goes to  show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are just having a show of democracy by  saying\r\n\r\nthat  they want to ascertain the views of the people\r\n\r\nbefore they do anything decisive. I say this attempt\r\n\r\nis  just made to prolong the democratic process  and\r\n\r\nto  force the people to choose a thing which they do\r\n\r\nnot like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ardently hope that the Government will give a\r\n\r\nclear-cut  indication whether they are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw such undemocratic provisions which you  can\r\n\r\nnever  find  in  other democratic countries  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   In  the  meantime,  the  Government  should\r\n\r\nshoulder  all  the consequences as a result  of  the\r\n\r\ndelay of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, at the last sitting in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  there  has been  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nhypocritical  exhortation about  democracy  and  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process  made by the  Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\npeople  who  are the least qualified to  talk  about\r\n\r\ndemocracy. They have invoked democracy to  establish\r\n\r\nthe  right of Communists to cause confusion,  spread\r\n\r\nfalsehoods, and try to prevent merger. They are  the\r\n\r\nvery  people who are furthest removed from the ideal\r\n\r\nof  government  by  the free  will  of  the  people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Member for Thomson has forgotten  that\r\n\r\nduring the P.A.P. conference in May last year, after\r\n\r\nthe  Hong  Lim  by-election, he  was  the  strongest\r\n\r\nadvocate for taking the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCuban line. Like Fidel Castro, he strongly advocated\r\n\r\nthe  abolition  of  all future  elections  as  being\r\n\r\nunnecessary  and  stupid.  The  Member   for   Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  was then trying to dissuade my colleagues\r\n\r\nand   I  from  ever  contemplating  resignation  and\r\n\r\nreturning  the mandate to the people. At that  time,\r\n\r\nwith  no  merger and no common commodity  market  in\r\n\r\nview,  we  saw  no political solution to  our  basic\r\n\r\nproblems of economic expansion. The Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  went  so  far as to  say  that  what  was\r\n\r\nimportant  was not whether the people knew  that  we\r\n\r\nwere doing good for them, but whether, in fact, what\r\n\r\nwe  were  doing  was good for them.  He  capped  his\r\n\r\nargument  by  saying  that  if  Mao  Tse-tung,   the\r\n\r\nChairman of the People's Republic of China,  had  to\r\n\r\nstand  for  election  after  the  hardships  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  communes, he would probably have  lost  his\r\n\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Referendum Bill has been brought in to\r\n\r\ndetermine the wish of the majority of the people  on\r\n\r\nthe  mode and manner of the inevitable reunification\r\n\r\nof  these  two  territories. To  put  it  in  proper\r\n\r\nperspective, let me remind the Barisan Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson that the Government are  under\r\n\r\nno  obligation,  morally  or  legally,  to  hold   a\r\n\r\nreferendum. We had a mandate from the people in June\r\n\r\n1959  in  clear and categorical terms  to  implement\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.   In  fact,  all  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen were elected on the P.A.P. platform, the\r\n\r\nmain  plank of which was merger. They had all signed\r\n\r\nsolemn  pledges  that  they  would  resign  if  they\r\n\r\ndeparted  from the Party programme and were expelled\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Party. Next we have a mandate  from  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  of 33 unanimous votes with no Assemblymen\r\n\r\nbeing bold enough to be present to vote against  the\r\n\r\nproposals  of merger contained in Paper Cmd.  33  of\r\n\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Communist front leader\r\n\r\nwho   is  manipulating  and  coordinating  Communist \r\n\r\npolicies  in the Barisan Sosialis and the  Communist \r\n\r\nfront unions, has openly told a meeting of Committee\r\n\r\nmembers of several union officials, who taxed him  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  this point, that the Government have full  legal\r\n\r\nand  constitutional rights once these proposals have\r\n\r\nbeen passed in the Assembly, to carry out the merger\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  with  the  Federation   of   Malaya.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  let  us be clear in our minds  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  under no compulsion  to  have  this\r\n\r\nreferendum and that there is no necessity to  resort\r\n\r\nto  trickery,  as  the  Member  for  Queenstown  has\r\n\r\nsuggested.  Later, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will  explain\r\n\r\nthe  considerations  which have led  the  Government\r\n\r\nfirmly  to  the view that a referendum on merger  is\r\n\r\nboth  desirable  and in the long-term  interests  of\r\n\r\npeaceful and stable conditions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at the outset make public the position of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and  of the Opposition Parties  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  merger and this referendum.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nUMNO-SPA  Alliance have openly said here  that  they\r\n\r\nwant  this  merger to go through without any  hitch.\r\n\r\nWhat  they  have stated openly here  is  honest  and\r\n\r\nconsistent with what they have said privately,  that\r\n\r\nthis referendum is an unnecessary risk. Two of their\r\n\r\nMembers,  the Member for Farrer Park and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  have stated here publicly  that  they\r\n\r\nconsider  the Government have a right and should  go\r\n\r\nthrough  with  merger  without  the  bother   of   a\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim and his United People's\r\n\r\nParty, the inaugural meeting of which has yet to  be\r\n\r\nheld  and  a proper Committee has yet to be elected,\r\n\r\nprivately want merger established and the Communists\r\n\r\ncurbed by a strong Central Government. He sees  very\r\n\r\nclearly  where  his  interests lie.  He  has  openly\r\n\r\nrejected any call for general elections made by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  The last thing  he  wants  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  before the Communists  have  been\r\n\r\ndealt with. It is open knowledge - and he has admitted\r\n\r\nit  to quite a number of Members on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse - that  he has lost most of his kaki or  runners\r\n\r\nto  the  Communists in the unions  and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. He has not got the wherewithal to  contest\r\n\r\nand  win  a general election now. He has lost  these\r\n\r\nrunners and kaki partly through persuasion that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis  were  on  the point of  forming  the  next\r\n\r\ngovernment  and  partly through intimidation.  Under\r\n\r\npresent circumstances, he therefore does not want  a\r\n\r\ngeneral election. He wants to ensure merger, when he\r\n\r\nknows  that the Communists will be removed from  the\r\n\r\nscene. And he continually encourages Members on this\r\n\r\nside   of  the  House  to  expose  and  attack   the\r\n\r\nCommunists in and outside the Barisan Sosialis. But,\r\n\r\nat the same time, he hopes to ensure that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould be weakened by the smears and false charges of\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, which he is helping  to  propagate,\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  going to sell out the rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  All these smears for the purpose that  when\r\n\r\nthe Communists are contained, he hopes to emerge  as\r\n\r\nthe strongest single Party. Therefore, he opposes  a\r\n\r\ngeneral election now. But he is also hoping that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  take the odium for  the  Communist\r\n\r\nsmear  of selling out a Chinese Singapore to a Malay\r\n\r\nFederation.  He  would be quite  happy  to  see  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   carry   through   merger   without    a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Of  course, since the  Government  have\r\n\r\ndecided  on  a referendum, he has also attempted  to\r\n\r\nclaim  that the referendum has been forced upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment because he has demanded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Anson, the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Workers'  Party. He made an astonishing  remark\r\n\r\nyesterday which admitted that although his Party has\r\n\r\nbeen captured, he has not been captured. His private\r\n\r\nview  is that the Government should go through  with\r\n\r\nmerger and not bother about a referendum. But loudly\r\n\r\nand publicly he demands guarantees for a referendum.\r\n\r\nWhat  game  is  all this about? I suggest  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntransparent one, Mr Speaker, Sir. Unlike  the  more\r\n\r\nsubtle  Member for Hong Lim, he blatantly  seeks  to\r\n\r\nidentify himself with the Communist popular  causes.\r\n\r\nI wonder often whether it could be that he is hoping\r\n\r\nthat when their political front organisations become\r\n\r\ndefunct,  he  would  inherit the  support  of  their\r\n\r\nremnant branch organisations. He has admitted to the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Health  and  Law  in  a  moment   of\r\n\r\nfrankness, after what I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought  was a mere threat to indulge in  fisticuffs\r\n\r\noutside  this Chamber between the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nand  the  Member  for  Crawford,  in  a  moment   of\r\n\r\nremorse - he felt so sorry - he said, \"Imagine  two  men\r\n\r\nwith  grey  hairs boxing each other!\"  And  he  said\r\n\r\nanyway  he  knew his fate was at the  mercy  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and that they could pull the  carpet  on\r\n\r\nwhich  he stands and he would be finished.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat he said. He has no organisation of his own. Nor\r\n\r\nis he in a position to make any appeal to the people\r\n\r\non  his own without Communist support, which support\r\n\r\nincludes  the translation of what he says before  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  understood by the Chinese, Malay and Indian\r\n\r\nmasses.  He makes a hue and cry about democracy.  He\r\n\r\nhas  talked  rashly  of  \"blind  chickens\"  and  the\r\n\r\n\"canvassing of the dead\". He also wants  merger.  He\r\n\r\nknows  full  well  that without merger  the  country\r\n\r\nwould be ruined and lie would have no place in  this\r\n\r\nsociety, both in his profession and by virtue of his\r\n\r\nrace.  I  used  to believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  he has the courage of his convictions.  But\r\n\r\nafter  his  debacle  at the Kuala  Lumpur  Communist\r\n\r\nfront  conference in January, I am somewhat hesitant\r\n\r\nin  this  belief.  In the Malaysia  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, he parted with the Communists on the issue of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Here in this Chamber he supported  it.  He\r\n\r\nwent  to Kuala Lumpur and, in the Steering Committee\r\n\r\nconcealed from public gaze, he told them that he was\r\n\r\nfor  Malaysia  and  would have nothing  to  do  with\r\n\r\nmerging with Indonesia as the heartland of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHe  has  told us in this House that for professional\r\n\r\nreasons  he  left for Brunei before  the  resolution\r\n\r\nopposing  Malaysia was passed by the conference.  So\r\n\r\nit  was that lie was saved the final humiliation  of\r\n\r\nbeing present when his Party disavowed him and voted\r\n\r\nwith  the  other Communist front delegates  opposing\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, on the other hand, do not\r\n\r\nwant  a  referendum. What they wanted was to capture\r\n\r\nthe Government by either seducing or intimidating 26\r\n\r\nAssemblymen   into  supporting  them.  That   having\r\n\r\nfailed, they want general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelections, to destroy any government that  seeks  to\r\n\r\nestablish   merger   between   Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, which would be fatal to  their\r\n\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown repeated his futile cry\r\n\r\nfor general elections when he made his speech on the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill the day before yesterday. He said at\r\n\r\nthe  radio  forum  last  year  that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   were  politically  immature   for   such\r\n\r\nadvanced democratic processes like a referendum, and\r\n\r\nthat  general  elections were far better,  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  there can be no single Party emerging  with  a\r\n\r\nmandate  to carry out merger. Since he has lost  the\r\n\r\nargument  and  since his plea for general  elections\r\n\r\nhas not found any support from either the Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim or, for that matter at that time, from  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson - I do not know now, because, as  you\r\n\r\nknow,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson  from\r\n\r\ntime   to   time  changes  his  mind - or   from   the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O./S.P.A. Alliance, he now has to try his luck\r\n\r\nto  create mischief in the referendum. He has  asked\r\n\r\nwhether the Government would resign if they lose the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Sir,  it  is  my  unpleasant  task   to\r\n\r\ndisabuse  his  mind  of the very silly  notion  that\r\n\r\nthere  is such a thing as the Government winning  or\r\n\r\nlosing a referendum. A referendum is a process - these\r\n\r\nare  carefully chosen words for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown - by which  we  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the majority of the people, since  there\r\n\r\ncan  never  be any unanimity, however imperfect  the\r\n\r\nmethod may be. The people's representatives in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   have  already  endorsed  the   heads   of\r\n\r\nagreements  for  merger between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. I am reasonably confident that\r\n\r\nthis  accords  with wishes of the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  as  being the best terms and  conditions  to\r\n\r\nsuit  our  circumstances. But if it SO happens  that\r\n\r\nthe majority of the people want a different mode and\r\n\r\nmanner of achieving the inevitable reunification  of\r\n\r\nthe  two territories - by way of illustration, if, for\r\n\r\ninstance, they do not wish to have local autonomy in\r\n\r\neducation and labour - then, of course, it will be the\r\n\r\nduty of the Government to fulfill their wishes.  And\r\n\r\nso  the  question of winning or losing a  referendum\r\n\r\ndoes not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger\r\n\r\nbeing  frustrated  and  the  country  plunged   into\r\n\r\ndisaster   by  the  activities  of  the   Communists\r\n\r\nmanipulating a referendum, let me say that it  would\r\n\r\nbe  criminal folly on the part of the Government  to\r\n\r\nhold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and\r\n\r\nMalaysia   to  be  imperilled.  If  that  were   the\r\n\r\nposition,  if the risk existed, then, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhat  benefit the Member for Hong Lim or the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson may reap by the Government having to carry\r\n\r\nthe  odium  of  living down the Communist  smear  of\r\n\r\ntrying  to sell out a Chinese Singapore to  a  Malay\r\n\r\nFederation,  it  would still  be  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to go through with it to ensure that  the\r\n\r\npeace,  security  and happiness of the  people,  not\r\n\r\njust of Singapore but of Malaya and of Malaysia, are\r\n\r\nnot  jeopardised. But we are in the happier position\r\n\r\nof  not embarking on any such risks, and there would\r\n\r\nbe  no risk of the Communists, partly by their being\r\n\r\ntoo  clever by half, being able to frustrate  merger\r\n\r\nand Malaysia whatever they do in a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because we are confident of this that\r\n\r\nwe could consider whether the overall position would\r\n\r\nbe  better  if we carried through merger  without  a\r\n\r\nreferendum than with a referendum. The conclusion we\r\n\r\nhave  come to is that in the long term, it would  be\r\n\r\nfoolish  to  help  the  Communists  in  their  smear\r\n\r\ncampaign  that  merger  between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  a sell-out of Singapore,  where  the\r\n\r\nChinese are in the majority, to a Malaya, where  the\r\n\r\nMalays are in the majority. It is needless for me to\r\n\r\nrefute  the  absurdity of this pro, position  other\r\n\r\nthan  to  point  out that the Communists  themselves\r\n\r\nhave stressed time and time again that the Tunku and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government do not want  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  without  Malaysia  and  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories at the same time. All I need  say\r\n\r\nis  that  it  is strange indeed that  if,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nSingapore  were being sold or given away,  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation is not anxious to take a gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a sane and\r\n\r\nrational  analysis  of  Command  Paper  33  of  1961\r\n\r\nindicates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeyond  any  doubt  the  fair measure  of  political\r\n\r\ninfluence  that  Singapore, as  one  of  the  twelve\r\n\r\nStates  in  the  Federation and  the  third  largest\r\n\r\nrepresented  in  the Central Federation  Parliament,\r\n\r\nwill bear on the political policies of the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. Sir, there may be certain\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people  who may be influenced  by  these\r\n\r\nreckless communal smears and lies. To implement  the\r\n\r\nheads of agreement for a merger without giving  them\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate choice of the mode and mariner of  the\r\n\r\ninevitable  reunification would  be  to  assist  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  spreading this evil lie  by  lending\r\n\r\ncredence to these rumours. The final position  which\r\n\r\nwe  want to achieve is not just merger but a  merger\r\n\r\nunder which the various races in Malaya will live in\r\n\r\npeace  and  harmony.  If the Chinese  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthrough news reporting of the Chinese Press by  pan-Malaysian newspapers like the Nanyang Siang Pau  and\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh, which circulate  throughout\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Malaysia, from Perlis in the  North  to\r\n\r\nBorneo  in the East, are infected through  lies  and\r\n\r\nfalsehoods   into  believing  that  in  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia the Chinese are being sold out to a  Malay-dominated  Federation, then an unpleasant  situation\r\n\r\nwill  arise in the Federation and in Singapore.  Let\r\n\r\nus  never  forget that there are, after  all,  about\r\n\r\nthree  million  Chinese in the  Federation.  However\r\n\r\npolitically immature the people may be - a point which\r\n\r\nhas been made by the Member for Queenstown - they will\r\n\r\nhave to face the realities of life in Singapore,  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and indeed in South-East Asia.  They  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  the choice of either  having  merger\r\n\r\npeacefully  by  consent, or not so  peacefully  with\r\n\r\nunpleasantness  caused by the  relentless  logic  of\r\n\r\nmilitary,   economic,  geographical  and  historical\r\n\r\nforces. It is the duty of the Government to try  and\r\n\r\nbring  merger  and  Malaysia  about  peacefully   by\r\n\r\nconsent,  with the maximum of goodwill and  of  give\r\n\r\nand take. As for the small percentage who are unable\r\n\r\nto  understand the issues because it is beyond  them\r\n\r\nor   because   the   Communists  have   deliberately\r\n\r\ndistorted and twisted the issues, they can abide  by\r\n\r\nany decision made in this Assembly. This percentage,\r\n\r\nSir, was less than one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the  votes cast in the  last  general\r\n\r\nelections.

Sir, one simple point\r\n\r\nI  have  made to the Member for Hong Lim and  I  now\r\n\r\nmake  it to the Member for Anson. Give us one single\r\n\r\nprecedent of a referendum statute or an enactment in\r\n\r\nany   democratic   country - Australia,   Switzerland,\r\n\r\nanywhere  you like - where the questions to  be  posed\r\n\r\nare  determined  by  a  body  which,  ex  hypothesi,\r\n\r\nincludes the Opposition, which, ex hypothesi, cannot\r\n\r\nhave  unanimity. If a precedent could  be  produced,\r\n\r\nconsideration  would be given to  it.  But  I  could\r\n\r\nproduce precedents here of legislation in countries,\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  has  said   are\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  where  the  questions  to  be  put  are\r\n\r\ndecided by the Government. Sir, it would be silly to\r\n\r\nallow the Communists in the Barisan Sosialis to  try\r\n\r\nand wreck the referendum by causing confusion in the\r\n\r\nframing of the questions. But I suggest that  it  is\r\n\r\nlogical  and rational that those who are  unable  to\r\n\r\nmake up their minds shall be deemed to abide by  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the people's representatives  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment has been proposed after\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration of the amendments  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  put  in by Members of the Opposition,  and  in\r\n\r\nthis particular case an amendment by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  one  of  them,  Sir, seeks  to  allow  voters\r\n\r\nintentionally  to deface and mess up ballot  papers.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to clause 31 of the National Referendum\r\n\r\nBill, i.e., after \"or\" where it secondly occurs,  to\r\n\r\ninsert \"being a person other than a voter in respect\r\n\r\nof  his  own  ballot paper\". Sir, under the  present\r\n\r\nlegislation - and   one  under  which   all   previous\r\n\r\nelections  have  been held with proper  decorum  and\r\n\r\nfairness - no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson shall deface or destroy his ballot paper.

The Opposition wants this. Maybe  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Anson  does  not   know   the   wider\r\n\r\nimplications.  Not unnaturally the conclusion  `that\r\n\r\nwe  or any rational person must come to is that this\r\n\r\nis  one of the tactics to counter the referendum, to\r\n\r\ncause  confusion by tricking or intimidating  people\r\n\r\ninto spoiling or defacing the ballot paper.

Let  us  not  be squeamish  about  these\r\n\r\nthings.  He himself admitted yesterday that although\r\n\r\nhis  Party may have been captured, he has  not  been\r\n\r\ncaptured. Well, I say, God bless him. Perhaps he  is\r\n\r\nnot worth the capture. I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that it is contrary to the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  this country to allow the  Communists\r\n\r\nand their open front organisation an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate, by lies, trickery and smears, people  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  or  leave  blank ballot papers.  One  could\r\n\r\nachieve  that  result  by any number  of  lies.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  there are a lot of ignorant  people  who,\r\n\r\nfor some reason or the other, may believe that since\r\n\r\nthey were not born here, for them to put a cross for\r\n\r\nor  against  a proposition might mean  the  loss  of\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship. They would really readily believe\r\n\r\nsuch   a  proposition,  and  if  sufficiently  large\r\n\r\nnumbers   can  be  persuaded  to  believe   such   a\r\n\r\nproposition, they might be dissuaded from  making  a\r\n\r\nchoice  and  leaving a blank ballot. This  provision\r\n\r\ndoes not prevent anybody from making his choice, but\r\n\r\nit  makes  it  unprofitable for  the  Communists  to\r\n\r\ndissuade  people from exercising their choice.  That\r\n\r\nis the purpose of the amendment which has arisen out\r\n\r\nof  the  amendment proposed by the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nwhich he may or may not know may be very useful  for\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. So the provision we have made, that\r\n\r\nunmarked  or blank ballot papers shall be deemed  to\r\n\r\naccept  the decision .on the matter by the Assembly,\r\n\r\nwill prevent any such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmischievous campaign, can look after the  less  than\r\n\r\none  per cent in the last general elections of those\r\n\r\ngroups who, the Member for Queenstown said, are  not\r\n\r\npolitically mature enough to understand  the  issues\r\n\r\nin a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in January of wanting to\r\n\r\ndelay  the passage of this Bill and thereby avoiding\r\n\r\nthe  holding  of  a  referendum.  We  at  that  time\r\n\r\ndirected our attention to the Barisan Sosialis.  But\r\n\r\nthey,  of  course, from time to time, in order  that\r\n\r\nthey   will  not  be  spotlighted  in  their   stark\r\n\r\nnakedness, their ugly features revealed, bring in  a\r\n\r\nfew aides to try and blend into a wider and a bigger\r\n\r\nbackground. They brought in the Member for Anson who\r\n\r\nfoolishly  supported  the  statement  that  we  were\r\n\r\ntrying  to  abscond from a referendum.  So  did  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim. Now, however, the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim has asked that more time be given to him so\r\n\r\nthat he could find out if other democratic countries\r\n\r\nlike  Australia have referendum laws  which  provide\r\n\r\nfor   the  determination  of  the  issues   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and by the Opposition also. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I was grateful for his suggestion. Now he wants\r\n\r\nthe Bill to go to Select Committee. In order that we\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  accused  of  wishing  to  delay  its\r\n\r\npassage,  we  have stated that it can go  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  if  it is the wish of the Opposition.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, the Government will abstain. Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson was so moved by this gesture of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  he  exclaimed,  \"Very  fair!  Very\r\n\r\nfair!\" Of course, we must press that the Bill should\r\n\r\nbe reported to this House by the end of April. There\r\n\r\nare  various  reasons for it, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  A\r\n\r\nSelect Committee is a matter on which the Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition can please themselves.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  denounced this yesterday. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson praised it yesterday. I am now told the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  praised it the day before, but denounced\r\n\r\nit  yesterday when he was approached by  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe U.P.P. and the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance. He went\r\n\r\nover  to  the  Barisan  side and  opposed  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. I am now told in my few minutes'  absence\r\n\r\nout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof this Chamber - I do not know whether the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  was  here - that there has been a  reversal  of\r\n\r\nline.   The   Barisan - their   appendages   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly - have made the wrong decision, it seems;  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  this was an impromptu one which  again  may\r\n\r\nhave to be reversed. But they also are not against a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee and they will abstain  now.  Well,\r\n\r\nSir,  so  be it. The Opposition can have it any  way\r\n\r\nthey like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the complaint of lack of time to\r\n\r\nconsider  the amendments, may I point out  that  all\r\n\r\nthese  amendments are as a result of the  amendments\r\n\r\nproposed by the Opposition? In nearly all cases, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have moved  these  amendments  in\r\n\r\nCommittee  without giving the Opposition any  notice\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  That  is so. We gave them  notice  last\r\n\r\nMonday.  If  the  Bill  were not  to  go  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  it would have been next week before  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage  is  arrived  at.  I  am  therefore\r\n\r\ncompletely unmoved by all these charges made by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson and by the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nof  unfair  practice and of not giving  them  enough\r\n\r\ntime.   If   they  really  wish  to   consider   the\r\n\r\namendments - as  the  Member  for  Farrer   Park   has\r\n\r\nsaid - they can vote for the motion by the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim to refer the Bill to Select Committee.  But\r\n\r\nas  I  say, whether in Select Committee or  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber or in any other public forum, we defend what\r\n\r\nis  fair,  what is just and what is right. We  shall\r\n\r\nnot   be  deterred  from  doing  what  we  know   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  What is really necessary is to  disabuse\r\n\r\nthe  minds of the people of Singapore - or any section\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore; in this particular case,\r\n\r\nprincipally  the Chinese - that there is any  sell-out\r\n\r\nto  any  Malays in the Federation. Merger will  take\r\n\r\nplace  whether we go through a referendum or without\r\n\r\na  referendum. The Seeretary-Genera1 of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis has admitted that to a meeting of his union\r\n\r\nofficials  recently. He knows it. The  game  is  up.\r\n\r\nThey  fought the wrong issue. In fact they acted  as\r\n\r\nthe  catalyst for merger. The issue is  not  whether\r\n\r\nmerger takes place or not, but whether after it  has\r\n\r\ntaken place you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  happy  society composed of three  principal\r\n\r\nraces. Let us be frank about it - two principal  races\r\n\r\nand one minor race the Chinese and the Malays, about\r\n\r\nequal in number; the Indians, about 15 per cent.  If\r\n\r\none community believes that another has deprived  it\r\n\r\nof  its rights or that somebody has sold it out  and\r\n\r\ncarries a chip on its shoulder, that is the kind  of\r\n\r\nbitterness and hatred upon which the Communists hope\r\n\r\nto  feed and grow after Malaysia. It is our duty not\r\n\r\njust  to  plan for merger - for that phase is over - but\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that after merger only those who  sought\r\n\r\ntrouble and who now have got it coming to them  will\r\n\r\nbe left embittered, namely, the Communists and their\r\n\r\nstooges  in  the  front organisations, it  must  be\r\n\r\nbrought  home to the majority of the Chinese - whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  Chinese-speaking,  non-Chinese  speaking,\r\n\r\nborn here or born in China - that merger is inevitable\r\n\r\nand  is in their own interest of survival, and  that\r\n\r\nnobody   sold  anybody  to  anyone  else-let   alone\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the Federation. For if that  were  the\r\n\r\ncase,  as I said, the gift would have been  taken  a\r\n\r\nlong  time ago. It is because of certain other basic\r\n\r\nconsiderations,   of   maintaining    the    overall\r\n\r\nproportions   between   the   various   races    and\r\n\r\ncommunities,  of the imbalance that Singapore  alone\r\n\r\nin the Federation would introduce, that Malaysia has\r\n\r\nbeen  timed to coincide with merger. That in  itself\r\n\r\nis   an  admission  that  Singapore  wields  a  fair\r\n\r\nproportionate  measure  of  influence  in  the   new\r\n\r\nFederation.  That  point will  sink  home  when  the\r\n\r\npeople  make their choice. As I put it to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Stamford,  is  she afraid to  put  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis proposition - complete merger like Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca - to a vote of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in view of the unfounded  charges\r\n\r\nand  insinuations made by the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nand other Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen regarding the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government in this Bill, I wish  to\r\n\r\nreiterate  what  I  said when  I  moved  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modifications which the Government have made\r\n\r\nto the Bill with regard to the procedure for holding\r\n\r\na   referendum  were  made  because  no   individual\r\n\r\ncandidate or political Parties were involved  as  in\r\n\r\nthe case of elections, and also in order to simplify\r\n\r\nthe  procedure at polling stations and to save time.\r\n\r\nThese  modifications were made to suit the different\r\n\r\nrequirements of a referendum. However, in order that\r\n\r\nthere can be no doubt whatsoever about the propriety\r\n\r\nof  the  conduct  of the referendum, the  Government\r\n\r\naccept   several  amendments  of  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  relating to the appointment  of  polling\r\n\r\nagents  and  counting  agents by  political  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Assembly, the affixing  of  seals\r\n\r\nby polling agents or counting agents, the opening of\r\n\r\nballot  boxes  in their presence, and the  provision\r\n\r\nfor  the  recounting of votes. The  Government  also\r\n\r\naccept   with  some  modifications  the   Opposition\r\n\r\namendments  on  the prohibition of  flags,  banners,\r\n\r\nsymbols,  advertisements, etc, and canvassing  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  For the information of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  the  period  of  time  in  respect  of\r\n\r\ncertain   statutory  notifications  will   also   be\r\n\r\nextended by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate once again that canvassing\r\n\r\nwill  be prohibited only on polling day, just as  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  any elections in the past.  Also  the\r\n\r\nprohibition  on  the displaying of  flags,  banners,\r\n\r\nsymbols,  etc, is to be confined only to the  period\r\n\r\nof  the  referendum.  The  provision  of  referendum\r\n\r\npetitions  too has been spelt out in a comprehensive\r\n\r\nform under the new Part V of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government therefore have met most of the\r\n\r\ncriticisms contained in the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. However, in spite of the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  conceded to the amendments  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, the Member for Queenstown deemed fit  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on a long tirade fighting shadows of his  own\r\n\r\nmaking. Nevertheless, the speeches of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown and his colleagues showed how absurd they\r\n\r\nhad  become after closely associating with Communist\r\n\r\nfront leaders in the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of a referendum on\r\n\r\nmerger  was raised by the Party even before  the  13\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members left the P.A.P. in the hope\r\n\r\nof becoming Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.\r\n\r\nIt is equally absurd for the Member for Hong Lim to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the proposal to hold a referendum  was\r\n\r\nforced upon the Government through his pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon made a fantastic\r\n\r\nsuggestion that the purpose of the referendum is  to\r\n\r\ngive the Government another lease of life. If he  is\r\n\r\nnot  dishonest, he will remember that in  May  1961,\r\n\r\nsoon  after the Hong Lim by-election, the Government\r\n\r\nwere  prepared  to hold a referendum as  to  whether\r\n\r\nthey should continue in office. However, it was  the 13  Barisan  Sosialis Members  now  sitting  on  the\r\n\r\nopposite  side  of  the  House  who  came  out  most\r\n\r\nstrongly  against this move. They were horrified  at\r\n\r\nthe  prospect  of  not  being in  office  either  as\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries or  Assemblymen.  If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership wanted to hang on  to  office  at\r\n\r\nwhatever  cost, we would not have put the future  of\r\n\r\nthe Government in the hands of the people then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the criticism that the Opposition\r\n\r\nhad  not been given adequate time to campaign during\r\n\r\nthe  referendum. This again is far from  the  truth.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of this Bill,\r\n\r\nthe  first  matter to be committed to the electorate\r\n\r\nfor a referendum will be the terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with the Federation.  Much  has\r\n\r\nalready been said about this merger during the  past\r\n\r\nfew  months  through  the  radio  forums,  meetings,\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and  in  this  Assembly:  The   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  in fact, have held a considerable  number\r\n\r\nof  mass  meetings  in the last few  months  on  the\r\n\r\nmerger  issue,  of  course,  not  with  a  view   to\r\n\r\nclarifying the facts as contained in the White Paper\r\n\r\nbut  in  order to create fear and confusion  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people. The fact that their so-called\r\n\r\nmass  meetings are being attended by fewer and fewer\r\n\r\npeople is already an indication to them as to  which\r\n\r\nway the wind of public opinion is blowing. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  cannot  expect  a political  Party  founded  on\r\n\r\ndouble   talk  and  petty  ambitions  to   stir   up\r\n\r\nenthusiasm among the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim yesterday went to\r\n\r\nconsiderable lengths to criticise the Government for\r\n\r\nnot  calling an All-Party Conference to discuss  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill and to agree on the question  to  be\r\n\r\nput   to  the  people.  Although  he  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance in Australia, he was unable  to\r\n\r\nquote  any  provision  in the Australian  Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance where there was provision for an All-Party\r\n\r\nConference  to  decide on the  question  to  be  put\r\n\r\nbefore the people. From what the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nsaid regarding the All-Party Conference and the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  for  Anson sought  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  to decide on the question, I am  beginning\r\n\r\nto wonder whether they understand the cabinet system\r\n\r\nof  government. The Government is elected by, and is\r\n\r\nresponsible  to, the people. It is the  business  of\r\n\r\nthe Government to govern in the best interest of the\r\n\r\npeople.   Surely   these  two  gentlemen   are   not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the Government should abdicate their\r\n\r\npowers and responsibility? If an executive matter is\r\n\r\nto  be referred to the Assembly for a decision, then\r\n\r\nthere  might as well not be a Cabinet. Perhaps  that\r\n\r\nis what they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one can imagine what the\r\n\r\nposition would be like should this happen. The issue\r\n\r\nfor a referendum would be so confused that the whole\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the referendum would be  defeated.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the purpose of a referendum is to ascertain\r\n\r\nthe views of the people on a certain national issue,\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Government  consider  to  be  of   such\r\n\r\nmagnitude  and  importance that direct  consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the people is necessary. Since the Member  for\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon says he has full confidence in  the\r\n\r\npolitical consciousness of the people and  in  their\r\n\r\nability to see clearly the issue before them, I fail\r\n\r\nto  see  any reason why they should be afraid  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  his  Party  Chairman,  seems  to  think\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to him, the people are ignorant fools  and\r\n\r\nhave  such  a low political consciousness that  they\r\n\r\nare  unable to distinguish between the good and  the\r\n\r\nbad,  and  therefore a refrendum is most unsuitable.\r\n\r\nIf  then  this is the view of the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthat  the  people are politically immature and  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  low  political consciousness and  the  same\r\n\r\ndegree  of sanity as the Member for Anson, then  it\r\n\r\nshould -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  wonder whether the Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon has second thoughts about the implications\r\n\r\nof  his Party's own merger proposal on the basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca, and that he now realises  that\r\n\r\nhis  Party's type of merger is not acceptable to the\r\n\r\npeople,  because it is a sell-out of more than  half\r\n\r\nof the citizens' rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  made  an  unfair allegation  against  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the civil servants  who  will  be  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes.

According to  him,  the\r\n\r\nclause  on tendered votes will enable the Government\r\n\r\nto indulge in irregular practices. How this could be\r\n\r\ndone  he did not explain, and I hope he will  do  so\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I only wish to say at this stage that the\r\n\r\nwhole  referendum  machinery is  run  by  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  including the issue of ballot  papers  to\r\n\r\nthe  voters. The Ministers, the Parliamentary  Secre\r\n\r\ntaries,  and Government Assemblymen have no hand  in\r\n\r\nrunning   the  polling  stations.  Apart  from   the\r\n\r\npresiding  officer  who  is normally  a  responsible\r\n\r\ncivil  servant to see that a `ballot paper is issued\r\n\r\nonly  to  the person entitled to it, there are  also\r\n\r\nthe   polling   agents  appointed  by  the   various\r\n\r\npolitical Parties themselves to see that the polling\r\n\r\nis  conducted  in an honest and fair manner.  Is  he\r\n\r\nthen  suggesting that the civil servants,  numbering\r\n\r\nmore  than 10,000 in charge of the polling stations,\r\n\r\nwill  indulge in irregular practices, and that  they\r\n\r\nare  even  so  bold  as to do  it  under  the  close\r\n\r\nscrutiny  of  the  polling agents appointed  by  the\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties? Elections have  been  held  many\r\n\r\ntimes in the past, and I have yet to hear of such  a\r\n\r\nfantastic  charge  being made  against  the  polling\r\n\r\nstaff.  If  I  may point out, the Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon took part in at least four elections and I\r\n\r\nfailed   to   hear   from  him  any   complaint   of\r\n\r\nirregularity committed under this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, not so long\r\n\r\nago  his  Party Chairman, the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson, and many others in the Barisan  Sosialis, praised the integrity  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice to high heaven. But today we hear the Member\r\n\r\nfor    Upper   Serangoon   making   this   fantastic\r\n\r\npresumption that the civil servants in charge of the\r\n\r\nreferendum machinery is politically corrupt.  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they  think  that  the  praise  they   have\r\n\r\nshowered on the civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants  in the not too distant past has fallen  on\r\n\r\nbarren  soil  that they have now decided  to  change\r\n\r\ntheir views?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, great play has been made of the\r\n\r\namendment regarding unmarked and uncertain votes. In\r\n\r\nthis respect, the Minister for Finance and the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister have already given an adequate explanation.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in their campaign to oppose merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia, the Communists and their stooges have\r\n\r\nresorted  to  unprincipled  tactics  of  deceit  and\r\n\r\nduplicity  even  to  the extent  of  stabbing  their\r\n\r\ncomrades   and  pilfering  properties  from   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbranches. Ever since the issue of merger was raised,\r\n\r\nthe  communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have been earnestly going about  confusing\r\n\r\nthe  illiterate  people,  especially  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  by spreading rumours that they should oppose\r\n\r\nmerger  because merger would mean the domination  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  by the Malays; special privileges  and\r\n\r\nlicence  would be granted to the Malays; and Chinese\r\n\r\nculture and education would be eliminated. Since the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  decided to  refer  this  important\r\n\r\nnational issue to the people, they have decided that\r\n\r\nthe   referendum  should  be  exploited   to   their\r\n\r\nadvantage.  Without the amendment  proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  regarding uncertain and unmarked  votes,\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  and their stooges  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  could go round and mislead the  electorate\r\n\r\nto  cast blink votes or deface the ballot papers  by\r\n\r\ngiving  all  kinds  of false interpretation  to  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper.  For example, a vote for  merger  will\r\n\r\nentail the loss of citizenship or a taxi licence  or\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to be educated in a Chinese school.\r\n\r\nIt  is  to  ensure that the right of the  voters  to\r\n\r\nexpress their views is not prevented or confused  by\r\n\r\nthe   falsehoods   and   rumour-mongering   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists and their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nthat  the amendment has been introduced so that  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  views of the people may be ascertained  and\r\n\r\nthat the referendum will not be turned into a farce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may note that in the last general\r\n\r\nelections in 1959 the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrejected  votes,  which  included  the  unmarked  or\r\n\r\nuncertain  or defaced votes, etc., only amounted  to\r\n\r\n6,650,  which  was about one per cent of  the  total\r\n\r\nvotes cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, charges of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndictatorship  were  levelled  against   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment   by   the  Member  for   Queenstown   in\r\n\r\nconnection   with   this  Bill.  The   Members   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  Nee  Soon, and Upper  Serangoon  seemed\r\n\r\nunable  to  grasp the simple truth put  to  them  in\r\n\r\nsimple   language.   The   Government   could   have\r\n\r\nimplemented the merger plan after the Assembly  gave\r\n\r\nits  approval to the White Paper, Cmd. 33  of  1961,\r\n\r\nwithout  holding  a referendum. The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are prepared to put the issue  of  merger\r\n\r\nbefore  the people even after the Assembly gave  its\r\n\r\napproval   proves  conclusively  that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is far from being dictatorial. Indeed the\r\n\r\nGovernment   consider  merger   a   national   issue\r\n\r\naffecting the future of 1.7 million people,  and  it\r\n\r\nis  therefore  a  matter important  enough  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  decide on the manner of  the  inevitable\r\n\r\nreunification  of  the  two  territories.   If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to be dictatorial, like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, not only would this Bill  not\r\n\r\nbe  before  this House today, but most probably  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown  and his  political  cronies\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  present in this  Assembly,  but,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Minister for Finance, they would be\r\n\r\nsix feet underground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Elope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move, \"That the Bill be committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman  and\r\n\r\nsuch Members as may be nominated by the Committee of\r\n\r\nSelection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to take the motion in two\r\n\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the Bill be committed to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 9; Noes, nil;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 38; Absent, 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Ayes.

In  the\r\n\r\nlast  five months of last year, there was an average\r\n\r\nof  one strike every two days, against an average of\r\n\r\nfive  a  month  in the first seven months.

The number of disputes dealt  with\r\n\r\nby  the  Industrial Section of the Labour Department\r\n\r\nlast year was 1,225.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst strike month was November with 20\r\n\r\nstrikes involving 32,304 workmen and costing 300,842\r\n\r\nman-days lost. Moreover, Sir, many new strikes  have\r\n\r\nalready  taken  place this year  and  there  do  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  be indications of an easing off  on  the\r\n\r\nstrike  front.  From these facts  and  figures,  hon\r\n\r\nMembers  cannot  ignore  the  fact  that  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  has  been  on the increase and,  as  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people, we cannot  but  view\r\n\r\nthis with grave concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while on the question of strikes, I want to\r\n\r\ntake  this opportunity to refer to the recent strike\r\n\r\nof the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBank  Employees'  Union at the Oversea-Chinese  Bank\r\n\r\nwhich  has  not been amicably settled. Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  remember that during the debate on the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Banking Bill which was taken through\r\n\r\nall its stages last January, I had occasion to refer\r\n\r\nto this Union as a P.A.P. union. This reference drew\r\n\r\nforth a Press statement from the Acting Secretary of\r\n\r\nthe  Union  declaring that his  Union  did  not  owe\r\n\r\nallegiance  to  any  political  Party,  nor  did  it\r\n\r\nprofess  any political ideology. The statement  went\r\n\r\non  to  express  the hope that I would  withdraw  my\r\n\r\nallegation.  Well, well, I am glad, Sir,  that  this\r\n\r\nUnion  has  made  its  stand  clear  vis-a-vis   its\r\n\r\nallegiance  to  any political Party. I  accept  this\r\n\r\nstatement and I would like to congratulate the Union\r\n\r\nfor  the wisdom of its stand. Its members should  be\r\n\r\nproud  that  the Union will not allow itself  to  be\r\n\r\ngeared to the machine of any political Party. Having\r\n\r\npaid  all  this  highly  deserving  praise  to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Bank Employees' Union, Sir, I do not think\r\n\r\nI was wrong in describing it as a P.A.P. union in my\r\n\r\nspeech  referred to earlier. Inasmuch as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  described unions which  have  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  leaders associated with  them  as  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  unions  and as Communist front  unions,  I\r\n\r\nhave  described the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union\r\n\r\nas  a P.A.P. union because it has Mr Devan Nair and\r\n\r\nalso,  mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture closely associated  with  the\r\n\r\nunion.  If  the Prime Minister is right, then  I  am\r\n\r\nright.  In  fact,  Sir, I am more  right  because  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, a  representative  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government,  is connected  with  the  union.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I am more right than the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen I described the Singapore Bank Employees' Union\r\n\r\nas a P.A.P. union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

The second  part  of  my\r\n\r\nmotion, therefore, comes in, and that is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House...calls on the Government to take\r\n\r\nall reasonable steps to ensure industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice  in the interests of the economic well-being\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance is a\r\n\r\nreasonable step in this direction. When the Bill was\r\n\r\nread a Second time in February 1960, I think it  was\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister who said that this was the first\r\n\r\nattempt made by the Legislature to bring the rule of\r\n\r\nlaw  into industrial relations where the rule of the\r\n\r\njungle had prevailed previously. The Bill as drafted\r\n\r\nby the Austrian expert brought in specially for this\r\n\r\npurpose  was  a good Bill, and the Opposition  quite\r\n\r\nfrankly  informed  the  House  that  they  were   in\r\n\r\ncomplete  agreement with the principle  involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill when it was read a Second time in February\r\n\r\n1960.   Unfortunately,  Sir,  during  the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage, there were rush amendments introduced by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  were  forced  through  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's strength then of 43 Members in spite of\r\n\r\nvery  strong  objections  from  the  Opposition.  50\r\n\r\namendments  were  introduced by the Government,  and\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  mutilated the  Bill  and  took  the\r\n\r\nessence   out  of  the  genuine  effort  to  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace. However, the Minister did  assure\r\n\r\nthe  House  during his speech on the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  would  give  very   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration to the Annual Reports of the President\r\n\r\nof  the Industrial Arbitration Court required  under\r\n\r\nsection  83 of the Ordinance and that the Government\r\n\r\nwould not hesitate to introduce amending legislation\r\n\r\nif  the need to do so was shown. At long last,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  President  of the Industrial Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nhas  submitted his first Annual Report and this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  the  hands  of  hon.  Members  since  last\r\n\r\nJanuary. It is clear, Sir, from the Report  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  it  has been clear to us for some time,  that\r\n\r\nthe Court has been working at a feverish pace and  I\r\n\r\nwould ask the Government not to hesitate to give the\r\n\r\nadditional staff asked for by the President  in  his\r\n\r\nReport. Certain suggested amendments have also  been\r\n\r\nbrought up by the President of the Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nwith the Minister. I take it that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  suggested amendments are aimed  at  improving\r\n\r\nthe  operation of this legislation as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nexperience gained over the past 15 months.  I  would\r\n\r\nask   the  Minister  to  introduce,  without  delay,\r\n\r\namending legislation as recommended by the President\r\n\r\nof  the  Arbitration  Court. The  present  unhealthy\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore demands immediate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Table 4 of the Report discloses a sorry state\r\n\r\nof  affairs and the Government cannot afford  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent about this. Table 4 shows that there  are\r\n\r\n8  cases pending before the Court. One case is being\r\n\r\nheard,  while  the  other  seven  cases  are   still\r\n\r\nawaiting hearing two of which were submitted to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  as far back as September 1961, that is,  they\r\n\r\nhave been in cold storage for many, many months  and\r\n\r\nare  still  awaiting hearing. I can now  understand,\r\n\r\nSir, why it was that the Minister had been found  to\r\n\r\nbe   hesitant   in  directing  trade   disputes   to\r\n\r\narbitration.  It  would  be  manifestly  unfair   to\r\n\r\nrequire the disputants, particularly workers'  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  to  shelve settlement of their  claims  for\r\n\r\nmany,  many months awaiting the convenience  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court; for it  must  not  be\r\n\r\noverlooked  that  once  a  trade  dispute  has  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted   by  the  Minister  to  the   Court   for\r\n\r\narbitration, strike action must cease. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law in his speech  on  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Industrial Relations Bill in February\r\n\r\n1960,  said (Hansard, 10th February, 1960, Vol.  12,\r\n\r\ncol. 154):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As the system develops, it could be that we may\r\n\r\nhave  to  have  more  than one Court  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nmatters in the first instance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 4 clearly shows that one Court is grossly\r\n\r\ninadequate. Moreover, Sir, let us look at section 29\r\n\r\nof the Industrial Relations Ordinance which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of section 30 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance    the    Court   shall   carefully    and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  hear,  inquire into  and  investigate\r\n\r\nevery  trade dispute of which it has cognizance  and\r\n\r\nall matters affecting the trade dispute and the just\r\n\r\nsettlement  of  the dispute and shall determine  the\r\n\r\ndispute by arbitration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir, \"the Court shall carefully and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously hear, inquire into and investigate ...\".\r\n\r\nThe  fact that there have been cases pending hearing\r\n\r\nfor   months  and  months  is,  to  say  the  least,\r\n\r\ndefeating the object of this special legislation. It\r\n\r\nis  now evidently clear that the Government must set\r\n\r\nup  more than one Court to do justice. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  receive  an  assurance from the Government  that\r\n\r\nthis will be done forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now refer to Part VII of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Bill. This deals with boards of\r\n\r\ninquiry.  This  provision in the law  has  not  been\r\n\r\nbrought into play by the Minister. There must  be  a\r\n\r\npurpose  for such provision, and it is my submission\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister should have exercised his  power\r\n\r\nunder  this Part in regard to the recent  strike  at\r\n\r\nthe  Oversea-Chinese  Banking Corporation.  Ltd, in\r\n\r\nthis  particular strike, the union claimed that  the\r\n\r\nemployers  had done some act injurious to the  union\r\n\r\nand  demanded an apology. The employers were adamant\r\n\r\nand  refuted  the union's claims. As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nworkers were called out on strike, which lasted more\r\n\r\nthan a week before it was amicably settled. But  the\r\n\r\nworkers  would  not  have to  suffer  some  loss  to\r\n\r\nachieve their ends and the public would not have  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  inconvenience  if  the  Minister  had   only\r\n\r\nexercised  his  power  under  this  Ordinance.   The\r\n\r\nMinister should have appointed a board of inquiry to\r\n\r\ninquire  into who was right and who was  wrong,  and\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  would be brought  to  bear  on  the\r\n\r\nculprits.  I would ask the Minister not to  hesitate\r\n\r\nto  use this power when the occasion demands it  and\r\n\r\nthus put a check on unnecessary industrial strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out earlier, one Court of\r\n\r\nArbitration has been found to be ineffective to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the spate of trade disputes. More courts  have\r\n\r\nto  be  established,  and once  this  is  done,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  should have no hesitation to direct  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes   to   be  submitted  to   the   Court   of\r\n\r\narbitration. Once a strike takes place,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nduty of the Labour Ministry officials, including\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  and his Parliamentary  Secretary,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not overburdened with work,  to  step  in\r\n\r\nstraightaway  and  try to bring  about  an  amicable\r\n\r\nsettlement. But if these efforts proved futile after\r\n\r\na  reasonable  time,  the  Minister  should  without\r\n\r\nhesitation   direct  that  the  trade   dispute   be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  the  Court  for  arbitration  if  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance is  meant  to  be  a\r\n\r\nserious  piece of legislation to promote  industrial\r\n\r\npeace with justice, and the rule of law must be made\r\n\r\nto  replace  the rule of the jungle  which,  in  the\r\n\r\nwords of the Minister for Labour and Law uttered  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  1960,  causes \"suffering and  hardship  to\r\n\r\nthose  involved, and economic loss to the  community\r\n\r\nas  a  whole on a scale which a progressive society,\r\n\r\naiming   at  a  happier  life  and  higher  economic\r\n\r\nstandards  for  all,  cannot  tolerate  and   cannot\r\n\r\nafford\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conciliation is the biggest factor in promoting\r\n\r\nindustrial peace, and it is therefore vital that the\r\n\r\nLabour  Department should have a full complement  of\r\n\r\ntrained conciliators. I do not know whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  strong and effective team  of  trained\r\n\r\nconciliators in the Labour Department,  but  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants additional staff, we will  give  him\r\n\r\nall support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago in this House, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   waxed  eloquent.  He  said  in  vitriolic\r\n\r\nlanguage  that  it was the policy of the  Government\r\n\r\nnot to allow non-citizens to play an active part  in\r\n\r\nthe industrial relations field. If he meant what  he\r\n\r\nsaid  and  said  what  he  meant, may  I  ask   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  when  it proposes to introduce  amending\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  this  effect?  In  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance, non-citizens are not  entitled\r\n\r\nto  be  appointed to serve on the panel of employers\r\n\r\nor  of employees. Sir, in view of section 83 of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance, a number  of  secret\r\n\r\nballots   have   been  undertaken  by   the   Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment  to ascertain the workers'  choice  of  a\r\n\r\nparticular trade union to represent their interests.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  understand, Sir, how, after  such  secret\r\n\r\nballoting  had disclosed the choice of the  majority\r\n\r\nof  workers  in a particular place of employment,  a\r\n\r\nrival trade union which lost in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecret   balloting  was  allowed,  to  continue   to\r\n\r\nfunction,  in  one  particular  case,  it  was  even\r\n\r\nallowed  to  call  and carry out  a  strike  of  the\r\n\r\nminority  of workers. Does this not make a farce  of\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  of secret ballot undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour Department? Why go through this rigmarole  as\r\n\r\nit  will  only  bring  the  Labour  Department  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute   and   contempt?  If  a   secret   ballot\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Labour Department does not  settle\r\n\r\nthe question, why should the Government waste public\r\n\r\nfunds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Industrial Relations Bill was read a\r\n\r\nSecond  and  a  Third  time in  February  1960,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   quite   rightly   claimed   that   this\r\n\r\nlegislation  would  bring  the  rule  of  law   into\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations where previously the  rule  of\r\n\r\nthe   jungle  had  prevailed.  The  Bill  which  was\r\n\r\nassented  to  on  25th  February,  1960,  came  into\r\n\r\noperation on 15th September, 1960 - a delay  of  seven\r\n\r\nmonths - and  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court  was\r\n\r\nofficially  opened on 24th October, 1960.  All  this\r\n\r\nhappened  in 1960 and yet, Sir, in 1961, there  were\r\n\r\n113  strikes more than in previous years.  Has  this\r\n\r\npiece of legislation achieved the object - that is, to\r\n\r\nbring  the  rule  of  law into industrial  relations\r\n\r\nwhere   previously  the  rule  of  the  jungle   had\r\n\r\nprevailed? To a lesser degree than in 1961,  it  has\r\n\r\nfailed.  Why  and  where  it  has  failed,  I   have\r\n\r\nendeavoured  in my speech to quote a few  instances.\r\n\r\nThis  law, if it is meant to be a serious  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation   to  promote  industrial   peace   with\r\n\r\njustice, must be made to work, and it can be made to\r\n\r\nwork,  and  I  call on the Government  to  take  all\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to make it work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Government is no less anxious\r\n\r\nthan we are to promote industrial peace with justice\r\n\r\nso  that the industrialisation plans for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore can be assured of  some\r\n\r\nmeasure of success. The P.A.P. have leaders who  are\r\n\r\nvery  close to the trade unions. They are  therefore\r\n\r\nin  a  position to know what reasonable steps  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  ones I have touched upon, the  Government\r\n\r\ncan take to ensure industrial peace with justice in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the economic well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, my motion rests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I propose the Question, may I\r\n\r\nenquire from the Member for Anson whether he intends\r\n\r\nmoving his amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, may I suggest that the\r\n\r\nmover of the motion, if he wishes to deal with  that\r\n\r\namendment, can do so now so that the device which we\r\n\r\nhave   adopted   on   other   occasions   could   be\r\n\r\nadopted - that  is, the debate could  range  over  the\r\n\r\nmotion and the amendment, and then at the end of the\r\n\r\ndebate  the  Question  could be  put  first  on  the\r\n\r\namendment and then on the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I seek your indulgence, Sir,I shall\r\n\r\nbe  unavoidably away in Penang on Monday.

It must be a comfortable position.\r\n\r\nHe  has  so well hidden the antecedents of the  days\r\n\r\nwhen he was a trade union agitator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a touch of hysteria a little\r\n\r\nreminiscent of the Straits Tunes in this motion, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  I  have sought to bring  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbalance to it by my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recognise that in a free competitive\r\n\r\nsociety, the worker is naked and defenceless in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  the  power of capital and  his  only  real\r\n\r\nprotection is the unity he gets from the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement; and by the very nature of the structure of\r\n\r\nour  economy, a trade unionist and a capitalist must\r\n\r\ncarry  on  a  constant struggle which  is  perfectly\r\n\r\nhealthy,  as  healthy as hunger and the satisfaction\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law can help to some extent, but the law\r\n\r\ncannot replace self-help in the industrial field any\r\n\r\nmore than it can replace self-help in the individual\r\n\r\nfield.  This  alarm  displayed by  the  motion - grave\r\n\r\nconcern;  mounting  industrial unrest - forgets  that\r\n\r\nthere are other countries, for instance, England,  a\r\n\r\nland of democracy. I was just reading the other  day\r\n\r\na  book  and I noticed that in 1912, there  were  40\r\n\r\nmillion man-days lost by strikes, and there were far\r\n\r\nmore  in  1921 and in 1926. If we take our minds  to\r\n\r\nAustralia   and  America  and  to  other  democratic\r\n\r\ncountries,  there  are far more man-days  lost  and,\r\n\r\nwhen  they are compared to the population, there  is\r\n\r\nfar  from cause for alarm. I would say, with respect\r\n\r\nto  you, Mr Speaker. Sir, but for the malice of our\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  we would be conscious of the  restraint\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndignity  of our workers, Sir, let us not lose  sense\r\n\r\nof  the value of a strike to the worker. I speak  as\r\n\r\none  who has suffered from unfortunate strikes  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill was himself the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour, but even in spite of some strikes which\r\n\r\nwere  politically motivated and completely malicious\r\n\r\nand  not intended for the welfare of the worker,  in\r\n\r\nthat  one year in 1955, Sir, the standard of  living\r\n\r\nof  the  worker  was  raised by  11  per  cent;  the\r\n\r\nindustrial workers' wages rose from 65 cents  to  74\r\n\r\ncents in one year - an increase of 9 cents - and in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the six years since 1955, it has increased\r\n\r\nby  6  cents. That year compared to last year was  a\r\n\r\nyear  of  turmoil,  and last  year  was  a  year  of\r\n\r\ncomparative peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill refers to the strike in\r\n\r\nthe  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation which seems\r\n\r\nto  touch his heart rather closely. Sir, of all  the\r\n\r\nstrikes  I  have heard of, that would be hardly  the\r\n\r\none I would consider compelling the worker to go  to\r\n\r\narbitration. May I remind the hon. Member that  when\r\n\r\nI  pleaded with him, as the Minister for Labour,  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  provisions  for  arbitration,  he   said,\r\n\r\n\"Marshall,  not now. The workers do not like  to  be\r\n\r\nforced  into arbitration. It is much better to  have\r\n\r\nvoluntary    negotiations.\"   There    is    nothing\r\n\r\nconfidential about that. That was the advice of  one\r\n\r\nMinister to his Chief Minister who was very  much  a\r\n\r\ntyro   in  these  matters.  The  Minister  was   the\r\n\r\nexperienced  labour man and it was  advice  which  I\r\n\r\nfound  to be good - and, frankly, Sir,I believe still\r\n\r\nis  good - that compulsion in the field of  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations is by and large unwise. Although I  cannot\r\n\r\nbut  agree that it is, I hope that greater advantage\r\n\r\nwill be taken of arbitration proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do move the amendment that stands in my name in\r\n\r\norder to bring a sense of balance to this debate, to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that there is industrial unrest - but  this\r\n\r\nis   natural  and  healthy - to  recognise  that  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should do something but that  it  cannot\r\n\r\ntake  the  entire  burden to  seek  to  repress  all\r\n\r\nstrikes; and because Mr Tan Chin Tuan does not like\r\n\r\nan O.C.B.C. strike, therefore, the Government should\r\n\r\nintervene, is really an unbalanced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach to an extremely important problem.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  am  particularly disturbed  about  is  that\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I understand, has issued  orders  which\r\n\r\nhave  encouraged a small section of the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  to  indulge  in excesses,  orders  to  the\r\n\r\npolice  not  to take action in respect  of  criminal\r\n\r\noffences  without reference to a Labour  officer.
