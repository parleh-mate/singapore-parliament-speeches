Any standard floor finish provided is unlikely to satisfy the wide range of tastes of flat buyers. Most of them want to select finishes according to their individual preferences and budgets. The HDB's existing practice allows them this flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of standard floorings for kitchens and bathrooms is necessary to reduce damage to these wet areas, and hence minimise the possibility of water leakage. Even then, the HDB's experience shows that many owners hack up the standard kitchen flooring and retile them after the minimum 3-year period during which retiling is prohibited. Flat owners have to bear the cost of repairing any damages to the kitchen and toilet floors as a result of hacking. The HDB feels that owners are likely to replace standard floor finishes in other rooms if these are provided. This practice is a waste of both materials and labour. The provision of floor finishes in itself will not enable flat buyers to move in immediately, as there will be other renovation works required, like repainting of walls, installation of window grilles, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to conventionally built flats, HDB's prefab flats are completed with tiled flooring. This is because the industrialized method of construction requires floor finishes to be cast at the same time as the prefab floors. Owners of prefab flats are not allowed to hack up the floor for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> retiling, as this may cause damage to the joints resulting in possible water seepage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat buyers therefore have the choice of selecting prefab flats with floor finishes that are suitable for them or opting for conventionally built flats and carrying out their own floor finishes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Is the Minister not aware that times have changed and continue to change? There are already so many complaints from flat buyers against the sub-contractors. I have here just two samples, one from the Singapore Monitor and the other from the Straits Times. One heading reads, \"Angry flat owners want their money back\", and the other heading, \"Contractor vanishes before jobs are completed\". So I say that the times have changed and that the flats in Tampines are welcomed by the buyers because the floors are all done up nicely. The number of people - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question, Mr Sia? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I wonder whether the Minister is aware that times have changed and that the people buying the flats in Tampines - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, let him first answer about times having changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, I am aware. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> So is the Minister not going to consider that since times have changed therefore the policy has got to be changed too? Follow up with the times. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member did not pay much attention to what I said just now. I said that flat buyers have the. choice of selecting prefab flats with floor finishes, ie those who want finishes that are suitable for them, or opting for conventionally built flats and carry out their own flooring finishes. In other words, the buyer has a choice. For those who want flats with finishes, HDB has built flats with finishes. For those who do not want them, they can opt for the conventional type of construction. So they have a choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RESIGNATION OF BRIG-GEN LEE HSIEN LOONG</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health whether the impending resignation of Brigadier Lee Hsien Loong from the Army was known or expected when he was promoted to that rank. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, promotions in the Singapore Armed Forces are decided through a strictly defined set of procedures. The present procedures were published in the March 1982 issue of the Pointer, a publication for SAF officers. The factors considered in a promotion are performance on the job, potential for higher level appointments, character, and recommendations of superiors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has a system of regular annual promotion exercises. The process begins around February and ends in June. Promotions are effective from 1st July of the year in question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1984 promotion exercise, the SAF Promotions Council recommended a number of promotions including Col Lee Hsien Loong. That recommendation together with others were accepted by the Minister. It was made irrespective of any contemplated resignation because the decision to promote is made purely on the basis of the officer's capacity to contribute to the SAF. Furthermore, unlike the situation in the civilian sector, SAF regulars who leave active service are still members of the SAF. As reservist officers or NCOs, they can expect to play as important a role or, if they upgrade themselves, even a greater role than when they were in active service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. If the resignation of the officer was known at the time the promotion was considered, may I ask the Minister what was the urgency in promoting him, if he was going to resign from active service in the Army? Is it not possible for him to have gone on the reservist strength and then be promoted through that, if he was found suitable for promotion? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained, the promotion of officers in the SAF depends on a number of factors: his experience, character, contribution to the SAF. In the case of Col Lee Hsien Loong, he was found worthy of promotion this year by the Promotions Council, and he was accordingly recommended for promotion. I have no reason to disagree with the recommendation of the Promotions Council. There was no need whatsoever to defer the promotion of a good officer who richly deserved to be promoted this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister be good enough to say how long this officer had been in active service in the Army before he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier?

Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent outbreak of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cholera in the Woodlands Home for the Aged was caused by the introduction of cholera bacteria into the Home from an outside source. A resident helper in the kitchen was infected through consuming contaminated food brought to him by a relative. He developed diarrhoea on 14 August and was diagnosed to be suffering from cholera on 18 August. Up to 7 September, a total of 21 residents were infected with cholera and 76 were identified as carriers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four of the cholera victims died. The causes of death were 'acute myocardial infarction' and 'acute cerebral infarction' in an 85-year old resident, 'cardio-respiratory failure' in an 82-year old resident, 'acute intestinal gangrene' in a 75-year old resident and 'acute gastroenteritis' in a 90-year old resident. It can be seen that two of the four victims died because of their frailty and low resistance to the cholera bacteria. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, certain newspapers have given wide publicity to the outbreak and attributed the spreading of the disease within the Home mainly to the unsanitary condition of the toilets. While a few toilets serving the male residents were defective at the time of the outbreak and some others were not quite clean, these were in themselves not the main cause for the spread of the disease in the Home. The frailty of most of the residents in the Home, many of whom are incontinent and have poor control over their bowels, were a more significant factor. It was unfortunate that an infected resident helper in the kitchen was not detected as a cholera victim and isolated until after several days. He was the initial source of the spread of the cholera. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My staff have done what they could within the available manpower resources of the Woodlands Home for the Aged. Mr Speaker, Sir, the relevant issue to consider here is whether we can afford to deploy a staff force to ensure at all times personal hygiene and complete cleanliness of the toilets and premises of these Homes. Although the State has a duty to care for the residents in these Welfare Homes, I am of the view that we must do the best with the resources available. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Measures taken to prevent recurrence of similar situations</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon has asked what measures have been taken to prevent recurrence of similar situations. Mr Speaker, Sir, this incident in the Woodlands Home was an unfortunate one. The Home has been in existence for 20 years and there has hitherto been no epidemic or even food poisoning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, we have taken several immediate measures to prevent recurrence of a similar outbreak. Only freshly cooked food is allowed into the Homes. All residents and food handlers are made to wash their hands before touching food and drinks. All food handlers will be screened regularly by the Ministry of Health. A new working procedure for minor repairs has been introduced which allows the Superintendent of the Home to get the work done by any nearby contractor if the term contractor appointed by PWD fails to respond to a request for minor repairs within a reasonable time. The existing PVC toilet cisterns will be phased out and replaced by heavy duty ones. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Hygienic Conditions of the Homes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs runs three Homes for the aged and destitutes and nine Homes for children and young persons. I am satisfied with the hygienic conditions of these Homes. Frequent inspections we conducted by my staff and by members of the Boards of Visitors appointed by the Director of Social Welfare. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the long term, my Ministry has instituted a thorough review of all its institutions. The review may result in the relocation of some Homes to more appropriate localities with purpose-built facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S.

According to her, even young, healthy office workers dirty the toilets no matter how new the environment of the office and the toilets may be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Straits Times, according to her, although the toilets are about two years old, the handles to the water closets are already breaking and repairs to choked toilets have been less than prompt.

Jayakumar (Minister for Labour and Second Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour and Second Minister for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision on the flat $120 levy cannot be rescinded. The foreign workers levy, including the levy on foreign maids, is not new. It was introduced in 1982 when it was decided to take certain foreign workers off the CPF Scheme. At that time, it was clearly explained that the main purpose of the levy was to discourage the indiscriminate recruitment of foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 30% ad valorem levy was introduced in 1982, the position of married working women was recognized. First, the minimum of $150 was not applicable to foreign maids. Secondly, foreign maids were among the categories not affected by the 1984 deadline for the phasing out of foreign workers from non-traditional sources. This distinction continues to be made. Thus the $120 flat levy is still lower than the previous 1982 minimum of $150. It is also much less than the $200 flat levy payable for other foreign workers which incidentally will be increased in stages to $350 in April 1986. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous 30% ad valorem levy was clearly insufficient to deter indiscriminate recruitment of maids or to curb the increase in their numbers. In the first six months of this year alone, there was an increase of nearly 5,000 foreign maids, much more than the total annual increase for the previous year of 3,000 which was already high. Many who had no genuine need for domestic help were recruiting foreign maids. Others were deploying them for unauthorized work. Under-declaration of wages in order to pay a lower levy was also increasing. These problems will become more acute as local incomes increase; the low cost of foreign maids will lead to an ever increasing demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no inconsistency between the $120 flat levy and the objective of getting more married women to join the workforce. The availability of a foreign maid was never intended to be, and must not be, the sole means to induce more married women to work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 106,900 married working women aged between 30 and 49 years. The argument that all or most of them should have maids is untenable. In addition, there are another 183,800 married women aged 30 - 49 who are now not working. If most or all of them are to be allowed maids in order to persuade them to work, we will then have about 300,000 maids in Singapore. The principal reason for encouraging more married women to work is precisely to reduce our dependence on foreign workers. It would therefore be defeating our objective if the entry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of married women into the workforce itself swells the foreign worker population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many other countries, such as Japan, USA and Europe, their female labour participation rate is higher than Singapore. Yet foreign domestic maids are not available. In Singapore, too, the use of all other alternatives must therefore be continually explored and encouraged: child care centres, creches, parents-in-law, foster services and so on. If foreign maids were available to every married working woman, not only will the number of maids proliferate to unmanageable levels, worse, there will be no pressure or need felt to actively develop these alternatives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have three supplementary questions but I wish to ask them one at a time.

I should be very pleased to see what the section says. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two questions are these. First, does the Minister really think that the levy had to be raised or imposed so as to restrict the number of foreign maids coming into Singapore? Does he not think that it is a specious answer? Is there no other way of controlling the entry of foreign maids other than by imposing a levy? Is the Minister really suggesting that work permits are being issued ad lib to everybody who cries for one foreign maid? Are there no conditions restricting the issue of work permits for foreign maids? I would ask the Minister to think carefully about these questions. Does he not think his answers are specious? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I ask was this levy imposed because it was another source of revenue for the Government? And if so, why does the Government need this money, and is it not another tax? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, l think we can now understand the points raised by the First Deputy Prime Minister if there was any doubt earlier.

Now, his other two questions are meaningless. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson must really make up his mind. He cannot blow hot and cold. On one occasion a few months ago, he took up the cause and argued vigorously for the displacement of all foreign workers. He made allegations here that the Government policy and foreign workers here were affecting our own workers. Now a 100% turnaround - asking for different measures which would encourage more maids to come to Singapore. So he should make up his mind. What is his position? What is his Party's position on foreign workers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I for the last time in this House appeal to the Minister to answer the questions?

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as all hon. Members are aware, since 1979, the Government has been urging employers to reduce their dependence on foreign workers. The economic, social, political and other reasons for this have been explained on many occasions. As a start, we have gradually phased out unskilled foreign workers from non-traditional sources except those who are required for work in the construction industry, the shipyards and as domestic servants. Most of the non-traditional source workers in the other sectors will have left by the end of this year and the remaining by 1986. Our present plan is to phase out the remaining unskilled foreign workers by 1992 as gradually as economic forces will permit us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to proceed with reduction of our dependence on unskilled and untrained foreign workers, it is necessary for us to start taking action even now as, otherwise, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the transitional difficulty will become even more severe. Obviously, the first measure that we have to take is to control the overall stock and be restrictive on the number of new foreign workers who are being admitted. We have been doing this for some time. However, with the recent pick-up in manufacturing activities because of the world economic recovery and with the accelerated public housing building programme reaching its peak, there has been an unusually heavy demand for workers and for foreign workers during the last few months. To accommodate the demand by these two vital sectors, we have to take a more restrictive policy in processing work permit applications from other sectors in order to hold down the overall number. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does appreciate that the more restrictive attitude towards new work permit applications will cause difficulty for some businessmen. However, these are transitional problems which ire less painful when adjustments are made early. Employers who do not make serious efforts to reduce their reliance on foreign workers will find it even more difficult to adjust later. My Ministry, however, will try to be as flexible as possible in processing work permit applications from employers within the constraints of our long-term goal of reducing reliance on unskilled work permit holders and the constraint of ensuring that numbers are kept at manageable levels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the hon. Member, in this regard, that my Ministry is, for the time being, flexible in allowing employers to renew the permits of their existing foreign workers other than those who are from non-traditional sources and are due for repatriation. Employers should however bear in mind that they will ultimately have even less foreign workers to solve their labour problems. They should therefore make adjustments before it is too late. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Choice of electorate)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

And may I ask him again, what constitutional theory has told him that this is possible? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson should listen to the answers he has solicited. I told him that the reserves do not belong to the People's Action Party. They belong to the people of Singapore. I have not consulted any legal experts. There are very few countries in the world that have these reserves. Therefore the question has not arisen. We can easily reduce ourselves to the state of the majority and the question will not arise. It has arisen because we are a minority, and I think it should not be beyond the ingenuity of people who have brought us into this unique position to make sure that, in so far as is humanly possible, no act of negligence or stupidity should pass unnoticed before the reserves are run down. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mechanism is quite simple, the implementation is quite complex. That is why there has been this long period of contemplation as we weigh the practical implications of our proposed methods, There will be ample opportunities for debate. There will be ample opportunities for those who oppose to say so.

They, too, take deposits from and lend money to the public, though finance companies cannot offer current account facilities to cus- tomers. However, unlike commercial banks, their operations are basically confined to the domestic market; they do not open branches overseas nor can they deal in foreign exchange and gold. There are currently 34 finance companies operating in Singapore. Out of these, 11 are owned by local banks, five are owned by foreign banks and 18 are independently-owned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance companies command a substantial share of the domestic market. As at June this year, total deposits of non-bank customers with finance companies amounted to $4.8 billion. This is about one fifth of domestic non-bank deposits of $26.5 billion placed with commercial banks. At the same time, loans extended to non-bank customers by finance companies amounted to $5.7 billion, about one-sixth of the domestic loans of $35.7 billion granted by commercial banks to non-bank customers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Finance Companies Act came into effect on 10th January 1968 and, except for a few amendments made in 1969, the Act has remained unaltered. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> However, the operations of finance companies have expanded substantially during this period of time. Over the decade or so from 1974 to June 1984, the aggregate capital funds of finance companies have increased by five times from $209.5 million as at December 1974 to $1.1 billion as at June 1984, and their total assets have increased from $1.4 billion to $6.9 billion. The range of activities that finance companies engage in has also broadened considerably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent amendment to the Banking Act aimed to rectify the inadequacies that then existed in the Act. Generally, most of the provisions of the Finance Companies Act are similar to those of the Banking Act before it was amended. It is therefore necessary that the Finance Companies Act be amended to bring it in line with the revised Banking Act, so that it would provide for effective supervision of finance companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the main provisions in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Act will, in general terms: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) provide for an expanded definition of financing business; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) ensure that control of finance companies would not pass into undesirable hands; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) set more suitable limits on credit facilities that a finance company may extend to its customers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) improve the Authority's supervisory powers over finance companies; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) enable the Authority to have stricter control over the audit of finance companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment widens the definition of financing business. The activities of finance companies have traditionally been that of collection of savings and term deposits and the channelling of such funds to hire-purchase and mortgage financing. However, the business of finance companies has evolved to include more sophisticated activities such as leasing and factoring. As such, the definition of financing business has to be amended to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> empower the Authority to prescribe certain operations as financing business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that finance companies do not pass into undesirable hands, the next set of amendments appearing in clause 4 would empower the Authority to control: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a takeover of a finance company by the intended acquisition of not less than 20% of its shares; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) arrangements by which outside parties would be able to determine the policy of a finance company; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the acquisition of substantial shareholdings, ie interests in 5% of the voting shares of a finance company. These amendments are the same as the amendments that have been recently effected for the Banking Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments, parallel to those effected for the Banking Act, seek to ensure that finance companies adopt high prudential standards and do not over-commit their resources. The amendments appearing in clause 7 would have the effect of: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) changing the existing limit which a finance company may grant credit facilities to a single customer or group of connected customers by lowering the aggregate percentage from an amount in excess of 60% of the capital funds of the finance company to 30%; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) limiting substantial loans to an aggregate amount which does not exceed 50% of its total credit facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial loan means, in general terms, a credit facility granted to a single customer or group of connected customers which in the aggregate exceeds 15% of the finance company's capital funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that the capital funds of individual finance companies vary substantially. Currently, they range from as low as $2.7 million to a high of $296.4 million. As such, finance companies with more modest capital funds might very well find that they would have to raise more capital in order to comply with the amended prudential limits. They can do this either by having shareholders inject \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more capital into their operations or by merging. Finance companies will be given a grace period of two years to comply with these new prudential limits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed in clause 8 is designed to ensure that finance companies conduct their investment activities in a prudential manner. This provision empowers the Authority to exercise a measure of control over finance companies which seek to diversify into other undertakings to an undesirable extent. Accordingly, it provides that finance companies shall not enter into agreements to acquire interests of 20% or more in any company without obtaining the approval of the Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the Authority to exercise prudential supervision on a group basis, clause 8 also sets out provisions empowering the Authority to require a finance company to aggregate its assets, liabilities or profits, with those of any of its subsidiaries or related companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of amendments appearing in clause 10 seek to enhance the Authority's powers of control over finance companies. Existing provisions in the Banking Act confer on the Authority powers to move in and take control of the bank if, for example, it is insolvent or found to be carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the interests of depositors. Under these provisions, the Authority can assume control of the bank, issue an order effecting an immediate change in the bank's management and appoint some other person to advise the bank in the proper conduct of its business. In this way, the Authority can ensure an orderly withdrawal of funds and the integrity of the bank's assets. These provisions will be incorporated into the Finance Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important amendment in the Banking Act was the introduction of new provisions to enable the Authority to extend the role of external auditors so that the auditors could play a supplementary supervisory role. This amendment is also proposed for the Finance Companies Act and appears in clause 12. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments made by the Bill do not warrant any special mention in addition to what has been stated in reference to them in the Explanatory Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES (RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.36 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed under the Bill to amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act to effect the following economic policies which were announced in the 1983 Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Extension of various incentives provided under the Act to non-manufactured products and services; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Extension of the investment allowance incentive to non-manufacturing companies for their water conservation projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Economic Expansion Incentives Act applies at present to only the manufacturing industry. We have in recent years been actively promoting activities like engineering and consultancy services, industrial design, biotechnology projects and computer services. These have been identified as areas of future economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill creates two new Parts - Part IIA and Part IIIA - to extend pioneer status tax relief and expansion incentives to cover the knowledge-intensive activities \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which we would like to encourage. The following activities will qualify for incentives under these new Parts: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) any engineering or technical services including laboratory, consultancy and research and development activities; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) computer-based information and other computer related services; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the development or production of any industrial design; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) such other services as the Minister may prescribe. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment allowance for water conservation projects is currently restricted only to manufacturing companies. The amendment to section 46B of the principal Act extends the incentive for investment allowances to a company which proposes to carry out a project for the purpose of reducing its consumption of potable water. This amendment will encourage non-manufacturing companies, such as hotels and shopping complexes, to invest in plant and equipment that will reduce their potable water consumption. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opportunity is also being taken to make certain technical amendments to the principal Act. Section 20 of the principal Act is being amended to change the base year for calculating expansion incentives. Currently, a company which qualifies for expansion incentives enjoys tax exemption on the additional profits it makes after the expansion. The reference used is the company's profit for the accounting year during which the expanded capacity comes on stream or the preceding accounting year. The amendment allows the average profit for the three years preceding the expansion to be used as the reference. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 46A of the principal Act is also being amended to broaden the definition of \"fixed capital expenditure\" for the purpose of investment allowances to include expenditure incurred on the acquisition of any know-how or patent rights. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to seek an expla- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nation from the Minister on this Bill. He says that the Bill is to amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act and to implement two new tax incentive schemes and also to make certain technical amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to know why is it necessary that we should proceed with the Second Reading of this Bill when at the commencement of business the Minister had just introduced a second amendment Bill to the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act. Why could not the second amendment Bill be incorporated into this first amendment Bill, or why could not this first amendment Bill wait until the provisions of the second amendment Bill are ready and we debate the whole thing together? Can I please have an explanation? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the answer is a very simple one. We were unable to get all the amendments ready in time to enable all the amendments to be incorporated in this present Bill and, rather than wait until we were able to finalize all the amendments, we decided to proceed with the amendments which have been finalized and agreed with the Attorney-General's Chambers. I regret that it was not possible to have a neater arrangement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I also heard the Minister say just now that this was to implement the schemes announced at the Budget meeting. The Budget meeting was sometime in March and now it is October, i.e. seven months ago. Surely, all these amendments could have been incorporated into one amendment Bill so that we could discuss them together rather than coming to Parliament in bits and pieces. Personally, if for no other reason, the Minister should really ask his technical staff to get on with the work or wait until we have got everything together and then come here for a debate rather than coming o Parliament in bits and pieces and ask us to approve this Bill now and then the second amendment Bill at the next sitting which could be any time seven days after the second Bill is published. I just do not see why Parliament should be asked to sit at different sittings debating amendments to the same Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the answer is very simple. Times change and we must change with it. Taxation Bills are difficult Bills and while my officials have done their best in order to try and incorporate all the changes that are necessary, I am afraid that I cannot assure the Member that it will ever be possible for me to put forward a perfect Bill which will incorporate all the amendments that we wish to introduce. Indeed I think it will be inadvisable to do so because it will mean that we have reached a stage of stagnation and that my Ministry at least would have no new ideas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, you must pardon me if I pursue this line of argument. This amendment Bill was first published on 24th August and we are now having another amendment Bill which would again be debated. I am sure the Minister has got simple explanations. The explanation is convenience of his technical staff. But how about the convenience of Members of Parliament? I also appreciate that the Minister cannot incorporate all the amendments at one go but the time difference between two amendment Bills is really far too short. He is asking us to swallow this, saying \"it is not possible.\" The time difference is too short. Today is the 19th October and the first amendment Bill was introduced on 24th August.

It would have been possible for me to hold up the second amendment Bill until next year so that I would not have given the Member cause for concern or to be upset today. But I felt it was unwise to do so and that, as and when the amendments are ready, they should be presented to Parliament. And I see no reason for holding up any amendment just to make sure that it gives the appearance that we have thought out everything. But I would assure the Member that we will, of course, try and incorporate and be as expeditious as possible in presenting the necessary amendments to Parliament.

The study, carried out in consultation with the relevant authorities, such as the Port of Singapore Authority, Public Utilities Board, Jurong Town Corporation, Sewerage Department and the Primary Production Department, has shown that another 685 hectares of land at Punggol can be reclaimed. This is shown, coloured pink, on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/84\" a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of Honourable Members. This reclamation will be in addition to the 277 hectares off Punggol, coloured yellow on the plan, approved for reclamation by this House at its sitting on 4th March, 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas to be reclaimed are in the shallow waters off Pasir Ris, Punggol and Jalan Kayu. Areas 2, 3 and 4 in the plan will be used for public housing, while area 1, being adjacent to the Serangoon sludge \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> treatment works, will be used for refuse tipping, and industrial and recreational purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation will not affect the navigational channel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation works will be carried out in phases over a nine-year period from 1985 to 1993. Area 2 where the Punggol Fishing Port is located will be reclaimed last to give the fishing port a useful lifespan of almost 10 years. The fishing port will be relocated to a nearby location on the reclaimed land when reclamation works have been completed. Other consequential works required are the extension of the effluent out-fall pipes from the Seletar and Serangoon Sewerage Treatment Works and the preparation of new refuse tipping ground at Area 1. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the project inclusive of the consequential works has been estimated at $874 million. About 76 million cubic metres of fill will be required for this project.

'N' level examinations in school. The criterion recommended by a committee of principals was based on an aggregate of 12 points for first language and 2 other subjects. Subsequently, studies based on the results of specimen Cambridge G.C.E. 'N' level papers administered to our pupils showed that the criterion should be changed to 9 points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the announcement before the examinations would not have adversely affected the pupils. The announcement was concerned only with the criterion for repeating the G.C.E. 'N' level in school.

Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health if he will make public the report and findings of the Singapore Armed Forces Board of Inquiry into the death of Pte V. Rajendran of the Singapore Armed Forces on the 9th November 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> PTE Rajendran's death was the subject of Coroner's Inquiry No 2801/83. This was a public Inquiry under the law, All facts relevant and material to his death were before the State Coroner, who made his findings on 15th September, 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Armed Forces Council convened a Board of Inquiry into the death of PTE V Rajendran. The law provides that the record of proceedings of a Board of Inquiry held pursuant to the Singapore Armed Forces Act, 1972, and Regulations made thereunder, are privileged. No person is entitled, as of right, to a copy of the record of proceedings of any Inquiry. Following British practice, the Ministry of Defence does not publish Board of Inquiry reports. Besides security objections in some cases, there could also be legal difficulties, because the witnesses appearing before a Board of Inquiry are not protected by the same rules of evidence which apply in the courts. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to make public the report and findings of the Board of Inquiry on the death of PTE V Rajendran. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I recognize that the death of a serviceman, especially a national serviceman, is a matter of grave concern, not only to my Ministry, but also to the general public. I can therefore state that in the case of PTE Rajendran, the Board of Inquiry's findings were consistent with the Coroner's findings. In particular, both findings confirmed that the deceased died of bronchopneumonia, and that there had been no ill treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that no serviceman is exposed to unnecessary risk during his military service, the SAF has published training and safety directives, prescribing how training should be conducted, and what specific safety precautions must be taken. There are also medical and evacuation instructions which explain what should be done in case a serviceman is injured. These directives and instructions are strictly complied with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a serviceman is killed or seriously injured in service, the Armed Forces Council, chaired by the Minister of Defence, convenes a Board of Inquiry to investigate the matter. The Board is chaired by a senior officer from a different unit, or even from a different Ministry, who has nothing to do with the incident. It investigates not only the immediate cause of the death or injury, but also the training the serviceman was involved in, and whether remedial or disciplinary actions are called for. The Board reports directly to the Armed Forces Council, which follows up the case with the full resources of the Ministry of Defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MERGER OF NEWSPAPER COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

When the idea was mooted by the publishing companies, the Government raised no objections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger makes sense. The two publishing houses will have to spend $20-30 million a year for the next few years in a long and fierce circulation war. This does not include the capital expenditure of over $50 million on duplicated plant and equipment which will be incurred by both sides. Its outcome will be uncertain. Singapore may at the end of the day still end up with only one newspaper in English and one in Chinese. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1982, the newspapers were restructured to ensure the long-term viability of Chinese newspapers and to upgrade the standard of journalism in English newspapers through competition. The objectives remain unchanged. The merger has guaranteed the long-term survival of the Chinese newspapers.

Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry what are the functions and responsibilities of the Social Development Unit and what is the amount of money that has been expended on the work of the Unit since it was set up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> The 1980 census highlighted the fact that an alarmingly large number of better educated ladies remain unmarried. The factors contributing to this trend are:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The cultural attitude amongst the local men who prefer to marry women with educationally lower qualification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The preference amongst the tertiary educated women to marry men who are better educated or at least of the same educational level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on equal educational opportunities for both male and female has unwittingly brought about the high incidence of singlehood amongst our graduate women. As a responsible Government, it has to try to correct this trend. The Social Development Unit was formed in January 1984 mainly to act as a catalyst, to start public thinking and discussion on the subject and to provide opportunities for single men and women to interact socially. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three training workshops and eight computer courses have been run and expenditure to date is about $200,000. Thus far, 700 persons have benefitted from the activities organised by the Social Development Unit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONTROL OVER DIVERSIFICATION OF GOVERNMENT COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken by the Government to strengthen control over the diversification activities of government-owned or government-controlled companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Most of the companies, which are owned or controlled by government, were set up in the 1960s and early 1970s. The companies were established principally to satisfy economic policy objectives prevailing at the time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every dynamic enterprise makes appropriate responses to changes in external conditions. Government companies are no exception. Many of them launched activities which were related to their main line of business or specialisation. Those companies have by and large done well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few companies may have strained the definition of related activities. Those companies are now being curbed and all companies have been reminded that they should not stray too far from their core businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the Member that the Ministry of Finance takes a close interest in the affairs of government companies. Every quarter I chair a meeting of senior government officials which reviews, in some detail, the performance and major activities of government companies. Reports on the progress of the companies are submitted to Cabinet regularly. In addition, I make it a point to visit periodically the major companies which are owned or controlled by government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above steps I am satisfied that there is adequate supervision over the diversification activities of government-owned or government-controlled companies. It would, however, not be desirable, in my view, to hobble government companies to such an extent that the managements are inhibited from making normal commercial decisions without reference to the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>1984 PILGRIMAGE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr M.K.A.

The Muassasah is an agency set up to coordinate arrangements for pilgrims from a specific country or region. The objectives of the Muassasah system are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. to upgrade the standard of service for pilgrims; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. to regularise the fees charged by the Makkah syehs; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. to prevent pilgrims from being overcharged by unscrupulous syehs; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. to eliminate the annually recurring problems of water shortage, poor transportation service and poor quality of food provided; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. to group pilgrims of the same country together so that they can be better looked after. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the problems encountered by the pilgrims were poor accommodation, inadequate supply of water, difficulty in obtaining food and poor transportation service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is collating information from pilgrims, pilgrim brokers and the team of Medical/Welfare officers who accompanied the pilgrims during their Haj on the problems they encountered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS will then take up the pilgrims' problems with the relevant Muassasah agency so that these may be resolved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>AL-AMIN MASJID</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr M.K.A.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> The Ministry of Labour, through its Employment Service Department, provides assistance to disabled persons who seek employment if they are Singapore citizens or permanent residents. Since 1977, the Department has found employment for a total of 667 disabled persons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides direct placement services, the Department also administers a Disablement Resettlement Scheme to assist disabled persons to be gainfully employed. Under this Scheme, the Department arranges job training for disabled persons and subsequent employment. Since 1977, 212 disabled persons had completed their training under this Scheme and were found employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experiences of the Department, the major problems facing employment prospects for the disabled are the same as that for handicapped persons. Employers are reluctant to employ them for fear that being less mobile and dexterous, their work would be affected. However, job placement officers from the Vocational Assessment and Placement Centre of the Singapore Council of Social Service, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Labour are continually exploring job opportunities for the disabled. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REPRIEVE FOR WORK PERMIT HOLDERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr M.K.A.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Work permit holders from non-traditional sources were only allowed into Singapore as a temporary measure. Hence, in January 1982, the Government announced its plan to phase out these unskilled foreign workers as and when their permits expire except for construction, shipyards and domestics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers referred to by the Honourable Member have therefore been given ample notice and have had adequate time to adopt measures to reduce their dependence on unskilled foreign workers. Many employers have already done so. Those employers who are still having the workers cannot, therefore, be given further extensions of one to two years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CHECK-OFF FOR DURATION OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr M.K.A.
