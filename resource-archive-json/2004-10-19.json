FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> The US State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report for 2003, which was released on 1st March 2004, listed a range of jurisdictions as being of primary concern in respect of money laundering from international narcotics trafficking and other serious crimes.&nbsp; Singapore was included in that list together with the UK, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Switzerland, as well as the US itself.&nbsp; In short, all the major financial centres of the world were included in the&nbsp; list.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US State Department Report did not provide any basis for suggesting that Singapore-based financial institutions engage in transactions involving a significant amount of proceeds from<p align=left>Column: 802<p> international narcotics trafficking and other serious crimes.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; However, money laundering must be a concern in every country, and especially in international financial centres which handle huge volumes of transactions on a daily basis. Singapore takes its responsibilities very seriously in this regard.&nbsp; We are a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international body that develops policies and standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp; The US State Department's Report indeed acknowledges that Singapore strongly opposes money laundering and terrorism financing and has been a key player in the regional effort to stop terrorist financing in Southeast Asia.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS requires all banks and financial institutions operating in Singapore to institute rigorous measures to guard against money-laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp; These include the need to identify and know their customers and their customers' source of funds. &nbsp;They also have&nbsp; to maintain the records necessary to reconstruct and explain details of transactions, and to report all suspicious transactions.&nbsp; MAS conducts both offsite reviews and onsite inspections of banks and financial institutions to ensure that these measures are in place. &nbsp;External auditors engaged by banks and financial institutions are similarly required to audit for compliance with MAS regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through these rigorous processes, banks have identified and filed suspicious transaction reports with the Commercial Affairs Department CAD).&nbsp; CAD investigates these reports and, where it finds wrongdoing, it will take firm action.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2003, Singapore completed its IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Programme.&nbsp; The team of assessors found that Singapore has a comprehensive legal, institutional, policy and supervisory framework to combat <p align=left>Column: 803<p>money laundering and terrorism financing.&nbsp; They also noted that our financial institutions have a strong compliance culture for requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will stay fully committed to the international effort against money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp; Our high regulatory and supervisory standards are recognised internationally.

<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):&nbsp;</B> Sir, the Minister has given a comprehensive reply to the questions.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is:&nbsp; what else can be done in order to have Singapore removed from the list in view of the fact that we have put so many safeguards and measures in place and yet we have been cited in the report since 1987?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is whether the US State Department has cited any specific incidence or evidence to support their allegation that we are a major money-laundering country because Singaporeans are obviously very concerned over this label&nbsp;and they would like to see it removed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question is what other steps have been taken in order to try and make clear our position and make the US State Department understand our position, in particular, whether we have tried to enlist the help and get our Embassy in the US to speak to the US State Department or get the American Ambassador here to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final question, Sir, is whether there has been an increase in the number of suspicious transactions reported by the banks and whether there has been any prosecution by the CAD arising from such reports.</p></div></span>\t\t<p align=left>Column: 804<p>\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; I would like to thank Mdm Halimah for her useful questions.&nbsp; What steps can we take?&nbsp; It is really continuous work on the part of the banks to keep an eye out for anything that looks suspicious and to know their customers.&nbsp; The provisions are there not just in name.&nbsp; It is a real process where bank officers&nbsp;have to go through the full process of checking out the customers, trying to identify the source of funds and so on.&nbsp; It is also something which MAS takes very seriously in all its inspections of banks.&nbsp; It is a regular feature of the offsite review of information that is provided from the banks to the MAS, as well as the&nbsp;inspections we do when we go onsite to the banks themselves.&nbsp; We look up their records, check some&nbsp;transactions, speak to them about their processes, and speak to the audit committee, and so on.&nbsp; So it is something that we take very seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no specifics mentioned in the latest report to justify Singapore's inclusion among the jurisdictions suspected of being money-laundering centres.&nbsp; But one can infer from the list of countries included that all the major financial centres, by virtue of the fact that they have&nbsp;a very large volume of transactions, including currency transactions, passing through their centres on a daily basis, both onshore and offshore, are vulnerable to money laundering.&nbsp; We should not deny that.&nbsp; As an international financial centre, we should take it all the more seriously and keep working at it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we will keep up with our communication with the US State Department.&nbsp; I think they understand our position.&nbsp; They themselves have recognised in their report that Singapore is in the forefront of the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing and we will keep our line of communication with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Failure to comply is a criminal offence.&nbsp; So our banks take it very seriously.&nbsp; You will see the number moving&nbsp;up and down from year to year.&nbsp; I do not think we see an uptrend as such.&nbsp; Yes, there have been prosecutions.&nbsp; In fact, over the last three years alone, there have been more than 10 prosecutions by the CAD.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO MALAYSIA--><p align=left>Column: 805<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This was his second introductory visit to an ASEAN country to meet his counterparts.&nbsp; Although brief, it was a good visit.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and the Malaysian government accorded Prime Minister Lee and the Singapore delegation a warm welcome.&nbsp; Prime Minister Lee held a private, four-eye meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah, followed by a full delegation meeting.&nbsp; The two Prime Ministers, who are also Finance Ministers, signed a new Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) which will eliminate double taxation <p align=left>Column: 806<p>and promote cross-border investments.&nbsp; Their discussions focused on the two countries working together to strengthen bilateral ties, and to develop new areas of win-win cooperation.&nbsp; We already cooperate in a broad range of areas, including trade and investments, tourism, security as well as in handling problems like SARS and the avian flu. The Prime Ministers agreed that the two countries should enhance cooperation in areas such as tourism and transport links, including air transport. Our private sector should also do more.&nbsp; Prime Minister Lee noted that the tone of bilateral relations had improved and that both sides had to \"build on this and develop more momentum and cooperation\".</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; The two Prime Ministers also agreed that Singapore and Malaysia should look ahead, and not allow problems to affect overall cooperation. On the outstanding bilateral issues, Prime Minister Abdullah put forward some suggestions. Prime Minister Lee informed him that for continuity, he had asked Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong to handle these issues. Senior Minister Goh is familiar with the details and complexities of these issues, and will study carefully any Malaysian proposals. Prime Minister Abdullah reiterated his invitation for Senior Minister Goh to visit Malaysia soon, and we are working on possible dates for the visit.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Relations between countries, particularly close partners like Singapore and Malaysia, are not driven by \"tipping points\" but rather by fundamental interests. In many areas, the fundamental interests of Malaysia and Singapore run parallel, and link us together. In the wider perspective, we are not each other's main competitors.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; Singapore and Malaysia now see an opportunity to take bilateral cooperation to a new level. Maintaining this momentum will require hard work on both<p align=left>Column: 807<p> sides. From the way we cooperated to tackle problems such as terrorism and the Avian flu, there are grounds for optimism.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; But we must also be realistic. Apart from the outstanding bilateral issues, as two close neighbours, we must expect other disagreements and difficulties to arise from time to time. This is inherent in our situation. However, we must not allow these disagreements to define the entire bilateral relationship, or prevent cooperation in other areas. On this basis, I am confident that we&nbsp;will be able to improve our relationship in a mutually beneficial way.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (b) how can it be ensured that media competition in future can succeed and result in greater product variety and better-quality journalism.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say from the outset that although we have given in-principle approval to Singapore Press Holdings and MediaCorp's application for merging part of their media operations, the Media Development Authority and my Ministry are in the process of examining the application and studying the details of the merger before taking a decision on formal approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Sir, I&nbsp;now turn to the lessons that we can draw from this<p align=left>Column: 809<p> experience.&nbsp; The aim of the media liberalisation in June 2000 was to help the local media diversify their media operations, tap the benefits of media convergence and give Singaporeans more choices in terms of TV and newspaper offerings.&nbsp; This was also to prepare the local media for competition in an increasingly globalised economy.&nbsp; As a result of media liberalisation, consumers, local production houses and advertisers have benefited from the increase in supply of media products.&nbsp; Compared to pre-liberalisation, Singaporeans now enjoy a wider selection of TV programmes from two additional TV channels and additional free newspapers, namely <I>TODAY</I> and <I>Streats.</I>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while competition has brought about some benefits for consumers, it has also demonstrated the difficulties faced by&nbsp;Singapore Press Holdings&nbsp;and MediaCorp when they venture into each other's traditional preserves.&nbsp; Competition reveals that a small media market, a limited talent pool and a small advertising pie segmented by languages are major constraints in the media environment.&nbsp; These constraints were exacerbated by the onset of economic downturn post-liberalisation and the consequential shrinkage in&nbsp;advertisement spending by companies.&nbsp; Furthermore, both companies resorted to aggressively bidding for imported content and undercutting each other's advertising rates. &nbsp;It is therefore not surprising that they suffered substantial financial losses in the midst of an economic recession.&nbsp; While we acknowledge that free-to-air TV services typically take several years before breaking even, we have to accept the companies' decision in not wanting to incur further losses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of Singapore Press Holdings&nbsp;and MediaCorp illustrates the complexity in media competition.&nbsp; Whilst competition may have worked well for other small countries, there is no one-size-fits-all formula for success as each<p align=left>Column: 810<p> country is different.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we have gained a better understanding of our media environment and a greater awareness of the challenges our media players face.&nbsp; Our experience had helped us to draw up a media competition code which was introduced in April 2003 as \"The Code of Practice for Market Conduct in the Provision of Mass Media Services\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some have attributed the failure of both companies to the lack of a media competition code from the very beginning.&nbsp; I do not share this view.&nbsp; While the media competition code could guard against anti-competitive behaviour by preventing the dominant player from gaining unfair advantage over new entrants through predatory pricing, it could not be used to micro-manage the business strategy of&nbsp;media companies.&nbsp; Thus, it would not have addressed the aggressive competition for viewers and readers adopted by the two media companies.&nbsp; Such behaviour is best left to the market to sort out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the second question concerning media competition, the Government will not reverse its policy on media liberalisation and will remain committed to allowing competition.&nbsp; We do not have a cap on the number of media licences.&nbsp; Notwithstanding MediaCorp and Singapore Press Holdings' decision to merge, the Government continues to welcome new players willing to enter the TV and/or newspaper market, if they meet the prevailing criteria for such licences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to reiterate that the Government cannot foster competition at all costs or ensure that every media operation entering the market will succeed.&nbsp; Business success will depend on the operator's entrepreneurial capability and be subjected to the discipline of market forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have so many Questions to deal with.&nbsp; Dr Lee.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lee Boon Yang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained in my main answer that I do not think we can attribute the failure of&nbsp;the broadcast and print media competition to the lack of a competition code or competition regulation right from the onset.&nbsp; I think it is not fair to compare the broadcast and print media to the telecommunications market.&nbsp; Both markets are quite distinctly different, involving different technology applications.&nbsp; In the case of the failure of the broadcast and the print media competition, as I have explained, one of the significant factors is&nbsp;the shrinkage of the advertisement pie over the period from 2000 up to now.&nbsp; When the media market was liberalised in 2000, the approximate broadcast advertisement expenditure was around $200 million and it was projected to increase yearly to a figure of $270 million.&nbsp; But we know that, in reality, far from increasing, soon after liberalisation, the amount of&nbsp;expenditure spent for<p align=left>Column: 813<p> advertisements actually fell, and&nbsp;last year it was only about $180 million.&nbsp; So, instead of&nbsp;increasing, it actually fell.&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, the competitors adopted strategies which further undermined each other's viability&nbsp;by way of a \"cut-throat\" type of competition&nbsp;that certainly did not help in business viability.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of not having a competition code in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to remind the Member that in the case of telecommunications, the competition code came later after the market was thrown open for new entrants to the market.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;about nine months or so before the competition code was introduced.&nbsp; So one cannot take the approach that just because it was liberalised without an existing regulatory framework, it was doomed to failure.&nbsp; I think the two businesses are quite different - newspaper broadcasting versus telecommunications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would be the desired outcome?&nbsp; I think the desired outcome is for viable media companies in Singapore making every effort to constantly improve the quality of the products&nbsp;and also to offer a&nbsp;choice to consumers.&nbsp; Having looked back in history, the <I>Straits Times</I> has been the dominant English mass circulation newspaper for more than 100 years without very much competition.&nbsp; Did that result in the <I>Straits Times</I> stagnating, or the <I>Straits Times</I> took it upon itself&nbsp;as the sole player and therefore took a very relaxed approach&nbsp;and just dished out a low quality media product?&nbsp; On the contrary, although it was the dominant player, the <I>Straits Times</I> made every effort to constantly upgrade the&nbsp;quality of the product that it was offering.&nbsp; Not just the <I>Straits Times</I> alone.&nbsp; In fact, if you look at all of the stable of Singapore Press Holdings' publications, each one, in its own way, even before pre-liberalisation and pre-competition, was constantly making efforts to improve the quality of&nbsp;its products. The fact that they have won <p align=left>Column: 814<p>many international awards in various media classifications or sectors shows that their efforts have been recognised.&nbsp; So we cannot assume that just because there is no head-on competition,&nbsp;companies do not make an effort to upgrade themselves.&nbsp; My Ministry will certainly be trying to encourage these companies, even after they have&nbsp;merged part of their operation, to constantly upgrade and improve the capabilities of their journalists and&nbsp;editorial staff so that they can produce better quality reports and better quality broadcast materials for the consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least, does&nbsp;the failure of this effort to introduce competition in the media market signal that there is no opportunity for media competition in future in Singapore?&nbsp; I would say no.&nbsp; We have to look at each situation on its own.&nbsp; We launched media competition in 2000.&nbsp; On hindsight, which is always a 6:6 vision, we can say that it was perhaps&nbsp;at the&nbsp;wrong timing because the regional economy and our economy went into a period of slowdown.&nbsp; That was not the best time.&nbsp; But how were we to know precisely what would happen next?&nbsp; We just threw open the market and let the competitors do what they think was best for their business interest.&nbsp; The same would apply, going forward in the future.&nbsp; Last year, we opened up bidding for a second pay-TV licence in Singapore. There were no takers.&nbsp; Does that mean that we are resigned to not having a second pay-TV operator in Singapore?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; Some time in the future, when the environment changes, when the market conditions improve, we will put the second pay-TV licence out for tender again.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

There could be new technology available to minimise the cost of entering the pay-TV market, and somebody else might take it up and there could be competition even in the pay-TV sector.&nbsp; Likewise, for newspapers and broadcasting, there is always the<p align=left>Column: 815<p> possibility that other players might want to enter the market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we must bear in mind that&nbsp;although the broadcast market, after this proposed merger, would fall within the ambit of a single operator, MediaCorp, it does not mean that MediaCorp has the entire Singapore broadcast market on its own.&nbsp; It has a free-to-air channel, but do not forget that we have a digitised cable TV system in operation today which has the capability to offer anywhere between 50-80 channels.&nbsp; Today, I think they&nbsp;already have more than 40 channels available, and the offerings are continuing to increase.&nbsp; So our free-to-air television stations would be constantly faced with competition coming from the pay-TV sector.&nbsp; So they cannot relax.&nbsp; They have to fight this competition.&nbsp; They have to improve the quality of the product, the diversity of the content that they could offer in order to justify the market share.&nbsp; So I think we could look at this more confidently that in future, as the market for both broadcast and newspapers evolves, who knows there may be other players interested and the Government would certainly not discourage them.&nbsp; As I said earlier on, we do not have a cap on the number of licences that we would issue.&nbsp; Any player who comes along, we are prepared to consider.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the five-day work week will be implemented in all schools by January 2005.&nbsp; A committee, chaired by the Director of Schools, is examining the implementation issues. &nbsp;MOE has provided schools with guidelines to help them formulate their plans to implement the five-day work week. &nbsp;It has also shared examples of best practices from schools that have already been practising a <I>de facto</I> five-day week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry has cautioned that the shift to a five-day work week should not overload students during weekdays.&nbsp; It should also not be at the expense of the breadth of educational experience that we want to provide our students, in academic as well as non-academic areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make this possible, schools will seek to rationalise their programmes and look at how they can be delivered more effectively.&nbsp; It would mean cutting down on less effective or meaningful activities, while preserving or enhancing those that add the most value. &nbsp;Some JCs, for instance, intend to rationalise the number of tests they conduct in JC 1, so that teachers and students will have more time for learning and CCA activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools will look on Saturday as an opportunity for students to engage in unstructured activities, to reflect and to pursue their&nbsp; interests.&nbsp; Schools will also hold CCAs on weekends where necessary. Serangoon JC, for example, is planning to keep canoeing on Saturdays as students need the longer period of time that Saturdays&nbsp;allow to gain the full benefit of this CCA.&nbsp; Certain CCAs which rely heavily on adult or student&nbsp;volunteers from other schools, like some of the uniformed groups, are also likely to remain on Saturdays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, our schools are enthusiastic and committed to implementing the five-day work week well. At least 22 schools <p align=left>Column: 821<p>\thave already implemented a five-day work week.&nbsp; Schools will find sensible and pragmatic ways to do so, so as not to overburden either teacher or student, while preserving the richness of educational experience they provide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about single session schools in this context. &nbsp;All secondary schools and junior colleges are already operating on single session.&nbsp; Around two-thirds or 65% of the primary schools will implement full or partial single session from next year, while the rest will introduce partial single session within&nbsp;the next 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Phua also asked about community use of school facilities.&nbsp; Today, there are 310 schools which share their facilities with the community, and various groups and institutions outside school hours.&nbsp; In addition, MOE has been piloting a school field sharing scheme with the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) in seven schools under which the general public can book specially fenced-off school fields for recreational use outside of school hours.&nbsp; MOE is now working with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the SSC to expand the scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools support requests from the community to use their facilities as long as there is no compromise on the students' security and educational experience, which must always take precedence. Even with the implementation of the five-day work week, many students are likely to use school facilities on Saturdays.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is possible that more school-based facilities could be freed up for public usage on weekends.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)</B>:&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;there are some genuine concerns from parents who work on Saturdays that their children may not use the Saturdays off meaningfully but instead they may get <p align=left>Column: 822<p>\tinto bad company, and I think there are also genuine concerns from teachers along this line too.&nbsp; Would the Ministry ensure that schools could organise at least some activities from time to time for such students, or at least direct them to such meaningful activities?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member's point is a fair one.&nbsp; We are not&nbsp;moving from one extreme to another.&nbsp; It is not a black and white situation. Saturdays are good days to organise activities for our students, whether it is CCAs or enrichment or unstructured activities.&nbsp; We have to do so in a way which does not mean a five-and-a-half-day work week for our teachers.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it may mean making better use of student leaders themselves, allowing more opportunity for student leadership.&nbsp; It may mean allowing&nbsp;parents and families to come in and take part in CCAs, for instance, in primary schools.&nbsp; Some of our primary schools are, in fact, doing this very successfully.&nbsp; It achieves both family bonding as well as gets the kids involved in something healthy and allows them to use their energies&nbsp;well.&nbsp; So schools will work these things out, making sure we do&nbsp;not overburden the teachers but using Saturdays to stretch our kids a little, engage them in something purposeful.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Not many parents will favour a full day school for lower primary kids.&nbsp; But we are moving towards partial single session so as to allow, especially the upper primary&nbsp;kids&nbsp;-&nbsp;primary 3 to primary 6 - to have&nbsp;the space in the afternoons to engage in various school programmes, be it CCA or learning activities of one form or another.&nbsp; I think this is a pragmatic solution.&nbsp; The lower primary kids will occasionally do the same, but it is less frequent and less intensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving all our primary schools to single session will be very expensive as well.&nbsp; It means building 40 more schools, which means $800 million.&nbsp; And I think we can use those resources much more effectively in other areas, especially in our continual efforts to improve the quality of the teaching profession -&nbsp;hire more teachers, add more quality educational programmes, allow schools to build niches of excellence.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My question is: what will the Ministry do to ensure compliance at the individual school level?&nbsp; When will this five-day week be implemented in schools?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp; Sir, we are quite mindful of that.&nbsp; The basic precept of moving towards a five-day work week is that our teachers, like other civil servants, will work what I might call <p align=left>Column: 824<p>\ta five-day equivalent week.&nbsp; But&nbsp;like in other professions, sometimes you have to work on a Saturday, and many teachers would want to do so for particular reasons.&nbsp; But it should not be the norm, and, in general, a five-day equivalent work week should prevail.&nbsp; So schools are working this out.&nbsp; Schools will find different ways of spreading the responsibilities of their teachers.&nbsp; There will be some teachers who will be a little more engaged than others on Saturdays because of the nature of the activity they are supervising.&nbsp; And those teachers will find that they will have lesser duties during the work week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave it to schools to work out.&nbsp; There are several schools where I found that, in fact,&nbsp;a five-day week with very little activity on Saturday is workable.&nbsp; It depends on the nature of their activities and the profile of their students and CCA activities.&nbsp; So we will bear that in mind as one of our key precepts as we go forward.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.&nbsp; Following an earlier supplementary question, with regard to involvement in unstructured activities, I think, inevitably, the&nbsp;teaching staff as well as non-teaching staff may be involved if they are required to help to organise some of these ad hoc activities on Saturdays.&nbsp; In the event of this, how would the teaching and non-teaching staff be compensated?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is: how&nbsp;can MOE more actively promote a partnership of school CCAs with the community so as to better reinforce the sharing of infrastructure facilities?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp; Sir, on her first question, I am not keen to encourage a culture where people clock in and clock out with some precision.&nbsp; Teaching is a labour of love in many ways.&nbsp; It requires commitment.&nbsp; It is a challenging profession, but you cannot mark exactly when you clock in and clock<p align=left>Column: 825<p>\t out.&nbsp; It is much like many other professions. If occasionally a teacher has to do something on a Saturday because it is an activity of importance to the school&nbsp;- they might want the students to benefit from extra CCA training or special enrichment activity - I would not be keen to have to work out schemes of compensation.&nbsp; I think these things can be dealt with sensibly in the context of the school where everyone shares in the mission and shares in the objective of the school, so that teachers who put in extra effort are recognised.&nbsp; Sometimes they might be given time off and, at other times, their duties and responsibilities in other areas might be reduced.&nbsp; This is what school leadership is about.&nbsp; So working out a Ministry scheme would not be the right approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her second question is on the community's use of facilities.&nbsp; It is actually proceeding quite well.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can scale it up.&nbsp; I think this scheme that we are working out now with MCYS and the Singapore Sports Council is a promising one.&nbsp; We are piloting seven schools.&nbsp; It is working quite well.&nbsp; So let us take that forward.&nbsp; I do not see major systemic impediments to this.&nbsp; It is a practical issue.&nbsp; We could deal with security and we have got to ensure that there is absolutely no compromise on our students' educational experience&nbsp;-&nbsp;the fact that they have got to&nbsp;have those facilities available to them when the school decides&nbsp;they are&nbsp;necessary.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Minister for Manpower):&nbsp;</B> Sir, employability skills refer to the generic or foundational skills that every worker should possess.&nbsp; They include literacy, being able to communicate effectively, as well as to use information communication technologies (ICT), identify and solve problems, adapt to changes and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; These foundational skills are distinct from occupational or technical skills. However, employers recognise them as equally important to workplace effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA has, in consultation with employers and industry partners, mapped out the sets of employability skills that are relevant and useful.&nbsp; These will be particularly helpful in raising the employability of the lower skilled workers.&nbsp; For example, without workplace literacy, it would be very difficult for the lower skilled worker<p align=left>Column: 827<p> to learn new occupational skills to take on a new job.&nbsp; In other words, some workers&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;literate enough to read instruction manuals for new machines in the workplace.&nbsp; The customised training does not aim to help them read widely but focuses on their ability to read relevant instructions at their work to upgrade themselves.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Apart from setting out the key employability skills, the ESS comprises appraisal tools that enable career counsellors, employers and training providers to identify the competency gaps of job seekers and employees.&nbsp; The results are used to determine the type of training required for the worker.&nbsp; After training, the competencies of trainees would be re-assessed and they will receive certification as evidence of their new skills acquired.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are areas in which we expect every worker to have some knowledge in and some competency so that they can learn better and contribute better to the companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In benchmarking ourselves, we have taken a look at practices in many countries.&nbsp; We have taken a look at the Australian Business Council's employability skills standards.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;also taken a look at the&nbsp;Conference Board of Canada on employability skills 2000 plus&nbsp;the UK's Qualification and Curriculum Authority's key skills and&nbsp;the practices in the United States.&nbsp;

As to whether we have dipped into reserve fund, we have not.&nbsp; It is an endowment fund.&nbsp; So the Committees have been quite prudent.&nbsp; But we do not really put an upper bound to the number of applications.&nbsp;

But my preferred approach is we keep the guidelines loose, and then we let maximum flexibility on&nbsp;the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is&nbsp;my preferred arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are some simple rules.&nbsp; One, only citizens need apply.&nbsp; So, if you are a non-citizen, sorry, you are out.&nbsp; Two,&nbsp;it is very hard to judge who is poor and who is rich.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you earn $10,000 a month,&nbsp;please do not bother to apply.&nbsp; But whether you stay in a private property or a 3-room HDB flat, that depends.&nbsp; In my constituency - I just did a house-to-house visit - we have quite a number of old walk-up apartments.&nbsp; Look at their conditions - furnishing and so on - I think many of my constituents in 3-room flats fare much better.&nbsp; So, obviously, deciding on who deserves help and who does not is quite an art.&nbsp;

About 9% of our adult population is diabetic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent foot complications, the blood sugar level must first be controlled.&nbsp; Doctors treating diabetics need to advise their patients to look after their feet carefully and take any complaints related to the feet seriously.&nbsp; The diabetics must then learn proper daily foot care.&nbsp; Foot screening and assessments are currently provided by trained nurses at our polyclinic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trained nurses are able to assess and educate on preventive measures, as well as provide treatment for our diabetic patients. Sometimes, patients develop complex ulcers and would require more specialised foot care. A podiatrist would then be needed.

And in the whole scheme of things, it appeared that the general practitioners and the other polyclinic doctors did not see the need for it, that is,&nbsp;if they thought a problem was going to be a little bit more complicated than what they usually look after, they would rather send him to&nbsp;an orthopaedic surgeon to look at the foot and have the podiatrist see with the orthopaedic surgeon, rather than sending the patient to the podiatrists.&nbsp; So these are the details of medical practice that are best managed by people on the ground who know these things and will decide how to site these services better so that the patients get the best care, and ensure that is also provided in the most cost<p align=left>Column: 838<p> efficient manner.&nbsp;

For example, there&nbsp;is going to be a pilot project to bring chemotherapy to the outpatient level.&nbsp; It is a pilot project because we do not know whether it is the best thing to do.&nbsp; Chemotherapy involves giving very strong drugs.&nbsp; There may be complications from it.&nbsp; There may be a need for other special services that the patient needs suddenly because he is getting chemotherapy.&nbsp; On paper, it looks like it is a project that could work and&nbsp;be tried&nbsp;out.&nbsp; But suppose we have chemotherapy services in the polyclinics and patients do not want the polyclinic chemotherapy because, every time there is a problem that they have to,&nbsp;besides going to the polyclinic,&nbsp;get referred to the hospital.&nbsp; And let us say, it happens once in three times, the patients may decide to have&nbsp;their treatment at a hospital setting than in a polyclinic <p align=left>Column: 839<p>setting.&nbsp; So to see whether such things would happen, we would run a pilot project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you run a pilot project, you must run it with an open mind, not on the basis that if I start a pilot project, its conclusion must be what I have decided at the start of the pilot project.&nbsp; So with&nbsp;podiatry service, it was a pilot project and the conclusion that was decided at the end of the pilot project was that it was not a good way of providing the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have reverted&nbsp;to the previous way that they ran it.&nbsp; They may relook at it and see if they can better reorganise the foot services for diabetics, and we would encourage it.&nbsp; As a philosophy, we encourage our hospitals and&nbsp;clusters to bring as many services as possible&nbsp;as close to the polyclinic level and as close to the patients as possible.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SALE OF CHICKENS AND EGGS--><p align=left>Column: 839<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The suspension of the import of poultry and eggs from Malaysia on 18th&nbsp;August following the bird flu outbreak in Kelantan had resulted in a significant reduction in the supply of these items in our market. This is because Malaysia supplied about 50% of chickens and 70% of eggs<p align=left>Column: 840<p> consumed in Singapore. Inevitably, the prices of chickens and eggs rose. The price of&nbsp;chicken increased (by about 50%) from $4.62 per kg before the ban to a peak of $7 per kg, while the price of egg rose from 16 cents to 55 cents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ease the supply shortfall, AVA worked closely with importers and wholesalers to increase the import of frozen poultry, eggs, as well as powdered and liquid eggs from alternative approved sources. AVA also worked closely with Malaysia's Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) to resume the import of poultry and eggs from Johor and Malacca, without compromising public health. The imports from Johor and Malacca resumed on 30th&nbsp;September. This has eased the supply situation and moderated the prices of&nbsp;chicken to $5.17 per kg and egg to 26 cents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The making available of more supplies and market competition will greatly diminish any opportunity for profiteering. Consumers can also play their part to combat any tendency towards profiteering by switching to other food products, as well as not purchasing from vendors&nbsp;who charge excessively. Consumers who have encountered such an opportunistic pricing practice by egg and poultry traders can lodge their feedback with&nbsp;the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). CASE can also help to publicise this so as to&nbsp;put pressure on such traders.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ASSETS--><p align=left>Column: 840<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So it is not a stable source for us to rely upon.&nbsp; The other question that&nbsp;she asked is whether we could&nbsp;have done more to cushion an economic downturn.&nbsp; We have done so.&nbsp; In the past few years, during the economic slowdown, the Government had been willing and quick to respond with assistance packages, run budget deficits in order to help Singaporeans, households, businesses, to tide over the economic downturn.&nbsp; And these packages are quite substantial.&nbsp; If you look at 2001, it was close to $13.5 billion, two off-budget packages.&nbsp; In 2003, SARS, $1.2 billion.&nbsp; And, recently, when we had Avian flu and we banned the import of poultry from Malaysia, Government agencies were quick, as Members are aware, to provide relief to egg sellers, poultry sellers and slaughterhouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;what is really more important and the fundamental question here is: why is it that Singapore is in a position to run budget deficits when there is an economic slowdown, not just for one year but a few years,&nbsp; without, unlike some other countries, undermining the general market<p align=left>Column: 843<p> confidence in Singapore's macro economic stability, without negative knock-on effects on inflation or interest rates in the economy?&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have been able to do this is that we have consistently and strictly adhered to a policy of fiscal prudence and&nbsp;fiscal discipline.&nbsp; And this means running a balanced budget over the business cycle and&nbsp;accumulating surpluses in good years so that you are in a position to spend in difficult times.&nbsp; And it is this policy of a sizeable reserve and&nbsp;a reputation for fiscal discipline that allow us room to help Singaporeans, as individuals and households, during difficult times.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Overview</I></p><p><I>&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Members of this House will recall that earlier&nbsp;this year, we enacted four Bills relating to trade marks, patents, copyright and new plant varieties, to ensure that we meet the needs of the new industries we are grooming, as well as remain competitive in this fast changing IP landscape.&nbsp; The proposed changes relating to the Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill represent one more aspect of our continuing efforts to strengthen Singapore's intellectual property (IP) legislative framework.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments were put up for public consultation for about two weeks in August.&nbsp; We did not receive any comments.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has seen an increasing number of design applications and registrations since we enacted the Registered Designs Act in 2000.&nbsp; To continue to encourage Singapore-based design owners to protect and exploit their intellectual assets, it is timely to review the Act to keep pace with international and domestic developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these proposed amendments will benefit design owners in two&nbsp;ways.&nbsp; Firstly, design owners seeking to protect their designs in different countries will now have an easier route to register their designs in other jurisdictions.&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp; design owners who are also seeking other forms of IP protection can do so more easily as common practices and procedures will be&nbsp;aligned across the different registries of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS),&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 850<p>namely, the Registries of Trade Marks, Patents, Designs and Plant Varieties.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me&nbsp;elaborate briefly on these amendments.</p><p><br><I>Making it simpler to register a design in other jurisdictions</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we encourage our Singapore-based design owners to expand their businesses and venture into markets outside Singapore, we should ensure that they have a convenient avenue to obtain protection for their designs in these overseas markets.&nbsp; Currently, a design registration in Singapore, like the registration of other forms of IPs, only gives the owner protection within Singapore.&nbsp; If a design owner wishes to seek protection in another country, he has to file separate applications in each of the countries where he has a commercial interest, thus incurring additional costs and waiting time.&nbsp; If he chooses to file in five other non English-speaking countries, there is the further expense of translation costs.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify the process of obtaining design protection in overseas markets, we propose that Singapore become a contracting party to the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs (the \"Hague Agreement\").&nbsp; As a member of the Hague Agreement, our design owners who are seeking protection in the other member states would only need to file a single application with one office in one language, and pay only a single set of fees in one currency.&nbsp; Our design owners will thus be able to cut down on time and costs when seeking design protection in overseas markets.&nbsp; The accession to the Hague Agreement will also allow Singapore to fulfil our obligation under the Free Trade <p align=left>Column: 851<p>Agreement with the European Free Trade Association States.<br></p><p><I>According greater administrative ease for IP owners who apply for different forms of IP protection<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other set of amendments to the Registered Designs Act will assist IP owners in the registration of their IPs at IPOS.&nbsp; This is done by aligning the provisions of the Act relating to priority dates, hours of business and amendments to the forms with equivalent provisions of IPOS' other registries.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important for an IP owner because IP is usually a bundle of rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, an IP owner may have a patent grant for his invention, a design registration for the 3-dimensional shape of that invention, and perhaps even trade mark registration for the owner's mark applied onto that invention.&nbsp; The alignment of these provisions will make it easier for the IP owner to file all his applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this Bill will enhance our designs regime, and make it easier for our local design owners to protect their intellectual assets.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We received feedback and suggestions from investment advisers and managers in the trust industry, the Law Reform Committee of the Academy of Law, the Law Society of Singapore, experts from the NUS Law Faculty, and relevant Government agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 853<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, trust law can have wider application and be more versatile than commonly appreciated. Trusts are not confined just to wills and family settlements. They also have considerable and increasing relevance to global investments and to the management of private capital and savings.&nbsp; Trusts are able to separate ownership from management and create different levels of beneficial ownership of assets that provide the desired flexibility in the management, control and ultimate distribution of private wealth.&nbsp; They can also provide a degree of confidentiality that is desirable for the preservation and protection of private wealth.&nbsp; High net worth individuals favour private trusts for a variety of uses, for example, to provide for incapacitated persons, to protect family and property from spendthrifts, and to manage the centralisation and coordination of worldwide assets.&nbsp; Indeed, a recent <I>Business Times'</I> article reported that more Singaporeans, and not just&nbsp;high net worth individuals, are considering putting their assets into trusts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our legislation on the law of trusts has not kept pace with the developments in other countries that have seen an increasing use of the trust institution to manage private wealth, especially in the area of trustees' powers and duties.&nbsp; Trustees' powers are normally provided for in the trust instrument, but equally important are the default powers provided by statute. Under the present law, these default powers are geared to the management of traditional domestic trusts rather than \"international trusts\" that deal with worldwide assets. They are too conservative and do not provide for the sophistication and flexibility that are required for modern and international trusts. &nbsp;This is especially so in the global investment and financial markets of today, where conditions change rapidly, and it is not possible for a trustee to possess all the required expertise and<p align=left>Column: 854<p> experience to effectively perform all the functions personally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me explain some of the main changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One major change that this Bill seeks to introduce is the expansion of the discretionary powers of trustees, to enable them to manage trust assets in the most effective way, for the benefit of the trust.&nbsp; This will be achieved through various reforms, including the conferment of a general power of investment, and the power to appoint agents, nominees and custodians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the current Trustees Act, a trustee can only invest in accordance with a list of authorised investments set out in the Act, unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise.&nbsp; While this approach may have assisted trustees in the past, it unduly restricts them from optimising investment opportunities, especially in today's financial market where conditions change rapidly.&nbsp; It could also result in a false sense of security and lower the standard of care in the determination of suitable investments for the purposes of the trust.&nbsp; We should leave investment decisions to suitably advised trustees.&nbsp; This Bill therefore repeals the list of authorised investments and a trustee can now invest as he would his own funds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there will be safeguards to ensure that trustees adhere to certain minimum prudential standards when they exercise their trustee powers.&nbsp; A duty of care will be defined for trustees when they carry out specified duties or acts.&nbsp; In certain circumstances, for example, in making investment decisions, they will be required to obtain proper advice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On other changes,&nbsp;most of the amendments sought to be made by the Bill are highly technical in nature and I do not intend to dwell on each of them&nbsp;at<p align=left>Column: 855<p> length. But let me highlight some of the other more significant changes to the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the validity of certain trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 inserts a new section 90 which seeks to provide certainty on the validity of dispositions of movable property by a foreign person into a Singapore trust, ie, a trust subject to Singapore law.&nbsp; This is a desirable feature to give certainty to the settlor's intentions as the validity of such dispositions by a foreign settlor may otherwise be governed by the law of his domicile which may have given a different outcome to that he had intended when setting up the Singapore trust.&nbsp; This section will provide certainty by specifying statutory rules to determine the capacity of the foreign person to create the trust or transfer the property to be held on trust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, some civil law countries have rules that restrict an individual's freedom to dispose of his assets during his lifetime. In pursuing their own policies, these countries may apply these rules even when the assets in question are validly transferred under the law of the country that the assets are situated. Section 90 will provide certainty as to the validity of such transfers into Singapore trusts. This is achieved by recognising the individual as having the required capacity to transfer the property if the transfer is valid under Singapore law, his own personal law, or the law governing the transfer. Sir, this is not an unusual provision&nbsp;for even non-civil law jurisdictions&nbsp;have a similar provision such as that&nbsp;found in the Labuan Offshore Trusts Act of 1996, a Malaysian legislation.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on accumulation of income and fixed perpetuity period, clause 24 will make significant changes to our laws on the accumulation of trust income and the perpetuity period.&nbsp; These changes are <p align=left>Column: 856<p>effected under the Civil Law Act as the rules are not confined to trusts. These amendments will simplify the law in this area and, at the same time, bring certainty to the periods of time within which income from trusts may be accumulated and future trusts may be validated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say that in the&nbsp;context of the Trustees Act, trustees of new trusts will be able to accumulate trust income for the duration of the trust.&nbsp; This is currently not allowed and trust income may only be accumulated for prescribed periods. Sir, the principle against the excessive accumulation of income dates back to the 1800 UK Accumulations Act and&nbsp;it has been heavily criticised as having no relevance today.&nbsp; Many states in Australia, Canada and the United States have abolished this archaic rule.&nbsp; In the UK, the Law Commission has also recommended the abolition of this rule.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Bill will reform a complicated common law rule that requires future interests in property to vest within a \"perpetuity period\", if they vest at all. The period is measured by reference to \"lives in being\" plus 21 years at the relevant time. There are complicated rules for determining the relevant lives. Sir, not only is this rule complicated for lawyers and judges, it can frustrate the intention of the person creating the trust. For example, a gift is void if it might vest outside the relevant period of time, and a party other than the intended beneficiary may then become entitled to the property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our consultations, there was overwhelming support for the replacement of the common law perpetuity period with a fixed period.&nbsp; This Bill therefore will replace the common law way of determining perpetuity period with a maximum fixed perpetuity period of 100 years for new trusts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with expanded investment powers for trustees, and the repeal of the<p align=left>Column: 857<p> authorised investment list, there is no longer a need for unit trust schemes to be authorised under the Trustees Act. The Bill therefore abolishes the existing authorised unit trust scheme and any order that was made declaring a scheme to be an authorised unit trust scheme shall cease to have any effect.&nbsp; But let me stress and&nbsp;clarify that the revocation of the \"authorised\" status under the Act does not in any way diminish the investment value of these unit trusts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;now touch on clause 25 which will make related and consequential amendments to the investment powers of more than 50 statutory bodies.&nbsp; Currently, Sir, the investment powers of statutory bodies may vary, depending on when they were established. Older provisions are more conservative, and tend to be linked to the Trustees Act, which means that the statutory bodies have to invest according to the list of authorised investments under the Act.&nbsp; With the expansion of the trustee's investment powers, and the abolition of such a list, we have reviewed the position. The Bill now generally seeks&nbsp;to align the investment powers of statutory bodies with a standard provision that gives them sufficient flexibility and autonomy to make their own investment decisions under the oversight of their supervising Ministers.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, let me say that my Ministry was greatly assisted by the very constructive and useful comments given by those who responded to the consultation exercises that we conducted.&nbsp; These changes&nbsp;through this Bill will strengthen our legal framework for trusts, and help&nbsp;to further enhance our&nbsp;attractiveness as a financial centre for wealth management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 858<p>\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the Trustees (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; I would just like to make a few comments.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About three years ago, the Economic Review Committee identified wealth management as an area of potential growth for Singapore in terms of&nbsp;our financial services industry.&nbsp; And it also recommended that the legislation be updated because it is really quite old, going back to the 1920s, and it has not been significantly revised since that time.&nbsp; So the Trustees (Amendment) Bill is quite welcome by the financial services industry.&nbsp; It is a very important industry, it is vibrant.&nbsp; It is constantly innovating and evolving and also it is getting more complex by the day.&nbsp;So the law is always having to catch up with it, so to speak.&nbsp; But that said, we cannot avoid the pace of change and, indeed, we got to respond with changes because it will send a very important signal to the financial services community that we are serious to develop Singapore as an important centre for wealth management and other services.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, as&nbsp;DPM has said, we are serious about our efforts in developing a modern trust jurisdiction.&nbsp; But messages do take time to filter through&nbsp;and we have just got to constantly keep at it, and indeed the Trustees (Amendment) Bill is just the second in a series of measures taken to develop Singapore as a jurisdiction for asset management.&nbsp; In the 1990s, we introduced tax exemption for foreign trust on approved basis, and in 2002 we improved this tax treatment by taking away the pre-approval requirement.&nbsp; This is a very important policy shift and it shows that a favourable tax treatment is a very important consideration for settlors of trust in deciding where to locate their trust management.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, here I would like to say there is a certain bias against trusts which are set up for Singapore citizens<p align=left>Column: 859<p> and residents because the favourable tax exemption is not accorded to these trusts and I wonder whether this bias could be removed because it does not make sense that we should be taking charge of other people's assets when we are not doing so for our own.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important consideration for settlors of trust is that of the quality of legislation and DPM&nbsp;has touched on it. This has got to be constantly updated so that it is in sync with the best practices in terms of asset management, and indeed the Trustees (Amendment) Bill has&nbsp;removed all the constraints relating to investments,&nbsp;except that there is no longer a list of the sort of investments you ought to make and this really frees up the trustees in terms of creativity and professionalism.&nbsp; Now they could fully follow the best practices in terms of portfolio management.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend this special new section, which is about the duty of care on the part of trustee,&nbsp;because now \"professionalism\" is mandated.&nbsp; I also like to commend all these changes made, the clarifications made in terms of custodians, agents and so on and also remunerations of trustees and reimbursements of expenses.&nbsp; The rule change in terms of accumulations is also welcomed.&nbsp; The trustees could now either fully accumulate or partially accumulate over the life of the asset of the trust.&nbsp; The perpetuity period&nbsp;is great in terms of modernising our language.&nbsp; Very few people understand what is life in existence plus 21 years and also the removal of reference to King George V and VI.&nbsp; The bottom-line is that it has removed a lot of uncertainties and&nbsp;I think it is very welcomed.&nbsp; But I think there is still work-in-progress in terms of the Trust Companies Act.&nbsp; Here again, the financial services industry is waiting for that to be reviewed too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 860<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier on, this industry is fast evolving and there remain quite a few issues which need to be addressed.&nbsp; Firstly, it is the area of the single purpose trust.&nbsp; This is a new innovation and could be very useful in terms of asset securitisation, in terms of company ownership.&nbsp; I think this would partially address the whole issue of trustee liability and also in terms of non-charitable trust relating to sports and also employees.&nbsp; But, having said that, there are limits and also risks associated with this purpose trust which are now not fully understood and really my comment here is for the Ministry to continue to monitor the utility of these concepts and have these quickly implemented when they are more fully understood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area which is receiving the attention internationally is that this whole area of reservation of powers of settlors&nbsp;pertaining to investments has been addressed, but there are other powers of settlors, such as the validity of trusts when you have a structure which might be construed as a nominee arrangement,&nbsp; that need also to be addressed.&nbsp; My comment here is that the dialogue with trustees and practitioners should be continued so that they could be fully reviewed and implemented at a suitable time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would like to close by saying that it is important that the dialogue continues and DPM has said that&nbsp;extensive consultation has been done because this is important to move the industry&nbsp;forward and openness of ideas and input from those who are responsible for the development of this industry would send a strong signal to the international fiduciary community that we want a respectable and reputable centre for wealth management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 861<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> I would like to thank the Member, Mrs Fang Ai Lian, for her strong support of the Bill.&nbsp; I agree with her that this is an area that is constantly changing and evolving and would like to assure her that we would continue to monitor and, wherever necessary, come to Parliament with further changes and modifications to our laws.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She touched on some specific issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; First&nbsp;was her point about exemption&nbsp;of income tax on foreign trusts.&nbsp; She felt there was some bias which works to the disadvantage of Singapore citizens.&nbsp; Of course, this is really outside the scope of the Bill that I took through just now, but I have taken note of it and I will discuss it with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, so that&nbsp;he can&nbsp;consider it.&nbsp; But, having said that, let me also say that from what I understand, the objective of the tax exemption scheme for foreign trusts was to encourage the trust companies and banks to offer international trust administration services from Singapore.&nbsp; My understanding is that the foreign trust probably would not have been administered from Singapore if not for the tax exemption.&nbsp; The scheme was, therefore, focused on the administration of foreign trusts rather than administration of trusts set up by Singapore citizens or resident individuals.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, let me assure her that the Government would constantly monitor developments in the trust industry and would review policies to ensure that&nbsp;Singapore retains our competitive edge as a financial centre.&nbsp; I believe that the Ministry of Finance would also be reviewing the tax treatment of trusts set up by Singapore citizens or resident individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also mentioned the Trust Companies Act.&nbsp; She is right in that this is work-in-progress.&nbsp; I understand that the MAS and the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;are currently creating a new regulatory framework for trust companies, including a new Trust Companies Act, to increase <p align=left>Column: 862<p>legal clarity and guidance for trust companies in Singapore.&nbsp; MAS, which released the draft Trust Companies Bill for public consultation in July this year, would also take over the administration of trust companies from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; Policy positions, I believe, are now being finalised and I understand that the updated legislation is scheduled for First Reading in Parliament sometime in January 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also touched on single purpose trusts and&nbsp;also non-charitable purpose trusts and the reservation powers of settlors.&nbsp; Let me say that in our review, we did consider the specific areas that she mentioned, but&nbsp;many issues that arise, especially from non-charitable purpose trusts and settlors' reserve powers, are matters which&nbsp;require careful study and we also need to see how other jurisdictions handle them and what has been their experience.&nbsp; We thought that this is a matter that we would not put in this Bill now and make a determination much later after we have had the opportunity to study the experiences of other countries.&nbsp; Having said that, let me point out that we have accepted recommendations to make it clear in this Bill that if a settlor reserves to himself powers of investment of asset management, then that in itself would not invalidate the trust.&nbsp; This is reflected in clause 21 under a new section 90(5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me assure again the MP that this Bill is not the end of the review process and we would continue to monitor and study the best international practices and developments as we take into account future changes to our law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Clause 36 empowers the Minister to make an order, following the recommendation of the Commission, to exempt certain categories of agreements from this prohibition.&nbsp; This is provided that they improve production or distribution, or promote technical or economic progress, without imposing undue restrictions or substantially eliminating competition.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, abuse of a dominant position.&nbsp; The Bill does not prohibit dominance or substantial market power per se - firms can continue to increase market power through offering cheaper or more innovative products.&nbsp; However, clause 47 prohibits firms from abusing market power in ways that are anti-competitive and which work against the long-term economic efficiency,&nbsp;eg, predatory behaviour towards competitors.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, mergers and acquisitions which substantially lessen competition.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, not&nbsp;all mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) have anti-competitive effects.&nbsp; Being a small<p align=left>Column: 866<p> open economy, highly-concentrated markets are sometimes inevitable in Singapore.&nbsp; Thus, only M&amp;As which substantially lessen competition and have no offsetting efficiencies are prohibited under clause 54.&nbsp; Firms are not mandated to seek approval or to notify the Commission of any merger, but those that wish to seek the Commission's guidance or decision can do so on a voluntary basis under clauses 57 and 58.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For mergers involving public interest considerations, clause 58 provides that the Minister will decide whether such matters may be exempted from this prohibition.&nbsp; The Minister's decision is final.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 61 provides that the Commission may publish guidelines on how it will interpret and give effect to the provisions of Part III of the Bill.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission will set out its analytical framework and implementation approach in its guidelines, which will enhance transparency and give businesses greater certainty.&nbsp; As a practice, the Commission will conduct public consultation before finalising its guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the scope of application.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will apply to commercial and economic activities carried on by private sector entities in all sectors, regardless of whether the undertaking is owned by a foreign entity, a Singapore entity, the Government or a statutory body.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the intent of competition law is to regulate the conduct of market players, it will not apply to the Government, statutory bodies or any person acting on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a small open economy, we are vulnerable to anti-competitive activities from entities operating overseas.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, clause 33 thus provides for the extra-territorial effect of this competition law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 867<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 35, 48 and 55 exclude matters or mergers specified in the Third and Fourth Schedules from the prohibitions of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these are based on public interest considerations such as national security, defence and other strategic interests.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The other exclusions are for sectors or activities which already have sectoral competition frameworks.&nbsp; These sectors are in transition from a previously monopolistic situation to a more competitive environment today.&nbsp; And in such circumstances, more active market regulation and intervention is needed.&nbsp; Moreover, there are considerable technical matters affecting competition in these areas.&nbsp; Hence, the sectoral regulators, with their industry knowledge and expertise, are in a better position to handle such issues.&nbsp; However, cross-sectoral competition issues will&nbsp;be dealt with by the Commission, in consultation with the sectoral regulators.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sectoral exclusions listed in the Third and Fourth Schedules are not intended to be permanent.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the competition law has been in force for some time, we will review the need for such sectoral exclusions, taking into account market developments at that point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Powers to investigate, adjudicate and sanction; and rights of private action</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission will have powers to investigate and adjudicate anti-competitive activities, as set out in clauses 62 to 68. Clause 69 empowers the Commission to impose sanctions, such as requiring the offender to modify or terminate the agreement or conduct, pay a financial penalty, and carry out structural remedies.&nbsp; Structural remedies will be calibrated based on the redress <p align=left>Column: 868<p>needed to stop the anti-competitive activity in question.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides financial penalties, violators of the competition law are liable to be sued by parties who suffered loss or damage directly as a result of the infringement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 86 provides for such rights of private action, after the Commission has made its determination and the appeal process exhausted.&nbsp; This will serve as an additional deterrent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Appeal process</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV of the Bill covers the appeal process.&nbsp; A Competition Appeal Board will be established to hear appeals against the decisions of the Commission.&nbsp; The Board will be an independent body comprising members appointed by the Minister.&nbsp; Only parties which the Commission has made a decision against may appeal to the Board.&nbsp; They may make further appeals against the decisions of the Board to the High Court, and thereafter to the Court of Appeal, but only on points of law and the amount of the financial penalty.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Phased implementation approach</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will implement the competition law in phases.&nbsp; The phased approach will allow time for the Commission and for businesses to prepare for the implementation of the law.&nbsp; In the first phase&nbsp;which will commence on&nbsp;1st January 2005, only the provisions establishing the Commission will come into force.&nbsp; There will then be a&nbsp;12-month transition period before the provisions on anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices; abuse of dominance; enforcement; appeals processes; and the other miscellaneous areas which will take effect on 1st January 2006.&nbsp; This&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the second phase.&nbsp; In the third phase, which is likely to be 12 months thereafter, the remaining provisions relating to mergers and acquisitions, which are more complex and technical, will come into<p align=left>Column: 869<p> force.&nbsp; During the transitional period, the Commission will carry out more outreach programmes to raise the level of awareness and understanding of the law.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;our economic strategy over the years has been founded on a strong adherence to free market principles and international best practices adapted to our local conditions.&nbsp; With the enactment of the Competition Bill, we will create an even more conducive environment for businesses, foster greater dynamic competition, and promote more efficient and innovative markets. This will benefit both enterprises and consumers, as well as ultimately strengthen Singapore's overall economic competitiveness.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Competition Bill is one of the key recommendations of the Economic Review Committee.&nbsp; This Bill gives teeth to the Government's announced policy of curbing any predatory practices of dominant industry players and encouraging more open competition, which forces companies to be innovative and responsive to market pressures and demands.&nbsp; As a result, consumers will benefit from lower prices, more variety and choices and better services,.&nbsp; The economy as a whole will gain. Sir, therefore, I wish to express my firm support for this Competition Bill.&nbsp; In fact, it is long in coming.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is heartening that Singapore is finally going to have a competition law.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a new initiative, there are many aspects of this Bill which are not clear and may need some fine-tuning over time.&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few queries on this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Competition Bill exempts various sectors that have their own regulatory <p align=left>Column: 870<p>authorities and laws.&nbsp; This can create uneven standards on competition policy between this Competition Bill and the regulators of the exempted sectors.&nbsp; Moreover, these other regulators may be motivated and governed more by their sectoral interests and controls, and not focused on ensuring competition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite an example.&nbsp; Recently, there was&nbsp;an announcement on the&nbsp;proposed merger of SPH and MediaCorp.&nbsp; I read that the governing media body has approved the merger.&nbsp; But is the approval accorded based on the financial benefits accruing to the two entities to be merged or based on the potential benefits to customers and the industry?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that when there are&nbsp;two existing competing media providers, the consumers get more variety of TV channels, newspapers and more innovation in terms of service level and product variety.&nbsp; Once the media merger is implemented, we naturally expect to see the closing of some newspapers and&nbsp;TV channels.&nbsp; Would the merger therefore be good for competition and provide more services and variety to consumers?&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This media merger could well be the first test case for our Competition Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Competition Commission intervene to object to the merger of SPH and MediaCorp?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a provision in clause 87 of the Bill which enables the Competition Commission to enter into cooperation agreement and mutual consultation with the exempted regulatory bodies.&nbsp; However, I feel that such cooperation or mutual consultation may not be sufficient.&nbsp; In some instances, the regulatory bodies of the exempted sector may decide to ignore the advice or the views of the Competition Commission.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Bill should enable the Competition Commission to have an <p align=left>Column: 871<p>\"over-arching authority\" on matters concerning the promotion of competition and the avoidance of the creation of a dominant or monopolistic player.&nbsp; Hence, in the event that there are differing stances with regard to competition, the Competition Bill should prevail.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether this is possible or advisable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second comment on this Bill is with regard to what is deemed as&nbsp;\"abuse of dominant position\" of a major player.&nbsp; It is hard to police and define.&nbsp; A major player can decide to drop prices because it is more efficient, cost-effective and innovative.&nbsp; This tactic is ultimately beneficial to consumers.&nbsp; Therefore, why should the Competition Commission rule it as an abuse of dominant position?&nbsp; And why should the Authority disallow it?&nbsp; A weaker competitor can use this competition law to complain against the pricing tactics of a dominant player but, in actual fact, it could be that it is the weaker competitor who is not price-competitive.&nbsp; In such instances, how could the Competition Commission or the court decide and define what are the \"losses\" suffered by this minor player?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

As the Minister has said earlier, the stated principle is to&nbsp;incur low regulatory cost, which means&nbsp;to be&nbsp;very cost-efficient.&nbsp; But the creation of a new statutory board means that there is a need for higher expenses in relation to new offices, a new CEO with his staffing needs and expenses relating to formation of a statutory board.&nbsp; Did the Ministry consider constituting the Competition Commission as a department <p align=left>Column: 872<p>or a section within the Ministry of Trade and Industry?&nbsp; The Commission can be serviced by a secretariat.&nbsp; This approach could be equally effective without incurring higher costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I wish to express my strong support for this Competition Bill.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the Bill will guard against predatory behaviour towards competitors and the abuse of dominant position.&nbsp; I am sure this Bill would be helpful to our local start-ups and the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as they seek to find a footing when competing in Singapore.&nbsp; I am, therefore, pleased that the Bill will be applicable to all companies operating in Singapore, including GLCs and MNCs.&nbsp; This Bill will ensure that there will be a certain degree of&nbsp;level playing field which promotes fair competition for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, this Bill is worthy of support from this House.&nbsp; I say that because I think its objectives are laudable.&nbsp; It seeks to protect and promote the competitiveness of the Singapore economy as a whole.&nbsp; This will ensure efficient allocation of resources, productivity and ultimately<p align=left>Column: 873<p> higher economic growth for Singapore.&nbsp; At the same time, through this process, it will also accrue benefits to the consumers and businesses in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset, Sir, I think&nbsp;we need to be clear.&nbsp; Competitiveness does not equate with competition.&nbsp; The key element here is in facilitating a competitive economy, the critical ingredient is what some have called \"contestability\".&nbsp; In other words, whether there is one, a few or many players in a given market, it is the potential and actual competition.&nbsp; In other words, the competition from the existing players in the market and also the potential for new entrants to come in and lead&nbsp;really ensure a competitive framework.&nbsp; And it is important that, in that regard, when we look at any market-related issues and competition, this be borne in mind.&nbsp; Ultimately, the objective is fair competition and it is not to protect individual players or competitors in the market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I support the Bill both in spirit and in principle.&nbsp; However, it is important to ensure that such a Bill, with all its good intentions, does not increase uncertainty and costs to businesses.&nbsp; The Minister has made this point.&nbsp; I wish to elaborate on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact of the matter is the establishment of a Competition Commission, which will administer the Competition Act if this Bill is passed, will create a new regulatory hurdle for all businesses.&nbsp; The Competition Commission will administer the Act, and it is important that its rulings and decisions are precise, unambiguous and timely, because all this has an impact on the way businesses are run and the costs and uncertainties they have to bear.&nbsp; Otherwise, the very objective of promoting Singapore as an attractive place to do business will be frustrated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 874<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that perspective, Sir, of&nbsp; needing to ensure that businesses have greater certainty, and this Bill does not impose undue costs, I would like to comment on a few aspects of this Bill.&nbsp; The first pertains to the scope of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Third Schedule&nbsp;excludes sectors which are covered by any other written law, or&nbsp;code of practice related to competition and which gives another regulatory authority jurisdiction in the matter.&nbsp; There is a similar provision in the Fourth Schedule.&nbsp; The Schedule, in particular clause 5, does not explicitly state which sectors are, in fact, excluded.&nbsp; But I presume, and I think it can be reasonably inferred, that it applies to sectors such as telecommunications where competition is governed by, I think, the&nbsp;Telecommunications Code (the short form) which IDA administers; electricity and gas where you have the Electricity Act and Gas Act administered by EMA, if I am not mistaken; then the media industry where there is a code which MDA administers, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the question, in principle, is: should there be exclusions from the Competition Act for any sector?&nbsp; The competition law that we are promulgating here is a generic law.&nbsp; It has principles which are generic in application and these are principles that should apply to all sectors and be applied with consistency.&nbsp; That being the case, if we allow for exclusions of sectors which will have their own bodies administering, their own interpretation of what is fair competition, albeit in the context of</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>technical areas, the scope for inconsistency and differential interpretations is quite significant, and that is going to lead to potential conflicts.&nbsp; Allow me to illustrate just by giving a couple of examples&nbsp;where the Competition Bill and the Telecommunications Code differ.&nbsp;&nbsp;One is in the area of just penalties.&nbsp; The maximum financial penalty of up to 10% of the infringing party's annual turnover in <p align=left>Column: 875<p>Singapore&nbsp;is what is provided for under the Competition Bill.&nbsp; So if you are found to have fallen afoul of the Act, then that is the maximum penalty.&nbsp; In the Telecommunications Code, the maximum financial penalty is S$1 million per contravention.&nbsp; So the scope for disparity is great.&nbsp; And, naturally, the applicant or the plaintiff might feel aggrieved if the party against whom he is making a claim gets off with a lighter penalty.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Similarly, the right or process of appeal differs as well.&nbsp; In the case of the Telecommunications Code, the appeals are to&nbsp;IDA and then to the Minister.&nbsp; In the case of the Competition Bill, the decision of the Commission can be appealed to the Competition Appeal Board.&nbsp; So there is again a different process.&nbsp; So the greyness of the scope is compounded by the fact that certain parts of the Bill appear to suggest that the Competition&nbsp;Bill will still apply to excluded sectors, and I will&nbsp;give you a couple of examples of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33(2) suggests that portions of the Bill will apply to industries and sectors which nevertheless have specific competition laws regulating them.&nbsp; And&nbsp;clause 61(3) suggests that the Competition Commission can prescribe guidelines applicable to specific regulated industries and sectors.&nbsp; So I think we need greater clarity on this matter.&nbsp; The first question is a question of principle.&nbsp; Should these sectors be excluded in the first place?&nbsp; My own view is that&nbsp;we should not, and the reason is what I have articulated earlier, which is these are common principles,&nbsp;they should&nbsp;hold true regardless of the sector, and they should be applied with consistency across all groups of industries.&nbsp; Given that we have gone for&nbsp;the second best solution, which is that we have existing bodies and we are trying to manage it, then the question is: if they are to be excluded,&nbsp;we should <p align=left>Column: 876<p>state very clearly which sectors are being excluded and for how long, and what would be the threshold conditions&nbsp;which would compel the Ministry and, subsequently, perhaps Parliament to review these exclusions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, given that the Ministry has opted for this intermediate approach where there will be some sectors that are excluded and the rest administered under the Competition Act, I think there must be certain very clear arrangements in place in the interim.&nbsp; These include, one, a harmonisation of the provisions in the sectoral codes vis-a-vis the Competition Act.&nbsp; This is to ensure that there is no gaming in the system and things are clearly established, and it will pave the way towards eventual integration.&nbsp; The second is coordination between the Competition Commission and the sectoral bodies.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This is to ensure that businesses do not have to go to two different parties to undertake two parallel processes which might have quite different outcomes.&nbsp; So it is important that, when an appeal is lodged, whether it is&nbsp;to the sectoral body or to the Competition Commission, they are brought together and processed as one appeal and given one outcome.&nbsp; And, thirdly, I would urge the Ministry to review this exclusion and perhaps bring it forward even at a faster pace.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;the Ministry of Trade and Industry has said&nbsp;18 months or so, and it has given some indication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think we are not alone in this, lest I would be interpreted as being too critical.&nbsp; The UK also has got sectoral regulators having concurrent powers with the UK Competition Act, the Director-General of Fair Trading, and they work together and there are arrangements in place to make sure that they are closely coordinated.&nbsp; So it is not without precedent.&nbsp; I think the key element here is execution so that businesses have certainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 877<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;another point I want to raise is the issue of lack of clarity in the meanings and definitions of key terms that are used in the context of this Bill.&nbsp; Sir, the Bill prohibits anti-competitive behaviour and agreements, abuse of dominant positions, M&amp;As that substantially lessen competition, etc.&nbsp; But the key terms need elaboration and definition.&nbsp; For example, dominant position.&nbsp; How is dominant position calibrated?&nbsp; Is it by market share or market power?&nbsp; Are there thresholds?&nbsp; All of these obviously have problems and, clearly, there is an element of subjective outcome and decision-making.&nbsp; And this will reside primarily in the hands of the CEO or&nbsp;Director-General of the Competition Commission.&nbsp; But the players in the market must know when they are approaching the boundaries that are likely to test the limits of what the Competition Commission considers to be acceptable.&nbsp; What constitutes abuse?&nbsp; As Mr Leong Horn Kee mentioned earlier, what constitutes abuse of dominant position?&nbsp;&nbsp;If a key player in the market leads by price reductions, is that abuse?&nbsp; Or is that beneficial practice which will bring benefits to all consumers?&nbsp; And also, there is a question of substantially lessening competition.&nbsp; Again, it begs the question: what is the test of reducing competition?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I could give an example.&nbsp; If there is an exclusive business arrangement between a Singapore company and a product&nbsp;service provider from overseas covering Singapore's territory, is that an activity that will be prohibited under the Bill?&nbsp; And I think the test is,&nbsp;as the Minister alluded to,&nbsp;this concept of appreciable adverse effect on competition of the Singapore market.&nbsp; And, again, I have to say that the Bill itself does not use the term<p align=left>Column: 878<p> \"appreciable adverse effect\" in any part of it.&nbsp; I believe there is a passing reference to it in the Explanatory Statement.&nbsp; But the crux of the matter is, I think, most of us are none the wiser as to what actually would constitute \"appreciable adverse effect\".&nbsp; The Bill is general.&nbsp; It leaves much to the discretion of the Competition Commission, and I presume that it is intended to be the case.&nbsp; But the converse impact is that businesses are in the dark.&nbsp; The UK Competition Act also does not say much about these terms, to be fair.&nbsp; But in mitigation, first, soon after the Act was passed in 1998, I believe, the UK Office of Fair Trading developed rules, statutory guidance and advice to businesses.&nbsp; So they were better informed as to how this new Act would affect their business decisions.&nbsp; Equally, the UK also could resort to case law from the European Commission and that serves as another point of reference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our case, we do not have this reference to any case law.&nbsp; Because the Ministry has said that the Commission will issue guidelines on this matter, and I hope this can be done.&nbsp; And in doing so, may I make three specific requests.&nbsp; First, I would appreciate it if the Commission works on this fast, and not allow it to take 12 months or 18 months, but the sooner the better.&nbsp; Second, the process of formulating such guidelines should meaningfully include the business sector, because definitions of what constitute competition, anti-competitive behaviour, etc, are fundamental to the way many of these businesses are going to be run.&nbsp; And, thirdly, guidelines ultimately are non-binding.&nbsp; In other words, today, if a guideline is enacted, the Commission may choose to abide by it, but it may review&nbsp;it from time to time and that, indeed, is I think the intent.&nbsp; However, certain core principles that will underpin these guidelines should be embedded in the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we feel that today, we do not have enough experience in case laws to do so, I would urge the Ministry to revisit this over the space of the next two to three years to make sure that we do come back and amend this Act to embed certain key principles so that these are not open to interpretation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 879<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another aspect, Sir, is the retrospective effect that this Bill has on businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34(5) says that&nbsp;prohibition of these activities would apply to agreements entered into before, on or after the appointed day.&nbsp; \"Appointed day\" means in relation to a particular provision, the date of&nbsp;commencement of that particular provision.&nbsp; So this seems unfair or inequitable, because what it means is that the&nbsp;Bill would apply to agreements entered into in good faith even before this&nbsp;Bill was contemplated by the Government.&nbsp; So the question is: why are we having such an all-inclusive retrospective provision in this Bill?&nbsp; And this was not just a conceptual point as it means, first, businesses would incur substantial costs, because the moment the Act comes into force or certain provisions come into force, businesses would have to review all their agreements to see if they are in compliance and, if not, how they need to be readjusted.&nbsp; Similarly, it is going to create uncertainty for the businesses in case they are challenged or wondering whether they are going to be challenged.&nbsp; So the question I have is: why not restrict applicability to agreements that are signed after this Bill has been passed,&nbsp;or when this Bill was first tabled for public consultation which, I believe, was in April this year?&nbsp; At least,&nbsp;the market had first wind of what is happening and any action thereafter could be deemed to have been done with this knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key point I want to make here is that we must restrict it in some manner and not let this retrospective application be extended without any end point.&nbsp; And I think if the Ministry is concerned that there may be some historical agreements that are blatantly unfair or anti-competitive, then those egregious cases could still be brought up on appeal or when a complaint is raised,&nbsp;the Competition Commission and the Ministry can decide whether it is worthy of <p align=left>Column: 880<p>attention.&nbsp; But, in principle, it should not be a blanket application.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, one specific comment is on the availability of safeguards to prevent frivolous or vexatious claims.&nbsp; Sir, it is quite well-known that, in some instances in business, they use anti-trust or such competition Acts and the processes and appeal methods available to them through these Acts as a business tactic to appeal so as to stall the business agreements that they feel would be against their best interests or to possibly even frustrate and stump it altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is: should there not be provisions in this&nbsp;Bill to protect against frivolous or vexatious claims?&nbsp; The provisions could be in the form of a compensation to be paid to the party against whom a complaint is lodged, if it turns out that the complaint was frivolous and vexatious.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there is a policy concern that we do not want to deter <I>bona fide</I> complaints.&nbsp; But perhaps the way to deal with this is to ensure that such costs are only payable if it is assessed by the Commission that the complaint has, in&nbsp;fact, been frivolous or vexatious.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Minister would consider these points because this is an important Bill.&nbsp; It is going to change the complexion of the way we do business in Singapore.&nbsp; And I think it will certainly set the standard, in terms of what we are looking to achieve, but at the same time, we must make sure that, at the&nbsp;micro level, businesses are not disadvantaged and the outcomes run contrary to our very intent in passing this Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>Bill as it stands because of the wide powers given to the Minister for<p align=left>Column: 881<p> allowing him not to accept relevant provisions in the Bill.&nbsp; The relevant provisions in the Bill are contained in clause 34 which disallows agreements preventing, restricting and distorting competition;&nbsp;clause 47 which prohibits any practice of abuse of a dominant position in any market in Singapore; and clause 54 which prevents mergers which may result in the lessening of competition.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot agree with the provisions in the Third Schedule of the Bill.&nbsp; They are far too wide and too pervasive.&nbsp; The Third Schedule, to my mind, is wide enough to annul the intent and purpose of this Bill itself.&nbsp; Let us look at paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Neither the section 34 prohibition nor the section 47 prohibition shall apply to any undertaking entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly in so far as the prohibition would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to that undertaking.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clause is so wide-ranging that it can cover the activities of any Government entity, Government-linked company, or any company which the Government has an interest in, or activities of a statutory body or Government-owned company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 2 of the Third Schedule is equally wide-ranging in taking away the effects of sections 34 and 47 prohibitions as long as an agreement&nbsp;complies with a legal requirement.&nbsp; And, as we all know, really, all Government-owned entities are the creatures of statute.&nbsp; Therefore, they are not caught by this competition law.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the economic development of Singapore is a recent history.&nbsp; We all know that Singapore was first built up as a socialist state.&nbsp; The early political philosophy of the PAP was democratic socialism.&nbsp; Therefore, the infant capitalist<p align=left>Column: 882<p> system was not encouraged, but the public sector, by policy, was cultivated and built up.&nbsp; We see the Government controlled by one dominant political party and had a free hand in accumulating massive capital.&nbsp; The Government in Singapore, the richest sector in the economy, was soon the biggest landowner in Singapore.&nbsp; The Singapore Government now finds itself in an awkward position in a wholly-changed world from the 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; Now we are in an era of fierce competition from the other so-called emergent nations, in particular, the People's Republic of China and the other neighbouring states.&nbsp; Singapore's strategy or way out of this changed situation is to enter into Free Trade Agreements with other countries, some of which are mature capitalist countries where the early infant vibrant competition in their markets has turned some of their companies into&nbsp;monopolies, which are anathema to the capitalist system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have read of Bill Gates of Microsoft having to pay millions of dollars in fines when its company abused its dominant position in the software business.&nbsp; So competition laws are necessary in America and other mature capitalist countries to break up the monopolies that are being formed there.&nbsp; We in Singapore started by not encouraging&nbsp;private enterprise but concentrated on growing the public sector.&nbsp; The public sector now dominates the whole of Singapore's economy.&nbsp; This is Singapore's dilemma.&nbsp; Now, we need to enact this competition law to unravel that dilemma and meet with other international obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important question comes to mind.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether exclusions contained in the Third Schedule are a permanent feature or whether&nbsp;there is a time-frame to remove them, including other provisions in the Bill<p align=left>Column: 883<p> giving the Minister power to avoid the prohibitions and&nbsp;against monopolies as well as&nbsp;the above dominant positions and mergers as contained in clauses 34, 47 and 59 of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as regards the Bill itself, I would only like to have a clarification on one point from the Minister.&nbsp; I notice that the District Court shall have the jurisdiction to try any offence under the Act and shall have power to impose full penalties or punishment in respect of the offence.&nbsp; As regards punishment, clause 83 imposes a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.&nbsp; I have no quarrel with this punishment or penalty because they are within the jurisdiction of a District Court.&nbsp; But we see that under clause 69(4) of the Bill, the Commission can impose a financial penalty up to 10% of the turnover of the defaulting business.&nbsp; Nowadays, some businesses in Singapore have a yearly turnover of hundreds of millions of dollars, and a financial penalty of 10% of its turnover can easily exceed the quantum allowed under the jurisdiction of the District Court which, I believe, is to be only about $250,000.&nbsp; I stand corrected.&nbsp; If that is so, then the District Court has no jurisdiction to impose such a large&nbsp;financial penalty under the said clause 69(4).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister might like to comment on this provision of the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my appreciation to the Ministry of Trade and Industry for finally presenting this Competition Bill for passage through Parliament.&nbsp; I have a personal interest in this Bill, because it was first proposed by the sub-committee which I chaired, ie,&nbsp;the Government in Business Sub-Committee, which was part of Minister Raymond Lim's Committee on Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 884<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my committee studied the role of Government and its companies in encouraging or stifling entrepreneurship, it was obvious that what Singapore lacked was a generic competition law which would, in an indirect way, encourage the emergence of entrepreneurial companies in Singapore.&nbsp; When the committee looked at this, our vision of the competition law envisioned these few things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to create a level-playing field so that no one company has an undue advantage, particularly the Government-owned companies;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Anti-competitive business practices needed to be eliminated or banned, and these include practices like collusion, bid-rigging, price fixing, which involved coordinated action by direct competitors;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; The abuse of dominance needs to be eliminated.&nbsp; Abuse of dominance includes action by any single dominant player.&nbsp; Monopolies will not be banned, but abuse of market dominance should be.&nbsp; For example, the use of predatory pricing to exclude new entrants; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Companies intending to do mergers and acquisitions should pre-notify the competition authorities for transactions above a certain market value, eg, one-quarter for each company or one-third for a merged entity, with certain turnover thresholds.&nbsp; The competition authorities may approve the M&amp;A deal with certain conditions attached.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other issues that we wanted the competition law to address include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; There must be a serious attempt to prohibit exclusive deals between the Government or its agencies and any of the GLCs;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;We did realise that certain exemptions might have to be included,<p align=left>Column: 885<p> especially in sensitive areas of the economy, but the number of exclusions needed to be limited;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;All companies will have equal access to the national infrastructures, and these should not be given on a silver platter to any Government-linked companies;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Whatever law is enacted should not add to the costs and, hence, compliance costs should be minimised for these companies; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; An independent competition authority should be set up to formulate the policies and rules and to rule on cases violating the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how has the Ministry fared against the expectations of the committee on this competition law?&nbsp; I would like to say that they have scored seven out of 10, and&nbsp;I am very happy with the outcome.&nbsp; Seven out of 10, coming from me, is actually a big compliment!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say that in targetting large companies, especially GLCs, the intent was not to dismantle the dominant positions that&nbsp;these companies have, but to restrict them from using their dominant position to stifle competition.&nbsp; So, we were mindful that we should not destroy the value of big and well-run companies, but to prevent them from&nbsp;allowing other companies from also competing successfully with them.&nbsp; As an example, if a large company uses predatory pricing to eliminate smaller players, this should not be allowed.&nbsp; Similarly, should a large company set rules of business together with the Government by giving feedback where&nbsp;only they will benefit and smaller companies find it difficult to comply, this is also an uncompetitive behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have a few specific points on this Bill to discuss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 886<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the exclusions, and many Members have raised these.&nbsp; By virtue of the Third Schedule and the many clauses in the Bill which exempt certain sectors from inclusion in the competition law, we have in fact excluded many of the sectors of our economy which were originally intended to be governed by a competition law.&nbsp; It is a pity that so many sectors have been protected under the law.&nbsp; I see no reason to, for example, protect the telecommunication,&nbsp;postal, media and transport industries and specified parts of the banking industry.&nbsp; In fact, we could also have been more aggressive in including even certain parts of the energy industry in this competition law.&nbsp; An argument made by the Ministry is that there are already laws regulating these industries.&nbsp; I feel that the competition law should have been a senior law, ahead of all other sectoral regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, the Bill enables many sectors that already have these regulatory commissions to oversee competition within their relevant sectors.&nbsp; In effect, this law&nbsp;becomes a secondary law for these sectors, only to be enacted if the industry players cross over into&nbsp;a non-regulated sector.&nbsp; This has the potential to cause a bit of confusion, in my opinion.&nbsp; With this, each commission will have to have its own definition of dominant position, predatory pricing, undertakings and what constitutes anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By making the competition law a higher authority in Singapore, it will help unify and streamline definitions and guidelines.&nbsp; The different regulatory commissions will fall under this law, but provisions can be accorded to provide the relevant authorities to exercise flexibility to regulate and allow sectors to be more competitive.&nbsp; An added benefit of this would be to have an avenue for companies within their respective sectors to have a higher avenue of appeal in cases of dispute with their regulatory authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 887<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case in point is our FTA with the USA, which provides for judicial review of regulatory decisions.&nbsp; Article 9.11(3) of the USSFTA provides for the right of judicial review of a regulatory decision.&nbsp; It clearly sets forth that any aggrieved party in the telecommunications industry in particular must have the opportunity to have this review of a decision by a regulatory body.&nbsp; As it stands, the Code of Practice for Competition in the Provision of Telecommunications Services by the IDA does not allow this to happen. So, therefore, we do not fully meet the obligations of this bilateral agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that in its submissions to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Temasek Holdings encourages these sectors to be also included without any excessive protection, stating that \"Companies should be allowed to grow and thrive on sound commercial principles, unfettered by bureaucratic impositions or non-commercial Government directions.\"&nbsp; If Temasek, which has a vested interest in and owns most of the companies in the excluded sectors, feels that these companies should compete unfettered by any protection, there is, in my opinion,&nbsp;no need for the Government to provide these companies any further protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second issue is one of establishment of the Competition Commission of Singapore.&nbsp; It is important that the competition law must operate in a fair and transparent manner.&nbsp; Concern should arise from parties involved in commercial disputes about the objectivity and independence of this Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI has a number of statutory boards, some of whose senior executives sit on the Boards of Directors of corporate entities, particularly the Government-linked companies.&nbsp; Additionally, some of these statutory boards also have<p align=left>Column: 888<p> ownership and interest in GLCs that would be subject to the Competition Act.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister would help keep the integrity of the Commission clean by not having too many civil servants, whether directly or indirectly, who have connections with the GLCs being regulated under this law to sit in this Commission.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will defeat the purpose and it will make implementation of the law ineffective and people will lose confidence.&nbsp; Strict independence and clear goals of encouraging competition without vested interests to protect certain Government-owned companies should be the order of the day with this law and with the Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third issue is on the scope of the Bill.&nbsp; In general, an effective competition regulatory regime will aim for a consistent and broad application.&nbsp; The application of competition law to all business entities, regardless of ownership, industry or function, is important in establishing a culture of competition within any economy.&nbsp; But it is noted that the Bill has wide extra-territorial applications.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;clause 47(3) defines a dominant position to include a dominant position within Singapore and also elsewhere.&nbsp; However, it is not clear why the Bill should be concerned about a firm's dominant position in some market outside Singapore if it does not also have a dominant position within Singapore.&nbsp; In other words, if a firm does not have a market power in Singapore or in a</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>geographic market that includes Singapore, it is not clear how it could use that market power to harm its competition in the Singapore market.&nbsp; I would like to recommend that this section be revised to make it clear that the Bill covers foreign firms with a dominant position in Singapore but not firms with a dominant position in overseas market, but not in the Singapore market.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that in&nbsp;clause 33 of the Bill, it provides that as long as an \"agreement,<p align=left>Column: 889<p> abuse of dominant position ... or&nbsp;merger infringes or has infringed [or likely to infringe] any prohibitions&nbsp;in this Part [III]\", it does not matter whether the&nbsp;agreement has been entered into&nbsp;outside Singapore or the abuse of dominant position is outside Singapore.&nbsp;This means that agreements made entirely between foreign undertakings and&nbsp;decisions by associations&nbsp;of foreign undertakings or concerted parties will be caught by the Act as long as it can be shown that its effect is to prevent, restrict or distort competition within our shores.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the UK Competition Act, in contrast, provides that the Chapter I prohibition against agreements applies only if the agreement, decision or practice is implemented in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such broad extra-territorial application will put&nbsp;unnecessary strain, in my opinion, on the Competition Commission, as it would have to&nbsp;help to assess the impact of this abuse or violation in the various economies that may not necessarily be in Singapore.&nbsp; I think this&nbsp;is not a necessary thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, let me once again say that the real intent of a competition law should be to create a level playing field, to eliminate, if possible, or, at least, to drastically reduce practices which stifle competition in Singapore.&nbsp; While historically the Government favoured certain companies, making them dominant players in our economy, this historical reality should not result in these big Government-owned companies or even private-owned companies abusing their position of dominance.&nbsp; The Government has already done enough for them in the past and now they should no longer be in a position to unfairly benefit from the old favours that they may have got.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we would like to see accomplished is a healthy environment where<p align=left>Column: 890<p> there is a true form of competition, and where a large number of our enterprises and industries are highly competitive.&nbsp; If it is an important part of our overall plan to make SMEs a dominant force of our economic growth and, indeed, to turn our economy from being one where we attract only large companies to one of an entrepreneurial one, a decision needs to be made to soften the perception.&nbsp; We should not be half-hearted about this.&nbsp; As our large companies will only benefit and not lose from this new landscape of less protection and more competition&nbsp;as&nbsp;they try to compete globally,&nbsp;they would also welcome this new law.&nbsp; And with this prevailing chasm on the restructuring efforts, it must be noted that, depending on the approach that we take on this competition law, we have the potential of this being a keystone in Singapore's economic restructuring initiative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am very happy to support the Bill.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;something that we have been waiting for a very long time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\r\n\r\n<div align=center><b><!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 890<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In fact, some ASEAN countries such as Indonesia and Thailand have already enacted their fair competition laws.&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill will help our Government to effectively and fairly regulate the supply and demand of goods and services in the market, and make sure that goods and services are provided at reasonable prices.&nbsp; This will help the new enterprises, inspire innovation and creativity, so that our market will be more flexible and competitive. With this new Bill to regulate and control the market, more foreign companies will be attracted to invest here, thereby creating more job opportunities to resolve our unemployment problem and, in the process, bring about economic prosperity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that this new Bill will receive strong support from the consumers too. They are looking forward to various&nbsp; benefits that will be brought about by these new measures, such as cheaper goods and better service. This would not only benefit our local citizens but will also attract more tourists and, thereby, promoting growth in the tourism industry.&nbsp; Such healthy competition will bring a lot of benefits to our people, for example, the intense competition among the oil companies is a good example. Recently, despite the escalation of oil prices, the petrol companies in Singapore are giving their customers 5-10% discounts. This will help to regulate the petrol prices and, at the same time, benefit the motorists.&nbsp; This is an example of&nbsp; benefits brought about by healthy competition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of the interests of ordinary citizens is of paramount importance, particularly on basic daily necessities, such as drinking water, energy supply, housing, transportation and communica-<p align=left>Column: 892<p>tions.&nbsp; Ordinary citizens are often exploited by unscrupulous merchants when they are not adequately informed to strike up a good bargain for themselves. For example, during the recent spell&nbsp;of Avian flu, eggs, which would normally cost only 15 cents each were being sold at 60 cents each, when there was a shortage of supply. The ordinary citizens are already suffering when they have no eggs to eat.&nbsp; Yet, the merchants are raising the price. This is like what we call, \"rubbing salt into their wound\", and this is a consequence of unfair competition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enactment of this law is an excellent policy of the Government.&nbsp; MTI has conducted seminars to invite suggestions by members of the public and the professionals so as to finetune and improve on the Bill.&nbsp; I think this kind of consultative approach is excellent.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker,&nbsp; I would like to make two suggestions on this Bill:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I suggest that the Government enlarge the scope of regulation and control under this Bill and not to exempt certain industry sectors from the control of this Bill. As it stands,&nbsp; industry sectors such as telecommunications, media and energy, do not come under the control of the proposed Competition Commission of Singapore.&nbsp; This will result in \"one policy, two systems\",&nbsp;creating confusion to the people.&nbsp; These industry sectors, such as energy and communications, are daily necessities to our people.&nbsp; If we do&nbsp;not have good control over the price and service, it would result in a lot of confusion and friction that would, in turn, give rise to opportunities for the industry sectors to engage in unfair competition.&nbsp; I would suggest that telecommunications, media and energy companies should also come under the control of the Competition Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, members of the Competition Commission should also avoid sitting in <p align=left>Column: 893<p>the Board of Directors of commercial companies to ensure independence and unbiased decisions when making rulings.&nbsp; Although the Bill does provide for members to declare their interest as company directors and to refrain from participating in voting on any resolution which may have a conflict of interest, I feel that this is not enough.&nbsp; In order to avoid vicious suspicion and misunderstanding, it should be more advisable for members of the Commission to avoid taking up directorship in&nbsp;commercial companies.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Competition Act is long overdue.&nbsp; Other developed countries had this law much earlier than us.&nbsp; It is therefore important that we learn from others and do it right as soon as possible in order to maximise its benefits to our economy and society.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the purpose of the competition law must not just be to prevent anti-competitive behaviour as it is&nbsp;the main focus of this Bill.&nbsp; This approach is too narrow.&nbsp; The purpose must be to promote competition in all areas of the economy, to lower the barrier of entry for new businesses and to ensure fair play.&nbsp; This will then lead to benefits at three levels -&nbsp;the consumers, the companies and the nation as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the consumers, it will mean more choices and better quality of goods and services at lower prices. To the companies, free and fair competition will result in better efficiency and innovation to the country.&nbsp; There will be all round productive gain that will increase our national competitiveness and provide better employment opportunities for our citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve all these, I do not think the approach taken by the Competition Bill is good enough, which is to prohibit three <p align=left>Column: 894<p>activities, namely, anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position and mergers and acquisitions that substantially lessen competition.&nbsp; Further, the Bill does not extend its powers to certain industry sectors as well as Government policies and practices that stand in the way of effective competition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I strongly feel that such a narrow approach to this law will not serve us well.&nbsp; Australia started this law leaving all government activities aside. Soon, they discovered that there was a need for the Competition Commission to work with all government agencies, be it state or federal, to review all government policies and practices and lay down the principles of effective competition for all government bodies to adhere to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What our competition law should do is to lay the overall framework for competition in Singapore, encompassing all industries and all players.&nbsp; The proposed Competition Commission should oversee all matters concerning competition, except those relating to national security.&nbsp; Any complaint regarding ineffective competition should be fully investigated by the Commission.&nbsp; If a complaint is related to a regulated industry sector or to a certain Government policy or practice, the Commission should work with the relevant Government body to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I suggest this because each statutory board or Government department has its own objectives and functions, be it safety, infrastructural development or fiscal.&nbsp; They are not single-minded as far as promoting competition is concerned.&nbsp; Take, for instance,&nbsp;LTA.&nbsp; Its main objective is to ensure efficient transportation of people and goods. &nbsp;For years, Singaporeans have been paying higher prices for purchase of cars, not just because of high taxes, but also because of high profit margins earned by the authorised agents due to ineffective <p align=left>Column: 895<p>competition. &nbsp;As promoting such competition was not really the priority of LTA, it has taken LTA many years to allow parallel imports to compete.&nbsp; Just when it was thought that parallel importers would give authorised agents a run for their money, manufacturers and their agents found a way to exploit a Government rule to beat the competition.&nbsp; Since the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with the US, our Customs adopted the Customs Valuation Code (CVC) to assess the Open Market Value (OMV) of a car.&nbsp; Manufacturers are now using transfer pricing to give hefty discounts of their factory list price to their agents.&nbsp; These discounted prices lower the OMV of cars imported by authorised agents.&nbsp; On the other hand, in determining the OMV for parallel import cars, Customs add&nbsp;an uplift to the purchase price paid by parallel importers, notwithstanding that the purchase price is already higher than the OMV for cars from the authorised agents.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>As a result, cars purchased from the authorised agents pay a much lower Additional Registration Fee (ARF).&nbsp; The ARF is 130% of the OMV.&nbsp; So, needless to say, what we are seeing today is there is hardly any competition from parallel importers.&nbsp; Has anyone ever asked why there should be two substantially different OMVs and, therefore, ARFs, for essentially identical cars?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another very old policy of&nbsp; LTA is the surcharge of $10,000 imposed on imported used cars not more than&nbsp;three years old.&nbsp; With today's technology, such cars would not have problem meeting LTA's technical and environmental specifications, but the surcharge of $10,000 has made import of such cars non-viable.&nbsp; Without the surcharge, I am sure there would be keen competition in car sales that would benefit car owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the Competition <p align=left>Column: 896<p>Commission should have the preview upon industry or consumer's feedback to look into such Government policies or practices, whether they are from Customs or LTA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the competition law must not be one of just preventing abuses.&nbsp; It must also serve to promote competition as its ultimate objective and the best way to promote competition is to lower the barriers of entry for competition.&nbsp; These barriers, be they from Government policies or anti-competitive behaviour of private companies, inhibit new entrants into the industry, depriving the consumers of choice, as well as a generally lowering of price through competition.&nbsp; The Commission should be empowered to investigate and act against practices which put up artificially high barriers of entry into the industry such as unfair pricing of certain core services or complex procedures to discourage new entrants.&nbsp; Companies which are strongly vertically integrated should be closely watched for these misdeeds.&nbsp; On top of that, there must be a pro-active and coordinated review of all Government policies and practices that affect competition.&nbsp; Only then could we have a meaningful and useful law that would maximise the benefits of competition for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, it is wonderful that Singapore is finally introducing a Bill to make provision about competition and the abuse of a dominant position with the intended effect of creating a level playing field for all participants.&nbsp; I have been looking forward to the introduction of this Bill since the day it was mentioned many years back because I believe that competition would bring about cheaper prices and better services by the providers.&nbsp; However, as I<p align=left>Column: 897<p> flipped through the pages of this new Competition Bill, my fears have been confirmed.&nbsp; I am dismayed to learn that this Bill does not cover our political sphere.&nbsp; This Bill does not have any written provisions to check the monopolistic powers, anti-competitive behaviour and&nbsp;the abuse of a dominant position by a political party, in particular, the governing party of Singapore,&nbsp;against its competitors in the political market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p>5.19 pm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a well-known and recognised fact that the PAP, as the governing monopoly in Singapore, uses every resource within its dominant power to make anti-competitive practices, like the redrawing of the electoral boundaries and regrouping of weak constituencies into new and bigger GRCs,&nbsp;the threats to upgrading and the giving and cashing out of the New Singapore Shares one day before polling; and, more importantly,&nbsp;the announcement of the heavily amended electoral boundaries one day before the dissolution of Parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B> <I>rose</I> ---</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my speech is relevant because I am saying that the Competition Bill should include all sectors, including Government services, agencies and Government service providers - parties that are seeking the mandate of the market for public support.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are highly anti-competitive practices by a dominant player in the market for public support.&nbsp; If this anti-competitive behaviour is not checked and corrected in time, I fear the greater erosion of our democratic principles of <p align=left>Column: 898<p>equity and fairness, for which this society is built.&nbsp; The results of such unchecked abuse of monopolistic powers will be greater public apathy, higher disinterest in the affairs of our society and a stronger climate of fear among the populace,&nbsp;like what was reported in the media last week at the feedback conference attended by our youths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that the establishment of an independent Competition Commission, with the powers to receive, review and check&nbsp;reports of any abuse of the dominant position of a Government political party is the first step in the right direction and would go a long way to uphold our core principal values of democracy, equity and fair play.&nbsp; This would definitely benefit the population, which is rightly a consumer in sore need of public protection, from the abuse of a dominant player.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that expanding the role of the Competition Act to cover the political arena would help to create a more level-playing field for all interested stakeholders in the future of our country.&nbsp; I support this Competition Bill for now as I take it as the first step towards greater accountability and checks on all dominant players, both in the economic, social and political market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this Government refuses to allow the growth of genuine competition in its own political turf, then there is no moral basis for this Government to introduce this Competition Bill to affect other business providers.&nbsp; This Bill needs to be expanded to cover political and all other social service providers.&nbsp; I hope and expect the next amendment to this&nbsp;Act sometime later to seriously take in the said views and right the wrongs expressed herewith.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Sir, I did not know that the Non-Constituency Member has taken politics to be a <p align=left>Column: 899<p>business.&nbsp; I thought the essence of politics is to allow people&nbsp;the right of choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of democracy in any election, people do have a choice.&nbsp; And, if people&nbsp;so decide that this party continues to dominate the political scene, it is a demonstration of the free will and choice of the people.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we are in this House, term after term, election after election.&nbsp; Why do you question the people's choice?&nbsp; Perhaps it is with the same obstinacy of failing to understand that he raises&nbsp;these arguments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the contest of&nbsp; ideas between those who advocate free markets and those who argue for command economies was symbolically settled at the close of the last century with the collapse of the Berlin Wall - once the symbol and the bastion of communism - and with it, its attendant association with central planning and allocation of resources.&nbsp; Without a doubt, the free market has prevailed and, save for one country, in this world today, no country can openly deny that they have no aspirations in promoting an open and openly competitive economy; even if they still outwardly exist in form as communist regimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the free market as an ideology has prevailed.&nbsp; It, however, does not mean that there are no excesses associated&nbsp;with it.&nbsp; It would be folly to assume that competitive forces, the drivers of efficiency and productivity do not require regulatory oversight to prevent abuse and unfair practices.&nbsp; Predatory pricing, cartelling and outright muscling out of smaller competitors exemplify the sort of practices that are borne out of the excesses of the market place and for which regulations setting the rules must be introduced.&nbsp; For this reason, I support the timely introduction of the Competition Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 900<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the new legislation is a welcome instrument, there are, however, a number of concerns that I wish to raise before this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I note that the Competition Commission of Singapore would be constituted as a statutory board, just like any other&nbsp;statutory body in Singapore.&nbsp; The Commission would be constituted in part by the Market Analysis Division, which is presently housed in the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; It is an extension of a department of Government.&nbsp; This should not typically be a problem, except that there are inherent issues of perceived conflict of interest that should be dealt with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the public, the Government in forming the Commission plays the part of a gamekeeper.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, the Government is also in business.&nbsp; It may on occasions be seen to be a poacher.&nbsp; This is evident in the extensive and deep engagements that our GLCs have within the Singapore economy.&nbsp; I am fairly certain that in the nature of things, the Commission would be asked to determine questions involving some agreements or business practices of our GLCs.&nbsp; When it happens, the Commission would no doubt be hard put to ensure that justice is not only done, but must be seen to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government may at times require a consolidation of strategic services and manufacturing operations to better position Singapore competitively in the world market.&nbsp; If such consolidations are challenged, the Commission would find itself in a rather invidious position of having to decide between the interest of the other businesses and the interest, even if indirect, of the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the framework of the present legislation on competition does not do much to allay any misgiving that one may have from an initial review of the Bill.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 901<p>Clauses 35 and 48 provide that the prohibitions in relation to anti-competitive agreements or abuse of dominant position do not apply to matters specified in the Third Schedule.&nbsp; Generally, the Schedule allows the Minister the ability to exclude any agreement from the application of clause 34 which relates to anti-competitive agreements and also to exclude, in what I find is rather bizarre, some corporate behaviour from the application of clause 47 which relates to the abuse of dominant position.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members were to refer to clause 47, examples of such abuse include&nbsp;predatory behaviour towards competitors; limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; and applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with the other trading partners, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it strange that this legislation on creating a more competitive environment should now deem it fit for the Minister to sanction what the rule has described as unacceptable and unfair behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill, if it is to inspire greater confidence in the competitive environment, Sir, could be strengthened further by removing or greatly minimising the ability of the Government to interfere in its decision making process.&nbsp; Rather than reconstituting a department of the Ministry to undertake the work, it could have perhaps&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;Tribunal of Experts as opposed to a commission to undertake the review process.&nbsp; A tribunal would presumably have a greater leeway in settling the procedures by which it is to decide.&nbsp; More importantly, Sir, it could and should be parked in the judicial arm of Government, thus avoiding any suspicion of conflict of interest which the present approach seems to be saddled with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do accept that a legislation of this nature should allow the Government some discretion to intervene in the name of <p align=left>Column: 902<p>national interest.&nbsp; However, while the necessity of such intervention is not denied, it does not mean that for the benefit of certainty in our laws, the Minister's discretion on such matters should not be fettered.&nbsp; Presently, there is some restraint in the Third Schedule in limiting such carve-outs to exceptional and compelling reasons.&nbsp; However, one would argue that such references are too vague and broad and do not give the full assurance that it may not be abused.&nbsp; It may be better to stick to more elaborate descriptions as to the grounds on which the Minister may exercise his power to carve out exceptions to clauses 34 and 47.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as a corollary of the point above, I note that the Bill allows a person to appeal to the High Court or the Court of Appeal on questions of law in respect of a decision of the Commission.&nbsp; The issue of questions of law will lie in the interpretation of provisions of the Bill.&nbsp; This would include phrases like \"prevention, restriction or distortion of competition\", or \"abuse of a dominant position in any market\".&nbsp; Indeed, as is the experience in the other countries, much guidance on competition law will have to be given by case law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This raises a fundamental question as to whether the courts are indeed best qualified to undertake such determinations.&nbsp; Judges are essentially lawyers who are trained in the analysis and application of the law.&nbsp; They are neither economists nor financial experts who would readily comprehend the intricacies of the market place operations.&nbsp; Questions on the meaning of a word within the Bill on competition would require a thorough analysis on not only the plain import of the word, but also the impact that the decision would have against the wider economy and society.&nbsp; Are judges, therefore, technically trained to undertake such technical analysis and review?&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 903<p>Of course, it may be said that to overcome this limitation, judges may have the services of an <I>amicus curiae</I> or Friend of the Court in coming to a decision.&nbsp; This does not, however, leave one with the ideal position of having the best qualified person for the job.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>To take an extreme example, this would be akin to having a lawyer undertake a surgical operation while being guided by a surgeon at the same time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Competition Bill is rather unusual in having extra-territorial reach.&nbsp; Clause 33 provides <I>inter alia</I> that the Act shall apply even if any of the proscribed activity takes place outside of Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, I can understand that for the policy to be effective, the law must extend to activities beyond our borders.&nbsp; However, as the Minister would appreciate, such intent raises more issues than answers.&nbsp; For instance, how does one begin to take enforcement actions against parties who may not have a business presence in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, in the nature of commerce, one does not have to have a business domiciled in Singapore to do business.&nbsp; Coca-Cola and Nike, which are international brand names, do not need to be present to set up shop here as they deal through their distributors.&nbsp; It is conceivable that the Coca-Colas and the Nikes of the world may engage in restrictive trade practices or to be seen abusing their dominant market position to the detriment of consumers here in Singapore.&nbsp; Does it mean therefore that the Government will ban the promotion and sale of Coca-Cola and Nike products in response?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the extra-territorial reach of the Bill does not effectively deal with trade wars at the international level.&nbsp; We all know that in a globalised economy, there is an increasing tension within respective countries from affected interest<p align=left>Column: 904<p> groups who clamour for more protection.&nbsp; Outsourcing of services is one clear&nbsp; example of how trade issues on a global scale are increasingly coming to a head in some countries.&nbsp; Can a pact by a&nbsp;group of IT companies in response to&nbsp;labour union pressures to stop outsourcing IT&nbsp;services to Singapore be seen as a matter which comes within the ambit of&nbsp;our competition law?&nbsp; Would the restriction of sale of certain goods overseas to meet local demand by a company in one country be seen&nbsp;as a&nbsp;breach of our laws if as a result of which such goods in Singapore cost much more?&nbsp; No doubt, these are issues which the Commission will have to decide,&nbsp; and even if the Commission were to decide, would&nbsp;have to&nbsp;determine how best to enforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, I note that the Bill also contemplates retrospective application.&nbsp; While&nbsp;it is fair that the Bill should apply retrospectively to any of the proscribed activities, it may perhaps be seen to be unduly harsh or unfair to the parties concerned, as such arrangements were perfectly legal and legitimate at the time when they were concluded, and this was a concern raised earlier by my colleague in this House.&nbsp; Retrospective application of laws should be avoided where possible as it gives rise to much uncertainty within the legal landscape.&nbsp; Certainly, this Bill is no joy to the businesses and people who are affected as the Government has now placed a cloud of uncertainty on many of the common place agreements, not least of which are the joint venture agreements, pooling of resources agreements and mergers that essentially were meant to help local businesses take on regional competition. No doubt, lawyers like myself now will be having a field day busy reviewing many of these agreements.&nbsp; I am sure that for many, they will find an excuse to review contractual positions which are unfavourable at this moment in time.&nbsp; My concerns are that in applying this Act retrospectively, the Government may have unwittingly opened<p align=left>Column: 905<p> the Pandora's box and let the genies out for which they may have a hard time trying to put them back in.&nbsp; I would therefore urge the Government to tread carefully on its decision to apply this Act retrospectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the above comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the exception of one totally irrelevant speech from a Member who has totally disappeared, I would like to thank all the many Members of this House who have shared the benefits of their wisdom and experience and their thoughts on this piece of legislation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a significant step in our legislative&nbsp;and regulatory framework for businesses.&nbsp; It is one which we are taking boldly but carefully.&nbsp; And I was most pleased to hear Mr Inderjit give us seven out of 10.&nbsp; He says that by his standards, it is very good.&nbsp; I think seven out of 10 also illustrates the point that we are going forward but we want to make sure we evolve this and get the sequence and the pace right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on the various themes that Members of this House have brought up.&nbsp; I was struck by Mr Iswaran's point that competition does not equal competitiveness.&nbsp; It is worth reflecting on this because the purpose of this piece of legislation is to ensure that we have an efficient functioning market in Singapore and, ultimately, a competitive economy with competitive firms.&nbsp; Merely creating the forms of competition is not sufficient.&nbsp; And, in fact, although this is called the Competition Act, we must remember that this is a means to an end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point which I want to put to the House is that I said earlier in my speech that we are a small but open economy, and that has certain implications for us.&nbsp; Firstly, it means that <p align=left>Column: 906<p>we cannot just copy everything wholesale.&nbsp; Although I have said that we have modelled our legislation on the UK Act, we have had to make significant changes and modifications.&nbsp; Another implication of a small and open economy is this need for extra-territorial provisions.&nbsp; Our intent cannot be and it will be impossible to regulate the practices of big multi-national companies, big overseas firms who happen to have a small presence in Singapore.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, we do need to send a message that we do not want dominant firms, whether they be local or overseas firms, to engage in predatory and unfair behaviour within Singapore shores. As to&nbsp;the action we can take, obviously, we will have to confine our actions to the presence within Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point which Mr Iswaran brought up, and I think it is worth reiterating, is that regulatory cost should be kept to a minimum.&nbsp; Every well-intentioned piece of legislation, every well-intentioned new rule, new entity, new regulator will lead to increased cost.&nbsp; So I urge this House to be mindful, as we have been mindful at MTI, to make sure we balance the cost versus the benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of this, I will discuss later, is when we talk of the need for sectoral exclusions, because we want to avoid unnecessary duplications, unnecessary cost and unnecessary confusion to the firms and businesses which have to operate under such an environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Iswaran, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Sin Boon Ann&nbsp;and, in fact,&nbsp;practically all of them have focused a lot of attention on the exclusions.&nbsp; The first point which I want to put to Members with respect to exclusions is that exclusions from this&nbsp;Competition Act&nbsp;are not meant to protect the companies or the sectors so excluded.&nbsp;I think it is worth reiterating it.&nbsp; Excluding companies and undertakings from the <p align=left>Column: 907<p>Competition Act is not meant to protect them from competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me go through it in a little bit more detail.&nbsp; Clause 33(4) of the Competition Bill provides that the competition law will not apply to any activity or agreement entered into or conduct on the part of the Government or statutory bodies created by Parliament or any person acting on behalf of the Government or statutory bodies in relation to that activity, agreement or conduct.&nbsp; Why do we do so?&nbsp; Because, unlike Mr Steve Chia's irrelevant rambling, we are trying to regulate the conduct of market players in an economy.&nbsp; This is not meant to fetter the discretion or indeed the obligation of the Government to make policy and to perform public functions.&nbsp; Hence, policies and actions taken by the Government and its statutory bodies do not and should not come under the ambit of the proposed competition law.&nbsp; If there are problems with the policies and the actions of the Government or its statutory bodies, the correct venue and the ultimate tribunal for this is this House, and ultimately the electorate.&nbsp; So, do not resort to petty tools like saying \"I can use the Competition Act to regulate political and public policy objectives and actions.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, however, I have also said earlier in my speech that this Bill will apply to commercial and economic activities carried out by private sector entities in all sectors regardless of whether it is owned by a foreign entity, a local entity,&nbsp;Government or statutory body.&nbsp; So all these anxieties about Temasek-linked companies or indeed private limited companies owned by the statutory bodies&nbsp;are misplaced.&nbsp; The anxieties are misplaced because we&nbsp;intend that all these companies will come under the ambit of this law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point is the list of exclusions set out in the Third and Fourth Schedules.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 908<p> Before I enumerate the sectors, let me first describe the process by which we arrived at this list.&nbsp; There was a lot of consultation between Ministries and regulatory agencies and with businesses.&nbsp; And we decided that some exclusions are needed on the basis of public interest considerations -&nbsp;national security,&nbsp;certain aspects of defence, strategic interests.&nbsp; The areas which have sectoral exclusions right now, let me read that out to Members&nbsp; -&nbsp; piped potable water, waste water management, scheduled bus services, rail services, cargo terminal operations, armed security services, media clearing houses activities, gas, electricity, telecommunications, ordinary letter and postcard services.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members stop to think about this list, does&nbsp;it not&nbsp;sound&nbsp;very familiar?&nbsp; It sounds very&nbsp;familiar because these did not start as private sector competitive markets.&nbsp; These started as monopoly services provided for public good by the Government.&nbsp; Now, the first change that occurred to these sectors was not the Competition Act but the fact that the Government, as a matter of policy, decided that, where possible, we would introduce competition into these sectors.&nbsp; And the evolution of competition in these sectors occurred through liberalising these sectors and creating sector specific regulators.&nbsp; For instance, if we talk about telecommunications, IDA is the regulator.&nbsp; For media, there is MDA.&nbsp; For energy, there is EMA and so on and so forth.&nbsp; The point is that these are highly specialised sectors with&nbsp;very unique and different starting points, and we were actually converting monopolies and forcing them to open up and create a competitive element.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if you are starting from that point, I think you will agree with me that there is a need for, first, much more active intervention and regulations. Secondly, there are deep and significant technical, public policy and strategic interests involved in these decisions.&nbsp; Hence, it<p align=left>Column: 909<p> would be dangerous to try to open up these sectors without sector specific regulators who know the rules of the game, who know the technical issues and who can then best manage both the competitive and the technical issues as and when they clash, as sometimes they will.&nbsp; So the point is we are not afraid of competition.&nbsp; We do want competition and we do want competition in these so-called excluded sectors.&nbsp; But we want to ensure that it evolves in a correct, safe and appropriate way.&nbsp; So please do not run away with this misconception that this Competition Act, by excluding these sectors,&nbsp;is meant to protect these sectors.&nbsp; That is absolutely not the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to move on to the related issue&nbsp;of&nbsp;sectoral regulators.&nbsp; Many Members have brought up the issue of&nbsp;whether there is a danger of uneven standards, different procedures, different fines even, as Mr Iswaran brought up.&nbsp; Well, I would say that&nbsp;in an ideal state,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>we would certainly want to evolve to a common standard.&nbsp; And I think if you accept the fact that the general direction is clear and this is a piece of legislation which is evolving and really needs to be practised and refined as it goes along, then you would agree with me not to rush this congruence, although the long-term direction must be congruence and coordination.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is an important sub-point related to that.&nbsp; If you wanted to create more confusion for the market, then you would&nbsp;tell, for instance, the generation companies that they are subject to both EMA and the Competition Commission.&nbsp; So we have deliberately decided at this point in time, to keep it quite separate so that you know who is your regulator, you know what are the fines you are exposed to, you know what are the strategic issues that the Government or the regulator is concerned about, and you have some certainty&nbsp;to get on with<p align=left>Column: 910<p> reforming your sector and delivering your services in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next sub-point on this issue of exclusion&nbsp;I want to emphasise is that these exclusions are not permanent.&nbsp; As I said earlier, this is work-in-progress.&nbsp; In fact, if you read carefully the way we have crafted the legislation, the Competition Bill acts as a kind of a default vehicle so that if at any point in time we decide, for instance, that there is no need for&nbsp;regulation in telecommunications or energy, or whatever the case may be, because it will no longer be regulated under a specially created regulator under written laws, the default mode would be that it would come under the ambit of the Competition Act.&nbsp; So the very way we have crafted it -&nbsp;some Members have raised it - the wording seems to be a bit general and broad, but the&nbsp;intent is that eventually more and more of these sectors will come under direct regulation&nbsp;of the Competition Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say a few things about abuse of dominance.&nbsp; We are not against big companies.&nbsp; We are not even against dominant companies.&nbsp; In the nature of a small economy like ours, some companies will grow&nbsp;very, very big, and will have a dominant position.&nbsp; What&nbsp;we want to prevent is abuse of that dominant position.&nbsp; In fact, if you look again carefully at our legislation and compare it to other jurisdictions, we have defined it in a more difficult but ultimately more useful way.&nbsp; I will give you an example of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Competition Commission&nbsp;has to find that a certain anti-competitive act or certain abuse of dominant position has actually led to a distortion, reduction or elimination of competition before it finds that this activity has transgressed the provisions of this Act.&nbsp; Let me try to explain that in greater detail.&nbsp; It is much easier to craft a legislation to say that specific acts are illegal.&nbsp; Instead,&nbsp;we have said the act is illegal only if it is performed<p align=left>Column: 911<p> and it has&nbsp;impact on our local economy, which actually puts a higher onus of proof on the person or party who wants to allege that a certain company has engaged in anti-competitive behaviour, and the Commission then has to find it accordingly.&nbsp; So, it is not being done in a haphazard,&nbsp;slipshod or easy manner.&nbsp; It has been done very, very carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was intrigued by the fact that when we started talking about the Competition Commission, there were so many suggestions.&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee said that it should just be a department.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Sin Boon Ann all stressed the need for independence.&nbsp; And I think two of them said that it should be a tribunal, and they argued eloquently why it should be&nbsp;run by lawyers, rather than businessmen.&nbsp; Without getting into an ideological debate, we agree with Members that there is a need for independence, there is a need for integrity, and there is a need for integrity and impartialness to be seen as well.&nbsp; That is why we decided to create another statutory body.&nbsp; Yes, there will be some costs incurred in setting up another statutory body.&nbsp; But I think Members have to agree with me that we felt this was important enough to create a statutory body that whilst it may be supervised by MTI, it is not just another department or another policy arm of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; I can assure Members that we will keep it as small as possible.&nbsp; But we will ensure that the people who staff it are well qualified and know what they are supposed to do and will not waste time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also take Members' points that there is a need for this Competition Commission to make decisions in a timely way.&nbsp; As some Members have said, you do not want vexatious and frivolous comments or allegations to come in and keep things in limbo, and result in unnecessary friction<p align=left>Column: 912<p>and paralysis for the real businesses pursuing their objectives.&nbsp; These sentiments of this House will certainly be transmitted to this Commission when it is created and we will do our best to make sure they do.&nbsp; We will do our best to make sure we equip them with the staff, investigative and enforcement powers, so that they can make their decisions quickly, efficiently, but fairly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also take Members' point that, if you just look at this legislation as it is,&nbsp;people need more&nbsp;information.&nbsp; They need more definitions.&nbsp; They need more education. And that is why, if Members read carefully our implementation roll-out plan, on 1st January 2005, if this House approves this piece of legislation, the only thing that will come about is the Competition Commission.&nbsp; This Competition Commission then spends the next 12 months&nbsp;issuing guidelines.&nbsp; And it is not going to unilaterally issue guidelines but to discuss with all the stakeholders, because these are complex issues which none of us on our own have a monopoly of wisdom on.&nbsp; So those 12 months are meant to provide a period of intense consultation, the drawing up of guidelines so that, as Mr Inderjit Singh said, our businesses will have greater certainty as to how this law will operate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming this goes well, then on&nbsp;1st January 2006, the provisions which will basically prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position will come into effect.&nbsp; The more complex prohibition on mergers and acquisitions, we anticipate, will take two years before we put it into effect, and that is because we feel we need more time to consult and arrive at workable, sensible guidelines and <I>modus</I> <I>operandi</I> which the businesses understand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been concern about the retrospective provisions.&nbsp; I think I can quite understand all lawmakers' concerns with retrospective provisions.&nbsp; We thought <p align=left>Column: 913<p>long and hard about this.&nbsp; One alternative would have been to just grandfather all the current agreements, but there are dangers with doing that.&nbsp; First, we did not want a flurry of agreements to be made because people knew they could slip it through the grandfather's net.&nbsp; Secondly, there may really be current&nbsp;agreements that do need to have their provisions relooked at and reviewed, in order to move our economy to a more competitive phase.&nbsp; After all, we said this is meant to move our economy up one quantum step.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to how we are going to do it, again, the key word is \"carefully\".&nbsp; For agreements which have been in existence for more than five years before the Competition Act comes into operation, we will allow the companies to apply to the Competition Commission for more time, or a longer transitional period, so that they will have time to negotiate, renegotiate or&nbsp;amend those agreements so that they will comply with the requirements of the Competition Act.&nbsp; In any case, we are not repudiating all agreements.&nbsp; We are saying only those provisions which infringe the tenets of the Competition Act would, if complained about and if the Competition Commission finds against them, be held to be null and void.&nbsp; We are not saying everything is to be thrown away and everything has to be renegotiated.&nbsp; Yes, there will be a bit more work for Mr Sin Boon Ann, but I hope it will not be very much work for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related to this also is Mr Iswaran's point about frivolous and vexatious complaints.&nbsp; Again, if you look at the way we constructed it, if someone complains to the Competition Commission, it is not the same as if he has gone to a court of law and filed an affidavit against you.&nbsp; Because it is the Competition Commission's own discretion to decide whether there is or there is not a <I>bona fide</I> case that merits investigation, decision and ultimately enforcement.&nbsp; So, again, if we have a properly constituted, <p align=left>Column: 914<p>properly qualified and equipped Competition Commission, this should expeditiously filter out vexatious and frivolous complaints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam was a bit confused, I am afraid, with respect to the role of the District Court and the Competition Commission.&nbsp; In clause 69,&nbsp;it refers to the sanctions which the Competition Commission can impose on businesses for infringing the prohibitions listed in the Bill, and the Bill provides that no financial penalty may exceed 10% of the annual turnover for up to a maximum of three years.&nbsp;Clauses 82 and 83 that Mr Chiam referred to refer to offences that would be committed by people who do not cooperate with the Commission in the course of its investigations or in its attempts to enforce its actions.&nbsp; So, I am afraid, they are two completely different issues.&nbsp; You will not get a situation of people saying,&nbsp;\"Am I going to be fined by the District Court, or the Competition Commission can find against me?\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is worth reiterating the process.&nbsp; If the Competition Commission finds against you and if you disagree, you then have recourse to appeal to a Competition Appeal Board.&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann will be glad to know that the chairman of the Appeal Board will have to be a lawyer who is qualified to be on the Supreme Court.&nbsp; I think that means he must have at least 10 or more years of practice.&nbsp; So the lawyers will still have a role in this process.&nbsp; If you disagree with the decision of the Competition Appeal Board, you can still&nbsp;appeal to the High Court on points of law and on the quantum of the penalty or sanction levied against you.&nbsp; And if you disagree with the findings of the High Court, you can then go to the Court of Appeal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you can see that we have taken the trouble to set up a proper system with proper checks and balances and a right<p align=left>Column: 915<p> balance between business and law.&nbsp; But I want to conclude by saying that if you look at what other jurisdictions have done - I think in the case of the UK, it has been several decades that they have been working on competition law and evolving it, and the most recent legislation of 1998&nbsp;which we have looked at - I have no illusion that this is a big first step, but it is a first step of a much longer journey, and one which we have to go into with our eyes open, clear-headed leadership, and sensible people of integrity operating the system.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Technically, I would just like to inform this House that car dealers will be subject to the Competition Act.&nbsp; So there is no question about them escaping the coverage by this Bill.&nbsp; With regard to his specific point about&nbsp;why there are apparent variations in OMV valuation by LTA or&nbsp;MOF, I am sure&nbsp;LTA&nbsp;and MOF would quickly look into this.&nbsp; And if there is really a loophole, I am sure they will address it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bigger point is, in fact, that there are times when the goals of public policy may need to trump the market and that is why this Competition Act should not be an overarching blunderbuss law that acts to fetter all other exercises of Government<p align=left>Column: 916<p> or statutory bodies.&nbsp; So I am saying that we need to be very clear that where this is business and where this is going to lead to an efficient functioning of the market and&nbsp;more competitive firms, we use this more appropriately.&nbsp; In other circumstances where there are other policy objectives, then we do so.&nbsp; But when we do so, this Government is very aware that every regulation, every tax, or every new rule that we promulgate in pursuit of a public policy objective may, and very often,&nbsp;have market impact as well.&nbsp; And we need to balance the impact of that rule versus the impact on the way the market functions.&nbsp; And I will assure this House that this Government is ever mindful of that and we will not unnecessarily be so pig-headed about it that we will just impose a system and ignore the impact on businesses.&nbsp; But this is something which we will have to feel our way and cross each bridge as we come to it.&nbsp; So please do not treat this Bill as a panacea or as a solution for all ills, real or perceived.&nbsp;

But I would like to reiterate what the Minister said, which is that the Government has not reversed its position on openness to competition in the media sector.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point which he made, and I think is worth reiterating, is that we cannot insist on competition at all costs.&nbsp; Let us not forget that at the end of the day, this is a business that needs to be run and a business that needs to be viable.&nbsp; To blindly insist that you must keep the appearance, the form of competition at all costs even when it does not make business sense would be wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wrong for the Government to insist on that and for the Government to impose that on listed companies.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 918<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill before this House seeks to put in place amendments to the Singapore Armed Forces Act and consequential amendments to the Pension Fund Act. These amendments would allow for the transfer of the Defined Benefits component of the SAVER-Premium Fund to the Government Pension Fund. Subsequently, these Defined Benefits would be paid out from the Pension Fund when eligible members make a claim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Background</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will start by introducing the background behind these changes.&nbsp; The SAVER-Premium Fund was introduced to provide financial security for the SAF servicemen after their military careers. The SAVER-Premium Fund has two components: a Defined Benefits component, and a Defined Contributions component. The Defined Benefits component is the amount set aside primarily to service MINDEF's obligations to pay for the post-retirement medical benefits, also START benefits (which are lump-sum payments to Warrant Officers and Specialists on completion of 10 years of service) and compensations (arising <p align=left>Column: 920<p>from death or injury whilst in service) to all eligible members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other component, ie, the Defined Contributions component, is the amount MINDEF pays into the individual accounts of the servicemen in recognition of the adjustments that they would have to make as they transit to and take on a second career on retirement. This Defined Contributions component is not affected by this Bill. It will continue to be managed and invested by MINDEF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Rationale for transferring the DB component</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, the investment objectives of the Defined Benefits and Defined Contributions are different.&nbsp; The adequacy of the Defined Benefits component depends on actuarial outcomes, like how many officers and servicemen will require medical benefits post-retirement.&nbsp; On the other hand, beneficiaries of the Defined Contributions component participate fully in the risks and returns of the investments.&nbsp; In other words, they take the ups and downs of&nbsp;such investments.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF therefore intends to transfer the Defined Benefits component for central management within the Government Pension Fund. The transfer will allow the Defined Benefits component to be co-invested with the Pension Fund, which shares the same investment objective and has a larger risk pool. Furthermore, since both Funds -&nbsp;the State Pension Fund and the Defined Benefits Funds&nbsp;- are defined benefits in nature, the transfer can also result in better economy of scale in their management.</p><p><br><I>Transfer of the DB component</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF will ensure that the assets transferred would be equal to the liabilities at the point of transfer. Thereafter, MINDEF will make monthly contributions<p align=left>Column: 921<p> to the Pension Fund to fund new members' Defined Benefits, just as other Ministries do for their pensionable staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One very small portion of the Defined Benefits would, however, not be transferred. This is the amount set aside for 'compensation' arising from death or injuries of servicemen whilst in service. This is because the Ministry of Finance has decided that such payments should be made from the respective Ministries' operating budgets with effect from FY 04.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enable the transfer to be made, MINDEF needs amendments to sections 205B(2) and 206(1) of the SAF Act, and the consequential amendments to the Pension Fund Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This change has no impact on the individual servicemen, as it does not affect their individual Defined Contribution accounts and the Government's undertaking to provide post-retirement medical benefits and START benefits will be undertaken by the State Pension Fund in full.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I share Dr Ong's view that we ought to look after the servicemen and officers of the SAF.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure him that there will be&nbsp;no changes to the benefits that will accrue to servicemen or officers as a result of this amendment.&nbsp; The main reason for the change, ie, the transfer of the Defined Benefits component to the State Pension Fund is for efficiency of management, since the Defined Benefits component shares the same investment objective as the State Pension Fund.&nbsp; So, rather than leaving it to be invested by MINDEF, we have transferred this component to the State Pension Fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Defined Contributions component, which are contributions made by MINDEF for individual servicemen's account under the SAVER-Premium Scheme, will continue to be managed and invested by MINDEF.&nbsp;

This was because it was&nbsp;likely to have impact on a broad cross-section of the population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has received 61 written representations on the Bill from various stakeholders, including&nbsp;management corporations (MCs), subsidiary proprietors (SPs), managing agents (MAs), developers and lawyers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has heard oral evidence from 15 individuals or groups, whose views are representative of the stakeholders.&nbsp; It has taken into account these representations as well as Members' views expressed during the Second Reading.&nbsp; The full details are in the Report of the Select Committee,<p align=left>Column: 924<p> which has been presented to Parliament on 7th October 2004&nbsp;and available to the public since 8th October 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee has been guided by some key considerations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, recognising the different interests of stakeholders, the Committee has sought to strike a balance between the interests of majority and minority SPs, and owner developers and SPs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Committee has been conscious that SPs need to take greater ownership in managing their developments, in line with the intent to promote self-regulation.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Committee has sought to strengthen the Bill to inculcate a maintenance culture and to facilitate the staging of large development projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now&nbsp;elaborate on the key recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>New short title of Bill<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has agreed to change the Bill's short title to \"Building Maintenance and Strata Management\" to reflect its substantial content on strata developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Balancing the different interests of user groups - in mixed-use strata developments<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original Bill proposed a two-tier MC system for mixed-use developments, with a main MC and a second tier of subsidiary MCs (sub-MCs) to represent different users, eg, residential and commercial.&nbsp; The main MC manages the property which is common for general use of all SPs.&nbsp; The sub-MCs manage the common property used exclusively by their respective user groups, ie, \"limited common property\", and they can levy contributions from them for maintenance or improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 925<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two-tier MC system has been tried and tested in other countries, such as Canada and Australia, specifically in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.&nbsp; User groups have flexibility to make their own decisions without being frustrated by other groups who may not share their interest.&nbsp; For example, high-rise residential unit owners can now upgrade their lifts without being hampered by objections from owners of low-rise units without lifts. &nbsp;Likewise, retail shop owners in a mixed development can plan to upgrade the concourse of a shopping area without having to face resistance from residential unit owners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representations to the Committee generally supported the two-tier MC system.&nbsp; In fact, several representors have asked that the three categories of developments that are&nbsp;allowed to form sub-MCs, namely:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; residential and non-residential lots, eg, residential apartments and retail shops;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; non-residential lots used for different purposes, eg, hotels, offices and retail shops; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; different types of residential lots, eg, high-rise apartments and low-rise town houses</p><p><br>be expanded to include one more category, ie, non-residential lots in distinct office blocks. &nbsp;The Committee has agreed to this. &nbsp;To ensure that the addition of the fourth category will not result in the proliferation of sub-MCs, qualifying criteria will be prescribed by regulations.&nbsp; Such&nbsp;criteria can include the minimum size or gross floor area of eligible developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate dispute resolution under the two-tier MC system, the Strata Titles Board (STB) will be allowed to adjudicate boundary disputes on limited common property between MC and sub-MC, or even among sub-MCs.&nbsp; This would be<p align=left>Column: 926<p> more efficient and less costly than going to the courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Balancing the interests of majority and minority SPs - representation in the council</B><br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original Bill, each SP can only have one seat in the council, even if he owns more than one lot. Some representors consider this to be unfair to those SPs with substantial interests in a development.&nbsp; This is because the minority SPs can then dictate the overall management of the development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is reasonable to expect majority SPs to want to have a greater say in the management of their assets.&nbsp; Hence, the Committee has agreed to allow owners of multiple lots to have proportional representation in the council according to share value. &nbsp;This is subject to a cap of 49% of the council seats for any one SP. &nbsp;For example, a SP can have up to six seats in a 14-member council, or one seat short of half of the total seats. &nbsp;This is to prevent absolute control by any SP in the council and provide some safeguard to the minority SPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Balancing the interests of owner developers and SPs - contributions to maintenance fund&nbsp;<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current industry practice is that the developer sets up a maintenance fund for a development after the issue of its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). &nbsp;As soon as the developer starts collecting maintenance contributions, the developer must also contribute to the fund, for the unsold units as well as for the sold units that have not yet been handed over to the purchasers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair that the developer, who has not handed over the units to the purchasers, should contribute to the maintenance fund.&nbsp; However, in several representors' view, requiring developers to contribute to the fund for sold units not <p align=left>Column: 927<p>yet handed over could pressure them to rush through the handing over and compromise quality and customer service.&nbsp; The feedback is that developers usually need up to three months after TOP to hand over the sold units in large developments.&nbsp; Hence, the Committee has agreed to allow developers a grace period of three months from TOP before starting contributions for unsold units and sold units not handed over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Establishing a maintenance culture<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Members have expressed concern over the weak building maintenance culture in Singapore.&nbsp; I share their concern.</p><p><br><I><B>External windows</B></I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasised many times in Parliament this year the danger posed by, for example,&nbsp;falling windows.&nbsp; The Building Control Act has been amended to provide for the Minister to prescribe minimum standards for the design and installation of windows.&nbsp; Existing casement windows in residential buildings are required to be retrofitted with stainless steel rivets. &nbsp;This addresses the upstream safety aspects of design and installation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we also need to address the downstream aspects of maintenance to be fully effective in addressing the problem. &nbsp;External windows have been defined as common property in strata developments.&nbsp; This is so that the MCs can have control over window designs, in order to preserve the uniform appearance of building fa\u00c3\u00a7ades for aesthetic reasons.&nbsp; However, with the high incidence of falling windows in the last four years, which again I have highlighted in this House,&nbsp;for example, there were&nbsp;19 cases in 2000 and, last year,&nbsp;in 2003, there were&nbsp;106 cases, the rationale for defining all external windows<p align=left>Column: 928<p> as common property and the onus on MCs to maintain them are no longer relevant. &nbsp;A re-definition is needed, so that the most appropriate party is made responsible for window maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External windows can be classified into&nbsp;two distinct groups:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Those that can be opened, eg, casement, sliding and top-hung windows, and louvres; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Those that are fixed, eg, curtain walls or fixed glass panels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommends that windows that are openable be excluded from the definition of common property.&nbsp; As the SPs are the ones who have access and control over such windows, they will be made responsible for their maintenance.&nbsp; However, fixed windows remain as common property and, as such,&nbsp;MCs will continue to maintain them.&nbsp; In addition, the MCs will still retain the ability to regulate window designs for uniformity of the building fa\u00c3\u00a7ade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For consistency, a consequential amendment will also be made to the Town Councils Act to exclude openable windows from common property.&nbsp; These windows will come under the flat owners' maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Maintaining exterior features<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inculcate a strong maintenance culture, we need continuing public education.&nbsp; We also need to strengthen our legislation.&nbsp; The Committee has agreed to empower the Commissioner of Buildings&nbsp;to prosecute the \"person responsible\" for failure to maintain the exterior features of their buildings, and thus endangering the lives or properties of others.&nbsp; These exterior features include windows, airconditioning units, wall tiles and any other elements permanently fixed to the external fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of buildings.&nbsp; The<p align=left>Column: 929<p> penalty is a maximum fine of $10,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"person responsible\" is defined as the person or entity who has charge of the maintenance or daily control of the external features. This means:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Town Councils, for&nbsp;common property in HDB flats;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; MCs, for common property in strata developments; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Owners, for common property of any other buildings or premises.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For openable windows, which are no longer common property, the SPs in strata developments and the flat owners of HDB flats will be deemed as&nbsp;the \"person responsible\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Encouraging greater ownership amongst SPs</B></I></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under an existing provision, office bearers in the council (ie, the chairman, secretary and treasurer) are not permitted to resign unless replacements are found. &nbsp;Several representors feel that this is unfair to volunteers, who have to continue in office for many years due to general apathy of fellow SPs.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp;many are discouraged from coming forward to hold office.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

However, the office bearer must first notify the MC of his intention to resign and must convene a general meeting to try to find a replacement. &nbsp;Without replacements, the whole council may be vacated. &nbsp;If this happens, the entire body of SPs will then have to bear responsibility for the management of the<p align=left>Column: 930<p> strata development. &nbsp;Individual SPs will be made jointly and severally liable for the payment of all the MC's debts.&nbsp; If the SPs do not maintain their estate properly, the Commissioner of Buildings&nbsp;will issue a notice to compel them to take corrective actions.&nbsp; A new provision also allows any SP to apply to the STB to compel an election and the appointment of new office bearers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

Strata developments are founded on the concept of community living.

This will further enhance safety in our high-rise living environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the appointment of managing agent is a collective decision by all subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; Therefore, it is important that all subsidiary proprietors must take interest and bear the consequences of their decisions in appointing their managing agents.&nbsp; This is particularly important as managing agents are not regulated in Singapore.&nbsp; As stated in an article titled \"Watch who you hire to run your condo\" by Ms Tan Hui Yee of the <I>Straits Times</I> on 17th October 2004, management corporations must exercise due diligence when selecting managing agents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate tender selection criteria, such as professionalism, quality and track record, should be taken into consideration when awarding managing agent contracts.&nbsp; I would urge subsidiary proprietors to adopt a longer term view, and appoint professional managing agents to enhance the value of their property, instead of always going for the lowest tenderers.&nbsp; The proposed amendment to allow MC to appoint MA for a longer period of up to three years will provide more opportunities for MC and MA to work out plans to better manage their strata developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although some concerns were raised on the two-tier MC system, it will, nevertheless, provide more options and flexibility for subsidiary proprietors to adopt different approaches in managing their strata development, so as to better fulfil the needs of different groups of subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; However, I would like to urge the Ministry to monitor closely the implementation of the two-tier MC system and evaluate its impact on the standards of maintenance and communal living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 935<p><p><I>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Balancing the interests of various stakeholders</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure proper management of strata development, it is crucial that developers, managing agents and subsidiary proprietors exercise their duties and obligations diligently and in compliance with the Act. At the start, developers must ensure that proper documents are handed over to the MC so that the MC can manage the strata development properly.&nbsp; I support the amendment that the Minister shall specify the documents that are essential for the proper upkeep of the strata development and shall modify the list from time to time to reflect changes in strata development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To balance the rights of majority and minority SPs, I support the provision of proportional representation according to share value, subject to a cap of 49% of the council seats.&nbsp; This provides a good check and balance mechanism to prevent undue domination of a single majority SP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving operational efficiency</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various new measures were introduced to further improve the operational efficiency in managing strata management. For example, the removal of the requirement to have 100 SPs to form a quorum for AGM and EOGM will facilitate the conduct of general meetings.&nbsp; Other measures, such as allowing council members to vote in writing and to resign as office bearers, will encourage more SPs to come forward to serve MC and expedite decision-making of the MC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a new provision was made to include a statutory presumption of liability to be attributed to the upper floor units in cases of inter-floor leakages.&nbsp; This provision is necessary as inter-floor leakage is common and often results in a stalemate situation when SPs of upper<p align=left>Column: 936<p> floor units refuse to cooperate in repairing the leakage.&nbsp; While the liability is assumed, the cost of repair for inter-floor leakages should be shared equally between the upper and lower floor units in normal wear and tear circumstances.&nbsp; But if the inter-floor leakages could be directly attributed to the actions, such as renovation works of the upper floor units, the upper floor units may have to bear the cost of repairs instead.&nbsp; If there is a dispute between the SPs regarding the apportionment of repair cost, it can be referred to the Strata Titles Board for adjudication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the amended Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>even better than Mr Inderjit Singh's assessment of the Competition Bill.&nbsp; Indeed, this most recent consultative exercise and the subsequent amendments made, illustrate the importance and value of having thorough consultations on proposed changes to<p align=left>Column: 937<p> legislation or the introduction of new legislation, especially for something that has so wide-ranging impact on our living and working environment.&nbsp; This will help to ensure its effectiveness and efficacy as well as practicality in implementation.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the extensive consultations with key stakeholders prior to the drafting of the Bill did not exhaust the flow of comments and ideas during the Select Committee stage.&nbsp; This is not surprising as the legislation is highly technical and complex and impinges on many stakeholders with divergent interests, as&nbsp;alluded to by the Minister.&nbsp; Moreover, the drafters of the Bill may lack the practical experience in the industry to fully comprehend the crux of the issues and problems in the maintenance and management of properties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that many legislation are often highly technical and complex and could have unintended consequences, if not properly drafted or well thought out.&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to urge not only the Ministry of National Development but also other Ministries to actively engage stakeholders and solicit their feedback on proposed Bills, as long as they are not market sensitive, and allow thorough debates on the Bills before they are passed into law to improve their relevance and efficacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several key issues and concerns that have arisen as a result of some of the proposed amendments which the Select Committee has adopted.&nbsp; I would like to comment briefly on six of these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, changes to share value in phased developments.&nbsp; To allow for flexibility that would facilitate phased developments on white sites, such as the upcoming Business and Financial Centre in Marina South, the Select Committee agreed to <p align=left>Column: 938<p>allow share values allotted to units in a phased development to be stated with a range of variation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing share value in phased developments to be changed within certain prescribed limits and declared upfront by the developer would help to enhance the viability of such large-scale and highly risky phased developments in the face of rapidly changing economic conditions.&nbsp; However, the range of share values should preferably be kept small, otherwise it would be unfair to the first stage owners as there are implications on the early owner's share in the common property, the amount of contributions he has to pay, as well as his voting rights.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act does not spell out any guidelines as to how share values are to be given in a range or, when fixed, how is it to be changed subsequently.&nbsp; I propose that the BCA work with key stakeholders to issue some guidelines as to how share values ought to be given in a range, how they are to be adjusted - say, based on a formula - arising from changes in the subsequent phases of the development, and the information that must be clearly spelt out and given to purchasers so that they are fully aware of the implications of possible future changes to the share value of their units.&nbsp; As the chairperson of the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, let me state that the Institute would be more than delighted to contribute in this respect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, permitted alterations to common property during initial period.&nbsp; The Bill originally allowed subsidiary proprietors to carry out alterations during the initial period, if they pass a \"special\" resolution where the votes are based on at least three-quarters of the aggregate share values of the lots cast at the meeting.&nbsp; However, the lots owned by the developers are to be excluded from the voting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 939<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written submissions to the Select Committee had highlighted that, if not many units were sold by the developers during the initial period, this could effectively mean that a small number of owners could pass a special resolution that might affect the entire development.&nbsp; For instance, in a 100-unit development where only&nbsp;four units had been sold, a special resolution could be passed by three out of the four owners to make changes to the common property which might not be beneficial to the subsequent owners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Select Committee has taken this into consideration and now allows developer votes to be included.&nbsp; However, this change, which is provided now in clause&nbsp;50, would swing the scenario the other way.&nbsp; If developers hold at least 75% of the votes, they could presumably make alterations to the detriment of the 25% or less of the owners.&nbsp; Alternatively, in a more realistic scenario, they might not make any alterations to the common property which might be beneficial to the owners as a whole so as not to incur additional sums of money or deplete the management fund.&nbsp; Either way, the situation is unsatisfactory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the existing Act in restricting the power of the MC, including making alterations to development during the initial period, is, in fact, to prevent a developer, who may be the majority owner during the initial period, from making decisions which could be prejudicial to the owners or potential owners of the development before the first annual general meeting.&nbsp; Hence, including the lots owned by the developers in the computation of the votes for making alterations to the development during the initial period would defeat the very purpose for which the existing Act, and now&nbsp;clause 49 of the amended Bill, sets out to prevent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 940<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, to prevent both scenarios from arising, I propose that we should keep the <I>status quo</I>, ie, the original or existing position before the Bill, where the approval of the Commissioner of Building has to be obtained if the MC decides to carry out any alterations.&nbsp; The COB would then decide on the application of the MC for alterations, after taking into account the owners' and developers' views and interests.&nbsp; This should not be too onerous to the COB in any case, since it is&nbsp;envisaged that such situations would be rare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The justifications for reverting to the original position would be similar to the basis on which the Select Committee has now agreed to reinstating the offence provision based on feedback that it is an effective deterrent to compel SPs to pay their contributions even though the intention of the removal was to decriminalise&nbsp;minor offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, resignation of office bearers (Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer).&nbsp;Clause 55 provides that, \"Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a person appointed to the office of chairperson, secretary or treasurer of the council of&nbsp;a management corporation shall not resign his office until (a) a&nbsp;meeting of the council is first convened for the purpose of appointing another person to fill his vacancy; and (b) a general meeting is first convened for the purpose of electing another person to fill his vacancy, and any purported resignation or vacation of office in breach of this subsection shall be deemed to be invalid.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is in response to feedback that the existing provision which does not allow an office bearer to resign, unless a replacement is found, is onerous and unfair.&nbsp; As most people living in multi-unit strata title developments can attest, it is not easy to find well-meaning, responsible men and women with integrity, willing to serve.&nbsp; We should not make it any harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 941<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the new requirement that a general meeting would have to be convened to elect another person to fill the vacancy would, in practice, make the resignation of any one of the three key office bearers no less difficult and costly.&nbsp; It would be more practical if the Act provides that a general meeting need only be convened if the office bearer or the remaining Council members are unable to find a replacement for the post, say, within a month, after a Council meeting is convened for the purpose of appointing another person to fill his vacancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, period of appointment of the managing agent (MA).&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 57 of the Select Committee's report notes that the appointment of the MA is another important decision that would affect all SPs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Committee agrees that the termination and re-appointment of MAs should be done via a general meeting so that every SP would be aware of the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Bill had allowed for the MA to be appointed by the council without a general meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Select Committee now agrees that the MA should be appointed at a general meeting, clause 66(1)(b) of the amended Bill still provides that a managing agent may be appointed by the council without a general meeting if duly authorised to do so by the subsidiary proprietors at the last preceding general meeting.&nbsp; This is similar to clause 65(1)(b) of the original Bill and would appear to be contradictory to the current intention for the MA to be appointed at the general meeting to ensure that every SP is aware of the decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there is an error in clause 66(3)(b) which provides \"where the managing agent is appointed under subsection (1)(b) or (c) - by the council of the management corporation without a general meeting\".&nbsp; There is no clause 66(1)(c) now as it has been deleted from the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 942<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the Select Committee agrees in&nbsp;paragraph 71 of its report that MCs could be permitted to appoint the MA for a term of up to three years, which would be comparable to the MAs for Town Councils.&nbsp; Accordingly, clause 66(2)(a) has been amended to state that the MA appointed shall hold office until the conclusion of the \"third\" annual general meeting instead of until the conclusion of the \"next\" annual general meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Select Committee also notes that it is important that the MA's performance be reviewed annually and, hence, states that the MA's appointment should be an item on the AGM agenda to be reviewed annually.&nbsp; This requirement seems superfluous since, if the MC wishes to terminate the MA in accordance with the terms of appointment, say, due to poor performance, they could do so at the general meeting.&nbsp; There is no need to mandate that the MA's appointment should be an item for review at every AGM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, quorum for general meeting.&nbsp; In the original Bill, the quorum requirement for AGM and EOGM is either 100&nbsp;SPs or SPs who collectively own 30% of the total share value, whichever is lower.&nbsp; The Select Committee now removes the 100 SPs requirement as a representor had argued that the requirement of 100 SPs at an EGM is arbitrary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without this 100 SPs option, for large condominiums with, say 1,000 owners, the quorum required is 300.&nbsp; In practice, this number is not normally achieved.&nbsp; To make this section realistic and practicable, the quorum requirement should not make it so difficult to start a meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision making, on the other hand, could be stringent, depending on the seriousness of the subject matters<p align=left>Column: 943<p> discussed (based on the resolutions required).&nbsp; A common attendance at MC meeting is about 50-80; therefore, 100 SPs is a good reference point.&nbsp; Based on the proposed quorum requirement of 30%&nbsp;share value, most large condominiums would be unlikely to start their meetings.&nbsp; They would have to wait for half an hour to start the general meeting.&nbsp; Hence, the section in the original Bill with the 100 SPs or 30% of total share values should be retained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, accreditation of MAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 69 of the Select Committee report states that the Committee disagreed with the proposal for mandatory accreditation of MAs as this would be inconsistent with the move towards less Government regulation of the industry as a whole.&nbsp; The Committee felt that this should be self-regulated by the professionals themselves.&nbsp; In fact, this is precisely why the SISV-APFM accreditation was established, ie, to provide for self-regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it must be acknowledged that standards of practice in the industry are highly disparate precisely because managing agents have never been regulated in any way before.&nbsp; Incidentally, the wide gulf in standards of management agents was also a point highlighted in the <I>Sunday Times</I> article dated 17th October 2004 with the headline \"Watch who you hire to run your condo\", where the case of a security guard who attempted to secure an appointment as a managing agent was quoted.&nbsp; In contrast, other professions, including insurance agents, are subject to legislation.&nbsp; Indeed, by a strange twist of events, even maid agencies are required to be accredited.&nbsp; But MAs, whose role and function can determine the environment most Singaporeans live in, are not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 944<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent amendment to the Land Surveyors Act, not only are surveyors required by the Act to be registered, but they now also need to fulfil certain minimum CPD requirements before they can renew their practising certificates.&nbsp; One would presume that this was not seen as being inconsistent with the Government's move towards less regulation of the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the development of increasingly large-scale and complex developments, the proliferation of more private residential strata developments and the introduction of two-tier MCs, there is a need to maintain some minimum standards of practice among MAs to protect the interests of SPs and ensure the smooth functioning and operation of the Act.&nbsp; Ignorance or lack of knowledge and understanding of property maintenance and management may lead to costly oversight, pose hazards to occupiers and affect the reputation and value of the property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the&nbsp;Government appears adverse to legislation for MAs, I hope that it could at least give support for the accreditation scheme by, say, issuing guidelines to MCSTs, that, where possible, accredited MAs should be engaged to manage the development.&nbsp; The Minister would know that even non-statutory guidelines of a purely administrative nature have great persuasive authority.&nbsp; The professional bodies would then exercise control on their members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;Members of this House would realise, the Select Committee's report is a truly formidable document in weight and technicality of its content, and I suppose that my comments, due to time constraints, are by no means exhaustive.&nbsp; So, I would, in closing, urge the Ministry and BCA to keep the channels of communication open for more feedback to the implementation of this Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 945<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Let me try to address the questions that have been posed by the Members but not in the order of how they were posed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and take what I think are the more important and fundamental ones first, and it is the point which has been made by both Dr Amy Khor as well as Dr Teo Ho Pin&nbsp; - &nbsp;the consultation that we have adopted to try and arrive at this point.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, this is a Bill that has got far-reaching implications for many strata title holders in Singapore, as they&nbsp;do have problems with their managing agents.&nbsp; Many people do not come forward to serve for various reasons.&nbsp; And when they do come forward to serve, they do encounter certain problems. So there is a general lack of&nbsp;empathy.&nbsp; And this is the reason why, in the crafting of this Bill, we sought not only to try and address some of the problems of balance of interest between the various stakeholders but also to try and encourage more self-regulation and more involvement of subsidiary proprietors and stakeholders in the management of their estates.&nbsp; That is the reason why we decided to go for this very long consultation process; first of all, an exhaustive process talking to the various stakeholders and then subsequently when we&nbsp;came to Parliament, I accepted the point that was made by Members to commit this Bill to a Select Committee.&nbsp; And then in the Select Committee itself, we again canvassed for a wide range of views and we received a lot of views.&nbsp; More than 60 representations were made and very good representations, I must say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then went through the process of hearing the representors.&nbsp; And at the end of the day, many of their suggestions <p align=left>Column: 946<p>were&nbsp;accepted and incorporated as amendments to this Bill.&nbsp; As Dr Khor pointed out, about three quarters of the representations were&nbsp;accepted either wholly or in part.&nbsp; This is a process which the Government has practised in various forms, particularly in Bills which are of a very highly technical nature and also Bills which affect a lot of people.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to do this for Bills of this nature and I hope to seek the support of Members. In so doing, we will need to spend time sitting through and interviewing the representors and coming to conclusions.&nbsp; But I think it is time that is well worth spending, as Members will agree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second important point I would like to address is the issue of accreditation of managing agents.&nbsp; The point has been&nbsp;highlighted, particularly by Dr Amy Khor, on the need for managing agents to be professional.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin also made the same point.&nbsp; SPs should choose their MAs carefully because MAs are not regulated.&nbsp; Both of these Members understand the current situation.&nbsp; There is a wide range of standards in the industry.&nbsp; There is a wide gulf in the standards between one MA and another.&nbsp; So the question&nbsp;is: who should be doing something about this?&nbsp; My view is that we should continue to encourage the industry to self-regulate.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I think, first of all, they are the more effective regulators; secondly, they understand&nbsp;the industry better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, in fact, already such a self-regulation system in place.&nbsp; The SISV and APFM both&nbsp;operate a self-regulation system.&nbsp; They have an accreditation system.&nbsp; In addition to that, they have also worked with Government agencies, such as SPRING and BCA, to&nbsp;come up with certain standards for the industry to follow.&nbsp; These standards have been drawn up in the year 2001, the technical reference on performance of managing agents or TR3.&nbsp; Basically, this sets out<p align=left>Column: 947<p> basic requirements for MAs to follow.&nbsp; It serves as a reference for MCs to assess whether their estates are properly maintained.&nbsp; What we can do, of course, is to go to the next step and that is to upgrade this TR3 into a Singapore standard where the industry can then use this as a basis to accredit MAs in Singapore.&nbsp; So this has already been done.&nbsp; The industry has launched a system in December 2003 to raise the standard of professionalism in the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;support this move, and I hope that we would be able to do more. &nbsp;But whether&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;should mandate that all MAs must be accredited and to write this into the Bill, I do not think it is necessary for us to do so. I think it is an overkill and I have faith that the industry will be able to self-regulate and there are reputable players in the market who should be able to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I come back to my point that subsidiary proprietors and MCs must be able to arrive at informed decisions such that their condominiums and properties are well managed.&nbsp; And if they make the wrong decisions, they will suffer the consequences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;Members will continue to support this approach, work with the Government and continue to promote this self-regulation process and the authorities, BCA and SPRING, will help them in this process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo made several comments concerning two-tier MCs.&nbsp; He basically supported the two-tier MCs but he did also ask that we continue to monitor this process.&nbsp; As I indicated in my Second Reading speech, this is a very new process and this is the reason why we are going to take it in a careful and cautious way.&nbsp; We are not going to back date this to existing developments.&nbsp; We are going to apply this only to new developments.&nbsp; And as we do so, we will also monitor the<p align=left>Column: 948<p> developments closely, as he suggested, and, if necessary, we will make changes as we go along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of inter-floor leakages, yes, the reason why we accepted this particular suggestion was a realisation that to be fair, since most of the cases are actually due to the upper floor unit,&nbsp;we should place a rebuttable presumption on them.&nbsp; In other words, it is their responsibility to prove that they are not at fault.&nbsp; That is merely to facilitate the process.&nbsp; The current experience has been that since the upper floor unit is not the one who is suffering the consequences of the leak,&nbsp;there is really no urgency on his part to do anything.&nbsp; So he is the one who would be dragging his feet.&nbsp; He is the one who would not be answering phone calls or answering requests from the MC or the subsidiary proprietor of the lower floor to do something about it.&nbsp; So with this new clause in the Bill, the rebuttable presumption would be on the upper floor unit.&nbsp; The onus is on the upper floor unit to rebut this presumption and prove that the leak is not due to a defect in his unit.&nbsp; Of course, that does not automatically imply that the upper floor unit will have to pay the full cost.&nbsp; It really depends on what each individual case is, and this is where the Strata Titles Board comes into the picture.&nbsp; It is up to the Strata Titles Board to then determine the apportionment of cost depending on the specifics of each case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me hasten to add also that this provision only applies to strata developments, because it relates to disputes heard by the Strata Titles Board.&nbsp; For HDB flats, which are not under the STB, the current arrangement will still apply.&nbsp; In other words, the owners of the upper and lower floor flats would share responsibility in maintaining this party structure.&nbsp; HDB will try and adjudicate and try and resolve the problem to the satisfaction of both parties.&nbsp; Currently,<p align=left>Column: 949<p> there is no plan to change this arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor also made several other points concerning some other aspects of the change.&nbsp; She talked about changes in the share values in the phased developments&nbsp; -&nbsp; whether the range of the share values can be kept small in order to make sure that existing subsidiary proprietors are not disadvantaged later on.&nbsp; I agree with her that we should have some guidelines, and BCA will work with the industry to prepare some guidelines to make sure that there is equity both for the existing as well as for future subsidiary proprietors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards permitting of alterations to common property, this is a question of where we place that balance&nbsp; -&nbsp; how we balance the interest of the owner/developer and the subsidiary proprietors.&nbsp; We feel that with the special resolution, there&nbsp;are sufficient safeguards.&nbsp; We do not wish, if we can help it, to refer everything to the Commissioner of Buildings for such changes to take place.&nbsp; I believe that this is an arrangement which will find its own balance after a while.&nbsp; If there is blatant&nbsp;abuse of the system, then I would certainly expect the Commissioner of Buildings to get into the act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several other points made about resignation of office bearers.&nbsp; Why convene a general meeting to find a replacement?&nbsp; Basically, we want the office bearer who wishes to resign to make the effort to announce to the general body to give notice that he is going to resign, and also to have them put on notice that&nbsp;nobody is stepping forward.&nbsp; They are now able to resign, and the consequence of this is that the individual subsidiary proprietors will have to bear a liability, both jointly and severally.&nbsp; And this liability is something that has to be made known to them, and this is the reason why we require them to convene a general meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 950<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of quorum, why is the 30% removed?&nbsp; I believe the 30% was removed because there was a representation made that the number of&nbsp;100 SPs&nbsp;is an arbitrary number.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30% figure is deemed to be fair.&nbsp; Why do you need 100 SPs?&nbsp; The Committee felt that this was a reasonable point, and this is the reason why we felt that we would remove this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point that Dr Amy Khor made is probably a good point for me to conclude, and that is to agree with her.&nbsp; Yes, it is important that we keep the channels open.&nbsp; I do not believe that this is the last time that we are going to amend the LTSA, although I hope that we do not have to do it too often because this is a very major exercise.&nbsp; The last time we did it, I think, was more than 10 years ago.&nbsp; At that time too, we went through a very major exercise.&nbsp; But the way we have crafted the Bill allows us the flexibility to make regulations that will allow us to continue to keep or preserve the intent of this Bill.&nbsp; And I hope that many of the feedback that we got will allow us to improve the system or process by</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this Parliament resolves that the amendments set out in Appendix I to the Report of the Standing Orders Committee as contained in Paper Parl. 6 of 2004 be and are hereby made to the Standing Orders of Parliament.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 951<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the chairmanship of the Speaker, the Standing Orders Committee has proposed amendments to the Standing Orders (SOs).&nbsp; These amendments have been grouped under four categories, namely:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;New amendments;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;Substantive amendments;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Amendments to procedures and current practices; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;Other amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for proposing the amendments under the above four categories is stated in the \"Remarks\" column in Appendix I and there is no need for me to elaborate on them.&nbsp; However, I shall highlight the key and substantive amendments made to the current rules and procedures so as to facilitate the conduct of parliamentary business and improve the efficiency of the House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>New Amendments<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Residuary powers of the Speaker</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we have included a new provision to allow the Speaker to rule on all matters of practice and procedure.&nbsp; Currently, Standing Order (SO) No. 105 provides that in cases of doubt the Standing Orders shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice of the UK House of Commons.&nbsp; With the amendment, the Speaker can decide and rule on the interpretation and application of the Standing Orders but he will be guided by previous Speakers' rulings and established practices of Parliament.&nbsp; However, this does not prevent the Speaker from adopting the relevant practices of Commonwealth Parliaments so far as they may be applicable to us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 952<p><p><I>Interpretation of \"clear days\"<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the introduction of five-day work week in the public sector, we have defined \"clear days\" to exclude Saturday for the purpose of calculating the number of days.&nbsp; This is provided for in the Interpretation section in Amendment No. 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Effect of prorogation on Bills<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another new amendment relates to the effect of prorogation on Bills (Amendment No. 6).&nbsp; At present, all Bills which have not been passed or obtained the Presidential assent shall lapse upon prorogation of Parliament.&nbsp; The amendment provides that a Bill shall not lapse upon the prorogation of Parliament and all business and proceedings connected therewith shall automatically be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament.&nbsp; As Parliament is elected for a term of five years, there is no compelling reason for the business not to continue from one session to the next within the term of that Parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment also allows a Bill which has been passed by Parliament before prorogation to be presented, after prorogation, to the Presidential Council for Minority Rights for consideration and to the President for his assent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the business before any Select Committee shall not lapse upon the prorogation of Parliament and shall be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament and continue from the stage that it had reached in the preceding session.&nbsp; However, when Parliament is dissolved, all Bills will still lapse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Term of a Standing Select Committee<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders Committee has similarly proposed that the term of<p align=left>Column: 953<p> Sessional Select Committees, for example, the Estimates Committee or the Public Accounts Committee, be for the duration of a Parliament and that the business and proceedings before such a Committee shall not lapse by reason of a prorogation.&nbsp; As the term of these Committees will no longer be for a session, they shall henceforth be known as Standing Select Committees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Substantive Amendments</B><br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Oaths of Allegiance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the category of \"Substantive Amendments\", Amendment No. 9 gives the Speaker the flexibility of determining the manner of taking an oath or affirmation of allegiance at a place other than at the Table.&nbsp; For instance, Members may, in future, take their oaths from their seats or in groups.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Questions for oral/written answer<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next amendment under this category (Amendment No. 10) makes provision for the number of questions that a Member can ask for oral and written answer. Currently, Standing Orders allow for a maximum of three questions for oral answer per sitting. They are silent on the total number of questions, including those for written answer. The Committee has considered the provisions in other parliaments.&nbsp; For example, in Lok Sabha (India), a Member can ask not more than five questions per sitting, one of which can be for oral answer.&nbsp; In Canada, a Member is allowed to ask four questions per sitting, three of which can be for oral answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, a Member can ask not more than three questions for oral answer per sitting and in one session (there are three sessions per year) a Member can ask not more than 10 questions for oral answer and five questions for written answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 954<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the practices in other parliaments, the Committee has proposed that a Member may have up to five questions on the Order Paper at any one time and not more than three of these questions shall be for oral answer, which is the present practice.&nbsp; Though the amendment may place a cap on the number of questions for answer, I hasten to assure Members that it is not the intention of the Committee to prevent Members from asking questions.&nbsp; It is the legitimate right and duty of an MP to ask questions in Parliament.&nbsp; Ministries, on their part, welcome them as an opportunity to explain and clarify Government policies or programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there must be a reasonable limit to the number of questions that are filed for answer, as has been done in other parliaments.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the Committee is proposing that we have some restriction on the number of questions asked. Based on Parliament's records, a total of 657 questions for oral and written answers were filed by Members during the last two years.&nbsp; This works out to an average of two questions per Member whose questions appeared on the Order Paper.&nbsp; So the limit of five questions per Member per sitting should not pose a problem for Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment No. 11 inserts an additional rule governing the contents of questions.&nbsp; The purpose of this rule is to ensure that questions are not excessively long and do not range so wide as to detract from its focus.&nbsp; The present practice of allowing multiple parts to a question is unaffected by this rule so long as the question does not cover a plethora of issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In framing their questions, Members should try to be succinct and concise and should exclude preambles, contexts and background information on matters which are already public knowledge.</p><p align=left>Column: 955<p><p><br><I>Motion to debate on a specific matter/Ministerial Statement</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, in all cases, when Parliament wishes to debate on a matter under Standing Order No. 42, the term of the motion is, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"&nbsp; To be more specific on the matter to be debated, Amendment No. 12&nbsp; provides for the subject matter to be expressed in direct terms.&nbsp; For example, if it is intended to allow for debate on a Ministerial Statement such as \"Retuning the CPF\", a motion can be moved \"That the statement on \"Retuning the CPF\" be considered by Parliament.\". Whereas, under the existing provision, the term of the motion will be, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"&nbsp; Incidentally, although Standing Order No. 10 lists \"Ministerial Statements\" as one of the items of business, no substantive provision has been made for it in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; Hence, Amendment No. 3, which is a new amendment,&nbsp; provides for such a provision in the Standing Orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members can continue to ask for clarifications on a Ministerial Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments in Committee of Supply<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last amendment (Amendment No. 13) under this category relates to the debate in the Committee of Supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Standing Order No. 89 provides that Members wishing to move amendments in the Committee of Supply can file their amendments on matters of policy or details, in other words, either&nbsp;a $100 cut or a $10 cut.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, over the past five years, we have found that most of the amendments filed (more than 90%) were on matters of policy rather than on details of implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders Committee has therefore proposed to remove the distinction between $100 and $10 cuts, in other words, on matters of policy and detail, and confine amendments in the Committee of Supply<p align=left>Column: 956<p> to just&nbsp; $100 cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the amendment to Standing Order&nbsp;No. 89 provides for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Amendments to Procedures and Current Practices<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Question Time/conversion of questions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments under the next category \"Amendments to Procedures and Current Practices\" are to formalise the sitting time of Parliament and to make consequential changes to the times of business specified in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; In&nbsp;April 2003, Mr Speaker announced in Parliament that the commencement time of sittings of Parliament would be changed from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm with effect from 25th April 2003.&nbsp; Consequent upon the change of the commencement time, Mr Speaker also revised such other times specified in the Standing Orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;These revisions are now incorporated in the proposed amendments (Amendment Nos. 14(d), (e), 16 and 20). Amendment No. 19 also formalises the extension of Question Time from one hour to one-and-a-half hours as resolved by Parliament on 2nd April 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment No. 18 allows a Member to convert a question for written answer&nbsp;to a question for oral answer, or vice versa.&nbsp; However, the requisite notice period for such a request must be given.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will also be given more time to indicate their intention when they want to postpone or withdraw their questions for oral answer, if they have not been dealt with by the end of Question Time.&nbsp; They can inform the Clerk of their intention at any time prior to the termination of the sitting. Currently, they must do so by the end of Question Time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Introduction of Bills and moving of business motions before Supply business commences<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment No. 36(b) formalises the practice of allowing the introduction of<p align=left>Column: 957<p> Government Bills and business motions to be moved before the business of Supply commences.&nbsp; In such an event, the proceedings on the business of Supply shall be postponed until after the Bill or motion is disposed of.&nbsp; Opportunity is also taken to update certain Standing Orders to reflect the current practice, such as sending and receiving&nbsp; notices by electronic means, as well as to rephrase some Standing Orders to avoid ambiguity.</p><p><br><I>Moment of interruption<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended that the moment of interruption be shifted from 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm since our sittings usually go beyond 6.00 pm; sometimes they go beyond 7.00 pm.&nbsp; However, if Parliament decides to adjourn earlier during the debate in the Committee of Supply or during the debate on the President's Address, a motion can be moved to suspend Standing Orders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>Other Amendments<br></I></B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last group of amendments are mainly drafting amendments to standardise certain terms and update the terminology used in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; Some of the amendments are also consequential&nbsp;amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments proposed would facilitate the conduct of parliamentary business and ensure that Parliament functions more effectively and efficiently.&nbsp; I therefore commend Members to adopt the Report of the Standing Orders Committee.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think Members of the House would probably agree with me when I say that if there is anybody else in this House who is all for making sure that<p align=left>Column: 958<p> our proceedings in this House are done in a very efficient way, that would be me.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree that there is a need to update our Standing Orders in order to keep up with changing needs.&nbsp; While the recommendations of the Report of the Standing Orders Committee appear routine enough, and I would agree with most of the changes, I think there are some areas which, on closer scrutiny, give rise to some discomfort on my part.&nbsp; Sir, one of the objectives of Standing Orders is to ensure that the proceedings of the House are carried out in a smooth and orderly manner.&nbsp; However, nothing must be done to inhibit the rights of Members, particularly those on this side of the House, on the Backbench, in carrying out their tasks of querying, probing and even criticising the Government because that is what we have been elected to do.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It therefore puzzles me as to why the Standing Orders Committee is recommending that there should now be a limitation of five questions that a Member can ask at each sitting.&nbsp; Effectively, this means that if a Member files three questions for oral answer, he is left with only two questions for written answer.&nbsp; Whereas all this time, for many years, there has been no limit on the number of questions for written answer that a Member can file.&nbsp; I ask: has there been a &nbsp;torrent of questions for written answer that the Government has been flooded with that it cannot cope?&nbsp; The record shows that in 2003, and I have a list here,&nbsp;there were just 32 questions which were answered in a written format.&nbsp; And for this year, so far, until the last sitting in September, there were only 49 written answers that were given by the Frontbench.&nbsp; Are these numbers too great for&nbsp;Ministers to handle or, for that matter, for our civil servants to provide the facts and figures that are needed?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Sir, what is a written answer?&nbsp; A written answer is a piece of paper<p align=left>Column: 959<p> containing an answer.&nbsp; It does not consume the time of the House, as it is an answer that is circulated to Members and, today, it is done by electronic means, but it provides a wealth of useful information that Members of the House and the public would like to know and are entitled to know.&nbsp; In fact, it puzzles me that, at the last sitting -&nbsp;and I want to sidetrack a bit - there was a question filed by Mr Chiam See Tong for written answer regarding the recruitment of pilots by Singapore Airlines, and it was an answer which was not&nbsp;dealt with, it was not answered adequately.&nbsp; Mr Chiam had asked &nbsp;for the percentage of pilots who are foreigners and the number of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> pilots whose application to work for SIA had been rejected.&nbsp; Sir, the written reply that we all got was that Mr Chiam should write to SIA for that information because this is a public company.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to differ.&nbsp; The people, through the Government, and, in turn, through Temasek Holdings, own shares in Singapore Airlines.&nbsp; And since the issue of the pilots has in fact been made one of public interest, Mr Chiam's question deserved a proper answer.&nbsp; Sir, it was not the first time that a question on Singapore Airlines had been asked in the House.&nbsp; In fact, there had been numerous questions in the past years, and I think the Speaker correctly should have directed the Minister concerned to give a more adequate answer to the House.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Deputy Leader of the House, earlier on, gave examples of the limitations to such questions - he quoted the examples in the Lok Sabha of India, the Parliaments of Malaysia and Canada - but, I think, he conveniently left out the fact that the Lok Sabha has 545 Members, that the Malaysian Parliament has 193 Members and that the Canadian Parliament has 301 Members.&nbsp; What are we?&nbsp; We are 94 Members and we do not <p align=left>Column: 960<p>sit as often as all these other Parliaments.&nbsp; So why do we want to tell ourselves that we do not have the time, or we do not have the resources to deal with too many questions?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is this obsession with trying to make ourselves too efficient in this House to the extent that&nbsp;our rights to be heard are sacrificed, that worries me.&nbsp; Sir, if these proposals are to go through, it would appear that the Standing Orders Committee or, in fact, the Government is coming across as being too impatient.&nbsp; Even the ringing of the Division Bells has been shortened from two minutes to one minute,&nbsp;without taking into cognisance of the fact that we are now in a much bigger building.&nbsp; And if you happen to be at one end of the building, Sir, try to run to this Chamber to cast your vote within one minute!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will, in future - this is another example of how impatient we can become - face the prospect of not having their Oaths of Allegiance taken individually at this Table but, instead possibly, as the Deputy Leader has said, in groups or as one whole group in a manner to be determined by the Speaker.&nbsp; Yes, Sir, the current Oath-taking procedure is time consuming.&nbsp; But it takes something like 90 or 100 minutes of our time in five years.&nbsp; Is that too much to ask?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for Members of the House, most of us, particularly new Members of the House, the Oath-taking ceremony is a matter of pride.&nbsp; It is a matter of pride to be able to stand here at this Table individually and to take their Oath or Affirmation.&nbsp; And what are we going to have in future, Sir?&nbsp;&nbsp; It reminds me of a big wedding party where the happy families of the bride and bridegroom decide that perhaps it is too much to go round greeting all the guests and everybody then goes on to the stage, shout three <i>yam sengs</i> and then the job has been done.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 961<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while on one hand, the Committee is concerned that the time of the House be more efficiently spent, it appears to me very strange that it proposes that in debate in the Committee of Supply - and this, I think, was left out in the speech by the Deputy Leader -&nbsp;a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary would now be entitled to speak without any time limit.&nbsp; With due respect to some of the Ministers, we all know that they have a lot to say.&nbsp; But, sometimes, we also know that their answers can be rather long and winding ones, even irrelevant.&nbsp; But surely, it is stretching the patience of those of us on this side of the House to understand from this recommendation that the Frontbench would now be given <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">carte blanche</i> as far as time is concerned in the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; How does this contribute to the efficiency of debates in the <st1:place>COS</st1:place>?&nbsp; What about the Backbenchers?&nbsp; Already, in recent years, the time given to MPs to raise their topics has been curtailed.&nbsp; In this year's debate, MPs were given something like two minutes to make their speeches.&nbsp; As anyone, and surely the Ministers, would know, these two minutes would hardly be enough for one to make a proper speech.&nbsp;In many instances, there is just about enough time to make an introduction to what you are going to say.&nbsp; So where is the fairness in this?&nbsp; So why is the House now asked to give unlimited time to the Frontbench whereas nothing is being said in this Report about the inadequate time given to Backbenchers?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have now one last point to raise and which I feel that the Standing Orders Committee has overlooked in its review of the Standing Orders.&nbsp; Sir, this concerns the issue of Members who address the House by video.&nbsp; Last year, during the midst of the fight against SARS, we had&nbsp;four Members addressing us from another room in Parliament - Dr Balaji, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Dr Ng Eng Hen and Mr Khaw Boon Wan - and another Member,<p align=left>Column: 962<p> Dr Tan Cheng Bock, addressed us from his home through a video link.&nbsp; These Members were not physically present in the Chamber.&nbsp; But <i>Hansard</i> records them as being present in the House.&nbsp; I raise this as an important matter because one never knows that this might happen again in future.&nbsp; And the question I want to pose is this.&nbsp; Is the Member who is not physically present in the House but speaks to the House via a video link really present in the House?&nbsp; This is significant &nbsp;when you need to&nbsp;take an important vote.&nbsp; If he is deemed to be present, can he then be allowed to cast a vote via video?&nbsp; I highlight this because, some day in the future, this may have deep repercussions for us.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to bring the House back to that crucial day in July 1961, to be exact, 21st of July 1961.&nbsp; The Government tabled a motion in this House, a motion for the House to express confidence in it.&nbsp; If that motion had fallen, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> would have been in a chaotic situation and the history of&nbsp;the country might have been different.&nbsp; What happened on that day was that the Government had to arrange for a Member of the then Legislative Assembly, a Mdm Sahorah bte Ahmat, who was in hospital, to be carried by ambulance to the old Parliament building.&nbsp; She was brought up in a stretcher to the second level where she had to rest in her room and after a few minutes, she had to be helped into the Chamber to cast that important vote.&nbsp; As it turned out, the Government won the day, but it was by a very narrow margin.&nbsp; In a House of 51 Members, the Government obtained 27 votes, as opposed to the 24 Members who either voted against the motion of confidence or who abstained.&nbsp; So the Government won the day.&nbsp; And it was very clear then that a Member had to be physically present in the House.&nbsp; Imagine if we have a similar situation some day down the road, can the Member who cannot be around to cast a crucial vote,<p align=left>Column: 963<p> one that might perhaps also determine the survival of the government of the day, claim his right to do so&nbsp;via video, because the&nbsp;precedent had already been&nbsp;set last year that physical presence is not necessary for your attendance in the House to be recorded?&nbsp; Sir, I therefore would like to urge the Standing Orders&nbsp;Committee to address this very important issue.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 37.4pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I am all for making changes to keep up with changing circumstances.&nbsp; But I must say that I am very disturbed if the changes do not make the playing field more level for both sides of the House and, particularly, if they are being made under the guise of making the House more efficient.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support what the hon. former Speaker, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, has said.&nbsp; If&nbsp;a former Speaker who is&nbsp;also a member of the PAP can feel that this is not a fair or level playing field, how would the Opposition feel?&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why the hon. Member, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, was not appointed as a member of the Standing Orders Committee.&nbsp; I looked through the list of members.&nbsp; Besides the Chairman of the Committee, there are five Ministers.&nbsp; So, I suppose the outcome of the report, as what Mr Tan said, is tilted towards or is in favour of the Frontbench, which&nbsp;is not a surprise to me.&nbsp; Although the amendment in respect of&nbsp;the number of questions allowed may not seem&nbsp;too much of an issue to me, I do agree with Mr Tan's comment as to&nbsp;what&nbsp;the justification is and why&nbsp;there&nbsp;is a real need to limit the number of questions for written answer which could be sought for public knowledge and information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also share the same feelings of Mr Tan that some questions which are <p align=left>Column: 964<p>legitimate questions, whether written or oral, being&nbsp;asked as supplementary oral questions, were not allowed to proceed by the Speaker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder why the Ministers and the Ministers of State should be given such leeway in the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; Yes, we want the answer.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;I think, to be fair to Members who wish&nbsp;to raise certain issues, sufficient time must be given.&nbsp; All this while, when Mr Tan Soo Khoon was the Speaker,&nbsp;he had exercised very good time control, in which he allowed some debates in the House which, I think, made the Committee of Supply sittings more interesting.&nbsp; But with the amendment, I&nbsp;foresee that most of the time it would be the Ministers and the Ministers of State answering, and Backbench Members,&nbsp;especially the Opposition, would be left with very little time in terms of counter queries, clarifications, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government is very obsessed with efficiency and time management.&nbsp; Time and efficiency are&nbsp;important, but I think it is also equally important that Parliament should be allowed to play its role and Members are allowed to have sufficient time to ask questions and have at least a greater chance to say their piece, rather than the Ministers and the Frontbench saying their piece all the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;urge the Standing Orders Committee Members&nbsp;to look into these concerns and share our feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, maybe&nbsp;just myself and Mr Tan have the same feeling.&nbsp; As for the&nbsp;PAP Backbenchers, is this&nbsp;not a concern to them?&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I have said my piece.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have always listened to Mr Tan Soon Khoon's speeches in Parliament with great interest and a lot of respect for several reasons, which I think Mr Low Thia Khiang has mentioned.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 965<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, as a former Speaker of Parliament, he speaks with great authority and he has a very deep knowledge of the subject, particularly Standing Orders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two,&nbsp;as a very senior Member of this House, he has a great store of knowledge, wisdom and experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, his speeches have always been hard-hitting and to the point.&nbsp; Sometimes, I may not agree with it, but I think every Member in Parliament has a right to say what he or she feels.&nbsp; In that regard, being a senior Member not just of this House but also&nbsp;a former Speaker of Parliament, he must know that it is not the intention of the Government or of Parliament to restrict the Members' right to speak.&nbsp; Indeed, I think he has himself on many occasions had had to stop Members from speaking.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because there&nbsp;are certain rules that are in place in Parliament.&nbsp; This is not a free-for-all.&nbsp; This is not the coliseum, a Roman arena where people&nbsp;do whatever they like.&nbsp; There are rules in Parliament, and this is what Standing Orders is all about.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the question before this House is:&nbsp; what kind of rules do we put in place to make sure not just that there is fairness,&nbsp;efficiency and equity, but that&nbsp;everybody has a chance to say what he or she feels,&nbsp;Members of the Government as well as Members of the Opposition, and Members of the Frontbench and Backbenchers?&nbsp; This is a very basic tenet of parliamentary democracy.&nbsp; Surely, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, and Mr Low Thia Khiang who has also agreed with Mr Tan, must know that we in Parliament have never faced any sense that we are not allowed to speak.&nbsp; And I have made this point very clear in my speech also.&nbsp; As I said, I hasten to assure Members that it is not the intention of the Committee to prevent Members from asking questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what was a fairly simple exercise in trying to update the rules of Parliament, <p align=left>Column: 966<p>to update the Standing Orders to bring it in line with what other parliaments and jurisdictions are doing, has been viewed with much suspicion.&nbsp; All I can say to Mr Tan and Mr Low is that there is no such intention.&nbsp; We are not doing something that is beyond the curve.&nbsp; We are not doing something extraordinary.&nbsp; We are doing something which other reputable parliaments are also practising.&nbsp; I mentioned a few of them.&nbsp; I did not mention many others as well.&nbsp; Mauritius has a limit.&nbsp; Trinidad and Tobago have a limit but, if I use those examples, I guess comments will be made as to whether we should be comparing ourselves with those parliaments, but they are respectable parliaments too.&nbsp; However, I thought it only sufficed if I mentioned Malaysia, Canada and India, because these are parliaments which we are familiar with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;first of all, should we have a limit?&nbsp; Is it wrong to have a limit?&nbsp; We already have a limit for oral questions.&nbsp; There is nothing unusual about that.&nbsp; Now we are saying, \"Let us have a maximum for total number of questions, including written ones.\"&nbsp; Is that unreasonable?&nbsp; Other parliaments do it, why not us?&nbsp; Why are they doing it?&nbsp; It must be for the same reason that we are trying to do this, ie,&nbsp;to make sure that there is no situation that one day perhaps somebody will come along and say, \"Look, here are 1,000 questions for written answer\", or&nbsp;somebody&nbsp;putting&nbsp;on the Internet and saying, \"Look, anybody who has any questions, please submit them to me and I will file them in Parliament next week.\"&nbsp; Surely this is not something that we want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the question is:&nbsp; if it is not unreasonable to have a limit, then what is the limit?&nbsp;Again, here I must admit that the Committee has been rather arbitrary.&nbsp; Why five?&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the other parliaments, India has five in total, ie, one oral, four written.&nbsp; Yes, India has many,<p align=left>Column: 967<p> many more Members than us.&nbsp; Canada has four in total, ie, three oral, one written.&nbsp; Malaysia has three oral questions&nbsp;but, in a session, they can have 10 and five, which means if we compare it per session, it will probably be three oral and two written, ie, five in total.&nbsp; So, we decided a reasonable figure, more than some&nbsp;of the others perhaps, but just about the same ballpark, let us keep the limit at five, but let us keep the oral questions at three and the written ones at two.&nbsp; Is this onerous?&nbsp; So, we went back to the records and we checked.&nbsp; We looked at what Members had asked over the last two years and we discovered that each Member, on the average, asked two questions per sitting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, are Members being gagged as a result of this new rule?&nbsp; Have they been gagged in the past?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; And, as Mr Tan himself mentioned, over the last few years, Members have not really been asking that many questions, so why the rule?&nbsp; As I have explained, this is in order to make sure that we do not have a runaway situation in future.&nbsp; And the total number of questions that are asked is, by the way, per sitting.&nbsp; In other words, if we have two sitting days, it is actually double that figure.&nbsp; So, I think that&nbsp;Members would be reassured that there is more than sufficient room for questions to be asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about questions that have been asked but have not been answered?&nbsp; This is really left to the prerogative of the Speaker to answer and I will not comment on that.&nbsp; But suffice it to say that I am aware that there are rules and guidelines as to what questions can and cannot be asked.&nbsp; Whether it is Erskine May or Standing Orders, there are, again, certain rules in place, and I think Mr Tan himself is aware of those rules.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 968<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, as to the accusation that we are over-zealous in making Parliament too efficient, that we are sacrificing Members'&nbsp;rights, here I must confess that I am all for making sure that we do not go overboard,&nbsp;that&nbsp;in trying to make Parliament extremely efficient&nbsp;we forget about some of the practices or rituals of Parliament.&nbsp; I think we should keep the rituals of Parliament as far as possible.&nbsp; It is important for us to maintain the dignity of Parliament.&nbsp; But it does not necessarily mean that in doing so we do not change anything, that we maintain the status quo.&nbsp; We have actually made changes.&nbsp; In fact, some of the changes were made when Mr Tan was the Speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember very clearly that, in the past, when we took divisions, we had to go around, the Clerk would call each name, and then there would be a vote taken.&nbsp; Subsequently, one day, we had an electronic system whereby, instead of having your name called one by one, you pressed the button and you indicated your vote and your vote appeared on the scoreboard.&nbsp; Does that demean Parliament?&nbsp; I do not think so.&nbsp; It is just a more efficient way of doing things, making use of technology that is available.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is probably jumping the gun, if I give Mr Tan the benefit of the doubt in saying that.&nbsp; There is really no cause for alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not seeking to make Parliament so efficient and so technical and mechanical that it loses its meaning.&nbsp; So, why do we make changes?&nbsp; Why are the Standing Orders changed, for example, to allow Oaths of Allegiance to be taken from his place?&nbsp; It may happen one day that, in certain circumstances, you may want to do something like that.&nbsp; It may well be that, at some stage in future, Members, whether it is Nominated Members or any other Members,&nbsp;may want to do that.&nbsp; We are making provisions for a possibility some time down the road.&nbsp; But it does not follow <p align=left>Column: 969<p>that such changes in the Standing Orders automatically imply that there will be consequential changes made without reference to the dignity of Parliament.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lifting the restriction on the time that Ministers can speak, it has always been the practice that the Frontbenchers will get more time to speak because, presumably, the House wants to hear what they say.&nbsp; Whether it is in the Committee of Supply or whether it is in a debate, Frontbenchers should have more time to speak in order to allow them to elaborate on policies, to respond to suggestions or to rebut certain allegations.&nbsp; Again, this is not something that is uncommon for our Parliament.&nbsp; It is something that all parliaments practise.&nbsp; I agree with Members that this should not be at the expense of the Members' right or ability to say what they want to say.&nbsp; Here, I want to assure Mr Low.&nbsp; In fact, at the end of Mr Low's speech just now, he said, \"I have said my piece\", and he sat down.&nbsp; Basically, he has said what he wanted to say and he made his point and he sat down.&nbsp; He has done so many, many times in this Parliament.&nbsp; Nobody has stopped him.&nbsp; If he has been stopped or guillotined, it is the same guillotine that has been exercised on PAP Members.&nbsp; He has not been treated any differently. So again, I do not see where, how or when Members feel their rights to speak have been curtailed.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the point that Mr Tan brought up about whether a Member who addresses this House by video is deemed to be present in the House.&nbsp; I think this is a good point that the Standing Orders<p align=left>Column: 970<p> Committee has not addressed.&nbsp; This is a point that we should address because, as he has explained, on that historic occasion in 1961, it was literally a matter of life and death for the Government.&nbsp; Therefore, we should look at it.&nbsp; I will recommend to the Committee that we look at this, and at an opportune time, address this question fully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I come back to the same point that this was an exercise in trying to update the rules and the Standing Orders, take the opportunity, even if we do not need to do anything at the moment, update the rules so that they are in keeping with the times and that they will allow us to be a more efficient and a more effective House.<br></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would commend to Members that we adopt the Report of the Standing Orders Committee.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this Parliament resolves that the amendments set out in Appendix I to the Report of the Standing Orders Committee as contained in Paper Parl. 6 of 2004 be and are hereby made to the Standing Orders of Parliament.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 970<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ADJOURNMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Four</p><p align=\"right\">Minutes past Eight o'clock pm</p><p align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM--><p align=left>Column: 971<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SYNTHETIC DRUGS--><p align=left>Column: 971<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SYNTHETIC DRUGS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Indranee Rajah </B>asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what steps are being taken to combat the perception among young Singaporeans that synthetic drugs are merely \"recreational drugs\" and therefore harmless and non-addictive; and (b) whether there is a rehabilitation programme for users of synthetic drugs.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike those who abuse traditional drugs such as heroin, synthetic drug abusers often do not experience severe physical withdrawal symptoms. This, coupled with the fact that synthetic drugs are often abused at nightspots and rave parties, has led to the perception that synthetic drugs are harmless, non-addictive and can be used as a form of recreation.&nbsp; Therefore, synthetic drug abusers, especially the young and impressionable, think that taking synthetic drugs is not really harmful, but is hip and cool.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;</p><p tab-stops:=\"\" text-align:=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) is aware of this.&nbsp; Thus, CNB has organised many preventive drug education (PDE) activities targeting youths to highlight the danger of taking synthetic drugs.

These include an animated video titled \"The Way Out\" which highlights the dangers of synthetic drugs such as ketamine, 'Ice' and 'Ecstasy'; a \"Treading on Ice\" video which describes the pain and suffering of three ex-'Ice' abusers caused to themselves and their loved ones, and a docu-drama entitled \"Temptations\" where local icons such as Zoe Tay and Stephanie Sun put across strong anti-drug messages.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these measures have borne fruit.&nbsp; The number of synthetic drug abusers arrested dropped from 564 in the first half of last year to 314 in the first half of this year.&nbsp; In particular, the number of young synthetic drug abusers arrested, ie, those below 20 years, declined sharply from 95 to 48. &nbsp;CNB will continue to focus its PDE programmes on synthetic drugs to ensure that these drugs do not gain a foothold in Singapore, especially among our youths.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText3\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText3\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convicted synthetic drug abusers are currently sentenced to imprisonment in penal institutions and do not benefit from the rehabilitative programmes that opiate abusers undergo at the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRC).&nbsp; We have reviewed this and will be introducing a DRC regime for synthetic drug abusers in lieu of imprisonment by this year. This will offer them a more focused rehabilitation programme which will minimise the chances of them going back to drugs. In addition, the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders (CARE) Network will continue to provide aftercare support services for these abusers after their discharge.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SEXUAL OFFENCES--><p align=left>Column: 973<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SEXUAL OFFENCES</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam </B>asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will (a) give an update on the review of the laws governing sexual offences;&nbsp; (b) provide the figures for sexual offences against children aged 15 and below for 2003 and 2004;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (c) state the possibility of reviewing charges and laws to include paedophilia offences.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had previously informed this House that MHA has convened a multi-agency committee to review sexual offences currently prescribed in the Penal Code, Women's Charter and the Children and Young Persons Act.&nbsp; This review, which is part of a larger review of the Penal Code, is in its final stages.

This programme is open to officers who are five years from retirement.&nbsp; Under the programme, officers are put through different phases of preparation, ranging from mental and psychological readiness to training in generic areas such as health and financial management, as well as specific skills such as job interview techniques.&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt;

That is why MHA adopts a lifelong learning approach to ensure that all its officers, including those in the Police Force, continually upgrade their<p align=left>Column: 975<p> skills and remain relevant to the workforce.&nbsp; This continuous learning framework starts from the day officers first join the Ministry.&nbsp; In this vein, apart from police skills, Police officers learn general skills such as computing skills, dealing with finance, writing, supervisory skills, customer service, organisational effectiveness and leadership.&nbsp; This approach to life-long learning provides a strong foundation for the pre-retirement preparation activities.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt;

We are concerned when families are unable to afford their power as it is a basic need.&nbsp; However, most of these homes were 4-room HDB flats or larger.&nbsp; Some of the homes were condominiums or landed property.&nbsp; In addition, most <p align=left>Column: 977<p>of these families could make some payment and would get their power restored in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the families would approach SP Services with some payment to reconnect their supply within two weeks of supply disconnection.&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the economy improves over the next few years, we expect the number of homes with utilities arrears to decrease.&nbsp; For example, between August 2003 when the recession was at its height, and August 2004, the number of new accounts in arrears (ie, those families defaulting on their bills for the first time) has halved.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, there are some families who may have financial difficulties in paying their power bills. They would therefore accumulate arrears.&nbsp; For these families, SP Services will first work with them to better understand their difficulties and develop a suitable instalment plan to clear up their arrears.&nbsp; We would like to assure Mr Chia that the power supply for these families will not be terminated simply because they have chalked up arrears.&nbsp; Families will be given ample opportunities to sort out their utilities financing, including paying their arrears through instalments.&nbsp; Before any disconnection of supply, SP Services will send at least two reminders and a final notice of intended disconnection to the home within eight weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; SP Services would only terminate the power as a last resort.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Community Development Councils (CDCs), the Government also assists families who are in financial hardship to offset their utilities expenses. Needy families living in HDB rental housing may apply for the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS), whilst those living in purchased flats may apply for the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS). Depending on the family's circumstances, we may grant utilities assistance of up to $90 a month. In addition, Citizens Consultative Committees (CCCs) also offer local schemes to assist families who need help with their utilities bills.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 67.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 67.5pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP Services will be rolling out a pre-paid meter scheme from May 2005.&nbsp; This scheme will be available to families residing in HDB flats whose electricity supply has been disconnected due to payment default.

The current enhanced funding rate of 90% of course fees subject to $10 per trainee-hour will be adjusted to the pre off-budget rates of 80% of course fees subject to $8 per trainee-hour for workers aged below 40 years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt;

WDA has therefore adjusted the funding rate from 100% subject to $20 per trainee-hour to 90% of course fees subject to $16 per trainee-hour.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt;

WDA will conduct on-going reviews of the funding rates to ensure that they provide the appropriate level of incentives for employers to train their workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp; However good employers should see it in the interests of their companies and workers to support continual training of their workforce, and not train their workers only because there are high levels of funding support.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
