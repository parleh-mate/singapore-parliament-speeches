It would, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be easy for me to snap my fingers  at  my\r\n\r\nown election pledges. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvoters  can  do nothing, at least until  the  next\r\n\r\nelection.  Of course, a lot of things  can  happen\r\n\r\nbefore  the  next election comes,  but  I  am  old\r\n\r\nfashioned enough to believe that election  pledges\r\n\r\nare  solemn  undertakings which must be discharged\r\n\r\nto  the  best  of one's ability. If,  having  been\r\n\r\nelected, I find that it is necessary to change  my\r\n\r\nelection  promises, then the only  honourable  and\r\n\r\ndecent  thing to do is to go back to  my  electors\r\n\r\nand  seek  a  new mandate. I would do  this,  Sir,\r\n\r\nrather  than  try and explain away those  flagrant\r\n\r\nbreaches  of  promises  as  honourable   acts   of\r\n\r\npatriotism.  This  motion  before  the  House   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  challenge to all elected Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwhether they intend to stand by their own election\r\n\r\npledges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there may be a move on the part\r\n\r\nof  some  Members  to  amend this  motion.  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  such a move. The motion as  it  stands\r\n\r\ncan  be  an uncomfortable reminder of those  happy\r\n\r\ndays  when  we made clear to every voter  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  anti-colonial fighters pure and simple.  Our\r\n\r\nelection manifestoes and our election speeches are\r\n\r\nthere to prove what our sentiments were like  then.\r\n\r\nIt  may be thought that by amending this motion  it\r\n\r\nmay  be possible to conceal those noble sentiments\r\n\r\nwhich have become embarrassing to some Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, but however much this motion  may  be\r\n\r\namended, our election manifestoes and our election\r\n\r\nspeeches confront us. However much we may twist and\r\n\r\nturn  the  people, remember that  we  went  before\r\n\r\nthem; we were pledged to fight for freedom against\r\n\r\nthose  who  had  deprived us  of  it.  During  the\r\n\r\nelection we made it quite clear to the people that\r\n\r\nwe  had  to fight the British to get it. I do  not\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  any Assemblyman  saying  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  necessary to fight subversive elements,\r\n\r\nand  yet  two successive sessions of this Assembly\r\n\r\nhave been devoted to getting this House to approve\r\n\r\nthe  arbitrary  dissolution of  organisations  and\r\n\r\narrest  of  individuals.  One  can  see  how   the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  this Assembly has  changed  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the last few months. Until  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's unexplained visit to London early  this\r\n\r\nyear, the fight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  merdeka was a straightforward one between the\r\n\r\npeople of this country and the colonial power. The\r\n\r\nmajority of speeches made in this House made  this\r\n\r\nclear.  The  battle was with the Colonial  Office.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis was one of a united front of all anti-colonial  parties  and organisations  against  the\r\n\r\nforces of colonialism. Now it is a question of the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office, the colonial officials  and  so-called  nationalists in the Labour  Front  joining\r\n\r\ntogether  to  fight  against so-called  subversive\r\n\r\nelements  of  the  local  population  to   achieve\r\n\r\nmerdeka.  But  who  are and  what  are  subversive\r\n\r\nelements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ask yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> What constitutes\r\n\r\nsubversion? Is militant trade unionism subversion?\r\n\r\nAre systematic and constitutional efforts to bring\r\n\r\nabout  the  downfall of colonialism and the  local\r\n\r\ngroups   associated   with   it   subversion?   Is\r\n\r\nconstitutional  action,  however  embarrassing  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the colonial powers,  subversion?\r\n\r\nThe  Government has given no clear indication what\r\n\r\nit  means  by  subversive elements.  Sometimes  it\r\n\r\nclaims   that   it  is  proceeding  only   against\r\n\r\nCommunists and Communist-front organisations,  and\r\n\r\nsince  the  Malayan Communist Party  is  in  armed\r\n\r\nrevolt   against   constituted   authority,    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's anti-subversion campaign is  directed\r\n\r\nagainst those connected with the M.C.P. If this is\r\n\r\nthe  case, then it is important for the Government\r\n\r\nto  give  proof that this anti-subversion  is  not\r\n\r\ndirected against the nationalists dedicated to the\r\n\r\noverthrow of colonialism by constitutional  means.\r\n\r\nThis  the  Government  can do  by  bringing  those\r\n\r\narrested  for  subversion  to  trial  and  proving\r\n\r\nconclusively   that   they   were   involved    in\r\n\r\nunconstitutional and illegal acts. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  claimed  that  it  has documentary  evidence,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  convinced it that those arrested  were\r\n\r\nsubversive.  If  that evidence  is  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nconvince the Government, it should be good  enough\r\n\r\nfor  the courts also. It has been the proud  boast\r\n\r\nof   democracy   that,  unlike  the   totalitarian\r\n\r\ncountries, a man is imprisoned only when proved to\r\n\r\nbe  guilty  of  a specific crime.  It  is  no  use\r\n\r\npraising democracy as a superior way of life  when\r\n\r\nit, too, finds it necessary to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings  that the Communists are accused of  doing.\r\n\r\nAt  least the Communists often bring those charged\r\n\r\nwith subversion to public trial. If Government has\r\n\r\nproof  that  those arrested are guilty of  illegal\r\n\r\nacts, let this proof be tested in a court of  law.\r\n\r\nIt  is necessary for the Government to do this  if\r\n\r\nonly  to quell doubts that these arbitrary arrests\r\n\r\nare  a  prelude  to the crushing of constitutional\r\n\r\nnationalist and trade union activities. It is  not\r\n\r\nenough  for  Government  to  claim  that   it   is\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the proof it has. The Government is\r\n\r\nnot   an   impartial   judge   in   this   matter,\r\n\r\nparticularly  as these arrests have been  directed\r\n\r\nagainst organisations and individuals who are  not\r\n\r\nfriendly  to  Government.  Certainly  the   recent\r\n\r\narrests  have  been taken by certain employers  to\r\n\r\nmean  that  these are not directed solely  against\r\n\r\nviolent Communist subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am free, I assume that Government is not\r\n\r\nof  the view that I am a subversive character, but\r\n\r\nthe  authorities of the Naval Base,  Sir,  take  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  view. I and the legal  adviser  to  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base Labour Union (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  were\r\n\r\ncertainly   treated  as  undesirable   characters.\r\n\r\nThough   elected  by  the  voters   of   Sembawang\r\n\r\nConstituency, I was denied entry to the Naval Base\r\n\r\narea.  I  must assume that responsible and  fairly\r\n\r\nintelligent men run the Naval Base area.  If  they\r\n\r\ncan  construe the Government's action to mean that\r\n\r\neven  those  not  arrested by the  Government  are\r\n\r\nsubversive characters, how much more so  will  the\r\n\r\nother  employers not as enlightened as  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase  authorities? They look upon the clean-up  as\r\n\r\nencouragement to carry on a clean-up of their own.\r\n\r\nIf  an  elected Assemblyman like me can be treated\r\n\r\nin  this high-handed manner, what is the treatment\r\n\r\nmeted  out  to thousands of simple trade unionists\r\n\r\nand anti-colonialists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Even the Trades Union Congress thought  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to warn employers not to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  recent disturbances. Some employers  have\r\n\r\nalready  begun  their  own  purge  of  what   they\r\n\r\nconsider   are  undesirable  elements.   This   is\r\n\r\ninevitable.

The  best\r\n\r\nway  of  doing this is to bring those  accused  of\r\n\r\nsubversion  before the courts and  either  convict\r\n\r\nthem  for their acts or free them unconditionally.\r\n\r\nOtherwise   the   Government   must   take    full\r\n\r\nresponsibility for all the consequences  of  their\r\n\r\nactions, including the ruthless break-up of  trade\r\n\r\nunions  by employers and the persecution of  anti-\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.16 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe substantive motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar. The amendment I propose\r\n\r\nto  move is by deleting the word \"deplores\" in the\r\n\r\nfirst  line of the motion and substituting  therefor  the  word \"supports\" and by deleting all  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"against persons and organisations  without\r\n\r\nproducing any evidence to justify its action\", and\r\n\r\nsubstituting a full stop at the end  of  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Ordinance\" in the third line.

The Member for Bukit Timah,\r\n\r\nas   pointed  out  by  the  Chief  Minister,  made\r\n\r\ninflammatory  speeches at the  Beauty  World,  and\r\n\r\nsoon  after  the  meeting, those who  attended  it\r\n\r\ndrifted  along  to  the High School  vicinity  and\r\n\r\nalmost at an instant jeered at the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant to note that the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah at that meeting said that instead  of\r\n\r\nshouting  \"Merdeka\" the people should  now  shout,\r\n\r\n\"Pah  Mata\",  which means \"Beat  the  Police\".

May I remind him\r\n\r\nthat among those arrested were his friends - Messrs.\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair  and Puthucheary and two  other  Malay\r\n\r\ngentlemen.  Surely those people are  not  Chinese-speaking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> That was the last stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Now let me turn, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to the question of the expulsion of the  142\r\n\r\npupils which caused a lot of misunderstanding  and\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation. It would be interesting to note\r\n\r\nthat  among  those  142 pupils  there  were  young\r\n\r\nadults  ranging from the age of 21 to 25 and  that\r\n\r\nnone  of  them  were under 15 years old.  Even  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  this  fact and in  order  not  to  deny\r\n\r\neducation to those who genuinely seek it,  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  the  undertaking  that  if  those  expelled\r\n\r\nstudents  would apply personally to me with  their\r\n\r\nguardians,   I   would   consider   their    cases\r\n\r\nindividually and that there might be a possibility\r\n\r\nof  providing  them with education by  segregation\r\n\r\nfrom other pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also touched on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of mass signature campaigns. My reliable\r\n\r\ninformation  on this subject is that young  pupils\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  use of in forcing  ignorant  and\r\n\r\nilliterate people to sign. The lies that were used\r\n\r\nwere that if 200,000 signatures could be obtained,\r\n\r\nall  those  arrested would be  released  and  that\r\n\r\nthere would be a guarantee for non-Singapore  born\r\n\r\naliens  to  be immune from banishment.

The Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nattempted   to  draw  a  parallel  between   those\r\n\r\nstudents  and  our students, but he  forgets  that\r\n\r\nthose students in Hungary are University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  and  not pupils of middle  schools.  The\r\n\r\nword  \"student\" in Singapore has assumed a meaning\r\n\r\nindicating  anyone  from  a  toddler  attending  a\r\n\r\nkindergarten  to one doing post-graduate  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  University. The pupils in the middle  schools\r\n\r\nare still children and it is their primary duty to\r\n\r\nfinish their studies before they take part in  any\r\n\r\nadult activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the attention of the House and the\r\n\r\npublic  to  a very glaring fact among the  Chinese\r\n\r\nmiddle school students. A Communist flag was found\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese High School. Does the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar suggest that the Government  should\r\n\r\nsit tight and watch these children wave the Hammer\r\n\r\nand  Sickle  in  front of our eyes and do  nothing\r\n\r\nabout  it?  As  soon  as the sit-down  strike  was\r\n\r\norganised  in  the two schools, the  Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool and the Chung Cheng High School, a student,\r\n\r\nin a fiery speech, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our strength being invincible, should the Police\r\n\r\ntake  any  action  against us we would  unite  our\r\n\r\nstrength to go against the police batons and  guns\r\n\r\nto the last drop of our blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Another student said:\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Arm ourselves in time of necessity when facing\r\n\r\nanother struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  there any difference between workers who armed\r\n\r\nthemselves  with bottles, stones,  iron  bars  and\r\n\r\nacid  in  the  riots and the pupils who  vowed  to\r\n\r\nbattle the Police with their blood?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday a body of pupils distributed a circular\r\n\r\nto  all pupils and parents. They styled themselves\r\n\r\nas  \"The  Entire  Body of Fellow-Students  of  the\r\n\r\nChung  Cheng  and  Chinese  High  Schools\".   This\r\n\r\n\"entire body\" forgets that there are 2,513  pupils\r\n\r\nwho refuse to follow their steps and who refuse to\r\n\r\njoin  themselves with this unworthy  lot.  I  will\r\n\r\nquote passages from this circular:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have broken camp or dissolved our assembly in\r\n\r\nthe  schools according to plan. This does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  are afraid of criminal force or that  it\r\n\r\ntantamounts  to failure. Our planned dispersal  or\r\n\r\nbreak  camp is mainly for the sake of achieving  a\r\n\r\nmore   effective  form  of  safeguarding   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and of striving for the interests of the\r\n\r\nteachers  and students of the Chinese schools.

They presume that what they have been doing\r\n\r\nis  right  and that they are above the  law.  This\r\n\r\ndocument shows the arrogance on the part of  these\r\n\r\nchildren - children  who are  conceited,  who  think\r\n\r\nthey are infallible, who think that they can go on\r\n\r\nflouting  the  authority of their  parents,  their\r\n\r\nteachers  and  the Government.

And\r\n\r\nthat  issue  is - Can this Government obtain  a  new\r\n\r\nconstitution  that will end colonial  rule?  I  am\r\n\r\nconscious, Sir, that that is the only key question\r\n\r\nfor   any   decent  citizen;  and  the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nquestions of the basis of the new constitution and\r\n\r\nthe  date. Operation Merdeka is the only operation\r\n\r\nof  significance to everyone of us, and looking at\r\n\r\nthat  issue, we must recognise that in these  five\r\n\r\nmonths  during which the Government  has  been  in\r\n\r\noffice, the Chief Minister has gained not only the\r\n\r\nconfidence of large sections of the population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  including those who were  timid  about\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  but  what is of far more importance,  he\r\n\r\nhas  gained the absolute confidence and  trust  of\r\n\r\nBritish  military and commercial interests.  Early\r\n\r\nlast  year I recognised that it was vital to  gain\r\n\r\nthat  confidence in order to achieve  Merdeka  for\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I  tried desperately  to  gain  that\r\n\r\nconfidence  by sweet reasonableness and ultimately\r\n\r\nby  shock tactics. I failed. In five short  months\r\n\r\nthe   Chief   Minister   has   succeeded   to   an\r\n\r\nextraordinary   extent.  I   personally   am   now\r\n\r\nconvinced that the Chief Minister is the only  man\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  has in today's circumstances  who\r\n\r\ncan  bring  us  Merdeka in the  shortest  possible\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Down with the personality cult!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I seem to hear the voice of\r\n\r\nKhrushchev!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, Mao too. Sir, it may be\r\n\r\nthought that I am now playing the role of a  loyal\r\n\r\nstooge,  but I would like to say this:  I  entered\r\n\r\npolitics  because I passionately believed  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process, the process of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and freedom for the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nas  essential  for their healthy  growth;  and  in\r\n\r\norder  to attract their faith and their confidence\r\n\r\nin  that  process, I have at all times  sought  to\r\n\r\ntell them only the truth. I have never lied to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, whatever the difficulties and\r\n\r\nthe  pressures; and whatever the difficulties  and\r\n\r\nthe  pressures today, Sir, or tomorrow, I will not\r\n\r\nlie  to  them.  Therefore, Sir,  let  me  repeat - I\r\n\r\nbelieve the Chief Minister is the best man we have\r\n\r\ntoday  to  bring  home a decent  constitution  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  within the shortest possible  time.  It\r\n\r\ntherefore follows that any act which weakens  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  weakens our drive for Merdeka;  and  a\r\n\r\ncensure  of  this Government or the fall  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  would mean the indefinite postponement\r\n\r\nof stability and peace and freedom. The Government\r\n\r\nis in a unique position, Sir, that whether it does\r\n\r\nright or whether it does wrong, the decent citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore who wants freedom from colonial rule\r\n\r\nmust give it all the strength and support he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very heartening yesterday to hear the\r\n\r\nChief Minister declare that he is aiming for a new\r\n\r\nconstitution and full and free elections not later\r\n\r\nthan  August  next. A concrete statement  of  that\r\n\r\ncharacter  goes a long way to dispel  such  doubts\r\n\r\nand  anxieties as may have been building up. I  am\r\n\r\nonly  sorry that the Chief Minister has  not  been\r\n\r\nable   to   give  us  a  definite  date  for   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks. From what he said, I  gather\r\n\r\nthat  he  is ready but the Secretary of State  for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies is not and he is trying to  push  it\r\n\r\noff.  That  is understandable. The Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas indicated that he is going to London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  mid-December  to discuss the agenda  with  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State  for the Colonies.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister was with me last December in London\r\n\r\nand  he knows that the fixing of the agenda  is  a\r\n\r\nwholly minor matter which we freely admitted could\r\n\r\nhave  been  done by letter. There were then  other\r\n\r\nmatters  to  be attended to. I would urge  him  to\r\n\r\nconsider  fixing the agenda by cable and utilising\r\n\r\nthe  dates he has with the Secretary of State  for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies  in December for full constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks.  He knows the feelings of the Labour  Front\r\n\r\non  the subject. I add the voice of the people  of\r\n\r\nCairnhill   in   this   plea   that   he    pursue\r\n\r\nenergetically the matter of an early date for  the\r\n\r\ntalks.  The  psychological moment in  London  for\r\n\r\nthese talks is, I believe, soon. An early date for\r\n\r\nthe constitutional talks, Sir, would also help  to\r\n\r\nrestore  the morale and confidence of some  decent\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  who  have  been   gravely\r\n\r\ndisquieted by recent events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has stated that the\r\n\r\nactions  of the Government have identified  it  in\r\n\r\nthe  public mind with colonial rule. As far  as  I\r\n\r\ncan judge, that is only partly true, Sir, of small\r\n\r\nminority  sections,  not  unimportant  because  of\r\n\r\nthat. Under the Rendel Constitution, which we  are\r\n\r\nworking,  the Chief Secretary, a Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nofficial,  is the central authority in respect  of\r\n\r\ninternal  security.  All information  on  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity matters is channelled through him. He  is\r\n\r\nthe  person whose duty it is to advise the Council\r\n\r\nof  Ministers on matters of internal security. The\r\n\r\nfinal  say  in internal security is  his  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's.  Any  major  action  taken  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the field of internal security must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  based  on  the  information,  the\r\n\r\nguidance   and  the  co-operation  of   the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many arrests have been made not only of rioters\r\n\r\nand  curfew breakers but also of persons under the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance, arrests\r\n\r\nwhich  to some are reminiscent of the mass arrests\r\n\r\nin  India  and  Burma before independence.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  Sir,  that  today we recognise  that  those\r\n\r\narrests  in  India  and  Burma  were  arrests   of\r\n\r\nnationalist forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  let  us  remember that many  of  the  persons\r\n\r\nrecently arrested are believed to be ardently anti-colonial individuals. We have used British  forces\r\n\r\nagainst our own citizens. Let us face frankly  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  all this builds up to a picture  which\r\n\r\ngives  disquiet to some perfectly decent and loyal\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore. It is the tragedy  of  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution that those Malayans who  seek\r\n\r\nin all sincerity to work it for the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople are often identified with colonialism. Sir,\r\n\r\nif the Colonial Office says to us that two and two\r\n\r\nmakes  four,  we  in  Singapore  must  accept  the\r\n\r\ncorrectness  of that arithmetic. Let me  say  now,\r\n\r\nwith  no axe to grind, that the advice of Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice officials I have often found to be sensible\r\n\r\nand  right. If we try to show our independence  by\r\n\r\ngoing  contrary in every instance to every  advice\r\n\r\nof  colonial officials, then we create  chaos  for\r\n\r\nSingapore;  and  yet  because  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nbelieved to have followed the guidance and  advice\r\n\r\nof  colonial officials, it is damned, as I  in  my\r\n\r\ntime  was damned, as a running dog of the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice by certain sections of the population. That\r\n\r\nis  the  price  of  the  Rendel  Constitution - that\r\n\r\ndecent  Malayans seeking honestly to work  it  for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of Singapore are suspected  of  being\r\n\r\ntraitors to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways, Sir, in which Government can\r\n\r\nseek to regain the confidence of those sections of\r\n\r\nthe  population; and let us remember this:  though\r\n\r\nwe  may  have a hundred with us, the shepherd  who\r\n\r\nhas  a hundred sheep but has lost two goes out  to\r\n\r\nseek  for  those two - they should not be discarded -\r\n\r\nand  I  say  that  the Government can  regain  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of these minority sections  which  are\r\n\r\ngravely disturbed today in two ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By a renewed and vigorous drive on the\r\n\r\nmerdeka road; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By giving the maximum possible information of\r\n\r\nthe  clear  and  present  danger  of  a  Communist\r\n\r\nconspiracy to overthrow the Government by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is freely recognised, Sir, in every democratic\r\n\r\ncountry  in  the world that secrecy  is  sometimes\r\n\r\nnecessary, but it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  true  that  secrecy  and  democracy  do  not\r\n\r\ngenerally go together. The Government has given no\r\n\r\nindication that Operation Liberation is at an end,\r\n\r\nnor  has  it  stated  that the  present  quiet  is\r\n\r\npermanent peace and not a temporary lull.  If  the\r\n\r\ninference   is   that  Government  fears   further\r\n\r\ntrouble,  that  is all the more  reason  why  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and the people of Singapore should be taken\r\n\r\ninto its fullest confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other matters, Sir, arising out of\r\n\r\nthis  unhappy tragedy that has befallen  Singapore\r\n\r\non  which I wish to touch. The first is concerning\r\n\r\nthe arrest of the Member for Bukit Timah. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is proper at this stage for  anyone  in\r\n\r\nthis  House - nor  perhaps  would  you  permit   it,\r\n\r\ncertainly  I  would not permit myself - to  indicate\r\n\r\nwhat  I  know or what I learned in London  of  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  the views of this young  man.  But\r\n\r\nthis  I can say, Sir: I agree wholeheartedly  with\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister that no citizen is immune from\r\n\r\nthe process of law. When it comes to utilising the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  the  Preservation of Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance intended for use where there is evidence\r\n\r\nof  an  attempt  to  overthrow the  Government  by\r\n\r\nforce,  but  such evidence it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\nproduce  in  court - when  this  Ordinance  is  used\r\n\r\nagainst   a   representative  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and   one  of  the   most   prominent\r\n\r\nOpposition Members - that is a very grave act. This\r\n\r\nI know the Chief Minister is aware of. I also know\r\n\r\nthat  the Chief Minister will, if he can, seek  to\r\n\r\nbring charges against this young man in a court of\r\n\r\nlaw.  If  he cannot, we have this solace  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse - that  the  Member for Bukit  Timah  has  the\r\n\r\nright  to appeal to three judges - but I would  like\r\n\r\nto  add my plea in respect of this case which must\r\n\r\ndisturb  many.  I  would like  to  ask  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   if  these  three  judges  confirm   the\r\n\r\ndetention: that a special secret sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  be  called; and that the report  of  the\r\n\r\njudges  be communicated to us so that we would  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied in our own minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of the tragedy which has\r\n\r\nbefallen  us  is  the widening  rift  between  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking,  the  Malay-speaking   and   the\r\n\r\nIndian-speak-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ning  sections of the population on the  one  hand,\r\n\r\nand the Chinese-speaking Chinese on the other.  It\r\n\r\nis  utterly  false  to suggest  that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nyouths  are  disloyal monsters. It  is  completely\r\n\r\nuntrue to think of the Chinese-speaking Chinese as\r\n\r\nhaving their loyalty orientated towards Peking.  I\r\n\r\nthink,  Sir, it is appropriate at this  time  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore - all of us - should face the\r\n\r\nfacts and recognise the dangers of this facile but\r\n\r\ndangerous way of thought. For decades the colonial\r\n\r\neducation  policy in Singapore  has  been  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple one. Education costs money, they say. If we\r\n\r\nare to give education to the children of transient\r\n\r\nimmigrants,  we  must have income  tax.  Introduce\r\n\r\nincome  tax  to educate the children of  transient\r\n\r\nimmigrants  who  may  be  here  today   and   gone\r\n\r\ntomorrow? Nonsense! And anyway, education may give\r\n\r\nthem   ideas.  What  does  a  coolie   want   with\r\n\r\neducation?  So  because clerks  and  tambies  were\r\n\r\nneeded  for  commercial houses, we had schools  to\r\n\r\nproduce   only  clerks  and  tambies.   Missionary\r\n\r\nsocieties did valiant work in trying to fill  part\r\n\r\nof  the vacuum. The clerks and the tambies and the\r\n\r\nproducts  of missionary schools learned  something\r\n\r\nof  English culture. The English cultural  pattern\r\n\r\nwhich with its refinements of Greek philosophy and\r\n\r\nRoman  jurisprudence became  our  main  source  of\r\n\r\ninspiration,  involving our way of  life.  We  who\r\n\r\nwere educated in English schools tried to meet our\r\n\r\nproblems  with the techniques of English  culture.\r\n\r\nWe  did not become English but we learned what was\r\n\r\nhelpful   in  designing  our  way  of  life;   and\r\n\r\nincidentally, Sir, we learned respect and  loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the  Crown, faith in the rule of  law,  and  a\r\n\r\nlonging for democratic institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the others? The mass of Chinese had to\r\n\r\nfend  for themselves. They either had no schooling\r\n\r\nand  grew  up in the gutter, or they had  to  find\r\n\r\nplaces   in  so-called  schools  run  by   Chinese\r\n\r\nmerchants,  many  of whom donated  generously  but\r\n\r\nnone of whom knew anything of education or running\r\n\r\nschools.  The  teachers  were  poorly  paid.   The\r\n\r\nproducts of those schools and those who never went\r\n\r\nto  school  know a little of Chinese history,  the\r\n\r\nChinese classics, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese philosophy, and consequently their  source\r\n\r\nof  inspiration in meeting life's problems is  the\r\n\r\ntechinique of Chinese culture. They know little of\r\n\r\nthe rule of law. They know little of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy     or    Commonwealth     ideals     of\r\n\r\ninternationalism.  When you say  to  me,  Sir,  be\r\n\r\nloyal   to  Singapore.  I  understand  that  means\r\n\r\nloyalty   to   the   democratic   way   of   life,\r\n\r\nconstitutional       progress,        Commonwealth\r\n\r\nrelationship.  When you say to a  Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nChinese, be loyal to Singapore, he thinks  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary, of the Governor, of the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice. He thinks of the decades of discrimination\r\n\r\nand exploitation. He wants to change this, and  so\r\n\r\ndo I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He has no access to Western\r\n\r\nliterature  and  philosophy,  so  he   seeks   the\r\n\r\ntechnique for the change in Chinese literature and\r\n\r\nChinese  philosophy.

The\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking Chinese, given a  chance,  is  as\r\n\r\nloyal  a  Malayan as any Straits-born. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat   Communists  are  seeking  to  utilise  this\r\n\r\ncultural   affinity   to  impose   the   Communist\r\n\r\nideology.  But  it  is  not true  that  they  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded, and they will not succeed. The  Chinese\r\n\r\nhave  equal  rights  as  the  rest  of  us  in   a\r\n\r\nconstitution compatible with human dignity.  Those\r\n\r\nwho fear Peking's domination must surely have been\r\n\r\nheartened, Sir, by the advice of Premier Chou  En-lai  to our fellow citizens that they should  give\r\n\r\ntheir undivided loyalty to Singapore for their own\r\n\r\nwelfare, for the welfare of Singapore, and for the\r\n\r\nfriendly  relations  that  China  seeks  with  its\r\n\r\nneighbours. I know the most memorable incident  of\r\n\r\nmy visit to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina,  Sir,  was  when Premier  Chou  En-lai  was\r\n\r\nprovoked to anger by my remark that the concept of\r\n\r\ndual  nationality  was  a remnant  of  imperialist\r\n\r\nthinking,  and  the  logical consequence  of  that\r\n\r\nconcept  was that Singapore with its 76  per  cent\r\n\r\nChinese is a colony of Peking. \"Me,\" he said, Sir,\r\n\r\nin   English,  \"an  imperialist?  I  have   fought\r\n\r\nimperialism   for  30  years!\"  And   through   an\r\n\r\ninterpreter   he  told  me,  \"China   has   enough\r\n\r\nterritory, China has enough population.  We  think\r\n\r\ncolonialism is evil. We want no colonies. We  want\r\n\r\nfriends. If ever China tries to dominate Malaya, I\r\n\r\nhope  you  fight us.\" And turning back to  me,  he\r\n\r\nsaid in English, \"That is not only for us but  for\r\n\r\nthe  future and you tell the people of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I believe he was completely sincere when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  China  seeks  no  colonies,  it  wants\r\n\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore should discard this idea\r\n\r\nof  disloyal  Chinese. We must get  together  with\r\n\r\nthem  and  seek  to work out with  them  a  common\r\n\r\napproach  to  our common loyalty. We must  try  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the Chinese-speaking Chinese and  I  do\r\n\r\nask them to try and understand us. We, the English-speaking  section  of  the  population,  are   not\r\n\r\ncolonial  stooges because we seek  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  pattern  of approach in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem of merdeka. We are as sincere as they are.\r\n\r\nThey  must  also realise that there  are  elements\r\n\r\nwhich   seek   every  opportunity  to   damn   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and they have been working not only in\r\n\r\nschools   but   also  amongst  responsible   adult\r\n\r\nChinese.  Just  to give you one instance,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nknow how ardently, how sincerely my colleagues and\r\n\r\nI worked on the White Paper on Education. We tried\r\n\r\nwith  complete honesty to make up for the  decades\r\n\r\nof  disgraceful government neglect of the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity. We insisted on full equality for  them,\r\n\r\nirrespective of cost. It was a radical, I  thought\r\n\r\nit  was  a  magnificent, departure from the  past.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  relief  and  appreciation  from   the\r\n\r\nChinese  community,  we were  told  that  we  were\r\n\r\ntrying  to destroy Chinese culture. That  horrible\r\n\r\ncharge, Sir, is one that I will never forget. Till\r\n\r\ntoday  I  find it difficult to understand how  the\r\n\r\nreasonable and practical Chinese people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter reading the White Paper, can truthfully say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  discriminatory or seeks  to  destroy\r\n\r\nChinese culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the campaign of vilification against\r\n\r\nGovernment?   The   Chinese  themselves   do   not\r\n\r\nunderstand   how  they  have  been   pushed   into\r\n\r\nbelieving  the  White  Paper  to  be  evil,   into\r\n\r\nbelieving   that  it  seeks  to  destroy   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. Sir, I think it might be helpful  if  I\r\n\r\nwere to explain a little of what I have learnt of\r\n\r\nthe Stalin concept of the technique of revolution.\r\n\r\nBroadly  speaking, Sir, Stalin believed that  only\r\n\r\nthe   workers   are   capable  of   a   successful\r\n\r\nrevolution;  also  that the workers  are  normally\r\n\r\nignorant and illiterate. Therefore they have to be\r\n\r\npolitically  educated  to a  revolutionary  pitch.\r\n\r\n`The  political education consists  in  constantly\r\n\r\nsaying:  \"The  present is bad. The  Government  is\r\n\r\nwrong.\"  Whether  the Government  does  right,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government  does  wrong,  you   must\r\n\r\nalways   say:  \"The  Government  is  wrong,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  wrong, the Government  is  wrong\",\r\n\r\nuntil you have aroused their anger to the pitch of\r\n\r\nviolence.  It  seems  that they  conceive  of  the\r\n\r\nworker as being one who is like a sheep, unable to\r\n\r\nremember  today  the falsehood he  was  told  last\r\n\r\nweek, and they are like sheep which a noisy sheep-dog  can stampede in one direction. This has  been\r\n\r\nto  some extent successful in the colony, but I am\r\n\r\nglad   to  note  that  today  many  Chinese   are\r\n\r\nconscious that they have been gravely misled about\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intentions  in  respect  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. That is a good start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who, because of their study of the\r\n\r\nChinese  technique  of approach  to  freedom,  are\r\n\r\ninclined  to  be friendly to Communism,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  this, Sir: I spent  two  months  in\r\n\r\nChina. I had travelled very extensively and I  was\r\n\r\ngiven  very  considerable facilities to  meet  and\r\n\r\ntalk  with  innumerable officials  throughout  the\r\n\r\nlength  and breadth of China. I have seen Shanghai\r\n\r\nwhich  was  once a prosperous commercial  city.  I\r\n\r\nhave   discussed  Communism  in  the  context   of\r\n\r\nSingapore   with   many,  many   leading   Chinese\r\n\r\nCommunists. Not one of them denied my thesis  that\r\n\r\nin a territory where there is neither industry nor\r\n\r\nagriculture,   nor  mining  nor  fishery,   in   a\r\n\r\nterritory which survives economically by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvirtue of the activity of capital, Communism would\r\n\r\nmean  our economic death. In fact, Sir, I remember\r\n\r\nwith  pleasure that one leading Communist said  to\r\n\r\nme, \"Well, maybe in the freak economy of Singapore\r\n\r\nCommunism is inappropriate.\" I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nfor myself that I am more than ever convinced that\r\n\r\nthose  who seek to impose a Communist ideology  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  are,  whether  they  know  it  or  not,\r\n\r\nseeking  to  break our rice-bowl and to  drive  us\r\n\r\nstarving  into the sea. Those who think  they  can\r\n\r\ngain  merdeka by following the Communist technique\r\n\r\nof violence have had a fulldress rehearsal warning\r\n\r\nin recent days of what would befall them. Violence\r\n\r\nis  evil in itself, and in Singapore it is  doubly\r\n\r\nevil,  because in Singapore it is certain to  fail\r\n\r\nand  the  people only will suffer tragedy and  the\r\n\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to appeal to all who may be\r\n\r\ndisturbed  or  antagonistic by  recent  Government\r\n\r\nactions  to  recognise  that  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nseeking  sincerely the welfare of the  people.  By\r\n\r\nits own act this Government has given clear notice\r\n\r\nthat it will terminate its own life not later than\r\n\r\nnine  months hence. That, Sir, is surely  evidence\r\n\r\nof  its  sincerity? Let us all during  these  nine\r\n\r\nmonths cooperate together with the Government  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  welfare.  To  those  sitting  on  the\r\n\r\nfence, the antagonisms of the past one and a  half\r\n\r\nyears have caused enough damage, and merdeka  will\r\n\r\nnever  come,  and  if it comes  it  will  have  no\r\n\r\nmeaning unless we all learn to cooperate with each\r\n\r\nother  and with Government. I ask all sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  population to stop this traditional suspicion\r\n\r\nthat seems inherent in certain quarters and to try\r\n\r\nfor  the  next nine months a positive approach  in\r\n\r\nfull  co-operation with Government; and I say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in these nine months we can still learn  how\r\n\r\nto  live  together  as  equal  brothers,  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  Chinese  cannot  rule  Singapore\r\n\r\nagainst  the will of the rest of us. Nor  can  we,\r\n\r\nwho  are so preponderantly representative in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  rule  Singapore against  the  will  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking Chinese. For our  survival,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe must learn to respect, to understand and to co-operate  with each other. Let there be an  end  to\r\n\r\nthis violence which threatens the very possibility\r\n\r\nof merdeka.

Even the suggestion by  my\r\n\r\nParty   about  raising  immediately  a   Singapore\r\n\r\nregiment was not well received. The past ten  days\r\n\r\nfound  us  asking for assistance in the matter  of\r\n\r\ntroops  and  policemen from  the  Federation,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  Singapore owes much to the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation, Tunku Abdul Rahman, for sending\r\n\r\nus  the much needed aid so promptly. Without  such\r\n\r\nhelp,  this city could not have attained  normalcy\r\n\r\nin  such  a  short time, and this help  must  have\r\n\r\nsaved  Singapore  from further loss  of  life  and\r\n\r\nproperty. In Singapore, up to today, the  material\r\n\r\nloss  is  estimated  at  a  few  hundred  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars.   Everywhere  we  hear   expressions   of\r\n\r\nhardship and suffering. The workers were prevented\r\n\r\nfrom going to work and therefore lost the earnings\r\n\r\nthat   should  have  been  theirs.  The  students,\r\n\r\nespecially  the majority of them who are  keen  to\r\n\r\nlearn,  lost the opportunity to study during  this\r\n\r\ncritical  period. I sympathise with those students\r\n\r\nin their final year, in fact, their final month of\r\n\r\nstudy in school before graduating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver  ten years of hard work has already been  put\r\n\r\nin  and  if  the results of this last  examination\r\n\r\nwere  disappointing or if they were  compelled  to\r\n\r\nabandon their school careers, those who engineered\r\n\r\nthis  riot  must take the blame. The ordinary  and\r\n\r\npeace-loving  citizens,  by  and  large,  must  be\r\n\r\npraised  for  the manner in which  they  conducted\r\n\r\nthemselves, keeping within and observing the  laws\r\n\r\nof  the country. Imagine the immense inconvenience\r\n\r\nexperienced by such citizens. 20 hours out  of  24\r\n\r\ncooped  up  in  their houses. What a horrible  and\r\n\r\nintolerable  bore  it  must  have  been  to  those\r\n\r\nfamilies  of eight to ten children, or even  more,\r\n\r\nthat live in cubicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important question to ask now is:\r\n\r\nWho  caused  all this trouble? On whose  shoulders\r\n\r\nmust  the blame for all this loss of life and limb\r\n\r\nbe  placed? The blame must rest squarely on  those\r\n\r\nwho  engineered this riot and civil  disobedience.\r\n\r\nThese are the enemies of the people. These are the\r\n\r\ncowards and dishonest politicians who made use  of\r\n\r\ninnocent  and helpless young students and  workers\r\n\r\nto  serve  their  own ends. These are  the  people\r\n\r\nwhose  greed for power and selfishness of  purpose\r\n\r\ngo  all out to incite violence when they know that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not be the people who will suffer  and\r\n\r\nget  hurt. I  am referring to the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty   and  its  affiliates.  The  pseudo   trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  instead of assisting  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their conditions of work,  seize  on  the\r\n\r\ngullibility of the workers and convert  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions into political front organisations. Here  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  the  majority  of  workers,   the\r\n\r\nbackbone of our industries and services, are  good\r\n\r\nand  law-abiding citizens who are eager  to  avoid\r\n\r\ntrouble  and  earn  an honest  day's  wages.  They\r\n\r\ndenounced violence and complained of their loss of\r\n\r\nearnings.  In fact, many of them were quite  at  a\r\n\r\nloss as to how to raise money to pay for the needs\r\n\r\nof  their  families the next day. It was indeed  a\r\n\r\nrelief  to  all  when normalcy was  restored.  The\r\n\r\nreturn  of  the  majority of transport  and  other\r\n\r\nworkers  immediately after the curfew  is  a  good\r\n\r\npointer to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the students, what do children between\r\n\r\nthe  ages of 11 and 15 know about politics? During\r\n\r\nmy  days,  when I first attended a Chinese  school\r\n\r\nand then an English school, it was on the lips  of\r\n\r\nmost  Chinese  parents that  an  English  type  of\r\n\r\neducation  taught  the students  to  forget  their\r\n\r\nparents.  Chinese  culture demands  that  children\r\n\r\nmust   honour  their  parents  and  respect  their\r\n\r\nteachers. Today we hear of students ignoring their\r\n\r\nparents,  going against them, and will not  relent\r\n\r\neven  when  the  parents beg them to  comply  with\r\n\r\nrequests beneficial to the children themselves. In\r\n\r\nthe  classroom,  instead  of  the  teacher  giving\r\n\r\ninstructions,  the students give  orders.  I  ask,\r\n\r\nSir,  where  is it shown that Chinese  culture  is\r\n\r\nbeing  preserved? However, it must  be  said  that\r\n\r\nsuch  an  attitude is exhibited by only a few  so-called student leaders. I do not know about  their\r\n\r\nadvisers,  but if they agree that it is  wrong  to\r\n\r\nhonour  their parents and respect their  teachers,\r\n\r\nthen they are also no more fit to be human beings.\r\n\r\nThe  majority  of  students  are,  by  nature  and\r\n\r\ntradition,  keen  to study. They  know  that  they\r\n\r\nbelong to families and that they have parents  who\r\n\r\nnot  only  are responsible for bringing them  into\r\n\r\nthis  world, but are also responsible for  feeding\r\n\r\nthem,   clothing   them,   educating   them,   and\r\n\r\nprotecting  them. However, acting in circumstances\r\n\r\nnot   within  their  control,  these  very   young\r\n\r\nstudents  are powerless. Intimidation and  boycott\r\n\r\ngo  a  long way to compel the majority of innocent\r\n\r\nand   young   students  into   toeing   the   line\r\n\r\ndistasteful to their own conscience. Sir,  I  must\r\n\r\nspeak  up  for this large group of young citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  blame  cannot be placed on them. It  must  be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  those  who engineered  the  riot,  who\r\n\r\nincited  them, who prevented them from  doing  the\r\n\r\nright  thing.  We must consider their  future.  We\r\n\r\nmust  help  them to become useful citizens.  Where\r\n\r\nthey  have  strayed  against their  will,  let  us\r\n\r\ncreate  conditions  for their  quick  return.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should see to it that their schools are\r\n\r\nopened  at  the shortest possible time,  and  that\r\n\r\nsteps are taken to inculcate into young minds  the\r\n\r\ndiffer-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nence  between  right and wrong. True  Chinese  and\r\n\r\nother great cultures, which are, in fact, the most\r\n\r\nvaluable  assets  for any man living  in  society,\r\n\r\nshould   be   taught  in  all  schools - Government,\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided, as well as private  schools.  If\r\n\r\nthere   is  any  difficulty  in  finding  suitable\r\n\r\nlecturers,  I can assure the Government  that  the\r\n\r\nPublic Morals Committee will help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there had been rioting in many parts of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and incidents totalled  up  to  over  a\r\n\r\nhundred,  it must be pointed out that, apart  from\r\n\r\nserious  incidents  involving  arson  and   brutal\r\n\r\nmanhandling  of  innocent  citizens,  many   minor\r\n\r\nincidents  were caused by hooligans  and  ignorant\r\n\r\nyouths.  This  is an indication that  support  for\r\n\r\nlawlessness, was only confined to  a  very  small\r\n\r\nminority. I understand that many people, numbering\r\n\r\nnot  less than a thousand, have been detained  for\r\n\r\nbreaking   the   curfew  or   rioting.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, may I point out that many citizens did\r\n\r\nnot understand that the curfew imposed was a house\r\n\r\ncurfew?  As a result, many thought that  it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be an offence to stay in their compounds  or\r\n\r\non  the  five-foot way so long  as  they  did  not\r\n\r\nventure on to the roads. Many other citizens,  who\r\n\r\nhappened  to  be on the scenes of incidents  after\r\n\r\nthe event, were unfortunate enough to be detained.\r\n\r\nI  would  like the Government to use its sense  of\r\n\r\njustice  and  discretion so that the innocent  may\r\n\r\nnot be punished with the guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what was the underlying cause of these\r\n\r\ndisorders? I am afraid that Singapore politics  is\r\n\r\nalways  gravely  affected by the politics  of  our\r\n\r\ngreat neighbours. There is a need now to cultivate\r\n\r\na  real Malayan outlook and loyalty. No doubt many\r\n\r\npeople  have  come  from India, China,  Ceylon  or\r\n\r\nother  countries. Let me say that China  today  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  great  nation, and so  are  India  and\r\n\r\nCeylon.  These countries do not need the loyalties\r\n\r\nof  their children overseas to make them great. In\r\n\r\nfact,  Nehru, through the Commissioners of  India,\r\n\r\nhas  in the past stated that the Indians who  want\r\n\r\nto  be  citizens of Malaya must be loyal  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry. So it has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  Ceylon.  The Prime Minister of  China,  Mr\r\n\r\nChou  En-lai, in a recent news release,  has  also\r\n\r\nstated  that China does not accept membership  for\r\n\r\nhis  Party from the overseas Chinese. He has urged\r\n\r\nthat the Chinese living in Malaya should be loyal\r\n\r\nto  Malaya and he has also stressed the importance\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese people living here  to  live  in\r\n\r\nharmony  with  the other races. People  from  many\r\n\r\nnations  of  the world, particularly from  Europe,\r\n\r\nemigrate to America. They are Americans and are to\r\n\r\nthe very last loyal to America. I remember that  a\r\n\r\nCanadian Prime Minister was once asked whether  he\r\n\r\nwas  first  a  Canadian  and  then  French,  which\r\n\r\nhappened to be his race; and his reply was that he\r\n\r\nwas  Canadian first and Canadian last. These  are\r\n\r\nexamples  that  we can profitably follow.  Let  us\r\n\r\ncultivate  a  true Malayan outlook, a hundred  per\r\n\r\ncent Malayan loyalty, and let us be Malayans first\r\n\r\nand Malayans last. If we can achieve this, and  at\r\n\r\nthe  shortest  possible time, then I believe  that\r\n\r\nthis  will  be  the beginning of the  end  of  our\r\n\r\ntroubles and an era of co-operation, mutual respect\r\n\r\nand prosperity will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to this question of the recent trouble\r\n\r\nagain,  we,  the Liberal-Socialists, while  giving\r\n\r\nour  support  to  the Government in  carrying  out\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  maintain  law  and  order  in   this\r\n\r\ninstance, cannot help making a few observations on\r\n\r\nits   faults.  The  year-and-a-half  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government cannot escape entirely  from\r\n\r\ncriticism.  As I have said earlier, in this  short\r\n\r\nperiod  we  have  had two riots, and  here  I  say\r\n\r\nemphatically that the present riot is due  to  the\r\n\r\nbackfiring of the previous riot. The 1955 riot was\r\n\r\nclaimed by the trouble-mongers at that time to be\r\n\r\na  victory. They had been encouraged by government\r\n\r\naction  then,  and now in a state of  drunkenness,\r\n\r\nthey  have staged the second riot. I hope this  is\r\n\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is nothing much that I have ever admired  in\r\n\r\nthis  stand of the P.A.P., but there is  only  one\r\n\r\nthing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I  admire, and that is their consistency  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining that whatever they have done is  right\r\n\r\nand  that  whatever the misfortunes that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  seen throughout the last 16 months since  the\r\n\r\nelection  have been no concern of theirs and  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  started by them. Who then  started  the\r\n\r\nHock Lee bus riots? They said, \"Not we. It was the\r\n\r\nGovernment  who started the riots by  the  use  of\r\n\r\nforce  on the poor bus strikers.\" Who started  the\r\n\r\n300 strikes? They said, \"Not the Middle Road group\r\n\r\nof unions nor the P.A.P.\" What they did was to get\r\n\r\nbetter living conditions for the workers and about\r\n\r\n40,000  membership.  But when  challenged  on  the\r\n\r\npoint that, by staging so many strikes, they  were\r\n\r\nforcing   factories  to  close  down  or   curtail\r\n\r\nproduction, they demanded us to produce one single\r\n\r\ninstance  of  such a thing happening.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  never  kill the goose that lays  the  golden\r\n\r\neggs.  They  all die a natural death so  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. can prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who again started the near riot at the Kallang\r\n\r\nairport? They denied they were responsible. But  I\r\n\r\nwas  there.  I stayed on to the end.  That  near\r\n\r\nriot  never  started  until  the  mass  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupporters  and their friends came  along  to  the\r\n\r\nairport  terminal  building.  There  they  started\r\n\r\nchanting  songs, shouting merdeka  and  trying  to\r\n\r\nclimb  over  the railings into the building.  When\r\n\r\nthey  were  prevented from doing so,  stones  were\r\n\r\nthrown.  Of course, they said, \"They were not  our\r\n\r\nmen. They were other people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again what about these strikes? What about\r\n\r\nthe  riots  that  we  have had recently?  Who  was\r\n\r\nresponsible?  Can the P.A.P. and the  Middle  Road\r\n\r\ngroup  disclaim responsibility for having  incited\r\n\r\nand  worked  up  the disorder,  the  challenge  to\r\n\r\nGovernment, so that the riot could start?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, in seconding the motion\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, asked  this\r\n\r\nmorning,  \"What is subversion? What is  subversion\r\n\r\nso  long  as  we carry out our election  pledges?\"\r\n\r\nSurely the answer is that subversion is an attempt\r\n\r\nto overthrow the legally constituted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment by any act whatever to undermine  their\r\n\r\nauthority  or to challenge their right to  do  any\r\n\r\nact. That, to my mind, is subversion, but to their\r\n\r\nminds  it  is  a  perfectly natural constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle.  What  is constitutional  about  it?  By\r\n\r\nconstitutional  struggle, other people  understand\r\n\r\nit  to mean fighting an election or bringing up an\r\n\r\nissue which can unseat the government and so start\r\n\r\nanother   election.   Surely   not   by   inciting\r\n\r\ndisobedience or demanding all those who have  been\r\n\r\ndetained to be brought to trial?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is that wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, it is not wrong.

On this  occasion  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that the Member for Tanjong Pagar was  not\r\n\r\nand  could  not be very vehement about disclaiming\r\n\r\nresponsibility for starting the riot. What he said\r\n\r\nwas,  like a good lawyer, \"Prove it! We  have  got\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with it.\" In his motion before  the\r\n\r\nHouse he asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House deplores the further action of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front Coalition Government  under  the\r\n\r\nBanishment Ordinance, the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance,  and the Societies  Ordinance\r\n\r\nagainst    persons   and   organisations   without\r\n\r\nproducing any evidence to justify its action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What    further   evidence   and   what    further\r\n\r\njustification  is  necessary after  what  happened\r\n\r\nlast week?

I spent the whole of last\r\n\r\nweek - and I think many Members of the Assembly  did\r\n\r\nthe  same - trying to find out for parents and wives\r\n\r\nwhere  their sons and husbands and relatives were,\r\n\r\nand  I  am very grateful to the Assistant Minister\r\n\r\nto the Chief Secretary for so promptly acceding to\r\n\r\nmy  request to set up a central authority  whereby\r\n\r\nanyone  can ring up and find out where the missing\r\n\r\npersons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare; but, to my mind, that alone is not enough.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand about 500 people have been remanded  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  prisons pending trial for rioting  and\r\n\r\nbreaking   the   curfew.  The  administration   of\r\n\r\njustice,  as  I understand it today, will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to cope with this number of cases on top  of\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary day-to-day work which they  have  in\r\n\r\nhand.  I think it takes at least three months  now\r\n\r\nto  get  a  date  fixed for a hearing  before  the\r\n\r\ncourt. Among these 500 odd people you will have to\r\n\r\nsort out the sheep from the goats. I am convinced,\r\n\r\nfrom  the reports that have come to me, that quite\r\n\r\na  number of these people arrested for rioting and\r\n\r\ncurfew breaking are innocent members of the public\r\n\r\nwho  happened to be near the scene of rioting when\r\n\r\nthe police came. My experience is that the man who\r\n\r\nstarts  a  riot  and who is the real  troublemaker\r\n\r\nnever  stays  to  take the consequences.  He  just\r\n\r\nbolts away and leaves the consequences to be faced\r\n\r\nby  the  people  who happen to  be  there,  either\r\n\r\nhawkers or just passers-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one particular case in my mind. On the\r\n\r\n26th  of October, the first day of the trouble,  a\r\n\r\ncyclist was coming out of Alexandra Road near  the\r\n\r\nmilitary hospital. Unfortunately he collided  with\r\n\r\nanother  cyclist who was very anxious to get  home\r\n\r\nbefore  the  curfew. He fell from  his  cycle  and\r\n\r\nbroke  his  head. He was picked up by  a  military\r\n\r\nambulance  and  taken  to the Alexandra  hospital.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately  for  him, after  treatment  he  was\r\n\r\ndetained  there till about seven o'clock and  then\r\n\r\nsent  to the General Hospital, by which time other\r\n\r\nrioters with broken heads were pouring in, and  he\r\n\r\nwas  also detained. Fortunately, however,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to produce evidence to the investigating\r\n\r\nofficer  and  I  have been told that  he  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased as soon as he can leave the hospital. Now\r\n\r\nthat  is  one case, but I am sure there  are  many\r\n\r\ncases like that. I would therefore urge Government\r\n\r\nto do something about these 500 odd people so that\r\n\r\nthey  can be brought to trial before the court  or\r\n\r\nbe  discharged as soon as possible. I also suggest\r\n\r\nthat, except for those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst whom there is clear evidence, the bail  of\r\n\r\n$5,000  fixed for such cases at the present moment\r\n\r\nshould be reduced to $500, because it seems to  me\r\n\r\nthat  it  is impossible for these people  to  find\r\n\r\nsuch  a  large  sum of money before  they  can  be\r\n\r\nbailed out. I would also suggest that extra courts\r\n\r\nbe  constituted to deal with these cases and  that\r\n\r\nmore  investigators  should  be  appointed  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  these  cases  very quickly  so  that  the\r\n\r\ninnocent  can be discharged. I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  are many members of the Bar and members  of\r\n\r\nthe civil service who have experience on the Bench\r\n\r\nwho  would willingly volunteer to go through these\r\n\r\ncases  and  report  to the Attorney-General  which\r\n\r\ncases  ought to be discharged or withdrawn against\r\n\r\nthe  accused  persons. I hope Government  sees  my\r\n\r\npoint.  We  have  given Government  our  unstinted\r\n\r\nsupport when it was a question of maintaining  law\r\n\r\nand order. On my part, I feel that the maintenance\r\n\r\nof law and order is above party politics, and I am\r\n\r\nvery  glad  that my support has been justified  by\r\n\r\nrecent  events,  but  I  do  urge  Government   to\r\n\r\nconsider very sympathetically the 500 odd  persons\r\n\r\nwho are now locked up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.38 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar was  good\r\n\r\nenough to indicate to me this morning that he  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to raise a point which he has made  towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  his  speech, that is,  that  he  was\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the large number of  persons  who\r\n\r\nare  on  remand  on  charges arising  out  of  the\r\n\r\ndisturbances last week and who have not  yet  been\r\n\r\nbrought  to trial. He said, I think, at  an  early\r\n\r\nstage  in his speech that it now takes about three\r\n\r\nmonths  from  the  date of his  arrest  before  an\r\n\r\naccused is brought to trial and he urged that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should do something about it. As I  was\r\n\r\nsaying,  I am grateful to him for having indicated\r\n\r\nto  me  that he was going to raise this  question,\r\n\r\nbecause in the short time which I have had, I have\r\n\r\nbeen able to obtain some particulars which I think\r\n\r\nwill  go some way towards setting his mind at rest\r\n\r\non this particular point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to weary the House with\r\n\r\ndetails,  but  perhaps the hon. Member  and  other\r\n\r\nMembers  would  like  to  know  something  of  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  persons who are at  present  awaiting\r\n\r\ntrial.  The figures which I am going to  give  the\r\n\r\nHouse  are  the figures as at 6 o'clock  yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning, and I think, for the purposes of  what  I\r\n\r\nam going to say, the persons awaiting trial can be\r\n\r\ndivided into two categories. In the first category\r\n\r\nare  persons charged with offences under the Penal\r\n\r\nCode,  for  the  most  part  for  the  offence  of\r\n\r\nrioting,  and  the  other  category  consists   of\r\n\r\npersons who are charged with the offence of curfew\r\n\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of persons charged in\r\n\r\nthe  courts and awaiting trial for offences  under\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code,  that  number  as  at  yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning  was 326, of whom 290 were on charges  of\r\n\r\nrioting.  I cannot say how many are at present  on\r\n\r\nremand,  and  with regard to these cases,  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  this  figure is one which  the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nwould  like to have. But I am afraid that I cannot\r\n\r\ngive  him that figure now but I shall try to  give\r\n\r\nit to him later on. But it is a fact that bail has\r\n\r\nbeen offered in all cases. So we have there, under\r\n\r\nthe   Penal  Code  in  effect,  persons   awaiting\r\n\r\ntrial - 326.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the curfew breakers, the number\r\n\r\nagainst whom charges have been preferred is  1,034\r\n\r\nand  over  half of those have already  been  dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the courts. So we have then 326 under  the\r\n\r\nPenal Code and just over 500 for curfew offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am coming really to what the hon. Member\r\n\r\nwants  to  know. Arrangements have been  made  for\r\n\r\nfour  courts to deal exclusively with these  cases\r\n\r\nstarting   on  Monday  next,  and  I  have   given\r\n\r\ninstructions this morning that priority is  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  persons who are not on bail,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  to  persons  who are in  custody.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I hope that what I have  said  will\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  Member for Paya Lebar  and  also,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  the  Member  for Serangoon  who  expressed\r\n\r\ndoubts  and  concern in this matter. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar would also like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto know - he was worried about persons being charged\r\n\r\nwho  should not have been charged, but  I  do  not\r\n\r\naccept  that  at  all  and I say  that  with  some\r\n\r\nconfidence  because over 1,172  persons  who  were\r\n\r\npicked  up,  so  to speak, have been  released.  I\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir,  that what I have said will  help  the\r\n\r\nhon.

Citizens  have  been\r\n\r\narrested  and detained under the powers  contained\r\n\r\nin  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand  when  the persons arrested were not  born  in\r\n\r\nthis  country, they have been banished even though\r\n\r\nthey  have  family  ties  here.  The  Government's\r\n\r\nexcuse  has  been  that  these  persons  had  been\r\n\r\nengaging   in   subversive  activities.   Is   the\r\n\r\ninformation  at the disposal of the Government  so\r\n\r\nsecret  as all that, that they should always  want\r\n\r\nto  act in secret rather than make use of the open\r\n\r\njudicial  processes which are available  to  those\r\n\r\nwho have nothing to hide?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently in the case of the arrest of a\r\n\r\nChinese  journalist on suspicion, with a  view  to\r\n\r\nbanishment, on the charge that he had been engaged\r\n\r\nin   subversive  activities,  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nadmitted at a Press interview that it was possible\r\n\r\nthat   the  Police  could  have  acted  on   false\r\n\r\ninformation. Sir, how long are we to tolerate this\r\n\r\nunhappy  state of affairs? If `Government believes\r\n\r\nthat  those  it  has caused to  be  arrested  have\r\n\r\nviolated  the law of this country, then it  should\r\n\r\nmake every effort to have them produced before the\r\n\r\ncourts  of  law, so that the public may  know  why\r\n\r\nthey  have  been arrested and they  may  have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  a fair and open trial.  Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  states  that I  am  wrong  in  what  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, then let it show by its act that  it  has\r\n\r\nconfidence in our judiciary and produce before our\r\n\r\ncourts of law those it has arrested on a suspicion\r\n\r\nof having been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengaged  in subversive activities. It is  only  in\r\n\r\nthis  way that the fears of our citizens  will  be\r\n\r\nallayed and confidence in the Government restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.46 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  in  favour of the amendment moved by  my  hon.\r\n\r\nFriend  the Minister for Education. Sir, to render\r\n\r\nany  support to the original motion moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar  would  be  to  render\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the  actions and further  actions  of\r\n\r\nlawless elements which have brought about a  grave\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore, resulting in  so  chaotic\r\n\r\nand  so frightening effects on the peaceful  lives\r\n\r\nof  the  vast majority of the people. The  reasons\r\n\r\nand  justification for Government's action are not\r\n\r\nfar to seek. They have been repeatedly told to the\r\n\r\npeople in the past few weeks, and furthermore both\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister and the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nmentioned  this  in  the  Assembly  yesterday  and\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt, Sir, that violence was the\r\n\r\ntheme  of  the  students and  other  organisations\r\n\r\nwhich started the riots and such acts were done in\r\n\r\nthe  name of ideals of democracy, human rights and\r\n\r\nthe struggle for freedom. The policy of individual\r\n\r\nor  mob violence, intimidation, throwing of stones\r\n\r\nat  the Police and at innocent people, and setting\r\n\r\nfire  to institutions is a bankrupt creed.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  creed  obviously  of  immature  students  and\r\n\r\npoliticians and incompatible with the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  people  as a whole. To think of violence  and\r\n\r\nthe  insurrections  of the  early  18th  and  19th\r\n\r\ncenturies is entirely to misunderstand the present\r\n\r\nposition  in  Singapore and of the  world.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate,  Sir,  that some of  our  people  are\r\n\r\nbeing  advised, directly or indirectly, to  resort\r\n\r\nto   insurrection  and  violence  to  achieve  our\r\n\r\nfreedom.  In order to fight for freedom  today,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  non-violence  technique  is  the  only\r\n\r\ndesirable   technique  in   regard   to   internal\r\n\r\nconditions in Singapore. The thought that by using\r\n\r\nand  rushing into some kind of sporadic action the\r\n\r\npeople are speeding up the revolution in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  very  misleading. Violence can do  nothing  of\r\n\r\nthat kind. Such a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnique   is   only  just  hindering   mankind's\r\n\r\nprogress   towards  the  peaceful  attainment   of\r\n\r\nindependence. The growth of violence is a  symptom\r\n\r\nthat we have left the path of righteousness in our\r\n\r\npolitics.  The insurrectionary type of  action  is\r\n\r\nalways  the action of a small minority and a  weak\r\n\r\nminority,  which tries to capture  power  by  some\r\n\r\nsudden  action. We in Singapore are  neither  weak\r\n\r\nnor a small minority. We have a powerful organised\r\n\r\nmovement for attaining political freedom,  and  to\r\n\r\nindulge  in  sporadic violent action  is  just  to\r\n\r\nignore and not to utilise this movement. It is, in\r\n\r\nfact, hindering its functioning. We have the will,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  great weapon, in our hands,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould use it to our best advantage. To think that\r\n\r\nwe  can  do  a  great deal with  a  pair  of  nail\r\n\r\nscissors, as opposed to a big gun, is absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are being taught to defy the Police.\r\n\r\nWho  compose this Police Force? Our own  brethren.\r\n\r\nWhat is their duty? They are the guardians of  the\r\n\r\npeace,  security and well-being of  their  parents\r\n\r\nand  their fellow citizens. The internal  security\r\n\r\nof  any  country must depend on the understanding,\r\n\r\nmoral  support  and active co-operation  which  the\r\n\r\npeople of this country render to the Police.  This\r\n\r\nmust  be so in Singapore too. The Police Force  is\r\n\r\nthere   to   ensure   internal   peace.   Whatever\r\n\r\ngovernment  is in power - whether it is  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Coalition,  the  P.A.P.,  or  the  Liberal-\r\n\r\nSocialist - the Police act under the  direction  of\r\n\r\nthat  government.  For  what  purpose  should  the\r\n\r\nyouths  of Singapore be taught to hate the Police?\r\n\r\nIs it to start a fight against our Police, a fight\r\n\r\nagainst  our own fellow citizens, against our  own\r\n\r\nwell-being?  Sir, I heartily endorse  the  remarks\r\n\r\nmade  by the Chief Minister when he commended  the\r\n\r\nrestrained actions of the Police Force during  the\r\n\r\ntime of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also evidence that innocent workers\r\n\r\nand  students were and are being incited to a very\r\n\r\nhigh  pitch  of  violence  by  propaganda  and  by\r\n\r\ninflammatory   speechs   directed   against    the\r\n\r\nGovernment and its leaders who have devoted a fair\r\n\r\nportion of their working life and have given their\r\n\r\nall to the welfare of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Sir, I venture  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat it is discourteous for any movement, designed\r\n\r\nto  achieve  political  freedom  by  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional  means,  to  launch  a  series   of\r\n\r\npropaganda  campaigns against the  Government  and\r\n\r\nmisrepresenting facts to achieve their  own  ends.\r\n\r\nThey must fight clean and win the hearts and minds\r\n\r\nof the people by truthful propaganda. By truth and\r\n\r\nonly  by  truth  can we raise the dignity  of  our\r\n\r\npeople in the eyes of the world. We may be able to\r\n\r\nfool some people sometimes by wild propaganda, but\r\n\r\nwe will not be able to fool all the people all the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote an instance where the ideals of\r\n\r\ncivil  rights  were  put to the  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  by the so-called Singapore Civil  Rights\r\n\r\nConvention.  This letter, which was  addressed  to\r\n\r\nme, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Rights Convention of major trade unions\r\n\r\nand  other organisations in Singapore have  reason\r\n\r\nto  believe  that  the majority of  votes  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly in support of the recent arbitrary arrest\r\n\r\nof  trade union and civic leaders and equally  the\r\n\r\ndissolution   of   peaceful   and   constitutional\r\n\r\norganisations,  does  not reflect  public  opinion\r\n\r\ngenerally and the opinion of the great majority of\r\n\r\nyour own electorate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  will  not  think this is upholding  civil\r\n\r\nrights.  This appeal was not directed  to  Members\r\n\r\nwho   voted   against   Government's   motion   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  at  the last sitting of the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis appeal shows very clearly that freedom can be\r\n\r\ndangerous  sometimes  and how  easily  it  can  be\r\n\r\nabused  to  the  detriment  of  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nsecretary  of this organisation, sitting  down  in\r\n\r\nhis  office, could easily say that I do not  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of the people. I, who am  in  very\r\n\r\nclose  touch  with the people and who  utilise  my\r\n\r\nenergies and place my services at the disposal  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, must surely know better than the  man\r\n\r\nwho  sits  down  and writes this letter.  That  in\r\n\r\nitself shows very clearly what civil rights  these\r\n\r\npeople   have  been  championing.  That   is   not\r\n\r\nchampioning civil rights, but it is one  of  those\r\n\r\nbogeys that have been directed against me. Sir, if\r\n\r\na  democratic  decision of  the  Assembly  can  be\r\n\r\ninterpreted in this way, I have no doubt that this\r\n\r\nCivil  Rights  Convention  does  not  believe   in\r\n\r\nitself.

He stressed  the\r\n\r\nneed to avoid deep political cleavage, the need to\r\n\r\nunite public opinion and to win the hearts of  the\r\n\r\npeople  for a socialist programme centred  on  the\r\n\r\nlife  of Singapore. But there is an incompleteness\r\n\r\nin  his  analysis,  I  think,  which  I  can  best\r\n\r\nillustrate  by  reading one or two  extracts  from\r\n\r\nwhat he said on 4th October. Here is one:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"if they cannot get the men who are prepared to\r\n\r\norganise  the masses on their side, then  how  are\r\n\r\nthey going to get the masses on their side?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, he says you have got to have  the\r\n\r\norganisers  in order to get the masses,  and  that\r\n\r\nseems to be basic to his political philosophy  and\r\n\r\nbasic to his political Party. Then earlier on  the\r\n\r\nsame day he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...take away all the supports, all the ground\r\n\r\norganisations  that  sustain the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty,  and then you will have removed the  sinews\r\n\r\nof the Party.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the idea of the masses is one that I do not\r\n\r\naccept  in Singapore. In a country like Russia  in\r\n\r\n1917  or  China  in  1947, a backward,  tottering,\r\n\r\nruined, collapsing country, you do have masses  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense that the people have been reduced below\r\n\r\ntheir status of decent healthy human beings into a\r\n\r\nterrified  and  helpless mob.  Countries  in  that\r\n\r\nstate are not capable of democratic life and  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  organised with a  strong  hand.  You\r\n\r\ncannot make any pretence of democracy about it any\r\n\r\nmore  than  Lenin made a pretence of democracy  in\r\n\r\norganising Russia after the 1917 Revolution.  But,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is not politically or\r\n\r\nsocially  or  economically  bankrupt.  It  has  an\r\n\r\nenormous  reservoir  of  political  strength   and\r\n\r\npolitical  goodwill.  It has  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. It has, in fact, considerable  elements\r\n\r\nof  democracy now existing; and in a democracy you\r\n\r\ndo  not  have masses - you have individuals. You  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  desire  to  be  organised  by  young\r\n\r\nintellectuals.  You  do not  have  a  need  to  be\r\n\r\norganised. In a democracy the people can  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They  are not blinded,  oppressed  or\r\n\r\nterrified.  They can make their own judgments.  It\r\n\r\nis  most dangerous to think in terms of the masses\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It is an intellectual  error,  the\r\n\r\nsame  error that Karl Marx made when he  spoke  of\r\n\r\nthe  \"lumpen  proletariat\" - \"lumpen\" not  meaning\r\n\r\n\"lumped\"   but   meaning  \"foolish\",  \"shiftless\",\r\n\r\n\"purposeless\", \"loafer\" proletariat. We have  not,\r\n\r\nI  think, a lumpen proletariat in Singapore.  Our\r\n\r\npeople  are higher than that and they are  capable\r\n\r\nof political life. The lumpen proletariat attitude\r\n\r\nis  the attitude of a man standing up on high  and\r\n\r\nlooking  down at the crowd beneath him, and  there\r\n\r\nthey  are - the anonymous crowd of people - you cannot\r\n\r\ndistinguish  one  from the other. Sometimes  their\r\n\r\nfaces  are  blank, sometimes they laugh, sometimes\r\n\r\nthey   shout - ah - ah - ah!  But  they  are  just   the\r\n\r\nresponsive  instrument on which  the  intellectual\r\n\r\nplays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point of view of the man looking down\r\n\r\non  the  masses, but when you are down  among  the\r\n\r\nmasses, it is not like that. You are an individual\r\n\r\nand you are surrounded by individuals, and to the\r\n\r\nman down below, it is individual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreedom  that  counts. It is, I  think,  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant thing in a man's life that he should  be\r\n\r\nindividually      free.     National      freedom,\r\n\r\nmerdeka - yes - but  they  are only  a  means  towards\r\n\r\nindividual  freedom, which is the final objective,\r\n\r\nthe  full  flowering  and fruiting  of  the  human\r\n\r\npersonality,  free from its chains and  free  from\r\n\r\nexploitation and oppression. And because  we  have\r\n\r\nthis  desire for personal freedom, we do not have\r\n\r\namongst the people a desire to be organised.  They\r\n\r\nare reluctant to be organised. You do not have  in\r\n\r\na healthy democracy a hundred per cent trade union\r\n\r\nmembership.  You  do not have a hundred  per  cent\r\n\r\nvote for the head of the State. You do not have  a\r\n\r\nhundred  per  cent of anything.  You  do  not  get\r\n\r\npeople  turning  out  to vote  for  the  different\r\n\r\nParties.  You  do not have all the voters  turning\r\n\r\nout. You will think yourself lucky to get 70 or 80\r\n\r\nper cent of them out. Because they do not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  organised.  It  is  only  where  you  have   a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  country, a Communist  or  a  Fascist\r\n\r\ncountry,  that people are organised and bludgeoned\r\n\r\nand  compelled to come out and give  themselves  a\r\n\r\nhundred  per cent to an organisation. You  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  it  in  a democracy. You can get spontaneous\r\n\r\norganisation  as  the  need  arises.   They   have\r\n\r\napparently  a spontaneous organisation in  Hungary\r\n\r\nagainst  a  government kept in  power  by  foreign\r\n\r\nsupport. The people rose against it and organised,\r\n\r\nand, as far as I can gather from the reports, just\r\n\r\nrising  up  to say, \"We do not want to  be  pushed\r\n\r\naround and organised. We want to do the things  we\r\n\r\nlike  and  disagree with each other when  we  want\r\n\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You should ask American\r\n\r\nintelligence agents what they know about Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I thought I should be queried about\r\n\r\nHungary,  so  I  will take an example  during  the\r\n\r\nriots  in  Singapore.  I  have  anticipated   this\r\n\r\ninterruption!  I was away when the incident  I  am\r\n\r\nabout  to  relate occurred. My house stands  on  a\r\n\r\nrather small road called Meyappa Chettiar Road. My\r\n\r\nfamily  were  all  there, one evening  during  the\r\n\r\nriots,  when an organised body of rioters  marched\r\n\r\ndown  Meyappa Chettiar Road towards the  vegetable\r\n\r\nfarming area called Potong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPasir.  The  people  on the  sides  of  the  road\r\n\r\nspontaneously organised themselves. A considerable\r\n\r\nnumber - I do not know how many but enough  to  fill\r\n\r\nthe  house apparently - came up to my house and  the\r\n\r\nwomen and children were put up in the bedrooms and\r\n\r\ndown  below the men stood guard outside with their\r\n\r\nparangs  and their sticks. They had not  organised\r\n\r\nbeforehand. They saw what seemed to them to  be  a\r\n\r\ndanger  coming  along and they took  refuge  where\r\n\r\nthey  thought there was a good defensible position\r\n\r\non  top  of  a  hill; and they got the  women  and\r\n\r\nchildren quickly upstairs and they stood  by  down\r\n\r\nbelow and they were ready to defend themselves  if\r\n\r\nthey  had  been  attacked. That  seems  to  me  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  free  people moving into  spontaneous\r\n\r\norganisation against other people who are  not  in\r\n\r\nspontaneous  but in pre-arranged organisation.  As\r\n\r\nthe  rioters went on - they did not, in fact, attack\r\n\r\nthe area where these people had taken refuge (they\r\n\r\nwere humble people and did not deserve attack, but\r\n\r\nthey  thought they were going to get it) - they came\r\n\r\nto  the Bailey bridge, which was put up after  the\r\n\r\nfloods  of 1954, and when the people on the  other\r\n\r\nside  of the river realised they were approaching,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, some of the farmers started  beating\r\n\r\ntheir buckets and tin cans in the same way as they\r\n\r\nbeat  them when an eclipse is coming, and all over\r\n\r\nthat valley of humble vegetable farmers the lights\r\n\r\nwent  out.  That was all - just like  that.  I  have\r\n\r\ndescribed two different kinds of people. It was an\r\n\r\nextraordinary thing to see - little houses going out\r\n\r\ninto  darkness under the threat of the approaching\r\n\r\nrioters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that was spontaneous organisation, and I\r\n\r\nset against this analysis of organising the masses\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of human individuality,  of  human\r\n\r\nfreedom  and a society that seeks to liberate  the\r\n\r\nindividual,   to  set  him  free  for   the   full\r\n\r\ndevelopment of his personality. That is  an  ideal\r\n\r\nbut we have not got it yet in Singapore. We have a\r\n\r\nlong way to go. We have only democracy in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in one speech the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  said that if you believe in democracy,  you\r\n\r\nmust  believe in it absolutely. I agree in a sense\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  that it follows  that  you  can\r\n\r\nimmediately and always maintain all the  machinery\r\n\r\nof  democracy.  It does not always  operate.  Open\r\n\r\ntrial,   free   speech,   free   assembly,    free\r\n\r\npublication - all the democratic rights  which  you\r\n\r\ncan  find listed in the political books - they  are\r\n\r\nmachinery and a very desirable machinery, but they\r\n\r\ndo not always work. If you are going on a journey,\r\n\r\nit  is  usually a very good thing to have a motor-car  and  go  in a motor-car. But a motor-car  can\r\n\r\nbreak  down; a motor-car can be misused and turned\r\n\r\ninto a means of danger. If the motor-car will  not\r\n\r\nwork,  then  you had better abandon the  motor-car\r\n\r\nand  finish  your journey on foot as long  as  you\r\n\r\nwant to get on with your journey. In the same way,\r\n\r\nI  am afraid sometimes the machinery of democracy,\r\n\r\nas  generally accepted, does not always  work  and\r\n\r\nyou  may sometimes have to by-pass it and try  and\r\n\r\ncomplete   your   journey   and   get   to    your\r\n\r\nobjective - and your objective is personal  freedom.\r\n\r\nNow   where  organised  intimidation  exists,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  some parts of the machine are definitely\r\n\r\nunworkable. The machinery of open trial is not  an\r\n\r\neasy machine to operate. It never has been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote another example from what I am told\r\n\r\nis  a  very reliable source about the riots. I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to conceal this slightly because I  checked\r\n\r\nup before I decided to use this in my speech and I\r\n\r\nwas asked not to mention it at all; but I am going\r\n\r\nto  mention  it  and I am going to  conceal  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit so that it will not be easy to put  the\r\n\r\nfinger   on   my  informants.  A  Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nChinese looked out of his window and saw a gang of\r\n\r\nrioters    starting   to   make   a    road-block,\r\n\r\naccumulating their bottles and their iron  bars\r\n\r\nand  getting themselves into position to  try  and\r\n\r\ntrap  a car. This Chinese was horrified. He  spent\r\n\r\nsome time trying to make up his mind whether to do\r\n\r\nanything, and finally he got to his telephone  and\r\n\r\ntelephoned  to a friend to tell him about  it.  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Will you, my friend, please telephone  the\r\n\r\npolice  because  I dare not? I fear  these  people\r\n\r\nshould  somehow  get to know  that  I  have  given\r\n\r\ninformation about it. But I do not know  who  they\r\n\r\nare.  They  are just figures down the street-three\r\n\r\nor four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstoreys down below there. I can see them but I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know who they are. I dare not tell the police\r\n\r\nthat they are there.\" That was how the police  got\r\n\r\nto  know  of  it,  through  second  or  third - hand\r\n\r\ntelephone  calls before somebody was  found  brave\r\n\r\nenough to telephone the police. That is the degree\r\n\r\nof  fear  under which the people are operating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - under the threat of riots, intimidation,\r\n\r\nacid in your face and a bullet in your brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that seems to be perhaps a doubtful example\r\n\r\nbecause that was a time of great stress and  fear,\r\n\r\nlet  me take one example of unwillingness to  give\r\n\r\nevidence  in a time of relative peace  and  quiet.\r\n\r\nAnother  Chinese  took  a  child  to  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital  for treatment. The Chinese doctor  there\r\n\r\nwas extremely uncivil and insisted on delivering a\r\n\r\nlecture on political theory instead of getting  on\r\n\r\nand  giving the child the treatment that it should\r\n\r\nhave  had.  He was very uncivil to the  person  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the child. But I heard of this; my blood\r\n\r\ndid  not  quite  boil but it  simmered  a  bit.  I\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  contact the original person  to  whom\r\n\r\nthis had happened. I checked up and the reply was,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the story is correct.\" \"Will you give me the\r\n\r\ntime,  the day, and, if you can, the name  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctor,  and as many other details as you  can  so\r\n\r\nthat  I can get some action taken?\" But the  reply\r\n\r\nwas \"No\", and I worked for half an hour trying  to\r\n\r\nconvince this person that it was right and  proper\r\n\r\nthat the information should be given, so that  the\r\n\r\ndoctor could be told that he must do his duty as a\r\n\r\ndoctor   and   not   mix  it  up  with   political\r\n\r\nindoctrination. But I could not get permission  to\r\n\r\ngive  that  information and I could  not  get  the\r\n\r\ndetails.  That is the degree to which some  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are afraid to come forward and  give\r\n\r\nevidence. Anybody who knows anything about it will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  give  you dozens and  hundreds  more\r\n\r\nexamples of the same kind of thing, because  there\r\n\r\nhas  been so much intimidation and people who have\r\n\r\ntried to do what they knew was right have so often\r\n\r\nto pay a bitter and terrible price. I hope that in\r\n\r\nthis case we shall have the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence and that some trials will be possible but\r\n\r\nwe  have  to have that background in our minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  fear of coming out and saying openly, \"I  saw\r\n\r\nthis. I swear that this is true.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demand for open trials has been made again\r\n\r\nand  again by the People's Action Party, but  they\r\n\r\nhad  better check up because, if I may quote  from\r\n\r\nexperience  of  five years ago in  rather  similar\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  is not always  true  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  who has been detained wants an open trial.\r\n\r\nThis  sounds  surprising, but I know  this  for  a\r\n\r\nfact. In 1951, at the beginning of the first  term\r\n\r\nof  the  schools, a large number  of  people  were\r\n\r\npicked up by the Special Branch and detained under\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency Regulations. Amongst them were  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Singapore Teachers' Union, Mr P.\r\n\r\nV.  Sharma,  and the Secretary, Mr  C.  V.  Devan\r\n\r\nNair.  The  Union  Committee,  very  rightly   and\r\n\r\nproperly,  immediately called  a  general  meeting\r\n\r\nwhich  I  attended; and the proposal was that  the\r\n\r\nUnion should unanimously demand an open trial  for\r\n\r\nthese  two  valued  officers and  that  the  Union\r\n\r\nshould  raise  a  large fighting fund  and  should\r\n\r\nemploy  Mr D. N. Pritt, Q.C., as the counsel  for\r\n\r\nthe  defence. I was in sympathy with that,  but  I\r\n\r\ngot  up and made one point, and that was they  had\r\n\r\nbetter  check  up first whether  or  not  the  two\r\n\r\nvalued officers of the Union did, in fact, want an\r\n\r\nopen  trial,  as  the  Union  thought.  The  Union\r\n\r\ntherefore elected a Committee of three - two  others\r\n\r\nand  myself - to go to Changi Prison and  see  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen  and to find out whether they wanted  an\r\n\r\nopen trial or not. We went off. The police gave us\r\n\r\nevery facility. We had a private room in which  to\r\n\r\nsee  them - that was not a facility we  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen   given;  we  should  have  had  a  policeman\r\n\r\npresent, I believe, but I think by now the offence\r\n\r\n(if  there  was  one)  against the  regulations  is probably  cold. I think we spent about  20  or  25 minutes  arguing with them, and trying to convince them  that an open trial was feasible and possible and  right,  that we could get a  good  lawyer  to defend them and that we could find \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe money. But the answer was \"No\". Subsequently I\r\n\r\nhad  a  letter from Mr Devan Nair,  when  he  was\r\n\r\nremoved to St. John's Island, saying that  I  had\r\n\r\nbeen  spreading  false rumours about  him  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  he  did not want an open  trial.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"It is not that we do not want a trial.  It\r\n\r\nis  because we have no faith in any trial that  we\r\n\r\ncan  get in Singapore.\" As far as I can recollect,\r\n\r\nthat was the point. It was a difficult point to me\r\n\r\nbecause, as far as I could gather, he had no faith\r\n\r\nin  any  trial which could be given in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore presumably he did not want any trial. It\r\n\r\nwas with difficulty that we accepted this position\r\n\r\nbecause we felt that it put a stigma on the  whole\r\n\r\nUnion - that these two officers were not willing  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  justice of the courts of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the money which was raised had to be  spent\r\n\r\non  cigarettes  and biscuits and books  and  other\r\n\r\nthings, because they would not have a lawyer, they\r\n\r\ndid not want to go into the courts of Singapore. I\r\n\r\nam  dropping this into the People's Action Party's\r\n\r\nmind  because  they may come up against  the  same\r\n\r\nsort o difficulty again. I do not say it will;  it\r\n\r\nmay not be so, but there it is, it is a matter  on\r\n\r\nrecord. I have the file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to under-stress the dangers of by-passing any of the democratic safeguards\r\n\r\nwhich are parts of the democratic machinery - open\r\n\r\ntrials and other matters of that sort -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am most\r\n\r\nanxious  that I should not in any way misrepresent\r\n\r\nMr  Sharma  and Mr Devan Nair, particularly  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair,  who  now perhaps  faces  open  trial\r\n\r\nagain.  I have not looked at the file in  which  I\r\n\r\nhave all these records for some months. I used  it\r\n\r\nto  write  a  letter  to Fajar of  the  University\r\n\r\nSocialist  Club.  I  do  not  know  whether   they\r\n\r\npublished it but I sent it to them explaining  the\r\n\r\nfacts I have given in this Assembly today. I think\r\n\r\nit  might be right to add that my impression, when\r\n\r\nI  saw  Mr  Sharma and Mr Devan Nair  in  Changi\r\n\r\nPrison, was that it was Mr Sharma who was opposed\r\n\r\nto  the open trial and Mr Devan Nair seemed to me\r\n\r\nto  have been willing to go to trial if his senior\r\n\r\nand  Union President had not been unwilling.  That\r\n\r\nis  only an impression and I would not like to say\r\n\r\nanything  more about it in case I did misrepresent\r\n\r\nin  any  way. I do not want also, Mr Speaker,  my\r\n\r\nremarks  about the difficulty of getting  evidence\r\n\r\nto  be  taken  as misrepresenting  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I have given examples of the reluctance\r\n\r\nto  speak up and give evidence to lay bare  things\r\n\r\nthat  were wrong but that is not the whole  story.\r\n\r\nThere  are plenty of cases of people who  do  show\r\n\r\ngreat  courage and willingness to face the burdens\r\n\r\nof  citizenship and those people I  am  sure  have\r\n\r\nbeen  much encouraged and strengthened by the firm\r\n\r\nleadership of our Chief Minister and by the action\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his speech,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  and his Party had lived  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem   of  winning  people  to  democracy,   of\r\n\r\navoiding a political cleavage, for two years.

R. Lazarous) who did beat Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair  of  the People's Action Party in  open  free\r\n\r\nelections  in  Farrer Park in  1955.  I  will  say\r\n\r\nnothing  of the methods by which he achieved  that\r\n\r\nvictory.  Later  in  the same year,  he  tried  to\r\n\r\nbecome  President of the Labour Front.  He  failed\r\n\r\nand I will say nothing of the methods by which he\r\n\r\ntried to achieve that other victory which ended in\r\n\r\ndefeat. He subsequently left the Labour Front  and\r\n\r\ncrossed  to  the  Opposition and in  ally  on  4th\r\n\r\nOctober,  he  gave  his voice in  support  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party motion - a most  embarrassing\r\n\r\nmoment.  I am sure, for the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nand  one  which they will have some difficulty  in\r\n\r\nliving  down.  But I will give them  courage  that\r\n\r\nalthough  it  must have been embarrassing  at  the\r\n\r\ntime,  I  am sure they need not fear that he  will\r\n\r\nstay  with  them very long without his  allegiance\r\n\r\nbeing   transferred  elsewhere  on  a   convenient\r\n\r\noccasion. I would not have spent much time on  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park  except  that  he   does\r\n\r\nillustrate so well the limitations on democracy in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the fact that, in spite  of  those\r\n\r\nlimitations,  democracy  can  work.  We  do   have\r\n\r\nbreakdowns;  we  do have errors; we  slip  and  we\r\n\r\nstumble and we lose our way in the half-light  but\r\n\r\nwe  do go forward. We do overcome the difficulties\r\n\r\nand  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar pointed  out,\r\n\r\nyou do get a natural political death for those who\r\n\r\nare unsuited for a healthy political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, Mr Speaker. Sir, when I\r\n\r\npersonally hoped that the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nmight  have been one of a united social democratic\r\n\r\nlabour movement in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was a true Democrat-Socialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There was an opportunity but the\r\n\r\nopportunity  came  to  nothing.

The result of that was that there was a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  more  freedom of  manoeuvre  for  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Now,  I assume his reasons - I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  his reasons but he can correct me  if  I  am\r\n\r\nwrong - that  he looked at the Socialist Party,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Party, the Labour Front and he saw certain\r\n\r\nthings  that seemed to him somewhat comic. He  saw\r\n\r\nsome  rather odd fish, as I have said.  He  saw  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  the  cadres and the ground organisations\r\n\r\nand the emotional appeals, and so forth -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Integrity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - to which he gives the very highest\r\n\r\nvalue   and  I  think  that  he  undervalued   the\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  and the ability of the  individual\r\n\r\nvoter. He thought us ill-organised; he thought  we\r\n\r\nlacked  drive and dynamism and he thought that  we\r\n\r\nlacked  integrity. I think he still  thinks  those\r\n\r\nthings  about us to some extent. Probably we  have\r\n\r\nmore organisation that he gives us credit for.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  membership of between 11,000  and  12,000\r\n\r\npeople  who  have joined the Party as  individuals\r\n\r\nand not as a mass organised membership but we have\r\n\r\nnever  sought  to  organise  the  masses  in   the\r\n\r\nCommunist   method.  We  have  sought   individual\r\n\r\nsupport - people who can judge for themselves, think\r\n\r\nfor  themselves and decide for themselves.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot want masses who are manipulated. I do not deny\r\n\r\nthe value, Mr Speaker, of the masses approach  in\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances. If I had been in China  in\r\n\r\n1947  or in Russia in 1917, I should probably have\r\n\r\ngiven my support to Mao Tse-tung or to Lenin but I\r\n\r\nhope  I  should have had the courage to refuse  my\r\n\r\nsupport  to Stalin when he turned the system  into\r\n\r\nan  abominable tyranny. The point I am  trying  to\r\n\r\narrive  at, Mr Speaker, is that you have to  take\r\n\r\naccount   of   the  realities  of   a   particular\r\n\r\nsituation.  When  the Greek classic  law-giver  and\r\n\r\npolitician Solon was asked, \"What is the best form\r\n\r\nof government?\", his reply was. \"For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhom,  at what time?\". For Singapore at this time,\r\n\r\nI  believe  that  the best form of  government  is\r\n\r\ndemocracy  but I also believe that it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  ensure the growth and strength of democracy by\r\n\r\nremoving  the weeds which seek to strangle  it.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that there is a danger in by-passing any  of\r\n\r\nthe  machinery  of  democracy, of  the  safeguards\r\n\r\nwhich are established and recognised and proved in\r\n\r\npast  experience: one of them is open trial  which\r\n\r\nwe  have been discussing, but it is only a part of\r\n\r\nthe  machinery. The vital purpose of democracy  is\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of the individual - the full growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  human  personality. Communism  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be a step backward, a step downward  and  a\r\n\r\nstep  away from our achievements and it  would  be\r\n\r\nsocial,  economic and political  suicide  for  us\r\n\r\nbecause  we are beyond that stage and I hope  that\r\n\r\nwe shall never be driven back to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the people of Singapore understand\r\n\r\nand  accept  the  purpose  of  the  Labour  Front-Alliance Coalition Government. I believe that they\r\n\r\nshare our faith in the individual. I believe  that\r\n\r\nthey share our conviction that the individual must\r\n\r\nbe  protected against conspiracy, intimidation,  a\r\n\r\nlife  of fear and the threat of having his freedom\r\n\r\ntaken  from  him.  It is in that  conviction,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that I urge this House  to  support\r\n\r\nthe amendment moved by my hon.

The interpretation he gave of world\r\n\r\naffairs in his speech yesterday seemed to me to be\r\n\r\nonly  remotely  connected with the motion  but  it\r\n\r\ncertainly gave him an opportunity to sing  a  hymn\r\n\r\nof  hate against the British. I assert - and I  care\r\n\r\nnot how much the elected Members on both sides  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  may laugh - that the British  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle to be ashamed of and much to be proud of in\r\n\r\nthe  history of the administration of this country\r\n\r\nand  that it was achieved with blood and sweat and\r\n\r\nexploitation is, to my mind, a myth cooked  up  by\r\n\r\nthe     latter-day     have-nots     and     their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

He did\r\n\r\nhowever  tell us that the Member for  Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim Ching Siong) was actually waiting to  be\r\n\r\npicked  up  by  the  Police which  also  does  not\r\n\r\nsurprise me not, as he suggested, because the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister  in his  earlier  speech  had\r\n\r\nrevealed   his  intention  in  this  respect   but\r\n\r\nprobably because he was guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Come, come.

The Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\ndid  say  that  the  Member for  Bukit  Timah  was\r\n\r\nexpecting  to  be picked up and  I  only  gave  my\r\n\r\ninterpretation of why he thought so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar asked yesterday,\r\n\r\n\"Who began the trouble and who is responsible  for\r\n\r\nit?\"  Surely, these questions were rhetorical.  In\r\n\r\nhis   lecture   to  the  Government  Benches,   he\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the  Labour Front  Coalition  had\r\n\r\ncooked  its goose because they used British troops\r\n\r\nto  help the Police in, suppressing the riots.  In\r\n\r\nso  doing,  according to him, they have  lost  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the masses. It would be interesting  to\r\n\r\nknow  just how many people in Singapore, excluding\r\n\r\nthe  British,  gave thanks at the  time  of  these\r\n\r\nriots  for the very presence of these troops.  His\r\n\r\nremarks   about  the  General  Officer  Commanding\r\n\r\nSingapore  Base  District and the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice  seemed  to me to be scarcely  adult;  that\r\n\r\ntheir pictures appeared in the Press showing  them\r\n\r\nas  directing operations may have annoyed the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  but the Commissioner of Police happens  to\r\n\r\nbe  British and surely no one would be so naive as\r\n\r\nto  except  that  anyone  else  would  direct  the\r\n\r\ndisposition  of  Police  forces  in  an  emergency\r\n\r\nexcept  him.  This is after all  still  a  British\r\n\r\ncolony.  That the forces the Government have  been\r\n\r\nfighting against were subversive in every sense of\r\n\r\nthe word will be denied by no one except\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe 2\ufffd per cent representation of the population\r\n\r\nof the People's Action Party plus the few thousand\r\n\r\nmisguided  school children - God pity them - who  have\r\n\r\nbeen led astray by people who are scarcely capable\r\n\r\nof  thinking straight. If only those opposing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would pause to take stock of the damage\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing  in retarding  progress  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  towards self-government, they might  have\r\n\r\nanother think about it. Of course, I realise  that\r\n\r\nthis is the sort of thing one might expect to come\r\n\r\nfrom  a  person  in my position.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  has told the House that  he  would\r\n\r\nhave me deported if he had the chance. I think, in\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  he  may  be  slipping  because   I\r\n\r\nremember  about  a  year ago  in  this  House,  he\r\n\r\nindicated  that  when he was in power,  he,  as  a\r\n\r\ngracious host, would welcome the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Only to polite guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> But what about the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation in this respect? Is he  too  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  stooge?

He had been\r\n\r\nspeaking  of  Russia!  Russia,  whose  action   in\r\n\r\nEastern  Europe  makes  the  Franco-British   Suez\r\n\r\naffair sound like a school picnic.

Member's\r\n\r\nrefusal  throughout the life of this  Assembly  to\r\n\r\njoin in what he and his Party call \"anti-Communist\r\n\r\nhysteria\"   was   just   as   great   before   de-Stalinisation   but  how  utterly  ludicrous   and\r\n\r\nlaughable are these words of the hon.

Members of this House  who  have\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  Singapore at heart  except,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did a Member of this Party say - a Member who\r\n\r\r\nis conspicuous by his absence - to what the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister said the other day? He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A hundred Hon. Mr Lim Yew Hocks cannot destroy\r\n\r\nthis  movement. A hundred Hon. Mr Lim  Yew  Hocks\r\n\r\nwill only find their political graves in trying to\r\n\r\ndestroy  this invincible movement for freedom  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights for the people of this  country\r\n\r\nThis  movement  is an organic part of  the  mighty\r\n\r\ncurrent  of  the  Asian revolution.

Workers'  Union)\r\n\r\nin  Bukit Timah (his constituency), what did  they\r\n\r\nfind? The place was housed by a large number of so-called  unionists and students who put up a strong\r\n\r\nresistance. Home-made weapons, bottles  containing\r\n\r\nacid  and  documents  were seized - documents  which\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated  a programme  of  violence  and\r\n\r\ndestruction. The same were found in other premises\r\n\r\nfrom   which  the  rioters  were  receiving  their\r\n\r\ndirectives and among the rioters were students who\r\n\r\n(that is, the Singapore Factory and Shop took part in  the  throwing  of  bottles,  spoke  of?  Large victory  banners  and  a were  these  not  all  in readiness to proclaim the victory which they  with the  support  of pseudo-unionists and  thugs  were confident in gaining? There was plenty of evidence to justify Government's action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  must  have faith  in  the  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  if their faith is  misplaced,  no\r\n\r\nsingle person on this side of the House will wish\r\n\r\nto  remain a single day longer nor will he be able\r\n\r\nto  face the decent citizens of Singapore with a\r\n\r\nfree conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I thought we have lost it a\r\n\r\nlong time ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Government was aware that there were\r\n\r\ndestructive  forces  who were working  behind  the\r\n\r\napparent calm and it was imperative for action  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken  then and there and not later.

Hon.

The \"invincible power\"  would\r\n\r\nflourish  and  Members of this Assembly - at  least,\r\n\r\nthose  who  would  be  in the  seats  then -  would\r\n\r\nprobably  be expected to do the yanko  dance  when\r\n\r\nthe Speaker enters with a hammer and sickle in his\r\n\r\nhands,  instead  of  standing  with  respect   and\r\n\r\ndignity as we do now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all hon.

I had nothing to do  with\r\n\r\nthe crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusual speech delivered by the most learned\r\n\r\nand  brilliant orator in this country, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar, appeared to me to be so  weak,\r\n\r\nso vague\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  so confused that I could not understand  his\r\n\r\nintentions. What does he stand for and what is his\r\n\r\npolicy?  Today  I  have discovered  that  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to make use of the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\n(Inche  Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) - I think he is a member\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. by now - to defend his Party's policy.\r\n\r\nI   admit  that  after  I  heard  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  speak, I felt that it was  P.A.P.,  stuff,\r\n\r\nbut  definitely  not  the kind  delivered  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I am not in the Government, I do not\r\n\r\nhave -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What a shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> - the opportunity of getting\r\n\r\ninformation from the Special Branch. Therefore, I\r\n\r\ncannot  say  whether  those  arrested  and   those\r\n\r\ndissolved organisations are subversive or  not.  I\r\n\r\nam  also not a member of the P.A.P., and I have no\r\n\r\nconnection with those arrested and those dissolved\r\n\r\norganisations. Therefore, I cannot definitely  say\r\n\r\nwhether  they are subversive or whether  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  undesirable organisations. But one  thing  is\r\n\r\nvery  clear in my mind, and that is that  all  the\r\n\r\ntroubles  that we have are very closely  connected\r\n\r\nwith the P.A.P. and with the mover of the original\r\n\r\nmotion.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar can  lie  to\r\n\r\nanybody, but he cannot lie to me, Sir. He can say,\r\n\r\n\"No,  the  P.A.P. has  no  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nstudent  movement. The P.A.P. has never  used  the\r\n\r\nstudents for its political campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the Member for Tanjong Pagar - if he\r\n\r\ncan  recall  as far back as the year  1954 - of  the\r\n\r\ntime  when the new Bedok settlement suffered  from\r\n\r\nfloods.  Then, the leader of the P.A.P. led  five\r\n\r\nlorry loads of Chinese school students to the  new\r\n\r\nBedok   settlement  to  start  relief   work,   to\r\n\r\ndistribute  sweets - genuine sweets - and sweet  words\r\n\r\ntoo,  after  the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  had\r\n\r\njoined  with  the  Social  Welfare  Department  in\r\n\r\nspending more than $100,000 on flood relief.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the first time that I realised how clever the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are in their planning and tactics to  make\r\n\r\nuse of Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents. If the P.A.P. are not supported  by  the\r\n\r\nChinese school students, I wonder whether they can\r\n\r\nstill  claim that the P.A.P. is the only Party  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  that stands alone today.  If  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  were honest when he answered the statement\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Chief Minister of  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nTunku Abdul Rahman, condemning any politician who\r\n\r\ntries  to  make  use of students  as  a  political\r\n\r\ncriminal, then, by now, I hope that all Members in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  as well as the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\ncan  clearly understand and point out who are the\r\n\r\npolitical criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Tanjong Pagar was the adviser\r\n\r\nto the dissolved Chinese Middle Schools' Students'\r\n\r\nUnion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether I am  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to ask him a few questions. Did  he  give\r\n\r\nany  advice  other than from the  legal  point  of\r\n\r\nview?  Can he tell us, \"No, I was only an honorary\r\n\r\nlegal  adviser. I only give advice  to  the  Union\r\n\r\nfrom  the  legal point of view.\"? Can  we  believe\r\n\r\nthat, Sir? Can we believe that such a dynamic  and\r\n\r\npowerful  and  influential political  leader  just\r\n\r\ngave only legal advice to the Union? I believe the\r\n\r\nhon. Member has the ability and thinks it even his\r\n\r\nduty to advise the Union other than from the legal\r\n\r\npoint  of  view. Further, as he claims to  be  the\r\n\r\nleader of Singapore, did he ever tell the truth to\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  school students  that  this  country\r\n\r\nlives  only  on entrepot trade, especially  as  we\r\n\r\nhave little chance to merge with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya?  Then,  did he consider  it  advisable  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the Chinese school students to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the Communist system must be introduced into\r\n\r\nthis  country?  Did he advise the  Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents that, although every Chinese in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  entitled  to  express his admiration  for  new\r\n\r\nChina,  loyalty to Singapore must come first?  Did\r\n\r\nhe  tell  the  students that we cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\ncreate unnecessary class hatred, one indication of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  that  the  students always  charge  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce as being capitalists?\r\n\r\nTherefore,  down  with  the  Chinese  Chamber   of\r\n\r\nCommerce!  Class  hatred  is  so  rooted  in   the\r\n\r\nstudents'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminds.  What  capitalists are  there  existing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  To me, the many millionaires  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   here  are  not  all  capitalists  but  just\r\n\r\nprofessional    gamblers.    What    can     these\r\n\r\n\"capitalists\" invest in this country? Most of  our\r\n\r\ncapitalists  rely on telephones to  conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Sometimes  I think,  if  our  telephone\r\n\r\nsystem  goes out of order for just one  day,  many\r\n\r\nmillionaires will be bankrupt!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, did the Member for Tanjong Pagar say that\r\n\r\nthe short-cut towards merdeka for this country can\r\n\r\nnever be achieved by a violent revolution? We have\r\n\r\nheard  the hon. Member always professing to follow\r\n\r\nthe  Nehru line. The Nehru line shows us  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  achieve  independence by peaceful  evolution.\r\n\r\nDid  he  also  make clear to the  Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents  that he himself and the P.A.P. are  not\r\n\r\nonly   strongly  against  colonialism   but   also\r\n\r\nstrongly against Communism? I wish the hon. Member\r\n\r\ncan give me an answer to these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that yesterday, when the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar moved his motion, he never  touched\r\n\r\non  it  but  referred  to  international  affairs:\r\n\r\nHungary  and the Suez Canal. I was very interested\r\n\r\nwhen  he mentioned the Suez Canal, especially when\r\n\r\nhe   put  this  question - I  think  twice - to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications and Works,  \"What  is\r\n\r\nyour  stand on the Suez Canal?\" Now I want to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member himself, \"What stand do you take?\r\n\r\nAs  an Asian, as a believer in the Asian / African\r\n\r\nConference  spirit, what will your Party  give  as\r\n\r\naid  to President Nasser of Egypt? Why can you not\r\n\r\ncall  your colleague, Mr Jamit Singh, to start  a\r\n\r\nwater-front  strike in moral support of  President\r\n\r\nNasser? Why do you not make a statement expressing\r\n\r\nyour feelings on the Suez Canal issue? Why do  you\r\n\r\nnot also make a statement to express your feelings\r\n\r\nwhen  thousands  of Russian tanks  rolled  towards\r\n\r\nBudapest and you claim that you are for liberation\r\n\r\nand  the crushing down of counter-revolutionaries?\r\n\r\nWhat is the P.A.P. stand on that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite my strong support of the Government\r\n\r\naction against subversion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel   that   it  is  my  duty  to  make   certain\r\n\r\ncriticisms. The Government, it seems to me, cannot\r\n\r\nfully   understand  the  masses,  especially   the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  masses.  Sir,   the   Government\r\n\r\ncannot   understand  that  the   Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Singapore are more sensitive  than\r\n\r\nany  other race in Singapore. They have long  been\r\n\r\nregarded   as  second-class  citizens,  especially\r\n\r\nwhere   their   education  policy  is   concerned.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on account of this, the Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents do not feel that they are treated equally\r\n\r\nwith other students in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of Chinese students registered\r\n\r\nin  the colony is more than 200,000. The number of\r\n\r\nChinese  middle school students is  slightly  over\r\n\r\n10,000,  but  they  believe  that  their  movement\r\n\r\nrepresents  the whole Singapore student  movement.\r\n\r\nWhen  Chinese school students leave school,  they\r\n\r\nare  faced with problems ahead. There is  a  well-known proverb amongst Chinese school students that\r\n\r\n\"Graduation means disappointment\". When they leave\r\n\r\nschool,  it  is very difficult for  them  to  find\r\n\r\njobs.  Their  certificates are not recognised  and\r\n\r\ntheir  future  is  not secure.  Their  citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus  is  not  on  an equal footing  with  other\r\n\r\nraces.  As a result of all these factors, many  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese-speaking population  suffer  from  an\r\n\r\ninferiority  complex. I hope that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  give  careful consideration to the  Chinese-speaking  masses,  and  try  to  understand  them,\r\n\r\nespecially   since  we  have  not  achieved   full\r\n\r\nnational  status and bearing in mind the  forceful\r\n\r\nattraction  exerted from the Chinese mainland.  By\r\n\r\ntradition  and culture, it is quite  difficult  to\r\n\r\nexpect  all  Chinese-speaking  people  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir genuine loyalty to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to criticise is\r\n\r\nthat,  since  the Government took action  on  18th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  they have done very little  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  public of what they have done. Instead,  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  very strong organised movement  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  all  out  to do damage and to  mislead  the\r\n\r\nmasses, especially the lower income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore  public opinion towards this  issue  has\r\n\r\nbecome  divided and the Government seems  to  have\r\n\r\ntaken  no steps to prevent it. I am sure that  all\r\n\r\nof  us could have foreseen the trouble coming  but\r\n\r\nwhat  measures has the Government taken to prevent\r\n\r\nit?  Anyhow, the damage has been done. However,  I\r\n\r\nventure to suggest a few points to Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Hon. the Chief Minister has promised\r\n\r\nand  named  a  date for merdeka,  why  do  we  not\r\n\r\nimmediately revive the All-Party Merdeka Committee\r\n\r\nand sign a joint truce not to fight one another or\r\n\r\nplay  party politics any more, so that we  can  be\r\n\r\nunited into a solid body towards independence? Why\r\n\r\ncan  we not face facts? Today, the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister addresses the Hon. the Chief Secretary as\r\n\r\n\"my  dear  colleague Bill\", but I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary will sit next to Mr  Lennox-Boyd  next spring? Why should we not try  hard  to\r\n\r\nhave  peace during this transitional period  of  a\r\n\r\nfew  months only? In this particular case, I  wish\r\n\r\nto  give a few reminders to the P.A.P. Why  should\r\n\r\nthey  shout  so loud to demand that the Government\r\n\r\nmust   resign   and  have  an  immediate   general\r\n\r\nelection?  For  what? For the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar's ambitions as a Prime Minister? Has he done\r\n\r\nanything good for the independence movement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to mention the Press. The Press in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  am sure, must have a  double  duty.\r\n\r\nThey must report truly and honestly what they hear\r\n\r\nand   what   they   see.  They   also   have   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  educating our  people.  Public\r\n\r\nopinion,  as  has  been  clearly  shown,  is  much\r\n\r\ndivided  between  the two groups - the  non-English-speaking and the non-Chinese-speaking - and  I wish\r\n\r\nto  remind  the English Press, when reporting,  to\r\n\r\nconsider  at  the same time that they  print  over\r\n\r\n100,000  copies  of their papers and  to  remember\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  also hundreds  of  thousands  of\r\n\r\nreaders  of  Chinese newspapers  who  are  reading\r\n\r\ntheir  views.  We cannot deny the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nvernacular  papers, from time to time,  contradict\r\n\r\nthe English papers. We must find out why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  creates  that?  If these different  cultural\r\n\r\ngroups  cannot  fully understand and  respect  one\r\n\r\nanother  mutually, there will be  trouble  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chinese, it is my fervent duty to speak as\r\n\r\na  Chinese, because the problems facing  us  today\r\n\r\nare  so closely connected with the Chinese. I wish\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  Chinese in Singapore that  we  must\r\n\r\nrecognise  one  very clear fact:  if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve  independence,  we  must  merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, and if we merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, our population will be  just\r\n\r\nslightly over 50 per cent of the total. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must learn how to understand and to co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  our brother races, the Malays, Indians, etc.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot always bear ourselves up traditionally,\r\n\r\nculturally  or historically if we are too  closely\r\n\r\nconnected with the mainland of China and  we  may,\r\n\r\nunintentionally    but   emotionally,    try    to\r\n\r\n\"chinanise\" everything in this country, where many\r\n\r\nother   races   are  living  together   especially\r\n\r\nconcerning   political  beliefs.  China   is   now\r\n\r\npractising  Communism  and  we  cannot  say  that,\r\n\r\nbecause   we  are  Chinese  and  China   practises\r\n\r\nCommunism,  we  should therefore  bring  Communist\r\n\r\nChina's  formula and pattern of living  into  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  It will be very wrong and it  will  slow\r\n\r\ndown our progress towards independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall) mentioned the arrest of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)\r\n\r\nand  he  suggested  that  this  House  should   be\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the  findings of the  trial  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah. I take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nsay  that, no matter how much I disagree with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Timah, at least, he is  sincere\r\n\r\nand honest in his beliefs - unlike the person who is\r\n\r\nnow washing his hands of the Middle Road Group.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to point out to the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nthat,  since he has informed this House  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah is going to learn to master\r\n\r\nthe  English and Malay languages, it will be  very\r\n\r\namusing  to think that when - I do not know when - the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTimah  has  mastered them, it will  then  be  the\r\n\r\nright time for the Member for Tanjong Pagar to get\r\n\r\nin  to  learn  Chinese! Those are their  political\r\n\r\ndifferences. As a result of the 13 deaths and over\r\n\r\na  hundred injured due to the riots, I realise for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time  now  how  cold-blooded  are  our\r\n\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my friends told me that, from the look of\r\n\r\nthings at present, it would appear that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  is  ready to cash a cheque but  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants  a  post-dated cheque. I was  asked  for  my\r\n\r\nopinion as to who is right and who is wrong. I say\r\n\r\nthat  no matter whether the Labour Front wants  to\r\n\r\ncash  the  cheque  now or whether  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nprepared to accept a post-dated cheque, they  both\r\n\r\nmust  make sure that the money is good,  that  is,\r\n\r\ngood  in  the  interests of  the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\npromised  support to the present  Government  till\r\n\r\nthe  next merdeka talks but that promise  was  not\r\n\r\nunconditional. We reserved our right to  criticise\r\n\r\nthe  Government if it errs. Also, if any  Minister\r\n\r\nmisuses  his power and shows too much favouritism,\r\n\r\nit is our right in the public interest to bring it\r\n\r\nbefore this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will start on the question of curfew\r\n\r\nfirst. Not only do I wish to criticise but just to\r\n\r\nrequest  the  Government that,  perchance  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation arises, to avoid the hardships which had\r\n\r\nbeen  unnecessarily  imposed on  the  public.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is bound to preserve law and order  but\r\n\r\nby  taking  action  in  that  way  it  will  cause\r\n\r\nhardships   which   will   create   a    lot    of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction and bitterness in the minds of the\r\n\r\nmasses. I will give you, Sir, some instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, curfew was imposed in order to keep away\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public from going about the  roads\r\n\r\nto  create mischief but, Sir, where is the harm if\r\n\r\nany man sits down in his verandah with his family?\r\n\r\nIt  is  surprising that he is ordered to  get  in!\r\n\r\nRepresentations have been made to me from  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency and they say, \"The Ministers have got\r\n\r\nair-conditioned offices and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeautiful  bungalows. It is very easy to  talk  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  from there and to ask the  public  to\r\n\r\nexcuse  them for the hardships. But what about  us\r\n\r\nwho  stay  in  shop  houses and  cubicles  without\r\n\r\nventilation?\" In my constituency, the people  were\r\n\r\ncommanded to close even their windows. A group  of\r\n\r\nthirty or forty workers living together were asked\r\n\r\nto  close their windows. What do you expect  their\r\n\r\nfeelings  to  be? Yes, the Police might  say  that\r\n\r\nmissiles  might be thrown from those windows.  The\r\n\r\nproper  thing  to do is that such mischief  makers\r\n\r\nshould  be  watched and arrested but not everybody\r\n\r\nshould  be asked to close their doors and windows.\r\n\r\nCertainly not!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will mention one or two cases in which\r\n\r\ninnocent  people have been arrested. A coffee-shop\r\n\r\nproprietor  opened his door to let a  customer  go\r\n\r\nout.  Both he and the customer were arrested. This\r\n\r\nis surely stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Curfew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Persons returning from work were\r\n\r\nalso  arrested.  Certainly  the  Police  can   use\r\n\r\ndiscretion. There were many such people  who  were\r\n\r\ninnocent  and  they  have  unnecessarily  suffered\r\n\r\nhardship. I believe that they were only bailed out\r\n\r\nfor $5,000 by their friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will quote another instance of what\r\n\r\nhappened  to me personally. After the long  curfew\r\n\r\nfrom 3 p.m. on Saturday it was announced publicly\r\n\r\nthrough the radio that the curfew would be  lifted\r\n\r\nfrom  8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Sunday morning to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  people to do their shopping. I was  going  at 8.35 a.m. from Stamford Road to Orchard Road and  I\r\n\r\nsaw a stream of cars being stopped at the Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad  Circus.  When my turn came, a British  Tommy\r\n\r\nasked me, \"Where is your pass?\" I said, \"There  is\r\n\r\nno curfew between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\" He then said\r\n\r\ncurtly, \"No, there is a curfew on. You must have a\r\n\r\npass. Go back.\" All the cars turned back and I had\r\n\r\nto  travel two to three miles, more to reach home!\r\n\r\nSir,  why  this inefficiency? I do not  understand\r\n\r\nhow the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. the   Chief   Secretary   who   has   been\r\n\r\nadministering the Government all along should have\r\n\r\nfound such negligence in his Ministry. That should\r\n\r\nbe  avoided if - God forbid - such an occasion arises.\r\n\r\nThe  funniest part was that I had to send  someone\r\n\r\nto  a  Police station to get me a pass  because  a\r\n\r\nBritish  Tommy  or  a Gurkha  did  not  know  that\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  do  not  require passes.  The  Police\r\n\r\nofficer  said,  \"Oh,  no passes  are  allowed  to\r\n\r\nAssemblymen or otherwise.\" That was on the 29th at\r\n\r\nthe  Orchard Road Police Station at 9.30 a.m. I saw\r\n\r\na  Police circular dated the 28th that Assemblymen\r\n\r\nare not required to have passes. However, this was\r\n\r\nthe confused state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was very amusing to hear non-Chinese\r\n\r\nMinisters  during the curfew period talking  about\r\n\r\nChinese  education and culture. I think  the  best\r\n\r\npeople  to speak about Chinese culture are Chinese\r\n\r\nMinisters. I will be very much annoyed if  a  non-Indian  talks  about  my  culture  with  a  little\r\n\r\nknowledge. He has no business at all to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the greatest respect for my friend\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)\r\n\r\nfor his intelligence and for his study of politics\r\n\r\nfor  attaining  freedom for  this  country - a  non-Communist  and democratic Malaya. I  have  a  high\r\n\r\nrespect for him because during the last year and a\r\n\r\nhalf,  I have found him never to be personal  even\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is  attacked. Sir, personal  differences\r\n\r\nshould  be  forgotten when dealing  with  national\r\n\r\ninterests.  We  have  a brilliant  orator  in  the\r\n\r\nperson  of our former Chief Minister whose absence\r\n\r\nwas  so  much missed by the public. The  galleries\r\n\r\nwere  empty. \"Romeo\" was away. I am glad that  the\r\n\r\ngalleries are now full. The former Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nconfessed his failure this morning. The Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and he are both brilliant men but  I\r\n\r\nhave   said   before  that  they  lack   practical\r\n\r\nexperience in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win merdeka, tactics have to be adopted though\r\n\r\nthe   principles  should  not  be  sacrificed   or\r\n\r\ncompromised.  Tactics  which  are  most   suitable\r\n\r\nshould be adopted to achieve our aim. A great  man\r\n\r\nlike Gandhi took 30 years to perfect his weapon of\r\n\r\nnon-violence. There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere riots and troubles. He advised his people  to\r\n\r\nstop this violence and ultimately he succeeded. As\r\n\r\nI  said, Sir, tactics are very necessary. Now, can\r\n\r\nyou  win  merdeka by violence? You  have  got  the\r\n\r\nexample  of  Cyprus before you. The British  rifle\r\n\r\nthere is to see things resume their way. Take also\r\n\r\nBritish  Guiana. The Leftist Party  tried  to  run\r\n\r\nthings  in a leftist way and the constitution  was\r\n\r\nsuspended.   Take   another  example,   the   Suez\r\n\r\nposition. Britain is defying 62 nations. That is a\r\n\r\nfact.   Then,  how  can  you  achieve   merdeka - by\r\n\r\nviolence? Certainly not! What will be the  result?\r\n\r\nOur people will be shot and damage will be done to\r\n\r\nour  own properties for which we will have to pay.\r\n\r\nI  say that there should be a complete negation of\r\n\r\nviolence,   Then,  Sir,  is  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  going to give us merdeka on  a  silver\r\n\r\ntray  if we do not go their way? I have said  that\r\n\r\nit   is   almost  impossible  to  get   from   the\r\n\r\nConservative Government any freedom unless  we  go\r\n\r\ntheir  way. One thing is definite: violence should\r\n\r\nbe counted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is by constitutional means and\r\n\r\npeaceful  methods. You can see books and books  in\r\n\r\nIndia  to  show you how freedom can  be  achieved.\r\n\r\nThey  are  worth reading. My advice is to  take  a\r\n\r\nleaf   from  these  pages  and  follow  the   same\r\n\r\nconstitutional means of those countries which have\r\n\r\nachieved freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, students who are below the voting age should\r\n\r\ndevote  their time to their studies  and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, to keep their eyes open as to what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  this  country  without  giving  any\r\n\r\nallegiance  to  any Party but my advice  to  those\r\n\r\nstudents who are of voting age and who will be our\r\n\r\nfuture  leaders  is  that they should  take  every\r\n\r\npossible  interest in politics and  to  study  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own sake and for the sake of their country.\r\n\r\nIn every country, the movement has started through\r\n\r\nthe  students. It is also our duty  to  give  them\r\n\r\nproper  advice to follow the proper constitutional\r\n\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I firmly believe that the United Kingdom is\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  give up this strategic  island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore very easily because she has her interest\r\n\r\nin  white  Australia,  New Zealand,  Hongkong  and\r\n\r\nother places. She is not going to hand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover her power to some other alien country or  its\r\n\r\nfollowers. My advice to our people is that  if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to achieve merdeka, we must show our loyalty\r\n\r\nto  Singapore and not to any alien power; we  must\r\n\r\neschew  foreign or alien influence and drop  their\r\n\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a Communist but, at the same time,\r\n\r\nI am not an anti-Communist. England has recognised\r\n\r\nCommunist Russia and Communist China. What is good\r\n\r\nfor  the gander is good for the goose! I say  that\r\n\r\nwhile  not  being against or for, we must  protect\r\n\r\nour   own   interest.   The   Bandung   Conference\r\n\r\nintroduced the principle of Panchsheela, that  is,\r\n\r\nco-existence which means that while following  your\r\n\r\nown  politics  and your own way of life,  you  can\r\n\r\nstill remain friendly with other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my personal advice to my good friend the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief Minister is not to delay,  for  a\r\n\r\nsingle  moment, the opening of the merdeka  talks.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen months there have been two\r\n\r\nserious  riots  and discontent. The  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  said this morning that he does not  want\r\n\r\nthe  colonial rule. In other words, it  is  now  a\r\n\r\ncolonial rule and nobody can deny that it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause after all the Government is run with three\r\n\r\nex-officio Members and four Nominated Members.  It\r\n\r\nis not the elected Government which is running the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Yes,  there are elected  Members  but\r\n\r\nthey  are running the Government with the help  of\r\n\r\nthe  ex-officio  Members  and  Nominated  Members.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my advice is to open the merdeka  talks\r\n\r\nimmediately.  Of course, the United  Kingdom  will\r\n\r\ntry  to  delay this. Certainly, any country  would\r\n\r\nlike  to do this if it has power in its hands  but\r\n\r\nyou can force her hands. If we cannot, let us have\r\n\r\nan  election so that any one Party with a majority\r\n\r\ncan come into power. I do not mind which Party may\r\n\r\nbe in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I would like to say that there has\r\n\r\nbeen a lot of destruction during the riots but who\r\n\r\nsuffers and pays for it? I would advise the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore to refrain from violence. If anything\r\n\r\nis destroyed, we pay for it and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\ndoes  not  pay for it. No one pays except  us  and\r\n\r\nthat will harm us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

He\r\n\r\nanalysed  for  our benefit that  there  are  three\r\n\r\ncamps  existing  today: first, the Colonial  camp;\r\n\r\nsecond,   the  Communist  camp;  and  third,   the\r\n\r\nNationalist camp. When I challenged him across the\r\n\r\nFloor  to  announce to which camp he belonged,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Nationalist, of course.\" Sir,  I  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  doubts as to his nationalistic leanings\r\n\r\nup  to  the  time these riots started.  I  always\r\n\r\nbelieved in his sincerity to work for the national\r\n\r\ninterest of Singapore but when these riots started\r\n\r\nand  when  I  saw his statements in the  Press,  I\r\n\r\nstarted having doubts as to whether he was  really\r\n\r\nsincere or whether he was sitting on the fence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first statement that he issued as\r\n\r\nreported in the Press on 27th October reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A serious crisis has arisen as a result of the\r\n\r\ninept  handling  of the situation  by  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Coalition Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of heeding the warning signs of unrest\r\n\r\nand   tension  and  taking  steps  to   ease   the\r\n\r\nsituation,  the Labour Front Coalition  Government\r\n\r\nhas   made  the  situation  worse  by  its  recent\r\n\r\nactions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  next  statement  that  he  issued   was\r\n\r\nreported  in  the Press, I believe,  on  the  30th\r\n\r\nOctober, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the eyes of the people, the incidents that\r\n\r\nhave  occurred during the past four days have done\r\n\r\nmore harm to the Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\nthan what the P.A.P. could say or do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"The  Labour  Front Government's handling  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation was inept and the action that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government  was taking made  the  situation\r\n\r\nworse!\"  According to him, Sir, and his  Party,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  the  best  action that the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment should have taken which would have made\r\n\r\nthe  situation  better was  to  surrender  to  the\r\n\r\nrioters  and to arsonists, to let them have  their\r\n\r\nway  and to let mob violence rule Singapore.

Member  makes\r\n\r\nthat  he  is a Nationalist, cart anyone say  that\r\n\r\nthese statements were in the national interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, he said that there are three camps and\r\n\r\nhe  urged that to achieve merdeka, we should  play\r\n\r\none  camp against the other: the colonials against\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. Sir, I cannot believe that he  is\r\n\r\nso naive as not to see the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndangers  that such a situation may create.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  political child, Sir, and I am sure  that\r\n\r\nwhen he said that, it is not that he was not aware\r\n\r\nof  the  dangers that might be created. What  will\r\n\r\nhappen,  Sir,  if  we  achieve  merdeka  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  as  our allies? Will  we  get  a  true\r\n\r\nmerdeka?  Will we get a merdeka that will  benefit\r\n\r\nthe people? Will it be a merdeka, in fact? It will\r\n\r\njust  be an apology for a merdeka. It may be  from\r\n\r\nthe frying pan into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we strive for merdeka, we must choose\r\n\r\nour allies very carefully and we must see that  we\r\n\r\nmarch  to merdeka on our own strength and  not  on\r\n\r\nthe  strength  of doubtful allies as advocated  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar. Sir, I appeal to him\r\n\r\nto  do a bit of heart-searching and not to sit  on\r\n\r\nthe  fence. If he is a true Nationalist, he should\r\n\r\nwork  for the national interest. He said that  his\r\n\r\nParty  and  his  ground organisations  filled  the\r\n\r\nvacuum  which was created since 1948  up  to  the\r\n\r\ntime  of the present Rendel Constitution. To  what\r\n\r\npurpose  have  they filled this  vacuum?  He  has\r\n\r\nhimself   confessed  that  they  have   built   up\r\n\r\norganisations and that they have the men  to  talk\r\n\r\nto  the masses and organise them. Sir, is that  an\r\n\r\nacceptance  of the fact that the P.A.P. has  been\r\n\r\ninvolved in all these disturbances? I ask him that\r\n\r\nquestion,  Sir. If he is a true  Nationalist,  he\r\n\r\nshould work for the Nationalist cause but not  for\r\n\r\na  cause that will make merdeka a farce. We  live,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall)\r\n\r\nhas  pointed out, on trade and on the activity  of\r\n\r\ncapital  and if we get merdeka, we should  not  do\r\n\r\nanything that would jeopardise our position  as  a\r\n\r\ntrading  centre. We have no basic economy  of  our\r\n\r\nown.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar knows  it  very\r\n\r\nwell  and  admits  that fact. And  yet,  if  these\r\n\r\nactivities are carried on, I am sure that when  we\r\n\r\nget merdeka, we may have all our people starving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the riots and the curfew have created a lot\r\n\r\nof  difficulties and discontent and we have  heard\r\n\r\nthe Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) giving\r\n\r\nus  examples  of  the difficulties experienced  by\r\n\r\ninnocent people who technically broke the  law  by\r\n\r\ncoming out during the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurfew   hours.   Sir,  perhaps  some   of   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties and some of the arrests  of  innocent\r\n\r\npeople  were due to our not having been  organised\r\n\r\nto  deal  with such situations. Perhaps they  were\r\n\r\ndue   to   our   inexperience  in  handling   such\r\n\r\nsituations. It is possible, Sir, that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmay  make  us well experienced in this before  we\r\n\r\nget  our  merdeka. We have had two examples,  Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the  last year and a half or  so.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthen, we may be more experienced in handling  such\r\n\r\naffairs. But the fact, Sir, is that there has been\r\n\r\nphysical  damage which has not been very great - few\r\n\r\nbuildings  burnt,  some traffic lights  broken,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cars burnt, and so on. Then there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  damage  in other respects. Many  people  who\r\n\r\nwere   labourers  have  been  deprived  of   their\r\n\r\nearnings because they could not go to work  during\r\n\r\nthe  curfew  hours. Shopkeepers had to  close  and\r\n\r\nlose trade, Hawkers could not go out for three  or\r\n\r\nfour days because of the curfew. Farmers could not\r\n\r\nmarket  their  produce and so had to  go  on  what\r\n\r\nmeagre savings they had and the housewives and the\r\n\r\ngeneral public had to pay more for their food  for\r\n\r\nthe  few days that the disturbances lasted.  This,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  the tangible damage. Shipping  suffered,\r\n\r\nthe workings of this great port suffered and trade\r\n\r\nsuffered.  This, Sir, is visible damage but,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  amount of invisible damage that has been done\r\n\r\nis  that we have lost prestige as a trading centre\r\n\r\nand we have lost the confidence of those who trade\r\n\r\nwith  us and those who might have come and set  up\r\n\r\nindustries here to give employment to our  people.\r\n\r\nThat loss of confidence is a damage that cannot be\r\n\r\neasily  repaired. We were hoping that we would  be\r\n\r\nable  to  invite and to entice foreign capital  to\r\n\r\ncome  here  to  set  up  industries  so  that  our\r\n\r\nincreasing  population might get  employment  but,\r\n\r\nSir, with all these disturbances - two riots: one of\r\n\r\nthem a full-fledged affair - in the short space of a\r\n\r\nyear and a half, I ask you whether that is the way\r\n\r\nto  get  the confidence of foreign capital.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid,  Sir, that if this sort of thing goes  on,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  going to get any foreign capital  to\r\n\r\ncome here and who will be the sufferers then?  The\r\n\r\nsufferers  will be our own people.

I happened  to  be  in\r\n\r\nGeylang  that evening and I saw a crowd  attacking\r\n\r\npublic  transport  which  carried  people  of  all\r\n\r\nraces.

They\r\n\r\nwere  there to collect their children to take them\r\n\r\nout of danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the persons who were\r\n\r\nresponsible for the riots. Sir, who were\r\n\r\nresponsible  for advising the people  to  start  a\r\n\r\nriot?  Are  these people in this House, Sir?  They\r\n\r\nhave destroyed everything they could find in their\r\n\r\nway  and  yet they were not satisfied  with  that.\r\n\r\nThey  started spreading malicious rumours  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays that the Chinese were going to attack them.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government took action and appealed  to\r\n\r\nthe  members of the Malay community and we managed\r\n\r\nto  stop them from doing anything by telling  them\r\n\r\nnot  to believe in the malicious rumours that were\r\n\r\nbeing  spread. I can tell this House that  on  the\r\n\r\nmorning  of Saturday, a number of Malay  community\r\n\r\nleaders  went up to where there were  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nMalays who were supposed to attack the Chinese, to\r\n\r\ncalm them down. The Malays were told that whatever\r\n\r\nrumours  they  had  heard were malicious  rumours.\r\n\r\nThey then realised the truth and they responded to\r\n\r\nthe call of the Government to side and support the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  restoring peace on  this  colonial\r\n\r\nisland.

And now we\r\n\r\nhave  before  us  a motion which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew)  must  regret\r\n\r\nhaving  tabled, however eloquently he may  try  to\r\n\r\nhide  his  confusion.

If you had only taken  half-\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  combat the dangers when  they  broke\r\n\r\nloose ten days ago, having learned the uselessness\r\n\r\nof  half-measures employed last  year,  you  would\r\n\r\nhave betrayed your country and the trust placed in\r\n\r\nyou  as a Government. But because you have had the\r\n\r\ncourage   and  good  sense  to  act   firmly   and\r\n\r\ndecisively  to quell a rebellion which could  have\r\n\r\nassumed   alarming  proportions,  you   have   the\r\n\r\nassurance  of  renewed  support  of  the  Liberal-Socialists. Indeed, you could expect no less from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national emergency demands national-mindedness\r\n\r\nwhen  both Government and Opposition Members  must\r\n\r\nrally   to  the  national  interests  above  party\r\n\r\npolitics. Unless we in this House can learn to  do\r\n\r\nthis,  democratic government on this  island  will\r\n\r\nnever  prosper. Having reiterated our  support  of\r\n\r\nthe action taken by the Government - action which it\r\n\r\nwould have been criminal not to have taken knowing\r\n\r\nwhat   they  knew -  let  me  say  this:   In   all\r\n\r\ninsurrections  of this kind, the innocent  or,  if\r\n\r\nnot the innocent, the foolish are liable to suffer\r\n\r\nto  some  extent with the guilty. It  may  be  the\r\n\r\nstudent  who got mixed up in a rebellion  for  the\r\n\r\nfun  of  the  thing because he was  too  young  to\r\n\r\nrealise   into   what  dangers   and   with   what\r\n\r\nunscrupulousness  he  was  being  led  and  it  is\r\n\r\nevident he is still being led. It may be the young\r\n\r\ntrade  union  member  who was  forced  to  join  a\r\n\r\ncertain  group  or  lose  his  job  and  therefore\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  crowd  because  he  dared  not   do\r\n\r\notherwise.  It  may  be the  foolish  or  ignorant\r\n\r\ncitizen  who  committed the stupidity of  breaking\r\n\r\nthe  curfew just because he wanted to see what was\r\n\r\ngoing  on. I would ask the Government to  exercise\r\n\r\nthe  greatest care to see that the people who  can\r\n\r\nlearn from their mistakes are separated from those\r\n\r\nwho  were  the  real  plotters  and  schemers  who\r\n\r\nengineered the riots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

He said that these arrests were  carried\r\n\r\nout  in the early morning of 26th October and thus\r\n\r\nmaking  it appear that the Government had  already\r\n\r\nplanned  these  arrests. This,  Sir,  is  a  grave\r\n\r\ndistortion  of facts. The Police took this  action\r\n\r\nin  the  early morning of the 27th October,  after\r\n\r\nthey were satisfied that the Middle Road Group was\r\n\r\nactively connected with the riots,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave an account yesterday of ,the raids and\r\n\r\narrests  made  on  the premises of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nFactory  and Shop Workers' Union and  I  need  not\r\n\r\nrepeat  it here. I would like to stress,  however,\r\n\r\nthat this `action had brought about a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsignificant  change in the riot  situation.  There\r\n\r\nwas  an  immediate subsidence of  trouble.  In  my\r\n\r\nstatement yesterday, Sir, I gave an account of the\r\n\r\nevents   which  took  place  prior  to  the   riot\r\n\r\nincidents beginning 25th October. It was clear  to\r\n\r\nall  of  us where the responsibility lies and  yet\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar indulged  in  wilful\r\n\r\nperversion of facts -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow expressions of\r\n\r\nthat  nature to be passed about a Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw that, Sir. And\r\n\r\nyet,  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  by  a  clever\r\n\r\ndistortion of facts -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not any better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And yet, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar by a distortion of facts  tried  to\r\n\r\naccuse  the  Government of  being  the  fuse.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's action was made necessary and I  have\r\n\r\nalready explained why it was necessary. Each  time\r\n\r\nwe  acted, we acted to meet a situation created by\r\n\r\nthe  Middle  Road  Group. By their  actions,  they\r\n\r\nstand   condemned  both  here  in  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   The  hon.  Member   said   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  lost  the propaganda battle  from  the\r\n\r\n10th  to  the  24th October. This is a  deliberate\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation.  In  fact,   it   was   because\r\n\r\npeaceful meetings and the signature campaign  were\r\n\r\nhaving no marked effect that the Middle Road Group\r\n\r\nhad  to  change  their tactics. They  changed  the\r\n\r\ncharacter   of   their   meetings   and    adopted\r\n\r\ninflammatory, rabble-rousing speeches. Our records\r\n\r\nprove this, Sir. They fomented positive action  by\r\n\r\nthe  misguided  students,  hence  the  visits   by\r\n\r\nhundreds of workers to the Chinese High School and\r\n\r\nthe  Chung  Cheng  School on  the  20th  and  24th\r\n\r\nOctober and the resulting pickets and intimidation\r\n\r\nof other middle schools from the 22nd October. The\r\n\r\nfailure    of    constitutional    meetings    and\r\n\r\nparliamentary  language  forced  the  Middle  Road\r\n\r\nGroup to a more positive phase of struggle. It was\r\n\r\nbecause  the  same pattern of events  as  happened\r\n\r\nduring the Hock Lee riots in 1955 was taking shape\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government had to take action to  clear\r\n\r\nthe two schools of stay-in students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member said that if the speeches\r\n\r\nmade  by the Middle Road Group were seditious,  we\r\n\r\nshould  prosecute.  This  is  a  dangerous   over-simplification.  What is inflammatory  at  a  mass\r\n\r\nmeeting  may not be found to be seditious  in  the\r\n\r\ncalm  of  the courts weeks later. Whether  or  not\r\n\r\nprosecution  follows,  the  Government  must  take\r\n\r\nimmediate action to prevent further mischief.  And\r\n\r\nthis  is what we did by the arrests. Twice now  we\r\n\r\nhave learned the hard way how quickly inflammatory\r\n\r\nspeeches  can  produce  riots,  death  and  injury\r\n\r\nwhether or not they are seditious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that this Government\r\n\r\nadmitted that it did not have internal security in\r\n\r\nits  control.  This Government has  made  no  such\r\n\r\nadmission.  In  fact, I pointed out  very  clearly\r\n\r\nlast  month  that  internal  security  is  in  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Council of Ministers in which  the\r\n\r\nelected  Ministers have a majority of 6 to  3.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  what I have said so often: this Government\r\n\r\ntakes  full responsibility for what we have  done,\r\n\r\nThe only limit to our control of internal security\r\n\r\nis in the Governor's reserve powers of over-ruling\r\n\r\nus and, of course, in the strength of the security\r\n\r\nforces  at our disposal. The appointment, Sir,  of\r\n\r\nMr  M.  P. D. Nair as Assistant Minister  to  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary  is intended  to  bring  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity closer to the elected Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) touched on the\r\n\r\nProtected  Places  Ordinance vis-a-vis  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase.  I agree, Sir, I dislike any Member of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  being denied access to his  constituents\r\n\r\nbut  I  dislike too the suggestion that the action\r\n\r\ntaken by the Naval Base authorities arose from the\r\n\r\nProtected Places Ordinance. As far as I am  aware,\r\n\r\nSir, it was taken simply in exercise of the common\r\n\r\nright  of any authority to exclude strangers  from\r\n\r\nits  premises. And was it in all the circumstances\r\n\r\nof widespread riot and curfew so unreasonable that\r\n\r\nthe   Naval   Base   authorities   should   refuse\r\n\r\nadmittance  at  this time to one  who  had  openly\r\n\r\nassociated himself with the Middle Road Group  who\r\n\r\nhad  instigated the disturbances? I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member should blame his friends in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road who created an atmosphere of  tension\r\n\r\nwhich the Naval Base authorities had to take  into\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar draws attention to\r\n\r\nthe  action  taken  by certain  employers  against\r\n\r\ntheir  employees. I must accept  the  danger  that\r\n\r\ncertain  employers  may  take  advantage  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action  to victimise  genuine  trade\r\n\r\nunion   leaders.  Indeed  I  have  already  stated\r\n\r\npublicly  that employers must beware of just  this\r\n\r\nmischief. In my statement yesterday, Sir, I called\r\n\r\non  all employers to take note that trade unionism\r\n\r\nis  here  to stay and that any attempt to  smother\r\n\r\nit,  any attempt to exploit the workers, will give\r\n\r\nfertile  ground for subversive elements to thrive.\r\n\r\nI would ask all workers of Singapore who are being\r\n\r\nvictimised  to report to the Labour Department  so\r\n\r\nthat we can investigate into their complaints  and\r\n\r\nrender  all possible assistance. But, Sir, I  hold\r\n\r\nno  brief for spurious trade union leaders who  do\r\n\r\nnot  genuinely seek the welfare of the workers but\r\n\r\nseek  to exploit them for their own selfish  ends.\r\n\r\nThe  hon.  Member quoted certain  instances  to\r\n\r\nsupport  his point. I have with me, Sir, a  report\r\n\r\nof the Labour Department, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Tay Koh Yat. The Transport Employees' Union was\r\n\r\nformed  in  October  1955  by  the  Trades   Union\r\n\r\nCongress and not by the Company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Worse for the T.U.C.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It goes on to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Bus Workers Union Agreement with\r\n\r\nthe  management  in  December, 1955  stated  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  no  lightning strikes, By their  strike\r\n\r\naction   on  Friday  26th  October,  the   workers\r\n\r\nviolated  this  Agreement.

I wonder  how  many  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary  people of Singapore would have  accepted\r\n\r\nthat  description  when  they  first  saw  British\r\n\r\ntroops  manning road blocks on the morning of  the\r\n\r\n26th  October  after  a  night  of  constant   mob\r\n\r\nviolence  or  during  the  days  and  nights  that\r\n\r\nfollowed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Sir, we were grateful that prompt help came\r\n\r\nin  our  hour of need to ensure that the situation\r\n\r\ncould  not get out of hand just as we are grateful\r\n\r\nto  our  friends in the Federation for sending  us\r\n\r\nPolice reinforcements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, Britain now has the military\r\n\r\npower in Singapore. Apart from our splendid Police\r\n\r\nForce  and a few local forces, we have no military\r\n\r\nforces. We are dependent for help in time of  need\r\n\r\non  our friends. But this Government does not  for\r\n\r\none  moment  admit that that denies  us  political\r\n\r\npower nor will it deter us from pressing for  full\r\n\r\ninternal   self-government  when   we   meet   the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State early next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British troops were there to help our Police\r\n\r\nForce  to  protect life and property.  With  their\r\n\r\nhelp  in providing road blocks and reconnaissance,\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force was left free to operate against\r\n\r\nrioters,   arsonists  and  subversive  elements - an\r\n\r\noperation which they conducted with great credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, that on the debate on the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nridiculed  the Government for wanting to  raise  a\r\n\r\nSingapore Battalion. On the one hand, our  attempt\r\n\r\nto raise a Battalion of our own is ridiculed while\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand  when we have  to  depend  on\r\n\r\nBritish troops to guard life and property  in  our\r\n\r\ntime of need is again ridiculed. I really find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  understand the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

We\r\n\r\ncertainly  will not, Sir, if we follow the  advice\r\n\r\nof  the  hon.  Member to try and wrest  the  rifle\r\n\r\nbarrel out of British hands. I believe the British\r\n\r\nGovernment is less likely to yield to threats  and\r\n\r\nviolence  than to claims that are based  on  right\r\n\r\nand on our maturity to govern ourselves, which  we\r\n\r\nhave in good measure. The hon. Member says that he\r\n\r\nis determined to wreck the present colonial system\r\n\r\nas  quickly as possible. That is not our  way.  We\r\n\r\nare not out to wreck anything. We seek to build on\r\n\r\nthe  foundations  laid, to change  and  adapt  the\r\n\r\npresent   system  to  our  needs  and   to   self-government. We seek to construct, not destroy  and\r\n\r\nto  build a better Singapore with merdeka, not  to\r\n\r\ndestroy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fight against colonialism cannot be\r\n\r\nseparated   from  the  fight  against   subversive\r\n\r\nelements.  In fact, to win the one, we  must  also\r\n\r\nwin the other. The stronger we are internally, the\r\n\r\nstronger   will   be   our  case   in   the   next\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks. How long are we to hold  our\r\n\r\nhand  and  allow this conspiracy of subversion  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  unchecked? To have done so  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen to try to build up the house of merdeka while\r\n\r\nallowing the termite swarms to grow unchecked and\r\n\r\nto   permit  them  to  keep  eating  away  at  the\r\n\r\nfoundations of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vile rumour spread by the Middle Road\r\n\r\nGroup that the Government's action is aimed at the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  population   is   just   another\r\n\r\nexample  of  the  extent to which this  Group  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to  go  in their acts of subversion.  In\r\n\r\ntaking  action against this Group, the  Government\r\n\r\nis not attacking the rights of trade unionists, or\r\n\r\nfarmers, or teachers, or Chinese education, or the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  population.  We  are  liberating\r\n\r\nthem  from  a  vile form of political exploitation\r\n\r\nand  to protect their interests. Sir, while we are\r\n\r\non  the road to merdeka, it is wrong to divide the\r\n\r\npopulation  into  the various races  and  to  sub-divide   the  races  into  the  various  languages\r\n\r\nspoken. It is time we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstop  talking this. To me, to my Party and to this\r\n\r\nGovernment, there is only one kind of  people  and\r\n\r\none kind of loyalty - Malayans with a common loyalty\r\n\r\nto  Malaya. Sir, the new constitution which we are\r\n\r\nall  looking  forward  to  will  give  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights to all those who were not born in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  that when these rights are  won  for\r\n\r\nthem, full advantage will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) said that in the\r\n\r\ncase  of \"Operation Liberation\" one must also have\r\n\r\n\"Operation Co-operation\". You will recollect in  my\r\n\r\nstatement  yesterday that I  called  on  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one  in  Singapore to  co-operate  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in our \"Operation Liberation\"  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  all  work together for a  better,  for  a\r\n\r\nhappier Singapore, free from subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the speeches\r\n\r\nthat have been made on this amendment to my motion\r\n\r\ncan be divided into two categories: electioneering\r\n\r\nand  non-electioneering speeches.  I  congratulate\r\n\r\nMr  Francis Thomas, Mr Sutherland and the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanglin  (Mr  Ede)  for  not  having   gone\r\n\r\nelectioneering. Two of them do not have to  bother\r\n\r\nwith   elections.  Of  course,  Members   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment side, with the exception of  one,  were\r\n\r\nnot in a position to electioneer. They took the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

Yes, the\r\n\r\nbull  can  be more fierce and more dangerous  than\r\n\r\nthey thought, and they might find it necessary  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  rifle  barrel out  again.  But  I  was\r\n\r\ncheered  to watch the subjective strengthening  of\r\n\r\nattitudes.  At  the  time when the  merdeka  talks\r\n\r\nbroke  down, there were 13 of us in London.  Never\r\n\r\nin  my  life  had I felt more sick  and  tired  of\r\n\r\nseeing  weak need and wobbly characters.  When  it\r\n\r\ncame  to a moment of crisis and a decision had  to\r\n\r\nbe taken, all were in a flutter: \"What will happen\r\n\r\nnow?  What  will  happen to the  jobs?  What  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to my seat? What will happen to  me?\"  And\r\n\r\nnot  what  will  happen  to Singapore!  Well,  for\r\n\r\nbetter  or  for worse, that phase is  over  and  I\r\n\r\nthink the coming year till\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext  August  will see a further settling  of  the\r\n\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of looking at the matters we\r\n\r\nhave  been  debating. One is the short-term  view,\r\n\r\nthe other is the long-term view. In the short-term\r\n\r\nview,  we  have  been  arguing  about:  \"Who   was\r\n\r\nresponsible?  Why were they arrested?  Who  caused\r\n\r\nthe  riots? Did they cause the riots and then they\r\n\r\nwere  arrested,  or  were the  riots  conveniently\r\n\r\nengineered  for  their  arrests?\"  We  can  go  on\r\n\r\narguing   and  the  Government  will,   like   Dr\r\n\r\nGoebbels,  keep  on repeating:  \"They  caused  the\r\n\r\nriots and therefore we nabbed them. We imposed the\r\n\r\ncurfew and the riots subsided.\" It proves nothing.\r\n\r\nIf  the Government can prove its case, let us have\r\n\r\na public enquiry, let us have evidence laid before\r\n\r\nsome judicial tribunal and let the allegations  be\r\n\r\nproved. But I knew and all my Middle Road Group of\r\n\r\nfriends  knew that they were in for a  big  purge.\r\n\r\nThat  purge  started on the 18th of September.  If\r\n\r\nthere  were no riots on the 24th and 25th October,\r\n\r\nperhaps they would not have been arrested  on  the\r\n\r\n27th, But there would have been some other issues.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable. It was coming and they knew it.\r\n\r\nIt  was  not \"guilty conscience\". They  knew  they\r\n\r\nwere in for a purge. They made the Government  pay\r\n\r\na price, and that price is the long-term view. For\r\n\r\nthe time being, they are snuffed out, punctured -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Thirteen deaths!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, we all do not like riots,\r\n\r\nbut this was one which I knew, and I am convinced,\r\n\r\nwas  not  in any way sought or engineered  by  any\r\n\r\nsubversive group. This was a situation  which  was\r\n\r\ncreated  because of the Government's determination\r\n\r\nto  carry out a purge. And in the last resort,  it\r\n\r\nwas  the rifle barrel that settled it. As long  as\r\n\r\nthat is the situation the Government can make  all\r\n\r\nkinds of silly mistakes but the ring will still be\r\n\r\nheld and all will not yet be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not so easy either for the British,\r\n\r\nthe  Communist or the Nationalist to foretell what\r\n\r\nlies  ahead.

What is this revolution  in\r\n\r\nMalaya? Let me read this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Revolution in Malaya. People usually think\r\n\r\nof  a revolution as an armed uprising against the\r\n\r\nexisting    Government.   The    great    classic\r\n\r\nrevolutions in history have been of this type - the\r\n\r\nFrench,  Russian,  and  Chinese  revolutions.   I\r\n\r\nthink,  however, the use of armed  force  is  not\r\n\r\nalways an essential part of a revolution. Indeed,\r\n\r\ncertain types of uprising where armed forces  are\r\n\r\ndeployed  hardly deserve the name of revolutions.\r\n\r\nIn  certain South American states, for  instance,\r\n\r\narmed   revolutions   are  regular   occurrences,\r\n\r\nAdmiral  De-Soto with the backing of the  Marines\r\n\r\nand  the  Navy takes over from General  Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe  General then retires to a neighbouring state\r\n\r\nand lives there happily ever after. The rules  of\r\n\r\nthe  game lay down that ex-Presidents should  not\r\n\r\nbe  hounded  to  death but should be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  fruits of their previous  enterprise.\r\n\r\nWith foresight, all ruling Presidents observe the\r\n\r\nrules of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of thing used to take place regularly\r\n\r\nin  our  neighbouring state of Siam until  Phibul\r\n\r\nSonggram, the present Premier, put an end to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sort of revolution that matters is one\r\n\r\nin  which everybody is affected. People's  lives\r\n\r\nare changed\r\n\r\nirrevocably; some for the better, others for  the\r\n\r\nworse.  This  kind at revolution is  not  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  soldiers or generals. This  revolution\r\n\r\nresults  from  historical, social, political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  forces  which bring  about  such  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  in a country that the way in which  each\r\n\r\nperson  lives and thinks is profoundly  affected.\r\n\r\nIt  is  in  this  sense  that  we  speak  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Industrial Revolution\" in Europe and  it  is  in\r\n\r\nthis  sense  that we speak of the  revolution  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It  analyses for  students  what  the\r\n\r\nrevolution  is all about and I think hon.  Members\r\n\r\nin  this House would do well to subscribe to  this\r\n\r\nmagazine  and read it. Let me read just  one  more\r\n\r\npassage from this analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In Malaya, we have seen the failure of the armed\r\n\r\nrevolution staged by the Malayan Communist  Party.\r\n\r\nWe must at a later stage examine the causes of the\r\n\r\nfailure  of the M.C.P. rebellion. As things  stand\r\n\r\ntoday,  it appears to most people that it  is  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional struggle that will win independence\r\n\r\nto Malaya. Tunku Abdul Rahman's Government came to\r\n\r\nLondon  this  year to negotiate with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  the transfer of power from Britain  to\r\n\r\nan  elected  Malayan Government. The  negotiations\r\n\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How and why did this happen? Is there a catch to\r\n\r\nit?  Or  is it the result of some sudden and  long\r\n\r\noverdue  visitation of providence upon the  tender\r\n\r\nconscience  of the British Government?  These  are\r\n\r\nquestions worth pondering. Our answer is  that  it\r\n\r\nis  none  of  these  things. Our  answer  is  that\r\n\r\nthis - for  is - happy state of affairs is the  first\r\n\r\nresult  of an intense power-struggle in  a  three-cornered fight in Malaya between three forces:\r\n\r\nBritish  imperial power, Malayan  nationalism  and\r\n\r\ninternational Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round in the fight has gone to the\r\n\r\nNationalists    united   under   Tunku    Rahman's\r\n\r\nleadership.  The  Communists, who  had  for  years\r\n\r\ncalled the U.M.N.O. \"a feudal, reactionary, stooge\r\n\r\norganisation  subservient to British  imperialism\"\r\n\r\nsuddenly  awakened to the fact  that  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman and U.M.N.O. enjoyed the massive support of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  people.  The  British  on  their  part\r\n\r\nrealised,  especially after the  demonstration  of\r\n\r\nstrength  staged by Tunku in 1954-55, that  unless\r\n\r\nthey  came to terms with him they would ultimately\r\n\r\nbe  faced  with  a Dien-Bien-Phu. Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nnegotiation itself was carried out with  goodwill,\r\n\r\ncourtesy  and  decorum. But this  very  cordiality\r\n\r\nitself  is  the  result of the awareness  on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of  the reality of the power-situation.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in public statements, both sides declared\r\n\r\nthat  they were motivated entirely by the  highest\r\n\r\nmoral considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final count: What of the second, third and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  rounds?  It would  be  a  delusion  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  Tunku's  victory,  in  London  last\r\n\r\nFebruary heralded the conclusion of the fight  for\r\n\r\nan  independent and democratic Malaya. It would be\r\n\r\nan  even  greater  delusion  to  expect  that  the\r\n\r\npromulgation of the Constitution now being  worked\r\n\r\nout  by  the  Reid Commission will in itself  make\r\n\r\nMalaya secure for freedom and democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of power is only the first stage of\r\n\r\nthe  revolution in Malaya. The revolutionary  tide\r\n\r\nnow  sweeping over Malaya has yet to work out  its\r\n\r\ncourse. The three-cornered power-struggle will  by\r\n\r\nno  means be over by August 1957. By then  we  can\r\n\r\nsafely  predict  that the Malayan Communist  Party\r\n\r\nwill still have its armed detachments deployed  in\r\n\r\nthe jungle and its underground organisations still\r\n\r\nin  operation. The British armed forces will still\r\n\r\nbe  in  Malaya. British civil servants will  still\r\n\r\noccupy  important  positions. A  Malayan  Cabinet\r\n\r\nresponsible to the Legislature will be  in  charge\r\n\r\nof the nation's affairs under these conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three antagonists will therefore occupy the\r\n\r\nstage  in August 1957, though the balance of power\r\n\r\nwould  have  shifted.  What are  their  respective\r\n\r\nchances  of ultimate victory? What is the strategy\r\n\r\nwhich  each is likely to adopt? These are some  of\r\n\r\nthe questions to be considered in the next section\r\n\r\nof this article.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Read next week's exciting installment of Suara Merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think if Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse   do  not  grow  up  and  rise  up  to   the\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  situation, then we certainly  will\r\n\r\nperish.  These  are the problems which  we  should\r\n\r\nhave  faced some 20 or 30 years ago when we  would\r\n\r\nhave  had  a  much  better  chance  of  survival.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately  for  us, Malayan  nationalism  only\r\n\r\nbecame  a  force after the Japanese invasion  when\r\n\r\nthey  knocked the local people about and  suddenly\r\n\r\nawakened them to the fact that their fate was tied\r\n\r\nup with the fate of the country. It was only after\r\n\r\nthe   war   that  the  Nationalists  got  started.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if we want to survive in a  democratic\r\n\r\nMalaya,  we  must be able to hold that  ring,  and\r\n\r\nwithin  the  ring allow a free play of forces  for\r\n\r\npeaceful persuasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S.\r\n\r\nMarshall) talked of these nine months till August\r\n\r\n1957  and then presumably he thinks our  problems\r\n\r\nwill  be  over when we get this new constitution.\r\n\r\nThen there will be elections and there will be  a\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and a new government. The problem\r\n\r\nwill  still be there. It is here now, it  will  be\r\n\r\nthere in August 1957. In fact, after August  1957\r\n\r\nit  will  become more acute. Today the  Tunku  can\r\n\r\nsay, \"Let us not discuss Suez. Foreign affairs are\r\n\r\nout of my hands. Let us pray for peace.\" But after\r\n\r\nAugust  1957,  the Nationalists must  provide  the\r\n\r\nanswer  because we can no longer give this excuse:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  British.\" Therefore, the three-cornered power\r\n\r\nstruggle  will  become more intense  after  August\r\n\r\n1957,  not less. And to fight the Communists,  one\r\n\r\nmust   understand   how  they  think.   One   must\r\n\r\nunderstand what they are after. Is it evil?  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  convinced myself that Communism  is  an  evil\r\n\r\nforce. In fact, I agree with about 75 per cent  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they want to do. But it is that 25 per  cent\r\n\r\nof how they do it, that I object and oppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we formed the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  instead of joining the Labour Party or  the\r\n\r\nSocialist Party was because we did not believe the\r\n\r\npeople  who were then in the Labour Party and  the\r\n\r\nSocialist  Party  had  the  slightest  desire   or\r\n\r\nconviction  to bring about a social revolution  in\r\n\r\nMalaya   or  indeed  knew  anything  about  social\r\n\r\nrevolution.  If in fact, my colleague  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit  Timah  (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  were  a\r\n\r\nCommunist, then I would say, \"I agree 75 per  cent\r\n\r\nwith him. But I do not agree even 25 per cent with\r\n\r\nMembers  on the other side.\" Some people say  that\r\n\r\nwe  sit on the fence. We do not. We are positively\r\n\r\ncompeting, trying to organise. But we say  to  the\r\n\r\nelected  Members  of this Government:  \"It  was  a\r\n\r\npolitical  mistake. While the rifle barrel  is  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the British, to go round the back  of\r\n\r\nthe British and start the shooting was wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said yesterday that a wellknown Marxist\r\n\r\ndialectician said, \"A new society comes out of the\r\n\r\nrifle  barrel.\" I think I ought to read to Members\r\n\r\nin  this  House  this extract from  the  collected\r\n\r\nworks of Mao-Tse-tung, Volume II, page 272 - one  of\r\n\r\nthe  rare brains in this world. One may or may not\r\n\r\nagree  with certain objectives he wants to achieve\r\n\r\nbut one ought to listen to what he has got to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In foreign countries, no bourgeois party needs\r\n\r\narmed  forces under its direct command  but  China\r\n\r\npresents  a  different case; owing to  the  feudal\r\n\r\ndivisions  of  the  country,  whichever,  of   the\r\n\r\nlandlord or bourgeois blocs or parties has the gun\r\n\r\nhas power, and whichever has more guns has greater\r\n\r\npower.  The  party of the proletariat  that  finds\r\n\r\nitself  in these circumstances should see  clearly\r\n\r\nto the heart of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communists do not contend for personal military\r\n\r\npower (they should never do that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  let  no one follow the example of Chang  Kuo-tao) but they must contend for military power  for\r\n\r\nthe  Party and for the people. As, a national  war\r\n\r\nof resistance is going on, we must further contend\r\n\r\nfor  military  power  of the nation.  If  we  fall\r\n\r\nvictim  to infantilism on the question of military\r\n\r\npower,  we  shall get absolutely nothing.  As  the\r\n\r\ntoiling  masses  have  been for  several  thousand\r\n\r\nyears a prey to the deceit and intimidation of the\r\n\r\nreactionary  ruling classes, it is very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  them  to awaken to the importance  of  having\r\n\r\nguns  in  their own hands, Now that the oppression\r\n\r\nof   Japanese   imperialism  and  the  nation-wide\r\n\r\nresistance  have pushed the toiling masses  on  to\r\n\r\nthe   stage  of  war,  Communists  should   prove\r\n\r\nthemselves  the most clear-headed leaders  in  the\r\n\r\nwar.   Every  Communist  must  grasp  the   truth:\r\n\r\n\"Political power grows out of the barrel  of  the\r\n\r\ngun. Our principle is that the Party commands  the\r\n\r\ngun  and  the gun will never be allowed to command\r\n\r\nthe  Party, But it is also true that with guns  at\r\n\r\nour  disposal, we can really build  up  the  Party\r\n\r\norganisations, and the Eighth Route Army has built\r\n\r\nup  a  powerful Party organisation in North China.\r\n\r\nWe  can  also  rear  cadres  and  create  schools,\r\n\r\nculture  and mass movements, Everything  in  Yenan\r\n\r\nhas  been  built up by means of the gun.  Anything\r\n\r\ncan grow out of the barrel of a gun. According  to\r\n\r\nthe  Marxist theory of the State, the Army is  the\r\n\r\nchief component of the political power of a State.\r\n\r\nWhoever wants to seize the political power of  the\r\n\r\nState  and to maintain it must have a strong army.\r\n\r\nSome people have ridiculed us as advocates of  the\r\n\r\n\"omnipotence of war\"; yes, we are, but we are  the\r\n\r\nadvocates  of the omnipotence of the revolutionary\r\n\r\nwar,  which is not bad at all, but is good and  is\r\n\r\nMarxist.  With  the  help  of  guns,  the  Russian\r\n\r\nCommunists  brought  about socialism.  We  are  to\r\n\r\nbring about a democratic republic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first lesson we must learn, namely,\r\n\r\nthat if the Malayan Communist Party had more guns,\r\n\r\nthen   we   would  not  be  talking  today   about\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, its merits and  demerits.\r\n\r\nBut  I  ask,  \"In  this power situation,  do  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the other side honestly believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  British Conservative Party is going  to  say,\r\n\r\n'Here  is  the  gun.' Quit Malaya like  they  quit\r\n\r\nSuez?  Do hon.. Members on the other side  believe\r\n\r\nthat  they can identify themselves with the white\r\n\r\nman  who has the gun and hold the support of their\r\n\r\nAsian  people?\" The British are not here to  build\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy for us.  They  are  here\r\n\r\nbecause  of  tin and rubber interests, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  economic  investments in the  country.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  be so stupid as to lend ourselves  to\r\n\r\ntheir  scheme  of  things. They yield  only  under\r\n\r\npressure.  In this three-cornered power  situation\r\n\r\nas long as the British\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  here  with a gun, our first objective  is  to\r\n\r\ndislodge  them  and  take over  the  gun  and  the\r\n\r\ngovernment of the country. When you take over  the\r\n\r\ngun, then your battle begins. Then you can say to\r\n\r\nyourselves  and  to  the country:  \"What  kind  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  are  we going to have? This is ours  now.\"\r\n\r\nThen   you  can  decide,  and  if  one  is  really\r\n\r\ndemocratic, then one says, \"All Parties can preach\r\n\r\nwhatever     it     believes    peacefully     and\r\n\r\nconstitutionally but we shall hold the gun to  see\r\n\r\nthat  it is done peacefully and constitutionally.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  the power situation. To get the  maximum\r\n\r\nadvantage  out of this power situation,  one  must\r\n\r\nbuild  organisations and not wait for  spontaneous\r\n\r\ncombustions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one Organising Secretary in the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Party - only one - has brought  out  a\r\n\r\nmarked and noticeable transformation in the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Party  because  he happened  to  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained  once upon a time by the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  He knew how to organise. Had it  not  been\r\n\r\nfor  him,  I think the Front would be in bits  and\r\n\r\npieces. Look what happened, for instance, when the\r\n\r\nPress  rang up four Ministers and asked, \"What  do\r\n\r\nyou  think  about  the Duke of Edinburgh's  visit?\r\n\r\nShould  it be called off or not?\" Four Ministers,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, responsible men,  collectively\r\n\r\nresponsible for the government of Singapore,  gave\r\n\r\nfour different opinions to the Straits Times  and\r\n\r\nreduced their Party and the Government to a  state\r\n\r\nof  contempt.  But because of this organiser  in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front whatever internal  differences\r\n\r\nthere were in the Party did not spill out and they\r\n\r\nappear to be fighting as an organisation. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  first  prerequisite before joining  political\r\n\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have preached non-violence\r\n\r\nand  we  have  preached  it sincerely.  Those  who\r\n\r\nbelieve that the P.A.P. engineered the riots  must\r\n\r\nbe  utterly  mad. Apart from the moral reasons  of\r\n\r\nnot   using   violence  to  achieve  a   political\r\n\r\nobjective,  there  is this vital  factor  in  this\r\n\r\npower situation in Malaya, namely, that the Police\r\n\r\nare  predominantly  Malay, the  armed  forces  are\r\n\r\npredominantly Malay and the towns where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrioting will take place are predominantly Chinese.\r\n\r\nWe   knew - in  fact,  we  predicted  in  our  Party\r\n\r\nstatement which we issued in July - that any attempt\r\n\r\nby any group or by any sector of the population to\r\n\r\nimpose  its  will  on  another  by  force  and  by\r\n\r\ncoercion means, in effect, the danger of race  war\r\n\r\nin   Malaya.  The  danger  is  over  now  but  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Minister for Education knew  how  acute\r\n\r\nthat danger was during the recent riots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is being asked: \"Where was the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar? Why did he not tell the rioters  to\r\n\r\nkeep quiet?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, why did you not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nnever ran away and never will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my own mind, I was convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the Government asked for this. And once  the\r\n\r\nmobs  were  on  the streets, the only  answer  was\r\n\r\nforce.  Of course, there are people like  Mossadeq\r\n\r\nwho  can  go before a mob and weep, laugh and  cry\r\n\r\nand  make them disperse. But this is Asia, not the\r\n\r\nLevant, and whoever one can be - Tunku Abdul  Rahman\r\n\r\nor Chin Peng - when a mob is out, the only answer is\r\n\r\nforce. You cannot appeal to a mob that is out  for\r\n\r\nblood.  A  mob  is  already something  beyond  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of reason and will only respond to  force.\r\n\r\nWhatever  the  rights and wrongs of the  riots,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government knew it was coming  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  moved  into  prepared  positions   the\r\n\r\nmoment  it  happened. In fact, the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  such as to have  made  the  riots\r\n\r\ninevitable.  Once the situation had  been  created\r\n\r\nand the cry was the defence of Chinese culture and\r\n\r\ncivilisation,  with students in a stay-in  strike,\r\n\r\ndid  the Government expect that only parents would\r\n\r\ngo outside the Chinese High School to wait and see\r\n\r\nwhether their children were beaten up or not in  a\r\n\r\nflush out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has won this round of the battle\r\n\r\nbecause  ultimately force was the answer.  But  if\r\n\r\nyou  want  to win the long-term battle,  then  you\r\n\r\nhave got to organise the people on your side.  And\r\n\r\nyou  must  get  the  people who  can  organise  to\r\n\r\norganise  on  your  side. The first  task  is  not\r\n\r\nfighting the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  first task is to wrest the rifle barrel from\r\n\r\nthe hands of the British. When you have done that,\r\n\r\nthen  you decide what kind of Malaya you are going\r\n\r\nto  have.  That has been the stand of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party and will continue to be the stand  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party. I  can  think  of  no\r\n\r\ngreater  tribute than the one Mr Sutherland  paid\r\n\r\nme - I hope personally he does not think that I have\r\n\r\nanything   against  him - when  he  said  he   could\r\n\r\nforecast  90  per  cent of what our  attitude  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to be. That shows the consistency  and  the\r\n\r\nfirmness  of  the People`s Action Party.  We  say\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government's  tactics   were   wrong.\r\n\r\nPolitically,  the overall plan was made  on  false\r\n\r\npremises. Tactically, they were out-manoeuvred. It\r\n\r\ndoes not matter what happens in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it does not matter what happens in the\r\n\r\nnext  few months. The Member for Cairnhill  wanted\r\n\r\nto  know  if there would be a halt to this  purge.\r\n\r\nHow  can  there  be?  Once the  ball  has  started\r\n\r\nrolling,  where does it end? They cannot stop  it.\r\n\r\nHaving  gone  half the way, they have to  complete\r\n\r\ntheir  plan.  Completing  their  plan  means   the\r\n\r\ncreation of a vacuum. The creation of a vacuum  is\r\n\r\npossible as long as you have the rifle barrel. But\r\n\r\nif you cannot fill up that vacuum and you have got\r\n\r\nto  hold the situation by the rifle barrel all the\r\n\r\ntime  like Syngman Rhee in Korea and Diem in South\r\n\r\nVietnam then there will be many people like myself\r\n\r\nwho  have  got that 25 per cent disagreement  with\r\n\r\nthe  Communists.  But faced  with  the  choice  of\r\n\r\nsuppression and repression in a dictatorial  semi-fascist  state  and  the controlled  democracy  of\r\n\r\nCommunist  state, we will not have  the  slightest\r\n\r\ndoubt which one we prefer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon Members: Division , Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
