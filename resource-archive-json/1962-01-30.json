We saw the Prime Minister running from Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  to  Sarawak selling the idea to the  people,\r\n\r\nincluding  Bangkok, Saigon and other various  places - [Interruption]. I beg your pardon, Bangkok.  I  was\r\n\r\ninterrupted  by  the  Prime  Minister   who   sought\r\n\r\ninformation as to whether I was suggesting  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  selling  the idea in Bangkok, and my  reply  to\r\n\r\nhim,   Sir,  I  thought,  was  not  caught  by   the\r\n\r\nmicrophone. So I might repeat it. I told him  if  he\r\n\r\nfelt  the cap fitted, he could put it on. I have  no\r\n\r\nobjections.

Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, for several days we  have  heard\r\n\r\nMembers  of this Assembly speaking on this  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmotion. The Members of the Barisan Sosialis spoke of\r\n\r\ntheories  which they gathered from the textbooks  of\r\n\r\nLenin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis deserted the P.A.P. when their position  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. became untenable, in the hope  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would  be  paralysed,  because  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  prefer to indulge in violent  politics.  I\r\n\r\nask   them  whether  this  is  in  accordance   with\r\n\r\ndemocratic  practice.  The answer  is  `No'.  It  is\r\n\r\nclearly a Communist tactic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me speak on simple political\r\n\r\nmatters so that the Barisan Sosialis and the  people\r\n\r\nmay  easily  understand the difference  between  the\r\n\r\npolitical stand of the P.A.P., which is for  a  non-Communist, democratic and socialist Malaya, and that\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis. They indulge in deceit and\r\n\r\nfalsehoods.  Their  intention  is  to  hoodwink  the\r\n\r\npeople. I say to them that they should not have  any\r\n\r\nfalse  pride. The people cannot be fooled any  more.\r\n\r\nNow  it  is  even clearer that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  exposed  their true colours when they  expound\r\n\r\ntheories from the textbooks by Lenin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Barisan Sosialis will\r\n\r\nnot continue to fool the people. The people are keen\r\n\r\non a unification of the five territories. There is a\r\n\r\nproverb which says that united we stand, divided  we\r\n\r\nfall.  The Malaysia proposals reflect the desire  of\r\n\r\nthe people in Malaysia who wish to be united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion has the support of all the political\r\n\r\nParties,  except of course the Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nare  adopting  a  pig-headed attitude  - quoting  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  They still persist with their mischievous\r\n\r\ntactics of opposing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia proposals. In short, they are  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia because they have evil intentions.  In  the\r\n\r\npolitical  struggle that has been going on  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  I  have  heard a lot  about  nationalists,\r\n\r\ncolonialists, Communists, and so on Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthe  stand  of the Barisan Sosialis. The Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly are clear in their minds  as  to  the\r\n\r\nintentions  of  the  Barisan Sosialis.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  want  to  fool  and  hoodwink  the  people - particularly   the   people   of   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, Brunei and Borneo.  They  have\r\n\r\ngone astray. The territories comprising Malaysia are\r\n\r\nwatching  with  great interest the  attempt  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis to mislead the people. I urge  upon\r\n\r\nthem  not to adopt an attitude of false pride.  They\r\n\r\nseem  to oppose everything. They are against  merger\r\n\r\nand Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of the various\r\n\r\nterritories  in this region give their  wholehearted\r\n\r\nsupport  to  this  motion  which  will  bring  about\r\n\r\nindependence.  It is the duty of every  citizen  and\r\n\r\nevery political leader who owes an undivided loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the country to give his wholehearted support  to\r\n\r\nthis motion. The Barisan Sosialis are being used  as\r\n\r\nstooges by the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion represents the\r\n\r\nwishes  and desires of all the political Parties  in\r\n\r\nthe territories concerned. The slogans \"Let Malaysia\r\n\r\nLive\"  and  \"Merdeka Malaysia\" cannot be applied  to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. We should be proud  of  this\r\n\r\nMalaysia  concept and every citizen should  take  an\r\n\r\nactive  part  in  its realisation.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  are  trying  in  every   way   to\r\n\r\nfrustrate its realisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is just\r\n\r\nlike  a  frog under a coconut shell. The frog thinks\r\n\r\nthat  the  coconut shell is the world.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   are  strongly  opposed  to  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nproposals.  Perhaps  they  would  prefer  the  words\r\n\r\n\"Chinesia\"  or  \"Communisia\".  They  should  clearly\r\n\r\nstate their ideological stand in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu said\r\n\r\nthat we still see British soldiers in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nindependent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  today.  He alleged that the P.A.P. are  the\r\n\r\nadopted sons of the British. It is up to the Barisan\r\n\r\nto  state  their  stand. We in the  P.A.P. strongly\r\n\r\nsupport this Malaysia motion because we want to  see\r\n\r\nthe  realisation of merger and Malaysia. This is the\r\n\r\ndesire and wish of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the Member of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis that everyone of  them  is  a\r\n\r\ntraitor to the PAP. They cannot put their own  house\r\n\r\nin  order and yet they want to try to put the houses\r\n\r\nof other people in order. The Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis comprise traitors of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the object of this motion can\r\n\r\nonly  be  realised by people who are loyal  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry and are prepared to fight for it. Once again\r\n\r\nwe  urge the Malays in particular and the people  of\r\n\r\nother  races to beware of the Communist elements  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  who oppose  the  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I say that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nwhich  opposes  this  Malaysia  motion  is  a  Party\r\n\r\ncomprising  people  who  are  treacherous  to   this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Malaysia problem is\r\n\r\nnot only being discussed in this Assembly but it was\r\n\r\nalso  discussed in the Federation of Malaya and also\r\n\r\nat  the  Malaysia Solidarity Consultative  Committee\r\n\r\nmeetings  held  in  Jesselton,  Kuching  and   Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,   and  it  will  be  further  discussed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore from the 1st to the 3rd of next month.  In\r\n\r\none  of  these discussions, the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nrepresented  the Barisan Sosialis.  If  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis oppose this Malaysia Plan, why is  it  that\r\n\r\nthey  requested  to be  represented at  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nSolidarity Consultative Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution adopted at the Malaysian Socialist\r\n\r\nConference   held  recently  in  Kuala  Lumpur,   as\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  Berita  Harian  of  Monday,  29th\r\n\r\nJanuary, condemned the three previous Consultative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolidarity  Committee  meetings  on  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nproposals on the ground that the delegates to  those\r\n\r\nmeetings   in  Sabah,  Sarawak,  and  Kuala   Lumpur\r\n\r\nrepresented   their  own  selves  and  the   British\r\n\r\ninterests. This, Mr Speaker, means, in effect, that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis were interested in their party\r\n\r\ninterests   only.   The   Barisan   Sosialis    were\r\n\r\nrepresented  at the Malaysian Socialist  Conference,\r\n\r\nand  therefore  they were trying to  defend  British\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Utusan Melayu of Monday, 25th December reported a speech of the President of Party Rakyat of Malaya made at a Party conference. It said that the Malaysian concept initiated by Tunku Abdul Rahman was accepted in principle by Party Rakyat. It was not a new idea, as it had been thought of by former political leaders like Ibrahim Haji Yacob.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Barisan Sosialis do not really oppose\r\n\r\nthe  concept of Malaysia, hut what they  oppose  are\r\n\r\nthe fighters who initiated this Malaysian concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arguments are clear. As I said earlier, Party Rakyat accepted in principle this proposal as initiated by Tunku Abdul Rahman. Tunku Abdul Rahman has merely resuscitated this Malaysia concept which was mooted by Ibrahim Haji Yacob. If this Malaysia concept which we are debating today were initiated by Chin Peng, I am quite sure the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis would give 100 per cent support. So\r\n\r\nthe  problem is not the concept of Malaysia but  the\r\n\r\npeople who mooted this concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis say that the original aim of Malaysia is to attain the independence of Malaya, including the Malay Archipelago. With the establishment of Malaysia, Brunei will then be independent; so will Sarawak and North Borneo. They will be free from colonial\r\n\r\nclutches.  Is this not one of the efforts to  attain\r\n\r\nindependence? If the Barisan Sosialis consider  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not the way to get independence  from  the\r\n\r\nBritish,  are they suggesting that Brunei,  Sarawak,\r\n\r\nand Sabah should get independence by violent means?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee discussed the question of Malaysia in Jesselton, Kuching, and Kuala Lumpur, and unanimously agreed that with the establishment of Malaysia, Brunei will be free from colonialism, and so will North Borneo. The statement goes on to say that, secondly, to unite all those independent\r\n\r\ncountries into one single unit called Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  achieving independence  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfinalised yet. So the second question of integration\r\n\r\nof   all  the  independent  countries  to  form  one\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is:  when will these three territories  be\r\n\r\nfree from British colonialism? For then only can  we\r\n\r\nunite  these three territories. Mr Speaker, at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  these territories are still under  colonial\r\n\r\nrule,  and independence is being achieved  for  them\r\n\r\nthrough  Malaysia.  Only when  they  are  free  from\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism can we discuss the necessity, or\r\n\r\notherwise the merits and demerits, of uniting  these\r\n\r\nthree  territories and whether to include  Indonesia\r\n\r\nor  the Philippines. That is a subsequent matter.  I\r\n\r\nhope  this integration will not be with the Republic\r\n\r\nof China or the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the object of the Barisan Sosialis is to unite the Malaysian countries with Indonesia. I think the Barisan Sosialis are dreaming. As stated yesterday by the Minister for Health, the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis issued a statement in Bintang Timur saying that one of the objects of forming Malaysia is to let it come under the\r\n\r\ninfluence   of   Indonesia.   But   the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment itself has already made it clear that  it\r\n\r\nhas  no territorial claims on other countries except\r\n\r\nto liberate West Irian. So it is clear, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Barisan Sosialis  want  Singapore  or\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to merge with Indonesia, I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Government will not accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all the efforts of the Barisan Sosialis reflect nothing but a Communist attitude\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  bring disaster to the  people  of  the \r\n\r\nterritories comprising Malaysia. Mr Speaker, in the \r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu of 25th December, the leaders of the \r\n\r\nMalayan socialists say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not alone in our struggle to see the end of\r\n\r\nthe stationing of foreign troops in Our country.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This,  Mr  Speaker, says the leader  of  the  Party\r\n\r\nRakyat  means that it is not alone in its  struggle.\r\n\r\nIt  means  that  there  are other  important  people\r\n\r\nbehind it. I believe Mr Speaker knows who are those\r\n\r\npeople  behind  Party Rakyat. They are  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, which is the front line of the M.C.P. and\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I.  This is obvious, Mr Speaker, when  they\r\n\r\nsay  that  they  are  not alone  in  this  struggle.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all their efforts to oppose Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nthe result of leaders who claim to be socialists and\r\n\r\nwho  have  contacted leaders of the P.K.I. recently.\r\n\r\nThen  they  came  out  with the decision  to  oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  a  meeting of the Malaysian  Socialist\r\n\r\nConference in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, Mr Speaker, the leaders accepted the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan in principle. What they opposed  were\r\n\r\nthe people who initiated the Malaysia concept. As  I\r\n\r\nsaid earlier, if the Malaysia that we are discussing\r\n\r\ntoday were initiated by Chin Peng or D. N. Aidit,  I\r\n\r\nam quite sure the Barisan Sosialis would give it 100\r\n\r\nper  cent  support.  So. Mr Speaker,  this  clearly\r\n\r\nshows  that  the Barisan Sosialis is the channel  or\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle  and  the  stooge  of  the  P.K.I. of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I wish to inform this House that this Malaysia Plan is not a question of leaders of political Parties, but is a plan which will bring in its wake prosperity to the entire people of Malaysia. This is even more clear, Mr Speaker, when we see that the Barisan Sosialis is trying to wreck and to frustrate the prosperity of the people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

This  is  how\r\n\r\nthey get Communist support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am surprised at their attitude in fully\r\n\r\nsupporting the Indonesian demand for West Irian - that\r\n\r\nthat  area be returned to Indonesia. Irian Barat  is\r\n\r\nnot  independent,  but  when  we  have  a  plan  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  they oppose it and demand that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  first of all get self-government,  and  then\r\n\r\nonly  will  there be Malaysia. The  people  in  this\r\n\r\nisland  cannot understand the tactics of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,   especially  the  way   they   go   about\r\n\r\nbamboozling the people. We understand the Indonesian\r\n\r\ndemand   for  West  Irian.  They  have  opposed   us\r\n\r\nregarding  Malaysia. They do not want  us  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout a union between Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. Let us  consider  how  their\r\n\r\nminds work. On the one hand, they oppose unification\r\n\r\nand, on the other hand, they support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have always said they are\r\n\r\ngenuine  socialists. But if they are really  genuine\r\n\r\nsocialists,  Mr  Speaker, they will  not  have  any\r\n\r\ndiscrimination between the different races. Whenever\r\n\r\nthey move a motion, for instance, on education, they\r\n\r\nalways  talk  about the Chinese and  not  about  the\r\n\r\nother  races.  Do they call this the thinking  of  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  socialist? But if they are  really  genuine\r\n\r\nsocialists,   they   will   not   have   any    such\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  What we are  fighting  for  is  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people of Singapore  and  of  other\r\n\r\nareas which will be united with us in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, the Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have criticised Tunku Abdul Rahman.\r\n\r\nThey say he is a stooge of the British. Such remarks\r\n\r\ncannot be accepted because we know fully what  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman has done. He has done many things  for\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of the Federation. Now  he\r\n\r\nis  working hard to improve our country and the area\r\n\r\naround  us.  The  Barisan Sosialis  have  made  such\r\n\r\nassumptions.  They should swallow these  accusations\r\n\r\nand  not say this about the Tunku. Furthermore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, they do not seem to remember that not  many\r\n\r\nmonths  ago  they  praised him. But  now  they  have\r\n\r\nreversed  their  stand and are criticising  him.  Do\r\n\r\nthey not think that this is a wicked act  - an act  to\r\n\r\nsplit up the committees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Members of the Barisan Sosialis have said that Malaysia is sponsored by the P.A.P. I am surprised at this suggestion. Have we so much influence that we can ask the Governments of Brunei, Sabah and the Federation to follow our guidance? Are we not co-operating among ourselves to create Malaysia? But, Mr Speaker, we are not surprised\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  natural for them to  have  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude because they want to play politics. They do\r\n\r\nnot realise that if they play the wrong politics, it\r\n\r\nwill  burn them up. They say that the P.A.P. is  not\r\n\r\ndemocratic  and does not give freedom or liberty  to\r\n\r\nthe   people.  I  think  the  people  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nunderstand  us. We can see for ourselves  that  even\r\n\r\nnow  no other Party has followed the example of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  in putting  up  posters  at  bus-stands.  This  is not election time. Has  any  other\r\n\r\nParty done that? If we were not democratic, we would\r\n\r\nhave  arrested those who put up posters at the  bus-stands,  because this is against the law. They  knew\r\n\r\nthat  this was wrong. Yet they deliberately did  it.\r\n\r\nSo,  Mr Speaker, we can see how they go about their\r\n\r\nwork. They say we do not give them freedom of speech\r\n\r\njust  because we do not give them this  freedom.  We\r\n\r\nhave  allowed  them to hold rallies  many  times  at\r\n\r\nseveral  places in Singapore. Do they say that  this\r\n\r\nis  undemocratic on our part? We give this  back  to\r\n\r\nthem. If they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  in  power, they  would  not  have  any\r\n\r\nsympathy  for the people of Singapore.  If  we  have\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and are united, it would not be  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  oppose Communism. As the  Malay  saying\r\n\r\ngoes:  the  coconut fronds can either be used  as  a\r\n\r\nstick for making satay or we can tie them up into  a\r\n\r\nbundle  and make them into a broom. It is the  same,\r\n\r\nif  we  stand alone, we are not strong.  But  if  we\r\n\r\nunite  together, we will be quite strong and we  can\r\n\r\noppose  Communism. I say that I do not allow  myself\r\n\r\nto  be  influenced. I am willing to die in order  to\r\n\r\nfollow the right path. I do not like my country -  the\r\n\r\nplace of my birth - to fall to the Communists. We must\r\n\r\nremember that this country is the possession of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  this place. They should  not  bring  any\r\n\r\n\"ism\"  which is not agreeable to the people of  this\r\n\r\nplace.  They  should  not be proud  and  should  not\r\n\r\ncondemn the Government. They do not know what  they\r\n\r\nare talking about. They talk what they like. That is\r\n\r\nall, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better put the record straight.\r\n\r\nThe hon.

There has been great play on  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"plan\"  and  \"motion\". It is  argued  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that so far as he knows there is no\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan.  Though  he  does  not  support  the\r\n\r\npresent  Malaysia Plan sponsored by the British  and\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., nevertheless, he would like to  support\r\n\r\nthe  motion  moved by the Tunku and debated  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament on the 18th October,  1961.  His\r\n\r\nreason is that though he does not support the  plan,\r\n\r\nhe supports the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcept  of  Malaysia. I do not think I have  to  go\r\n\r\nover  the  old  grounds, Sir. All our speakers  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  stressed that we support the concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. But we do not support the present Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan of the British and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This has recently again been\r\n\r\nstressed by us at the Socialist Conference at  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  I am sure the Member for Anson, if he  were\r\n\r\nhere,  would understand and appreciate what  he  has\r\n\r\ndone.  But we feel that in moving the amendment,  he\r\n\r\nhas  failed to take note of one thing. That is, what\r\n\r\ntook place in the Federal Parliament when the motion\r\n\r\nwas  debated there on 18th October, 1961. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson thought that the motion had nothing to  do\r\n\r\nwith  what  took place in the Federal Parliament  in\r\n\r\nthe  debate that ensued. He thought that the  motion\r\n\r\nhad  nothing to do with the Malaysia Plan.  We  feel\r\n\r\nthat here is where the Member for Anson has made  an\r\n\r\nerror,  because  in  moving the  motion,  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated  the line and  the  plan  he  was\r\n\r\npursuing and -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With the support of the\r\n\r\nSocialist Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - hoping to adopt. He wanted a\r\n\r\nMalaysia with the Borneo territories - Sabah,  Brunei,\r\n\r\nand Sarawak - coming in as States and Singapore coming\r\n\r\nin   as   a   partner  with  no  automatic   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship and no proportional representation. Sir,\r\n\r\nthese Malaysia proposals or the Malaysia plan itself\r\n\r\nof  the  Tunku, as debated in the Federal Parliament\r\n\r\non  the date the motion was introduced, that is,  on\r\n\r\nthe  18th  of October, 1961, cannot be divorced  and\r\n\r\nseparated  from  the  motion  itself.  It   is   not\r\n\r\nrealistic,  Sir.  The amendment of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  amounts  to  changing the soup  but  not  the\r\n\r\nmedicine,  as  the  Chinese saying  goes.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the Member for Anson is saying that he  does\r\n\r\nnot want to take the mutton, to use another analogy,\r\n\r\nbut he is willing to take the mutton soup. So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  see,  Sir,  that the plan cannot be  dissociated\r\n\r\nfrom the motion itself. Similarly, the motion cannot\r\n\r\nbe  dissociated from the plan. They are one and  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing in the context of what took place in  he\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament on 18th October, 1961. Therefore,\r\n\r\nas  far  as we are concerned, the amendment  to  the\r\n\r\noriginal  motion  of  the Prime  Minister  makes  no\r\n\r\ndifference to the original motion itself.  It  would\r\n\r\nbe  wrong  indeed,  Sir, to fall into  the  trap  of\r\n\r\nsupporting the plan when the intention, in fact,  is\r\n\r\nnot to support the Malaysia Plan. The Workers' Party\r\n\r\nhas joined all the social Parties in the Federation,\r\n\r\nin Brunei, in Sarawak and in Singapore in condemning\r\n\r\nthe present Malaysia Plan. But the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nin  moving  the amendment, has given the  impression\r\n\r\nthat in supporting the Malaysia concept of the Tunku\r\n\r\nhe  is  also supporting the Malaysia Plan.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat,  in  fact, the amendment has done. Sir,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said a little while hack, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  joined  with  other socialist  Parties  in  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories, Federation  and  Singapore,  in\r\n\r\ncondemning the plan.

It  is\r\n\r\nan  inevitable historical process. The reunification\r\n\r\nof the peoples in the five territories, as far as we\r\n\r\nare   concerned,  is  something  which   we   should\r\n\r\ncelebrate  and rejoice at. The question  of  whether\r\n\r\nthis super merger will bring about prosperity to the\r\n\r\npeople in the five territories has become the  focal\r\n\r\npoint,  As  to the form of merger and what  it  will\r\n\r\nbring  to  the people, we will say that as  long  as\r\n\r\nthis  plan  will bring well-being and prosperity  to\r\n\r\nthe people, we will support it; and the broad masses\r\n\r\nof  the people will also support it. So we say  that\r\n\r\nthe whole question of super merger lies in the hands\r\n\r\nof  the poor people who were exploited for years. We\r\n\r\nhope  that by realising the concept of Malaysia  - and\r\n\r\nthe  sooner the better  - it will bring prosperity and\r\n\r\nimprove the livelihood of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a long-term objective of the P.A.P., we work\r\n\r\nfor  the  interests of the people. A  common  social\r\n\r\nsystem   exists  among  the  peoples  in  the   five\r\n\r\nterritories.  So this concept of a super  merger  is\r\n\r\nvery important as it will bring prosperity and well-being to the peoples of these five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk of the views of the people,\r\n\r\nespecially the Chinese, outside the House  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  Members  of  this House can  understand  their\r\n\r\nviews. During the last few months when the debate on\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia took place, the people  outside\r\n\r\nhave  been  very  enthusiastic  about  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould have a merger or not. Some of the Chinese are\r\n\r\nvery  frightened.  They  are afraid  whether,  after\r\n\r\nmerger, the Malays\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould suppress the Chinese and that, as in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, priority would be given to  the\r\n\r\nMalays   whenever  they  apply  for  jobs   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment service. Now, if that situation  were  to\r\n\r\narise, then the Chinese in Singapore are afraid that\r\n\r\nthey would suffer. But let me say that this fear  is\r\n\r\nnot  illegitimate.  We know for  a  fact  that  some\r\n\r\nMalays  in  the Federation of Malaya are  privileged\r\n\r\nand  have enjoyed certain priority over the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  cause  for worry of  the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope this merget and super\r\n\r\nmerger will bring equality to all races in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in all the other territories so that there will\r\n\r\nbe  no priority of one race over the other. If there\r\n\r\nis  priority  of the Chinese over the  other  races,\r\n\r\nthen   our  Malay  brothers  will  be  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst;  I  oppose such a plan.  As  far  as  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I  say  common equality  and  prosperity\r\n\r\nshould  be shared by all the races. If there  should\r\n\r\nbe   any  difficulties  and  responsibilities,  they\r\n\r\nshould likewise be shared by all the races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few days of\r\n\r\ndebate  on  this  motion, we  saw  how  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members  attacked us in  this  respect.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to tell them that we must not look  only\r\n\r\nat  one  side of the story. For example,  the  front\r\n\r\npart  of the Chair in which you are sitting is  red,\r\n\r\nbut  it does not mean that the rear of your seat  is\r\n\r\nalso  red.  So  if you listen to a story,  you  must\r\n\r\nlisten  to  the other part as well. We  just  cannot\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on one side. We must look  at  all  its\r\n\r\naspects in order to ascertain whether it is good  or\r\n\r\nbad.  We must realise that nothing in this world  is\r\n\r\nperfect.  It  is all the better for  us  if  we  can\r\n\r\nachieve  perfection. But it is impossible to achieve\r\n\r\nperfection, and so we must weigh the advantages  and\r\n\r\ndisadvantages,  and take those with more  advantages\r\n\r\nover the disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must weigh the pros and cons. So on the\r\n\r\nquestion of Malaysia and merger, we think we  should\r\n\r\nsupport  the  concept of Malaysia. For example,  Mr\r\n\r\nSun  Yat-sen, a political leader in China,  had  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of having a common world, which means  that\r\n\r\nall the peoples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the world would be under one roof. So the concept\r\n\r\nof Malaysia, as far as we can see, is similar to the\r\n\r\nconcept of a common world, because it reunifies  the\r\n\r\npeoples in the five territories. So I can say  quite\r\n\r\nsafely  that there is no doubt whatsoever about  the\r\n\r\nadvantages of the Malaysia concept because  this  is\r\n\r\nonly to the good of the people. If there is anything\r\n\r\nsinister about this concept, then we will oppose  it\r\n\r\nas long as this comes from the British colonialists.\r\n\r\nSo  I hope that all the Members in this House should\r\n\r\nbe  careful  if there is any sinister motive  behind\r\n\r\nthe  concept. But we must not do something good just\r\n\r\nbecause we fear the colonialist motives. As long  as\r\n\r\nthe leaders who are pushing through this concept are\r\n\r\nvigilant and they know that they will not fall  into\r\n\r\nthe  trap  of the colonialists, then we should  give\r\n\r\nthem  support.  If  the British colonialists  should\r\n\r\nthink  that  they  can make use of  our  leaders  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate  their  colonialist  rule,  then  I  will\r\n\r\nadvise them that all the people in Singapore and all\r\n\r\nthe  people in the world will condemn them for  such\r\n\r\nan act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you have pointed out, you say\r\n\r\nthat we should concentrate on the amendment, and  so\r\n\r\nI  would  like to cut short my speech. But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike,  however,  to  clarify  certain  points   that\r\n\r\nappeared in the newspapers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the Lady has not\r\n\r\nmisunderstood me. My remark about the amendment  was\r\n\r\ndirected  to  the  Member for Queenstown.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  can  speak  on the motion  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\namendment now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for\r\n\r\nyour guidance. I apologise for the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify certain\r\n\r\npoints. First, there is one point raised by Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nLark Sye as reported in the Sin Chew Jit Poh on  the\r\n\r\n27th  of this month. In his speech, he touched  upon\r\n\r\nthe  question  of merger between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation. He said if there is a merger, then  half\r\n\r\nof  the  population  in Singapore  will  lose  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights. Then what kind of a  merger  is\r\n\r\nit? We have many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese here, but there is no representation in  the\r\n\r\ntalks on merger. This has been said by Mr Tan  Lark\r\n\r\nSye.  I  would like to point out that I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  he  means as to what kind of Chinese  have  no\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  the  talks  on  merger.  If,  by\r\n\r\nChinese,  he  refers  to  the  absence  of   Chinese\r\n\r\nrepresentation,  then  it is incorrect  because  the\r\n\r\nmerger  talks  between Singapore and the  Federation\r\n\r\nwere carried Out between our Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of the Federation  of  Malaya.  Our\r\n\r\nPrime Minister here is a Chinese. As to Mr Tan Lark\r\n\r\nSye's worry about half of the Chinese population  or\r\n\r\nother races losing their citizenship rights, I  will\r\n\r\nsay that at a certain dinner we had occasion to meet\r\n\r\nMr Tan Lark Sye. When he expressed his concern over\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship  question, we  told  him  that  the\r\n\r\npeoples of Singapore will not lose their citizenship\r\n\r\nrights, except that they will elect among themselves\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who will be sent from  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Government. We also pointed out to  him\r\n\r\nthat  the people in the Federation cannot come  here\r\n\r\nto stand for election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now going\r\n\r\nback  on the merger proposals. We have finished with\r\n\r\nthat. She might touch on that in passing. But if she\r\n\r\ngoes  into  details, it is completely irrelevant  to\r\n\r\nthe motion, which is dealing with Malaysia. She must\r\n\r\nnot  debate  on  the  merger proposals  now  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  because merger is quite related to Malaysia  I\r\n\r\nam  mentioning  this  in order  to  clarify  certain\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\nthe  last  two weeks we have been debating two  very\r\n\r\nimportant motions, namely, the motion pertaining  to\r\n\r\nIrian Barat and the other on Malaysia. In the debate\r\n\r\non Irian Barat, the Barisan Sosialis were vociferous\r\n\r\nin their anti-colonial stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  even stated that Irian Barat should  be  freed\r\n\r\nfrom   Dutch  colonialism  by, force.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  never  at any time said that  the  Papuans\r\n\r\nshould have self-determination first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the same anti-colonialists in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, when it comes to taking  a  stand\r\n\r\nagainst  British colonialism, are offering the  same\r\n\r\nproposals  for Malaysia as the Dutch are making  for\r\n\r\nIrian  Barat. Since the famous Eden Hall tea  party,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis revolutionaries  have  become\r\n\r\ngreat  advocates  of  internal  self-government  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Borneo  territories  but  still\r\n\r\nretaining the British as their overlords.  In  order\r\n\r\nto   understand   the  Barisan  Sosialis   political\r\n\r\nsomersault, we must realise that the Communists  and\r\n\r\npro-Communists  are  dedicated  primarily   to   the\r\n\r\nstrategic   and  political  needs  of  international\r\n\r\nCommunism. It is significant that the opposition  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  has  been  voiced most  violently  by  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I.,  or  the  Partai  Kommunis  Indonesia.   The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists have condemned  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept  because they see in Malaysia a  counter  to\r\n\r\ntheir long-term plans to make Malaysia a part of the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Indonesian empire. They, the  Communists,\r\n\r\nsee  Malaysia as something which stands as a barrier\r\n\r\nto  the  expansion of Communist influence in  South-East  Asia.  The P.K.I., whose sphere  of  influence\r\n\r\nincludes South-East Asia, condemns Malaysia, and the\r\n\r\nlocal  underlings  like  the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nstarted implementing the P.K.I.'s policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our feeling that the attitude of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis towards Malaysia  merely  reflects\r\n\r\nthe  strategic  needs  and interests  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  not  those of the  people  of  this\r\n\r\nregion.  It is ironical that just as in its  heyday,\r\n\r\nWestern  imperialism deliberately fostered a  policy\r\n\r\nof  divide and rule in South-East Asia so that small\r\n\r\nand  feeble States could be manipulated by  colonial\r\n\r\npowers;  so  today we see Communists  following  the\r\n\r\nsame  policy  of preventing the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nstrong   united  States  of  Malaysia.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave now become servile stooges of the P.K.I. in its\r\n\r\nplans   to   keep   Malaysia   weak,   divided   and\r\n\r\nimpoverised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.'s approach to the problem of Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  based  on  the  fact that  the  over-riding  and\r\n\r\nprimary  objective should be the completion  of  the\r\n\r\nnational  struggle of the people of  Malaysia.  This\r\n\r\napproach   implies  not  only  the  elimination   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism, which is after all a negative  approach\r\n\r\nto  the  problem  of anti-colonialism,  but  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of Malaysian community, it also implies  the\r\n\r\nconsolidation   of  a  Malaysian   community   whose\r\n\r\nloyalties transcend racial, religious, communal  and\r\n\r\nother parochial considerations and affiliations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in the context of the Malaysian\r\n\r\nsituation,  socialists must lay  the  foundation  of\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness before they can utilise  and\r\n\r\nmobilise class solidarity which is so essential  for\r\n\r\nthe ultimate establishment of socialism in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  read out extracts from the resolutions passed\r\n\r\nat  the Malaysian Socialist Conference held in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  One  resolution as reported in the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  of  29th  January, 1962, page 18,  column  2,\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CONDEMNED the three previous Consultative\r\n\r\nSolidarity  Committee  Meetings  on  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nproposals on the ground that the delegates to  these\r\n\r\nmeetings   in   Sabah,  Sarawak  and  Kuala   Lumpur\r\n\r\nrepresented   their  own  selves  and  the   British\r\n\r\ninterests.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this resolution, supported by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  at  the  Kuala Lumpur Malaysian  Socialist\r\n\r\nConference, is correct, then the Member for Thomson,\r\n\r\naccording to his own colleagues, represented himself\r\n\r\nas  well as British interests. Since the expenses of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  delegates were met by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it appears that the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nhas  travelled  under false pretences  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrepresent British interests. What is the reason  for\r\n\r\nthis? Has the Member for Thomson stepped out of  the\r\n\r\nparty  line? Is this a public rebuke of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson at the behest of the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he  had said and done the wrong things?  Would\r\n\r\nhe, like Molotov, be sent to Outer Mongolia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person who attended the Consultative\r\n\r\nSolidarity Committee was the Chairman of the Sarawak\r\n\r\nUnited  People's Party. The Secretary of that Party,\r\n\r\nsupporting  the resolution passed at  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nSocialist Conference, has condemned his own Chairman\r\n\r\nas having represented British interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the average person, all these political\r\n\r\nsomersaults  will  be  confusing  and  difficult  to\r\n\r\nfollow.  The  truth  of  the  matter  is  that   the\r\n\r\nSocialist   Front  of  the  Federation   of   Malaya\r\n\r\nsupported Malaysia before the P.K.I. resolution. The\r\n\r\nSocialist Front leaders voted for the Malaysia  Plan\r\n\r\nin the Federal Parliament. Once the orders came from\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Communists to oppose  Malaysia,  all\r\n\r\nthe  so-called Socialist Parties were forced to  eat\r\n\r\ntheir  own words. Now that the Communist masters  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis in Jakarta have given the  new\r\n\r\nline, the Barisan Sosialis do not hesitate to make a\r\n\r\nscapegoat of the Member for Thomson by implying that\r\n\r\nhe was at Kuching to promote British interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so amazing about all this is that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  and  his  Barisan  colleagues,\r\n\r\nthough  proclaiming themselves Malayan  nationalists\r\n\r\nand socialists, are knowingly allowing themselves to\r\n\r\nbecome  traitorous dupes of the Indonesian Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  They  know  full well that  they  have  been\r\n\r\ninstructed  by  the  P.K.I. to  go  back  on  their\r\n\r\noriginal stand on Malaysia. They know that they  are\r\n\r\nnow  engaged on a deliberate sabotage of merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to  further not the ends of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  but  to help the Indonesian Communists  to\r\n\r\none day subvert and conquer the 10 million people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, the Barisan Sosialis Members are\r\n\r\nbeing  forced by their Communist overlords to engage\r\n\r\nin  political  duplicity  and  in  the  sell-out  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia to foreign Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Barisan Sosialis deny that they are\r\n\r\na  branch  of  the  P.K.I., but  they  respond  like\r\n\r\ntrained  poodles  to  the  orders  of  their  P.K.I.\r\n\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in this Assembly know that the denials of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis mean nothing, because political\r\n\r\nduplicity  is  an essential part of their  political\r\n\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that once they dismissed\r\n\r\nas  a  fairy tale our allegation that they had  paid\r\n\r\nsecret visits to Eden Hall in order to sell out  the\r\n\r\nindependence of Singapore to the British, in  return\r\n\r\nfor the abolition of the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the evidence was produced, they had to\r\n\r\nadmit   that  they  had  been  engaged  in  such   a\r\n\r\ndisgraceful and humiliating plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now denying that their opposition to\r\n\r\nMalaysia is a conscious effort to promote the  cause\r\n\r\nof  Indonesian Communism. They say, \"The  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nbranding all who oppose Malaysia as Communists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that this is not true. The P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nnever   said  that  all  who  oppose  Malaysia   are\r\n\r\nCommunists. We recognise the fact that there are non-Communists  who  oppose Malaysia  for  non-Communist\r\n\r\nreasons. We do not brand them as Communists,  though\r\n\r\nwe think they are wrong in fearing Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are saying is that there are proved\r\n\r\nCommunists who are opposing Malaysia for the sake of\r\n\r\nensuring   that   Malaysia  comes  under   Communist\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The Barisan Sosialis in opposing  Malaysia\r\n\r\nare  working to promote the cause of Communism. They\r\n\r\nare  exploiting non-Communist anti-Malaysia elements\r\n\r\nto further the ends of the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers react to our allegation of Communist control\r\n\r\nby  saying that the whole thing is a smear, but they\r\n\r\nnever deny our specific charges. Mr Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nhis  not  denied the authenticity of  the  documents\r\n\r\npublished in the book \"The Battle for Merger\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet these documents clearly prove that Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong is a fervent disciple of Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They denied too the report about Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong wanting Singapore to merge with Indonesia  was\r\n\r\ntrue.  Yet  the  recent somersault  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  on  the question of Malaysia  makes  clear\r\n\r\nthat  that is what they really want. The Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  made this cleat when he talked of Indonesia\r\n\r\nbeing the heartland of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Malaysian Socialist Conference is\r\n\r\nfurther  proof  that  the local  Communists  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and  front organisations  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation are now the messenger boys of the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Socialist Conference was originally\r\n\r\nintended  to  be  a  conference  of  socialists   to\r\n\r\ndiscuss,   among  other  things,  the   concept   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, which  the  Barisan  Sosialis   and   the\r\n\r\nsocialists in the Federation said was a good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the conference was postponed. No reason was\r\n\r\ngiven  for  this  postponement. Yet  it  was  common\r\n\r\nknowledge   that   the   success   of   the   merger\r\n\r\nnegotiations    and    the    Malaysia    Solidarity\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee meetings were  worrying  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Not long after the Kuching  meeting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee,  a  number  of  so-called  socialist\r\n\r\nleaders  from  Singapore,  the  Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories went to Indonesia.  Towards  the\r\n\r\nend  of  last  month, the P.K.I. came out  with  its\r\n\r\nblast against Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the so-called socialists changed their\r\n\r\nline  on  Malaysia. The conference of socialists  at\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  was  not to be  one  to  discuss  the\r\n\r\nsocialist way of realising Malaysia but a conference\r\n\r\nto  break up Malaysia. Since the P.A.P. was  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Parties  which  did not take  orders  from  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists, efforts  were  made  at  the\r\n\r\nconference  to see that the P.A.P. was  gagged.  Its\r\n\r\nworking paper was rejected. Its delegates were booed\r\n\r\nwhen  they revealed that some of the delegates  were\r\n\r\nCommunists and P.K.I. stooges. It was clear that the\r\n\r\nconference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  been  so  rigged that the P.A.P. would  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a chance to state its case for Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nCommunists had their \"boo boys\" ready to shout  down\r\n\r\nany  unpleasant  truths  which  would  have  exposed\r\n\r\nCommunist machinations. May I state here, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nafter  all  the  efforts, the  so-called  socialists\r\n\r\ncould  not  summon much of a crowd at the  Chin  Woo\r\n\r\nStadium. There were no more than 200 people present,\r\n\r\nand  of that a few were curious observers; many were\r\n\r\nschoolboys and schoolgirls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Socialist Conference was a flop, and\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis knows\r\n\r\nthis. This, in spite of the deception played on  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Kuala Lumpur. Posters were pasted in  the\r\n\r\nChinatown  in  Kuala  Lumpur, Petaling  Street,  and\r\n\r\nother  areas,  which indicated that  Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  Mr  Devan  Nair,  Mr  Woodhull,  would  be\r\n\r\naddressing   the  rally.  The  organisers   of   the\r\n\r\nConference knew that Mr Lim Ching Siong  would  not\r\n\r\nbe  addressing  the  rally. Indeed  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,  who\r\n\r\nwas  present  at the Conference, knew that  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong would not be addressing the rally.  Yet\r\n\r\nin  order  to  dupe the people of Kuala  Lumpur,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  posters  they mentioned that  Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  would  be addressing them. And  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbring  others who might be opposed to Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong but wanted to know what it was all about, they\r\n\r\nmentioned  Mr Devan Nair, Mr Marshall and  others.\r\n\r\nThis is their practice to attract a crowd. But after\r\n\r\nall their machinations and all their dupes, all they\r\n\r\ncould get were about 2,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis know that in fighting\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  they  are fighting a losing  battle.  The\r\n\r\nfact that they have now to become openly stooges  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I. shows clearly that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nis  neither  a  socialist Party  nor  a  nationalist\r\n\r\nParty.  It  is  a Party dedicated now  to  the  most\r\n\r\nshameful of all political acts - the betrayal  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry and the people of Singapore and Malaysia  to\r\n\r\ntheir Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist masters.

Obviously  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have\r\n\r\nlearnt  that their tiresome performance in  the  two\r\n\r\nweeks  of repetitious speeches during the debate  on\r\n\r\nmerger had not won for them either praise or support\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all their arguments in this debate, one thing\r\n\r\nis  clear, viz., they have learnt that to  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  support  merger in principle and then  quarrel\r\n\r\nwith   merger  in  practice  has  put  them  in   an\r\n\r\nembarrassing  position and has  confused  their  own\r\n\r\nsupporters.  So this time, on Malaysia, this  debate\r\n\r\nhas  been cut short because they are going  back  to\r\n\r\nthe   more  simple  and  straightforward  propaganda\r\n\r\nline - of  being  against  the  proposal,  oppose   in\r\n\r\nprinciple and in practice. What, is curious is  that\r\n\r\nthis  switch  of  line  coincides  with  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement   of   the  Indonesian   Communist   Party\r\n\r\nattacking Malaysia as being anti-Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From June to December last year, the time of the\r\n\r\nKuching Conference, the line of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nas  the  open front Communist political organisation\r\n\r\nwas  that  n  principle,  they  supported  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIndeed   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  Mr Lim Ching Siong, said in  writing  to\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  in  June last year  that  he  would\r\n\r\nsupport  a confederation of all the five territories\r\n\r\nprovided  internal  security was  left  outside  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Central Government.

And on 7th January in Kuala  Lumpur,  at\r\n\r\nthe  resumption  of  the adjourned  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nSolidarity Committee, after this policy statement of\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Communists, the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nwas  the  only delegate to the Solidarity  Committee\r\n\r\nmeeting  who refused to stand up and raise his  hand\r\n\r\nto say, \"Hidup Malaysia\", when everybody else did so\r\n\r\nat  the  call  of  Dato Mustapha, the  North  Borneo\r\n\r\ndelegate.  And  so at the so-called Socialist  Front\r\n\r\nConference in Kuala Lumpur, which even the blind now\r\n\r\nknow  to  be  nothing more than  a  Communist  front\r\n\r\nconference, the line was anti-Malaysia and, instead,\r\n\r\nself-determination for Singapore and Sarawak by1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Havelock has alleged that I\r\n\r\nhave  disclosed at a Party meeting in June 1960 that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was  a British plot.

When one year later, Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong  in June/July 1961  in  a  written\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  disclosed  that  he  supported  a\r\n\r\nconfederation  of  the  five  territories   provided\r\n\r\nsecurity was left outside the Central Government, he\r\n\r\nmust  have  known this-that Malaysia was a  `British\r\n\r\nplot!  Because by then the Member for  Havelock  had\r\n\r\nalready  turned turtle on us and gone  back  to  his\r\n\r\nformer  supporters and friends and superiors of  the A.B.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how is it that in June last year, knowing\r\n\r\nfull  well that it was a British plot, Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  still  advocated  a confederation - of  course,\r\n\r\nalways  provided  that internal  security  was  left\r\n\r\noutside the hands of the Central Government? For the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  the record, may I put the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHavelock's recollection right on what was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid?  I  never said that Lord Selkirk showed  me  a\r\n\r\ntelegram  which he sent to the Colonial  Office.  No\r\n\r\nU.K.  Commissioner does that and certainly not  Lord\r\n\r\nSelkirk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I recall referring to the Russian loan of over a\r\n\r\nthousand million rubles for the purchase of arms  by\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  saying that the  British  understand\r\n\r\nthat general tension in the whole area must mount as\r\n\r\na  consequence; that one day in the near future West\r\n\r\nIrian  will  be settled either by force  or  by  the\r\n\r\nimminent  use  of  force.  They  must  therefore  be \r\n\r\nconscious of the fact that once West Irian has  been\r\n\r\nremoved  as  a  colonial irritant on the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nRepublic,  the Borneo territories of Kalimantan  are\r\n\r\nbound  to loom large [I think it is more correct  to\r\n\r\nsay  the British Borneo territories than Kalimantan]\r\n\r\nin  the  forefront of the South-East Asian  horizon,\r\n\r\nand being practical people the British know it is to\r\n\r\ntheir advantage to move one step ahead of history.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as the Member for Thomson and the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Havelock have suggested - fear of the rising tide\r\n\r\nof  anti-colonialism in the Borneo  territories - that\r\n\r\nbothers the British. These are fanciful thoughts  in\r\n\r\nthe   context  of  the  realities  of   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nsituation.  Sir, the Member for Havelock  has  never\r\n\r\nbeen to Borneo. The Member for Thomson was there for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time last December, for  three  days  in\r\n\r\nKuching,  and two or three days in Brunei town.  And\r\n\r\nhe has not the slightest idea of the real position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me table a few salient facts. Sarawak has\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of a million people,  of  whom  about\r\n\r\nhalf  are  Dyaks,  one-quarter  Malays,  one-quarter\r\n\r\nChinese. The Dyaks were once part of the kingdom  of\r\n\r\nthe  Sultan of Brunei. Later they were ruled by  the\r\n\r\nwhite  Rajahs  who  gave special privileges  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays  over  the Dyaks. With the advent  of  direct\r\n\r\nBritish  rule in 1946, the special position  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays under the Rajahs was wiped out and there  was\r\n\r\ncomplete equality between the Malays and the  Dyaks.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  Dyaks, far from being anti-British because\r\n\r\nthe   British  Colonial  Government  improved  their\r\n\r\nposition  after the Second World War, are  extremely\r\n\r\nhappy  with  the  present position  of  equality  as\r\n\r\nagainst the previous position of inequality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only so-called anti-colonial elements in\r\n\r\nSarawak are found in the towns of Kuching and  Sibu.\r\n\r\nPro-Communist  elements, who have in  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears undergone training from elements in Singapore,\r\n\r\nare  operating amongst a section of the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nthe  towns of Sibu and Kuching - the size of Muar  and\r\n\r\nKluang respectively of some 10 or 15 years ago. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  15 to 20 years before the nationalist\r\n\r\nmovement  of the Dyaks, the Dusuns, the Muruts,  the\r\n\r\nMalays and the Chinese can reach the point where the\r\n\r\nBritish position would be at all threatened. And  it\r\n\r\nis not internal pressure which is making the British\r\n\r\nwithdraw gracefully before the time is up. I suggest\r\n\r\nit is the relentless logic of external pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis talk of the\r\n\r\nS.U.P.P. and the Party Rakyat of Brunei, I  do  hope\r\n\r\nthey  would put things in perspective. The influence\r\n\r\nof  the S.U.P.P. is only in one section of the total\r\n\r\nChinese population in Kuching and Sibu, the two main\r\n\r\ntowns  of  Sarawak, and not by all  means  the  only\r\n\r\ntowns   of  Sarawak.  And  not  the  whole   Chinese\r\n\r\npopulation live in Kuching and Sibu. Sir,  in  North\r\n\r\nBorneo  there  is no Socialist Party but  there  are\r\n\r\nabout 12 nationalist Parties now, and more are being\r\n\r\nregistered.  Of  a  population  of  430,000,  three-quarters  are  Dusuns, Muruts, and other  indigenous\r\n\r\npeople,  and  one-quarter  Chinese.  In  Brunei  the\r\n\r\npopulation is 20,000. Of these, 20,000 are  Chinese,\r\n\r\nand  of  the  20,000 only 3,000 have any citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  as subjects of the Sultan. 60,000 are Malays\r\n\r\nand  the indigenous people; 25,000 are adults.  Even\r\n\r\nassuming that every adult supports the Party  Rakyat\r\n\r\nof  Brunei, all it means is that a constituency, the\r\n\r\nsize  or about Geylang Serai, supports Party Rakyat.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Barisan  in Singapore and  the  Socialist\r\n\r\nFront  in the Federation, which unfortunately  today\r\n\r\nis  openly  and  heavily  Communist  penetrated  and\r\n\r\ndominated,  though  not to the same  extent  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  in  Singapore, talk about the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nfreedom  movements of Borneo, the British  officials\r\n\r\nthere  must be laughing their sides out. If it  were\r\n\r\ninternal pressure of the Borneo territories that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism has to contend with, then I  say\r\n\r\nthey  can safely remain there for another 15  to  20\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nationalist and a socialist Party, our\r\n\r\ndecisions  are based not on what the colonial  power\r\n\r\ndoes  or does riot do, but on what is or is  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of our people. The argument  has  been\r\n\r\nadvanced  by the Barisan Sosialis, in particular  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson, that if any  proposal  is\r\n\r\nsupported by the British colonialists, then it  must\r\n\r\nbe   pro-colonial   and  must  be  opposed   because\r\n\r\nobviously  the  proposal is in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists;   otherwise  they   would   not   have\r\n\r\nsupported   it.   Therefore,   since   the   British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  have  welcomed Malaysia,  it  must  be\r\n\r\nopposed by anti-colonialists. Sir, this may be anti-colonialist, Communist tactics and policy.  But  any\r\n\r\nnationalist  Party that works on such  a  fallacious\r\n\r\nprinciple and commits fatal blunders in the  process\r\n\r\nwill  wind  up in the gutter. The British  obviously\r\n\r\nknow  that  they must withdraw from the position  of\r\n\r\nsovereignty in Singapore and the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  quite  sure they are  very  happy  about\r\n\r\nwithdrawing from the position of sovereignty in  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories too quickly. That was the reason\r\n\r\nwhy I asked the Member for Thomson whether, in fact,\r\n\r\nshould  be  found  the British were recalcitrant  to\r\n\r\nleave, would he then support the liberation movement\r\n\r\nanalogous to West Irian? But, of course, he said  he\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  give me an answer on  this  Malaysia\r\n\r\ndebate.  But he has not done so. Sir, does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  it  is against the interest of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Malaya and the Borneo territories if  the\r\n\r\nBritish  say  it  is  in their  interest  to  leave?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Member for Thomson then,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  plot,  and therefore, we must  oppose  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  this?  Is  their  leaving  and  giving  us\r\n\r\nsovereignty  against  our  interest?  Must  we,   to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  and make the Communists happy, insist  upon\r\n\r\nthe  British remaining and prevent their withdrawal,\r\n\r\nall in order that the anti-colonial struggle can  go\r\n\r\non  and  on  to its protracted and final  conclusion\r\n\r\nwhich  they  hope  will be to  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists? Sir, since the objectives of nationalism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  different from the objectives of Communism,  so\r\n\r\nthe  yardstick of what is good and what  is  bad  is\r\n\r\nalso  different. The fact that the Malaysia Plan  is\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Indonesian Communist Party  to  be \r\n\r\nanti-Indonesia does not mean, first, that it  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  anti-Indonesia. It probably means that  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interest  of the Indonesian  Communist\r\n\r\nParty, and, to that extent, as was stated by Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong, on behalf of the Communists, it is part\r\n\r\nof  the  cold war strategy to prevent the Communists\r\n\r\nfrom  expanding their `influence'. That is what  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General    of   the    Barisan    Sosialis\r\n\r\nsaid - involving  Malaya,  Singapore  and  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories in the cold war. How? By preventing  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  Indonesia from expanding.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nSir,  even assuming, for the sake of argument,  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  anti-Indonesia - in other words,  it  is\r\n\r\nanti  a  Communist Indonesia, not  favourable  to  a\r\n\r\nCommunist   Indonesia,  because  the   non-Communist\r\n\r\nIndonesians are quite happy with Malaysia - why should\r\n\r\nthe plan be  bad for the people of Malaysia? The fact\r\n\r\nthat it is bad for a Communist Indonesia because  it\r\n\r\nprevents  easier  expansion of its  influence  over,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the  Borneo territories and later  Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation of Malaya may very well be a very\r\n\r\ngood  thing for the people of Malaysia. The  trouble\r\n\r\nwith  the Barisan Sosialis and their Communist  open\r\n\r\nfront  back-seat drivers is that they have  not  sat\r\n\r\ndown  to  calculate the consequences  of  their  own\r\n\r\npolicy  statements. In June/July last year, Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong said that he was in favour of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nprovided  internal security was outside the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. But on the 18th and 19th December,  with\r\n\r\nthe  assistance of the Member for Thomson,  all  the\r\n\r\nSarawak,  Borneo and Brunei delegates were convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the  best thing was to have external  affairs,\r\n\r\ndefence  and internal security in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, and an announcement was made  to\r\n\r\nthat  effect at the end of our deliberations.  After\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong lost  interest  in  the\r\n\r\nconfederation because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  Borneo territories have agreed, their leaders\r\n\r\nhave expressed the view that they should go into the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government.  Now first,  because  any  such\r\n\r\nscheme  to keep internal security outside the  hands\r\n\r\nof  the Central Government will obviously fail, and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  because the P.K.I. has come  out  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as  anti-Indonesia, the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nopenly  oppose  Malaysia both in  principle  and  in\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meanwhile Inche Syed Zahari, a former editor\r\n\r\nof  Utusan  Melayu, who was barred in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya for a diversity of reasons - which  at  one\r\n\r\ntime  I  had  hoped  to  be of  some  assistance  in\r\n\r\nresolving - and  who  is  now the  prospective  editor\r\n\r\nbehind  the  scenes  of  the Malay  edition  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, stated that the Tunku's  Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan  is  a fraud because Melayu Raya, the  original\r\n\r\nterm  for Malaysia, meant the incorporation  of  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories. Singapore, and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya into the heartland of Indonesia Sir, the pro-Communist  faction  of  the Socialist  Club  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya published with approval  Inche\r\n\r\nSyed  Zahari's article taking this line in the Fajar\r\n\r\nof  December  1950. And then we all  heard,  to  our\r\n\r\nconsternation  last  week on  the  motion  for  West\r\n\r\nIrian,  the  Member for Thomson repeating  the  same\r\n\r\nline  that  a real Malaysia means Indonesia  as  the\r\n\r\nheartland  and  that Malaysia without  Indonesia  is\r\n\r\nanti-Indonesia.  Sir, obviously  the  Barisan  fully\r\n\r\nsupports  the  proposal that real Malaysia  must  be\r\n\r\nMalaya,  Singapore,  the Borneo  territories  coming\r\n\r\ninto  the  heartland of Indonesia, and  because  our\r\n\r\nMalaysia does not mean that our five territories are\r\n\r\nput  into  the heartland of Indonesia, it  is  anti-Indonesia,  because, and I suggest the P.K.I. knows\r\n\r\nthat, it will make it more difficult for the P.K.I.,\r\n\r\nif it were to gain control of Indonesia one of these\r\n\r\ndays,  to  absorb the Borneo territories,  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  later  even  the Federation of Malaya.  So  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have turned and twisted their  line\r\n\r\nuntil   even  their  own  followers  are   confused.\r\n\r\nOriginally   they  wanted  to  oppose  merger,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, for the simple reasons that  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be in the hands of the Central Government  and\r\n\r\nCommunist activities would be conscribed. Instead of\r\n\r\nsincerely  admitting this and fighting  it  on  this\r\n\r\nground,  which  they fear nobody will support,  they\r\n\r\nhave  looked for all kinds of other reasons.  First,\r\n\r\nthey  want  to stop merger, with a lot of  malicious\r\n\r\nnonsense about citizenship and second-class citizen;\r\n\r\nthe worthlessness of labour and education being left\r\n\r\nin  the  State  of  Singapore. Then  they  want  the\r\n\r\nreverse  of  that, saying, \"Anyway,  look  at  that.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is valuable, it will be revoked  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government.\" As each one of those lies is\r\n\r\ndebunked,  they are then pushed into more  and  more\r\n\r\nextreme positions. Now since the Tunku says if there\r\n\r\nis  no Malaysia then there shall be no merger,  they\r\n\r\nsay. \"Well, then that is the best thing. Let us have\r\n\r\nno  Malaysia.\" But they were quite happy to  have  a\r\n\r\nMalaysia   with   security   outside   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  now that the P.K.I. has  declared\r\n\r\nMalaysia to be anti-Indonesia, then all they have to\r\n\r\ndo  is to echo it and follow that line. That settles\r\n\r\nit.  They  alleged,  first, that Malaysia  is  anti-Indonesia:  secondly, it is part of a  British  plot\r\n\r\nand   conspiracy:   third,   there   is   no   self-determination in the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask them what are their long-term\r\n\r\nobjectives  and  where  does  this  policy  of  just\r\n\r\nblocking the other guy going to lead them? What  are\r\n\r\nthey in favour of? They do not want merger unless it\r\n\r\nis  on  terms  which  will allow the  Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to capture the Federation.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nwant Malaysia since they have reserved that for  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Communist Party. What they want, so  they\r\n\r\nhave said, is an internally self-governing Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  defence, foreign affairs and sovereignty  left\r\n\r\nin  British  hands,  but with the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  abolished in order that the Communists  can\r\n\r\nrun  amok  and expand their influence. But what  are\r\n\r\ntheir  long-term aims and where do those  lead  them\r\n\r\nto?  What are their long-term objectives? Surely  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be to create an independent Communist  State\r\n\r\nof Singapore, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  would  be  both  economically  and  militarily\r\n\r\nimpossible.   The  declared  aim  of   the   Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  is  to set up a  Communist  Soviet\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Malaya and Singapore. Yet they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  merger,  although for all  these  years  since\r\n\r\n1945,  they have condemned the separation  of  these\r\n\r\ntwo  territories as being the responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nwickedness of the British colonialists and later  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation reactionary feudalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Wartawan, a little journal of some non-Communist and Communist journalists in Singapore,\r\n\r\nran  a series called \"Quo Vadis\". For those who have\r\n\r\nnot  seen the film, all it means is, \"Where are  you\r\n\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> \"Brother\". \"Where are you\r\n\r\ngoing, Barisan brother?\" That is the question  which\r\n\r\nevery  Communist  and  fellow-traveller  should  ask\r\n\r\nhimself.  As far as we are concerned  - the socialists\r\n\r\nand    the    nationalists - it   is   quite   simple:\r\n\r\nindependence, stability, peace and prosperity  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  non-Communist  socialist  Malaysia.   We\r\n\r\ntabled   this  as  a  resolution  in  the  so-called\r\n\r\nsocialist  conference  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  and  this\r\n\r\nCommunist  front  conference  using  the  banner  of\r\n\r\nsocialism,   was   afraid  even  to   discuss   this\r\n\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They wrote it down solemnly hoping  thereby\r\n\r\neverybody will forget that they are Communists. When\r\n\r\nwe  tabled that and said, \"Let us discuss this  non-Communist   socialist  Malaysia,\"  our   paper   was\r\n\r\nrejected   and  our  resolution  was  scrubbed.   No\r\n\r\ndiscussion  was  allowed from men  who  day  by  day\r\n\r\nabused  the  liberties of the democratic system  for\r\n\r\ntirades and untruths in the name of human rights, of\r\n\r\nliberty of speech, liberty of association. Sir,  the\r\n\r\ntragedy  of  the  M.C.P. is that,  contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nMarxist/Leninist  doctrine, it is  trying  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout a Communist revolution working through not the\r\n\r\nindigenous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraces - the Malays, Dyaks, Dusuns and the Muruts - but\r\n\r\nthrough the active immigrant section, the Chinese. I\r\n\r\nam  not  here  pronouncing judgement on  the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nbecause  I  was  never a member. I just  watched  at\r\n\r\nclose quarters. I am quoting now Mr Fong Swee Suan,\r\n\r\nMr  Sandra  Woodhull, Vice-Chairman of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  Mr  James Puthucheary,  adviser  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis - I do not want to quote ad nauseam.\r\n\r\nI  know  it is always unpleasant to have irrefutable\r\n\r\nproof  of  evidence of their own handwriting,  their\r\n\r\nown  statement, solemnly made on the  day  of  their\r\n\r\nrelease  from  prison, of their own  volition  after\r\n\r\nthey were released. They said the Communist movement\r\n\r\nin Malaya had failed because it has not been able to\r\n\r\nget  Malay  support. I am quoting them  when  I  say\r\n\r\nthis.   `The  inspiration,  the  impetus   and   the\r\n\r\norganisational  technicalities  are  those  of   the\r\n\r\nChinese Communist revolution. That is what Mr James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary told me; that is what Mr Woodhull  told\r\n\r\nme;  and that is what Mr Fong Swee Suan told me.  I\r\n\r\nspent  hours  analysing and reanalysing the  follies\r\n\r\nand  the blunders of the M.C.P. and I profited  from\r\n\r\nthese very objective and agonizing reappraisals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communist revolution in China is one of\r\n\r\nthe  greatest revolutions that had ever taken  place\r\n\r\nin  the history of China. It has given coherence,  a\r\n\r\ndisciplined   sense  of  purpose  to   replace   the\r\n\r\nwarlordship and the corruption that reduced China to\r\n\r\nanarchy  for  so  long. But even  according  to  the\r\n\r\nMarxist/Leninist  doctrine,  for  a  revolution   to\r\n\r\nsucceed it must be locally based and the M.C.P. will\r\n\r\nnot   be   locally  based  for  as  long  as   those\r\n\r\ninspirations cannot pull at the heartstrings of  the\r\n\r\nindigenous people of Malaya and Malaysia. If one day\r\n\r\nCommunism were ever to hope to make a really massive\r\n\r\nappeal,  then it must be home-based and it  must  be\r\n\r\nable  to draw the Malays, the Dyaks, the Dusuns  and\r\n\r\nthe Muruts together with the Chinese and the Indians\r\n\r\ninto  its whirlpool. That day can only come  if  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of the Communist Party passes  into  the\r\n\r\nhands of local Malays,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDyaks,  Dusuns  and Muruts, and the  inspiration  of\r\n\r\nrevolution   comes  from  a  close  neighbour   like\r\n\r\nIndonesia  with  a  people and a country  more  like\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Hence I say the significance of the P.K.I.\r\n\r\nstatement that Malaysia without Indonesia  is  anti-Indonesia.  It  is  easier to make  Malaysia  accept\r\n\r\nCommunism  from Indonesia through the Dyaks,  Dusuns\r\n\r\nand   Muruts  on  the  Indonesian  side  of  Borneo,\r\n\r\nappealing to kinsfolk on the Malaysian side  through\r\n\r\nMalays  from  Minangkabau and Sumatra, appealing  to\r\n\r\ntheir  kinsmen  in Malaya, than to get  Malaysia  go\r\n\r\nCommunist  from appeals of' thousands of miles  away\r\n\r\nfrom China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown said that the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Cairo has condemned\r\n\r\nMalaysia as a British plot in the cold war.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know how many Communists there are in  that\r\n\r\nSolidarity Committee, but I know that India  is  one\r\n\r\nof  the strong supporters and a great leader of  the\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  neutralist bloc. On  the  9th  December,\r\n\r\nwhen the Yang di-Pertuan Agong arrived in New Delhi,\r\n\r\nthe Vice-President of India, Dr Radha Krishnan,  at\r\n\r\na State banquet on behalf of the President of India,\r\n\r\nwho  was  then indisposed, stated that India  hailed\r\n\r\nand  welcome the plan to include Singapore,  Borneo,\r\n\r\nSarawak,  Brunei and the Federation in Malaysia.  He\r\n\r\nexpressed   the  hope  that  such  a   State   would\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the peace and prosperity of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  wished Malaya success in the execution  of  its\r\n\r\nplan.  Sir, this comes from the head of the  largest\r\n\r\nnon-Communist neutral nation. What I want to ask the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown is: is he suggesting that  he\r\n\r\nand  his  fellow travellers in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  more  anti-colonial than Mr Nehru,  Dr  Radha\r\n\r\nKrishnan,  or President Prasad? Or is he  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  the  Indian Government is less  well  informed\r\n\r\nthan the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Cairo?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in the course of the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the merger proposals of having  sold  out\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Therefore, it was my great  pleasure  to\r\n\r\nwatch the Member for Thomson  - who obviously gets  no\r\n\r\npleasure in hearing things like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  recounted to him - both at Kuching and at  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur recently, for there he found the North Borneo\r\n\r\nand Sarawak delegates pressing for the same kind  of\r\n\r\nconcessions   and  safeguards  that  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  obtained  from  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  They wanted autonomy in a number of spheres\r\n\r\nalso. They did not want to go in as a complete State\r\n\r\nlike  one  of  the  eleven  States  in  the  present\r\n\r\nFederation because they had certain local  interests\r\n\r\nto  protect.  They wanted to prevent free  migration\r\n\r\ninto    their   territories.   They   pressed    for\r\n\r\nBorneonisation, not Malayanisation, of  their  civil\r\n\r\nservice. They made mention of a separate citizenship\r\n\r\nin  order that people from the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  Singapore cannot go to North Borneo and Sarawak\r\n\r\nfreely and outvote the people there. And yet we were\r\n\r\nhere  falsely and maliciously accused of having sold\r\n\r\nout   Singapore    - we  who  have  obtained   special\r\n\r\nnationality  rights, automatic  conversion  for  all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens into Federation  nationals  with\r\n\r\nequal rights as Federation citizens even though they\r\n\r\ncould  not  qualify  under  the  present  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, may I just say that a Press report\r\n\r\nreferred  to  by the Member for Bras Basah  about  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr Tan Lark Sye,\r\n\r\nsaying  half  of  the people would be  disfranchised\r\n\r\nafter merger, must be false and untrue, because  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Lark Sye on the 27th of November last year, had\r\n\r\ndinner  with us and expressed great satisfaction  at\r\n\r\nthe  arrangements whereby nobody in  Singapore  lost\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and at the fact that it  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nfair  that if Singapore citizens cannot vote in  the\r\n\r\nFederation, neither can Federation citizens vote  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  from  time to  time  we  get  these\r\n\r\ndeliberate,  malicious  either  misunderstanding  or\r\n\r\nmisreporting.  So the battle will go  on  until  the\r\n\r\nlast of every malicious lie has been nailed down  to\r\n\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson was present in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  when  the citizenship rules for  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories were discussed; citizenship rules\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto decide who will be the citizens of Malaysia. Only\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects  in Sarawak and North  Borneo  and\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  the  Sultan  of  Brunei  will   become\r\n\r\nFederation citizens. Those not permanently  resident\r\n\r\nthere  must  have  both - they  themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nparents,  their  fathers,  must  be  born   in   the\r\n\r\nterritories  before they can qualify for citizenship\r\n\r\nof  the Federation. Sir, under these conditions,  90\r\n\r\nper cent of Singapore citizens who were not born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be disqualified. In other words,  90\r\n\r\nper   cent  of  340,000  citizens  by  registration,\r\n\r\nbecause   they   were  not  born   here,   will   be\r\n\r\ndisqualified.  So we have reached special  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation to allow all Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nto    keep    their   Singapore   citizenship    and\r\n\r\nautomatically   have   equal  rights   by   becoming\r\n\r\nFederation  nationals. Sir, the  Borneo  territories\r\n\r\ncould agree to these conditions because 95 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  their  population  were  born  and  bred  there,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Chinese in Borneo.  The  immigration\r\n\r\nlaws  of  Borneo have been so strict since  the  war\r\n\r\nthat  only  5 per cent are new immigrants  who  have\r\n\r\njust come from outside, namely, Indonesia and China;\r\n\r\nfrom China via Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the curious thing the Member for Thomson had\r\n\r\nto  explain  away was -  and I asked him this  at  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia     Solidarity    Consultative    Committee\r\n\r\nmeeting - if the agreement between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya was a sell-out,  why  did  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  want the same  concessions  and\r\n\r\nsafeguards   which  the  Singapore  Government   had\r\n\r\nobtained?  I  asked the Member for Thomson  in  open\r\n\r\nsession  whether, by virtue of the  remakes  he  was\r\n\r\nmaking  about the people of Borneo the necessity  to\r\n\r\nprotect them and so on, he doubted the competence or\r\n\r\nthe  standing of the delegates from Borneo,  Sarawak\r\n\r\nand  Brunei. He stood up - and it is on the record  of\r\n\r\nthe  Kuching conference - and admitted that they  were\r\n\r\nfully competent and fully qualified to represent the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Sarawak and North Borneo. He knows  that\r\n\r\nthe representatives of the people of Sarawak are men\r\n\r\nwho have been elected in local government elections.\r\n\r\nMind you, I do not know if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson understood the importance of when\r\n\r\nin  Rome, as the saying goes, not acting contrary to\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Roman's do. He turned up at Kuching  with\r\n\r\ngreat  revolutionary  force, verve  and  fervour  to\r\n\r\nunfurl  the banner of revolution, took off  his  tie\r\n\r\nand   his  coat.  I  understand  some  very  elderly\r\n\r\ngentlemen  there, who represent thousands of  people\r\n\r\nup  the Baran River and the Rejang River, turned  up\r\n\r\nto  do  honour  to  the occasion. They  brought  out\r\n\r\nfamily heirlooms and beads and necklaces round their\r\n\r\nnecks  and all the other tokens of respect  for  the\r\n\r\noccasion.  I  am  sorry to say that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson, much to his disappointment, discovered that\r\n\r\nhe  was  cutting no ice with men who talked politely\r\n\r\nbut whose word carried the authority of the whole of\r\n\r\nthe  inhabitants  up  the  various  rivers  and  the\r\n\r\ntributaries  of  those rivers. One chief  turned  up\r\n\r\nwith  bear's teeth attached to his ears to do honour\r\n\r\nto  the occasion. This great revolutionary from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan will be  able to confirm this. I am told that\r\n\r\nthese  bear's  teeth signify courage,  tenacity  and\r\n\r\ndecisiveness, because once the teeth sink in, it  is\r\n\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amongst the other happy events in the\r\n\r\nSolidarity Consultative Committee meeting  were  the\r\n\r\ntremendous  cheers  from all sectors  of  the  crowd\r\n\r\npresent. One of the Dyak chieftains said that in the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  where he came from, if the  Communist\r\n\r\ngave  trouble - I  did not understand him  altogether,\r\n\r\nSir,  because  I  am  not well versed  in  the  Dyak\r\n\r\nlanguage hut I understood a few words here and there\r\n\r\nby  his  gesticulations -  he  left  me  in  no  doubt\r\n\r\nwhatever  of  the traditional method  of  the  Dyaks\r\n\r\ndealing   with  troublesome  people.  And  tumultous\r\n\r\napplause  from  the Chairman of the  S.U.P.P.  As  I\r\n\r\nturned  round to my colleague, Inche Ahmad,  lo  and\r\n\r\nbehold,  to  his  right, there was  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson sitting rather morose and forlorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I thought he clapped his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He did not. He was the one\r\n\r\ngentleman - just  like  the  one  gentleman  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur - who  was  reluctant to stand  up,  raise  his\r\n\r\nright  hand, and say, \"Hidup Malaysia!\" He  was  the\r\n\r\none  gentleman  who came with revolutionary  fervour\r\n\r\nwithout a tie when other people brought out all  the\r\n\r\nfamily heirlooms. He found more and more that he was\r\n\r\nvery  far from unfurling the flag of revolution.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  was  the great catalystic effect  of  his\r\n\r\ntimely interruptions, always dissociating himself on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of his people from everything that was  said\r\n\r\nby  any other member of the delegation, which  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  convinced  everybody else of  the  first  cold\r\n\r\ndraught  of the things to come. They decided without\r\n\r\nfurther  ado  that  external  affairs,  defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity go to the Central Government  - thanks to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson. And so through all the  twists\r\n\r\nand  turns the Communist open front Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave now at last successfully isolated themselves as\r\n\r\nthe only Party now here which is anti-Malaysia both\r\n\r\nin principle and in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like their Vice-Chairman, Mr Sandra\r\n\r\nWoodhull,  and their adviser, Mr J. J. Puthucheary,\r\n\r\nto  ask  themselves, how is it that they could  have\r\n\r\napproved  in  writing - one of the useful  habits  one\r\n\r\nacquires as a lawyer is always to have a document in\r\n\r\nwriting; it helps to establish what was intended  to\r\n\r\nbe  said  accurately and I have their  agreement  in\r\n\r\nwriting - the   policy  statement   of   the   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee even before it was published  in\r\n\r\nthe  6th Anniversary Souvenir number on 1st January,\r\n\r\n1961 - just a year ago  - defining the P.A.P. stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger  and  supporting  the  first  proposals   Oil\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  And, of course, they have gone  back  and\r\n\r\nmelted   away   under   Communist   pressure.    But\r\n\r\nfortunately letters and documents do not  melt  away\r\n\r\nunder any form of pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike the Communists, our decisions are\r\n\r\nbased  on  our  own appraisal, and our policies  are\r\n\r\ndesigned to achieve our own political objectives. We\r\n\r\ncannot  and do not switch lines in midstream at  the\r\n\r\nbehest of an outside authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has\r\n\r\nexplained  how  the Indian Communists first  opposed\r\n\r\nthe  last  war as an imperialist war and joined  the\r\n\r\nCongress Party leaders in going to prison for nonco-operation with the British. But when Russia  entered\r\n\r\nthe  war,  then  it became an anti-Fascist  people's\r\n\r\nwar. People's war - they always talk about the people.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was contrary to the sentiments and\r\n\r\nthe  national  feelings of the whole Indian  people,\r\n\r\nand  the Indian Communists organised strike-breaking\r\n\r\nto  help the British war effort. As a result of such\r\n\r\nanti-national  policies, the Indian Communist  Party\r\n\r\ntoday  continues to be isolated from the broad  mass\r\n\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the High Priest in Moscow says or\r\n\r\nprobably  the local Cardinal in Indonesia  says,  so\r\n\r\nthe  person  in  the  Barisan Sosialis  repeats  and\r\n\r\nparrots  the  sermon. One day, Stalin  was  a  great\r\n\r\ncreative  Marxist-Leninist. And even Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong - the    Secretary-General   of   the    Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - held a meeting in memoriam to  grieve  over\r\n\r\ntheir departed leader. The next day he was condemned\r\n\r\nas  a  murderer  with  a personality  cult.  Cities,\r\n\r\nroads,  squares, factories and villages named  after\r\n\r\nhim have been given new names so that his memory can\r\n\r\nhe erased from the mind of Russia. And even his body\r\n\r\nlying  in  in state in the mausoleum was pulled  out\r\n\r\nand  reburied to be properly forgotten. This is  the\r\n\r\nway  you switch lines. \"I am in favour of Malaysia,\"\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson said so in Kuching. I  asked\r\n\r\nhim  pointblank.  He  stood  up  and  in  clear  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  terms  asserted  his  support  and  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the Barisan Sosialis -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T.

[Laughter]. It is not a\r\n\r\nlaughing  matter. If they are unfortunate enough  to\r\n\r\nbe  alive, then it will be worse for them. Once upon\r\n\r\na  time  Molotov, Kaganovitch, Malenkov,  Voroshilov\r\n\r\nwere all great men - Marxist-Leninists. The day before\r\n\r\nyesterday  I read that a special law was  passed  to\r\n\r\nscrub  out  the  names  of  these  men  from  towns,\r\n\r\nvillages,  factories,  schools,  universities,  army\r\n\r\nunits   and  other  items.  Sir,  84  decrees   were\r\n\r\nintroduced - 84   special  honourable  mentions,   New\r\n\r\nYear's  Honours, Stalin's Birthday Honours,  Lenin's\r\n\r\nHeroes' Day and Red Square Day over 30 years  giving\r\n\r\nrecognition to these men for their work on behalf of\r\n\r\nJoe  Stalin and the Russian Communist Party.

But  I was told that they made  enquiries\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister for Culture whether he could have\r\n\r\na   travelling  companion  because  he  gets  lonely\r\n\r\ntravelling to faraway places. Since only one man was\r\n\r\nallowed, the Chairman of the Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobviously  thought  it rather risky  sending  a  new\r\n\r\nrecruit  like that all by himself and a second-class\r\n\r\nscout  was sent - not the tenderfoot - in search of  his\r\n\r\nfirst-class badge provided he made good there. I am\r\n\r\nsorry  to say the Barisan Sosialis Plan - defence  and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs  go  to the  centre  and  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  remains  outside; two days  of  dissenting\r\n\r\nwith  everybody and keeping on. Here he was.  I  had\r\n\r\nliterally  to apologise on behalf of my colleagues - I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Geylang Serai apologised on his\r\n\r\nown  behalf - as we had by our democratic manners  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  habits  allowed  the  impression  to  go\r\n\r\nabroad  that  we  were  all a  lot  of  uncouth  and\r\n\r\nunmannerly  people  who went to foreign  places  and\r\n\r\nkept  on talking in a way which left nobody  in  any\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the local people are not  fit  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  themselves:  that the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\ncome to look after their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

And then I stood up publicly to apologise.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  to  say that at least  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson had the decency to stand up and affirm  that\r\n\r\nhe  had  not the slightest doubt that the  delegates\r\n\r\nfrom Sarawak and North Borneo were fit and competent\r\n\r\nto  look after the interests of their own people. It\r\n\r\nis  all  recorded  in  Radio Sarawak.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndocument  in  writing, but I am told  that  this  is\r\n\r\nalmost  as good. You can hear the voice. I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Thomson said that, because  he\r\n\r\nwas  a  better  judge  than the gentlemen  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  who  never went there. They  never  saw  the\r\n\r\nchaps who turned up there with beads. [Interruption]\r\n\r\nThey said that this represented British interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill realise that he is going back on his speech.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand why he is doing it because the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson   is   here.  He  is  hoping  to   have   an\r\n\r\ninterjection. Let us get on with the speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you know, it is all right\r\n\r\nbeing fair and democratic. I would not like it  ever\r\n\r\nto  be  said by the Member for Thomson outside  this\r\n\r\nChamber, \"If I were there I would have denounced the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister as a so-and-so.\" Well, he  is  here,\r\n\r\nSir,It is all recorded on tape by Radio Sarawak. He\r\n\r\nwas  there.  There were three witnesses - the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang Serai, who was no accomplice  of  mine,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Culture  and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  Sir,  I  am quite sure Radio  Sarawak  will\r\n\r\noblige, if Members of the House feel interested, and\r\n\r\narrange  for  the tape to be heard  in  the  Library\r\n\r\nduring   the   next   Session  of   the   Solidarity\r\n\r\nConsultative   Committee.  He   admitted   that   he\r\n\r\nrepresented  them. And a bunch of  people  who  knew\r\n\r\nnothing about it - I do not want to be discourteous to\r\n\r\npeople who - I think they really are more to be pitied\r\n\r\nthan   hated - had  the  temerity  to  say  that  this\r\n\r\nConference  represented British  interests  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  themselves. What is the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\ndoing  there?  Let me remind him: at  least  in  our\r\n\r\nMalaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee there  is\r\n\r\nfreedom  of speech. The Member for Thomson stood  up\r\n\r\nwhen  he was not expected to stand up at the opening\r\n\r\nceremonial session. He stood up, dissociated himself\r\n\r\nfrom  everybody else. He was allowed to  speak.  The\r\n\r\nChairman  did  not  stop  him.  I  was  told  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Minister  for  Culture,  that   the\r\n\r\nChairman at the Kuala Lumpur Conference - men who  are\r\n\r\nalways  shouting in defence of human  rights - took  a\r\n\r\nbig  ruler  and was getting more and more  agitated,\r\n\r\nbanging  the table and threatening the Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe   Parliamentary  Secretary.  Here  we  were   in\r\n\r\nKuching, civilized gentlemen. No, Sir, I will not be\r\n\r\nvery long. I think I might as well complete this.  I\r\n\r\nwant  this on the record, Sir; so many other  things\r\n\r\nand they are very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly knew that good manners pay, because the\r\n\r\nnext  day when he turned up for the party, he turned\r\n\r\nup properly dressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With a tie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With a tie, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

What  has\r\n\r\nhappened between July last year and now to have made\r\n\r\nthe Communists and the Barisan Sosialis take a right-about  turn?  That  is  the  question  we  must  ask\r\n\r\nourselves.  What  new in-formation,  what  startling\r\n\r\nfresh analysis, has been discovered which they could\r\n\r\nnot  have  discovered six months ago? Or they  could\r\n\r\nnot  have discovered one month ago in Kuching,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson went there  and  supported\r\n\r\nMalaysia in principle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Concept of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Concept of Malaysia.

All  I\r\n\r\ncan  say is that that is their tragedy. The line has\r\n\r\nbeen  set for them by the P.K.I. from Jakarta.  Mind\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Ban-san\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  a more important open front  Communist\r\n\r\nleader.   And   he   is  not  a  man   reputed   for\r\n\r\nunderstatements. He has categorically asserted  that\r\n\r\nit  is  the  P.K.I. that is following his line;  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I. taking the line from the Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Following from your line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what he said.

And the Secretary-General of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  says, \"No. I am not a Communist.\"  Are  we\r\n\r\nseriously asked to believe, Sir, that the third most\r\n\r\nimportant  Communist Party in the world  in  a  non-Communist country would take a line from a  man  who\r\n\r\nis  not  a Communist? That the Cardinal, instead  of\r\n\r\nlistening  to the Pope, listens to the local  parson\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore, and takes the sermon -the Sermon  on\r\n\r\nthe  Mount  is  preached  by  the  local  parson  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. And the parson says, \"But, no, I am not a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the whole organisation.  I  am  just  an\r\n\r\noutsider. A good, non-Communist Socialist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by keeping in line with the decisions of\r\n\r\ncommunist Parties outside Malaysia, they are  slowly\r\n\r\nbecoming  isolated in Malaysia. Just as  the  Indian\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party, by toeing the Moscow line,  became\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist;  so  they, by  toeing  the  P.K.I.\r\n\r\nline, will become anti-nationalist in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment moved by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nand  supported  by the Member for  Hong  Lim  is  an\r\n\r\namendment  in form. The substance remains that  they\r\n\r\nsupport  the principle of Malaysia. And we agree  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment. It also quite clearly  isolates  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis as the only Party in this  Chamber\r\n\r\nthat is against Malaysian solidarity and against the\r\n\r\nMalaysian nation. Sir, it is a bad start for them to\r\n\r\nbe against a nation even before it is founded. After\r\n\r\nits inauguration, I think those who were against the\r\n\r\nnation   even  before  it  was  founded  have   only\r\n\r\nthemselves to blame if they find that the nation  is\r\n\r\nnot particularly well disposed towards them after it\r\n\r\nhas been inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here as a Government prepared to do all\r\n\r\nthat  is  necessary in the interests of the  people,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the personal abuse and  smears  that\r\n\r\nhave been showered on my colleagues, on myself,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and the Government. We are what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   are,  and  always  have  been.  Fortunately  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues and I, Sir, are not desperate men because\r\n\r\nwe  have no reason to be desperate. I would like  to\r\n\r\nassure  my  enemies that desperation is  an  ailment\r\n\r\nthat  will  fix only those who are on the  verge  of\r\n\r\ndire  disaster. And we have no dire disaster  gaping\r\n\r\nin  front  of  us,  Sir. We are going  through  with\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia. It is our responsibility  and\r\n\r\nduty  to  the people to see that their security  and\r\n\r\ntheir prosperity are ensured. Nothing will deter  us\r\n\r\nfrom  this task. If it was power we wanted, we would\r\n\r\nnot  have contemplated resigning after Hong Lim; nor\r\n\r\nwould  we  have  chosen the more  difficult  way  of\r\n\r\ntaking  a  nationalist stand and defending  it  from\r\n\r\nattack  by the Communists and their supporters.  Why\r\n\r\nshould we have taken a more difficult road if it was\r\n\r\npersonal interests that moulded us? And we did  take\r\n\r\nthe more difficult road by setting out to explain to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore why they must be part of  a\r\n\r\nlarger  entity  for their own survival,  instead  of\r\n\r\ntaking   the  easy  and  cheaper  slogan  of  \"anti-colonialism\", \"full internal self-Government without\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council\". In a write-up in May\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Lim,  and  in  June  before  Anson,  the\r\n\r\nCommunist front organisations in the unions and  the\r\n\r\nmost important Communist front leader, Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  were  inviting us, the P.A.P., to  take  the\r\n\r\nlead  in the anti-colonial struggle. This is all  in\r\n\r\nwriting,  Sir;  statements  issued  to  the   Press,\r\n\r\ndocuments in writing. We were asked to lead the anti-colonial struggle but in their direction - to  press\r\n\r\nfor  the  abolition of the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nat  the next constitutional talks. All we need  have\r\n\r\ndone  in  Anson,  if  it  was  power  that  we  were\r\n\r\ninterested  in  for our ownselves, was  to  pay  lip\r\n\r\nservice  to  anti-colonialism  as  defined  by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and promise to ask for the abolition  of\r\n\r\nthe I.S.C. in 1963. And when 1963 comes and there is\r\n\r\nno  abolition  of the I.S.C., then  lead  a  massive\r\n\r\nagitation  for its abolition, to greater heights  of\r\n\r\nmass  popularity, all in the Communist anti-colonial\r\n\r\nmovement. That was the easy way and would have  kept\r\n\r\nus our safe majority this time;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  with  a  bit of skilful  trimming  and\r\n\r\ncutting,  bring us in again the next  time.  But  it\r\n\r\nwould  have brought ruin and perdition to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore, the people of Malaya and the people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia; for if Singapore goes, so will Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe whole of the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists have made grave\r\n\r\nmiscalculations as to our firmness of intention  and\r\n\r\ntenacity of purpose. They may do well before they go\r\n\r\non with their anti-merger and anti-Malaysia campaign\r\n\r\nto  ask, where will all this lead them to? On issues\r\n\r\nof  life  and  death, such as merger  and  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nconsiderations  of  personal fate  and  fortunes  of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen and Ministers are utterly and completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant.
