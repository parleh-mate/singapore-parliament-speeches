Hart:</b> Sir, I have been asked to make a\r\n\r\nstatement  on the economic and financial  position\r\n\r\nof Singapore at the present time and I welcome the\r\n\r\nopportunity of being able to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, little doubt that Singapore is at\r\n\r\npresent  experiencing a recession in  trade.  There\r\n\r\nare  on  all  sides complaints of  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nmoving  stocks, of restrictions in normal  entrepot\r\n\r\noutlets,   of  tightness  of  money  and  difficult\r\n\r\ntrading  conditions generally. There  is,  however,\r\n\r\nmore  concrete evidence in other directions.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been  a certain contraction in the circulation\r\n\r\nof currency and over the past two months banks have\r\n\r\npurchased  some  $30  million  worth  of  sterling.\r\n\r\nCustoms   duty  receipts  have  fallen  below   the\r\n\r\nestimates in some directions and are barely holding\r\n\r\ntheir  own  in  others. There  has  been  a  marked\r\n\r\nfalling  off  in  the  consumption  of  liquor  and\r\n\r\nreceipts have fallen some $2,300,000 below the estimate  for the first six months of the year.  Petrol\r\n\r\nduty  receipts have also fallen below the  estimate\r\n\r\nby  about  half  a  million  dollars  and  although\r\n\r\nconsumption  still increases, the rate of  increase\r\n\r\nis  considerably  below  that  of  pravious  years.\r\n\r\nReceipts from entertainment duty are slightly ahead\r\n\r\nof the estimate but here again the rate of increase\r\n\r\nin  the  purchase of cinema seats is lower than  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years.  The  number  of  new  motor  cars\r\n\r\nregistered has also fallen considerably  below  the\r\n\r\nlevel  for the same period last year. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the consumption of tobacco appears  to  have\r\n\r\ngone  up but this may be due more to the successful\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the Customs Department in  suppressing\r\n\r\nsmuggling than to any real increase in consumption.\r\n\r\nAgain,  there is an even more marked reluctance  to\r\n\r\npay  income tax and company tax this year than last\r\n\r\nyear  when  tardiness  also  gave  some  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern.  All  these  facts point  clearly  to  the\r\n\r\nexistence of a recession in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to say with any certainty what\r\n\r\ncourse  the  recession is likely  to  take  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. Too many imponderables are involved.  There\r\n\r\nare indications of an improvement in conditions  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  States  of America and  elsewhere  and\r\n\r\nthere is perhaps reason to hope that the corner has\r\n\r\nbeen  turned  in  these countries. There  are  also\r\n\r\nencouraging signs in the local economy.  The  price\r\n\r\nof the higher grades of rubber\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhas  been  maintained  and  rubber  interests  seem\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the  price of  other  grades  will\r\n\r\nimprove  as the year progresses. Statistics suggest\r\n\r\nthat   the  trade  with  Indonesia  has  been  well\r\n\r\nmaintained. There are therefore perhaps grounds for\r\n\r\nreasonable optimism about the future. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  just as the effects of the world trade reces\r\n\r\nsion are delayed in reaching Singapore, so recovery\r\n\r\nis  also  delayed,  although to  a  lesser  extent.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  even if the corner has been  turned  in\r\n\r\nthe United States and elsewhere, we must expect the\r\n\r\npresent recession to be with us for some time  yet.\r\n\r\nIt  might be well into next year before the effects\r\n\r\nare  finally thrown off. On the other hand,  events\r\n\r\ncould  quite  easily take place which might  deepen\r\n\r\nand prolong the present recession. In the unsettled\r\n\r\nstate  of  the world today, it is difficult  to  be\r\n\r\ncertain of anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, Sir, it became clear that Singapore was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be affected by the general recession  in\r\n\r\nworld  trade, the Government decided to take  stock\r\n\r\nof  its  position.  As hon. Members  are  aware,  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  proportion of the Government  revenue\r\n\r\nis  derived  from  sources which  are  affected  to\r\n\r\nvarying  degrees by fluctuations in  trade.  Forty-five  per cent of the revenue comes from duties  on\r\n\r\nliquor,   tobacco,  petroleum,  entertainment   and\r\n\r\nbetting.  The  yield  from  all  these  sources  is\r\n\r\naffected  to  a  certain extent by  contraction  of\r\n\r\nspending power which is often due to a recession in\r\n\r\ntrade.  Twenty-five per cent of the  revenue  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  income  tax and company tax. The  yield  from\r\n\r\nthis  source is directly related to earnings  which\r\n\r\nin turn are directly related to the state of trade.\r\n\r\nIn  the circumstances, it will be appreciated  that\r\n\r\neven  a  mild  recession in trade  must  have  some\r\n\r\neffect   on   revenue.  A  serious  and   prolonged\r\n\r\nrecession could have a corresponding effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will recall that when presenting  the\r\n\r\nBudget for 1958, I said that provided there was  no\r\n\r\nmarked  recession  in trade and provided  that  Government    expenditure   and    applications    for\r\n\r\nsupplementary    vote    were    kept     to     an\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsolute  minimum, revenue and expenditure  should\r\n\r\nbalance  at the end of the year. It will therefore\r\n\r\nbe  appreciated that even a slight contraction  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  could  upset  this  balance  and  that  a\r\n\r\nserious contraction could have a serious effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  are  also  aware  that  the  very\r\n\r\nambitious  development plans which Government  has\r\n\r\nin hand are financed to a considerable extent each\r\n\r\nyear by a contribution from revenue in addition to\r\n\r\nthe development fund and surplus funds. Any marked\r\n\r\ncontraction of revenue would limit the capacity of\r\n\r\nGovernment to make these contributions  and  might\r\n\r\nhave serious effects on the implementation of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans. Again in this connection,  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these plans gathered momentum in\r\n\r\nthe  latter part of 1957. More work was  done  and\r\n\r\nmore  money was spent than was expected.  This  in\r\n\r\nturn  meant  that  the balance of the  development\r\n\r\nfund  carried  forward into 1958 was smaller  than\r\n\r\nestimated  and meant that a greater proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe  surplus funds available will have to be  used\r\n\r\nto finance development in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, then was the background against which\r\n\r\nthe  Government took stock of its position in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  the uncertain economic situation.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  perhaps  I  may be allowed to  explain  what\r\n\r\naction  Government took as a result of its  stock-taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nposition,  it seemed clear that there must  be  at\r\n\r\nleast a slight contraction of revenue in 1958.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, the possibility was that it might\r\n\r\nnot be very large, and the returns for expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  the  early months of the year suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe  estimates for expenditure which were made  in\r\n\r\nDecember  of last year would not be very far  out.\r\n\r\nThe  most  obvious  way  to offset  this  possible\r\n\r\nslight   contraction  of  revenue   was   to   cut\r\n\r\nexpenditure and it was therefore decided to make a\r\n\r\ndetermined  drive  to reduce  expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments within their portfolios.  All\r\n\r\nvacant  posts  in  the Establishment  were  frozen until\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters had an opportunity to re-examine the need\r\n\r\nfor  them in the light of a change in the economic\r\n\r\nposition.  Proposals for special expenditure  were\r\n\r\ntreated in the same way. The recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nin  departments  of Government was  examined  with\r\n\r\ngreat  care to see what economies could be  effected.  This examination has proved to be a long  and\r\n\r\nlaborious business and has not yet been completed.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, sufficient information is  now\r\n\r\navailable  to suggest that considerable  economies\r\n\r\ncan   be  effected  and  that  these  may   go   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable way towards offsetting the effects of\r\n\r\nany contraction of revenue which may take place in\r\n\r\n1958.  In short, therefore, when the accounts  are\r\n\r\nmade  up,  it  may well be found that the  deficit\r\n\r\nbetween actual revenue and expenditure in 1958  is\r\n\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position with regard to 1959 perhaps gives\r\n\r\ncause  for  a  little  more  concern.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained, the effect of any recession in trade on\r\n\r\nincome and company tax returns is delayed and  any\r\n\r\nmarked decrease in individual earnings and company\r\n\r\nprofit in 1958 could have a considerable effect on\r\n\r\nrevenue  from income and company tax in  1959.  It\r\n\r\nhas  not  so  far  been  possible  to  obtain  any\r\n\r\nreliable information on these points or to  obtain\r\n\r\nany idea of the position in the Colony as a whole.\r\n\r\nI  can  however  assure  hon.  Members  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular  question  is engaging  the  close  and\r\n\r\nconstant  attention  of the  Government  and  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  steps  may  be  necessary  to  meet  any\r\n\r\nsituation which may develop will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to development, as hon. Members are\r\n\r\naware, the Government is already heavily committed\r\n\r\nin  respect of development plans which all Parties\r\n\r\nare agreed are essential for the well-being of the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. The implementation of  these\r\n\r\nplans  will stretch the resources of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe  limit. Any shortfall of funds from any source\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  taken into account  in  planning\r\n\r\nmight   have  an  embarrassing  effect.   It   was\r\n\r\ntherefore  essential  to  consider  the   possible\r\n\r\nconsequences        of        any        shortfall\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  contributions from revenue and contraction  of\r\n\r\nreserves and to make sure that the Government  was\r\n\r\nnot over-committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work in hand, Sir, at the present time will\r\n\r\ninvolve  the expenditure of well over $70  million\r\n\r\nin  1958.  This is more than has ever before  been\r\n\r\nspent  in  one year on development and  represents\r\n\r\nthe  fulfilment  of all the Government's  planning\r\n\r\nfor  the  development  of education,  medical  and\r\n\r\nhealth   facilities,  communications  and   public\r\n\r\nhousing  over  the  past three  years.  About  $24\r\n\r\nmillion  will be spent by the Public Works  Depart\r\n\r\nment  on  capital works including the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nAbout  $22  million will be spent by the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust on public housing.  $5  million\r\n\r\nwill be spent by the Singapore Telephone Board  on\r\n\r\ntelephone   development;  $4  million   on   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment; $7 million on the purchase  of  sites\r\n\r\nfor  schools,  etc, and on  the  resettlement  of\r\n\r\nsquatters,   and  the  balance  on   miscellaneous\r\n\r\nspecial  development expenditure.  Expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthis  order by Government will go a very long  way\r\n\r\nto  offset  the  effects of  a  recession  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  allied trades  and  in  many  other\r\n\r\ndirections in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to next year, work and services now\r\n\r\nin  hand  but uncompleted at the end of this  year\r\n\r\nwill  necessitate expenditure of about $24 million\r\n\r\nin  1959.  Of  this  total sum, $16  million  will\r\n\r\nrepresent   capital  work  by  the  Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.  There will also be other  unavoidable\r\n\r\ncommitments of which account must be taken.  These\r\n\r\ncommitments  will  total  a  sum  of  $30  million\r\n\r\nincluding some $15 million for public housing,  $4\r\n\r\nmillion  for  rural development,  $2  million  for\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  development,  and  so  on.  In\r\n\r\nbrief,  work  in  hand  at the  end  of  1958  and\r\n\r\nadditional  commitments of a general nature  which\r\n\r\nmust be added in 1959 will involve expenditure  in\r\n\r\nthat  year of the order of $55 million. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery  sizeable  sum  and  represents  a  level  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure  well  up  to   that   of\r\n\r\nprevious years. It will go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  long  way to offset any effects of the  present\r\n\r\nrecession which may still persist in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, no serious difficulty is\r\n\r\nanticipated in financing these programmes. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, until such time as the probable course\r\n\r\nof  the recession and its possible effects on  the\r\n\r\nrevenues of the Colony are quite clear, care  will\r\n\r\nobviously have to be taken not to enter  into  any\r\n\r\nfresh  commitments  which  might  subsequently  be\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  embarrassing. With  this  in  mind,\r\n\r\nMinisters  are at present examining  the  list  of\r\n\r\nadditional  items  of  public  works  which  could\r\n\r\npossibly  be  started this year  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ndetermining  those which should be proceeded  with\r\n\r\nforthwith  and those which are of less  importance\r\n\r\nand  which can safely be kept back until  a  later\r\n\r\ndate.

This unity\r\n\r\nwas  again displayed during the recent discussions\r\n\r\nand  it was again due to this unity that the  All-Party  Delegation was successful in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe  terms of the Order-in-Council directly reflect\r\n\r\nthe agreement reached last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the discussions in London on 27th May, an agreed press communique was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis  was a lengthy one and it set out in  detail\r\n\r\nthe main points which were discussed and settled.\r\n\r\nI  believe this communique was published in  full\r\n\r\nin the local newspapers and this has made my task\r\n\r\nthis morning easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The All-Party Delegation has adopted only one\r\n\r\nprinciple:   to   see  that  the   Constitutional\r\n\r\nInstruments  directly  interpret  the   agreement\r\n\r\nreached in 1957. We asked for nothing more and we\r\n\r\naccepted nothing less. The substance of  the  pro\r\n\r\nvisions  of  the  Constitutional Instruments  has\r\n\r\nbeen  agreed  and the legal draughtsmen  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  and  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  are now finalising and  refining  the\r\n\r\ndraft so as to state accurately the points of substance agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subversive clause, the stand of the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Delegation was made abundantly clear in\r\n\r\npress   reports.

The Secretary of State took note of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Delegation's objections but could  not\r\n\r\nagree  that  such  a restriction  should  not  be\r\n\r\nimposed.  He  stated that his  intention  was  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  the incorporation of this  restriction\r\n\r\nin  a separate instrument which would in any case\r\n\r\nbe  necessary  to  provide for elections  to  the first Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Bill creating the State of Singapore and\r\n\r\nenabling   the   Queen  to  make  the   Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)   Order-in-Council   has   already\r\n\r\npassed its Second Reading and it is expected that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will become law by the  end  of  this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out, Sir, to the All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation by the Colonial Office that it was not\r\n\r\nlegally and constitutionally proper for the draft\r\n\r\nOrder-in-Council to be made public until  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen submitted to the Queen and this draft Order-in-Council  cannot constitutionally be  submitted\r\n\r\nto the Queen until the Bill creating the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  become law. The All-Party  Delegation  was therefore prevented from making  public\r\n\r\nthe  draft Order-in-Council. Moreover, this draft\r\n\r\nOrder-in-Council  is  still  in  the  process  of refining.

I say this\r\n\r\nwith due respect to the Attorney General who, with\r\n\r\nhis  legal background, interpreted the law in such\r\n\r\na way as to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbar   Service   employees  from   contesting   the\r\n\r\nelections. There were many public-spirited  people\r\n\r\nwho  were prepared to come forward to contest  the\r\n\r\nCity Council elections in December last year,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of the interpretation of this  law,  they\r\n\r\ncould not do so. To quote a few, we \"lost\" a  very\r\n\r\ngood  public-spirited man in Mr V.  K.  Nair  who\r\n\r\nspent 6 years in the City Council, apart from  his\r\n\r\nother   public  services.  We  also   \"lost\"   Mr\r\n\r\nJaganathan  who was also in the City  Council  for\r\n\r\nabout  seven  years.  Had  it  not  been  for  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of this law, I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nthese  two men, together with many more  from  the\r\n\r\nthree  Services,  would have  contested  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil elections. The result of their taking part\r\n\r\nwould  have been an entirely different composition\r\n\r\nof  the City Council, and this may not have  given\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. the big majority that it has today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ex-employee of the Army, I welcome this\r\n\r\namendment  and  speak for my old  colleagues.  All\r\n\r\nthose   Service   employees  are   considered   as\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the  Crown. They are  not  treated,\r\n\r\nexactly as what the Singapore Government employees\r\n\r\nare  treated. Where elections are concerned,  they\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to be treated the same;  but  where\r\n\r\nprivileges are concerned, they are not  given  the\r\n\r\nsame privileges because they do not enjoy many  of\r\n\r\nthe   benefits  which  the  Singapore'  Government\r\n\r\nemployees are enjoying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was working in the Army, there was, as\r\n\r\nfar  as I know, a provision in the civilian  staff\r\n\r\nregulations  which provided for the nomination  or\r\n\r\nelection  of  a  Service  employee  to  the  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  councils. There was also  a  provision\r\n\r\nwhich  allowed  the employee concerned  to  attend\r\n\r\nmeetings of the local government councils - 24 days\r\n\r\nleave  in a year, and these 24 days could be taken\r\n\r\nin  half-days.  If the employers themselves  allow\r\n\r\nthe  employees to contest the elections, I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  why the Government should bar them from doing\r\n\r\nso.   But  better  late  than  never - hence   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this amending Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to have District Council elections very soon, and, in view of the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvague reply given by the Minister this morning,  I\r\n\r\nhope it will happen very soon, because we have not\r\n\r\nbeen  given a definite date yet. This  Bill  will\r\n\r\ngive  a chance to local people in the Services  to\r\n\r\ncome   forward   and  contest  the  elections.

But\r\n\r\nHead 7 is a curious message indeed, for the sum of\r\n\r\n$325,000,  and it appears under Chief Minister - New\r\n\r\nSubhead - Rural  Development.  Since  when  has  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's Ministry undertaken this business\r\n\r\nof  rural  development?  We  understood  from  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  the  Rendel  Constitution  that   his\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Ulu Bedok, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Local Government, Lands and Housing,  is  the\r\n\r\nman  in  charge  of  local  government  and  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   At  this  late   hour,   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is being hard pressed to answer when we\r\n\r\nare  going to have the District Council elections,\r\n\r\nwe  have  the  vote  of $325,000  for  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront's District Council elections fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not really concerned with the indirect\r\n\r\nslight which the Labour Front have administered to\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Chief Minister. They  must  obviously\r\n\r\nhave   considered  him  inept  and  incapable   of\r\n\r\nadministering this fund to the full  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front, and so he has to allow the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister to take over rural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary said that full\r\n\r\nexplanations have been given and it is interesting\r\n\r\nto note what the full explanation for this subhead\r\n\r\nis. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is proposed to establish a Rural Development\r\n\r\nFund under the control of the Chief Minister\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>not  the  Financial Secretary, and not the  Deputy\r\n\r\nChief   Minister  who  is  in  charge   of   local government-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"and,  in the first instance, to make the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$325,000  available for rural development projects\r\n\r\nwhich  will  enable farmers to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nmodern  methods  to  improve  their  standards  of\r\n\r\nproduction, and to make the best possible  use  of their land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA highly laudable project which should receive the\r\n\r\ntumultuous  support of all Members of this  House.\r\n\r\nThe explanation goes on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These moneys are intended to be spent on rural\r\n\r\ncredit  schemes, minor development projects,  such\r\n\r\nas  the conversion of waste into animal foods, the\r\n\r\nconstruction of district incubator units, improved\r\n\r\npigsties,  chicken  houses,  etc.,  ploughing  and\r\n\r\nfertilization  projects, improvement  of  drainage\r\n\r\nmethods,  the  processing  and  storage  of   farm\r\n\r\nproduce, and so forth, publicity, and minor works\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  every  other  conceivable manner  of  getting\r\n\r\nvotes  in the District Council elections.  Let  us\r\n\r\nsee  what an English-language newspaper said about\r\n\r\nthis - this is after an interview with a Government\r\n\r\nspokesman.  The  knowledgeable  reporter,  in   an\r\n\r\narticle published the day before yesterday, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Farmers associations in the Yio Chu Kang,\r\n\r\nChangi, Amah Keng and Upper Serangoon areas\"--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>with which the Assistant Minister to the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary is, I think, closely associated - with the\r\n\r\ncoming of the elections he is taking a great\r\n\r\ninterest in rural matters and votes-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"hope that the Government will also assist them to\r\n\r\nstay  away  from moneylenders and middlemen,  who,\r\n\r\nthey  said, deprived them of the benefits of their\r\n\r\nhard work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Association officials, farmers are\r\n\r\ndeep in debt and a major part of their income goes\r\n\r\ntowards paying interest to moneylenders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, with the assistance of this fund,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be paying interest to moneylenders  but\r\n\r\nthey  will be paying in votes to those people  who\r\n\r\npatronise  farmers' associations  with  government funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

There is a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  that and this belated attempt of a  block\r\n\r\nvote  of $325,000, taken specially into his  jurisdiction, to spend in some priority which  he  will\r\n\r\ndecide,  for the now admitted purpose  of  winning\r\n\r\nover  the  support of the masses - not in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  because that is a waste  of  time;  that\r\n\r\nwill  not come up in another two years - but in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council  elections. The  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, if he really wants to  know\r\n\r\nwhen the District Council elections are going  to\r\n\r\nbe  held, is that they will be held as soon as the\r\n\r\nGovernment feels that having spent this money - this\r\n\r\nbribe of $325,000 - it can reasonably anticipate a fair proportion of the voters voting for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.00     noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I  cait\r\n\r\ntruthfully and honestly tell him that it is  about\r\n\r\ntwo  years  since I have been trying to  help  the\r\n\r\nrural   dwellers  because  most  of  the   matters\r\n\r\naffecting   them   come  within  my   Ministry - the\r\n\r\nAgricultural     Department,    the     Veterinary\r\n\r\nDepartment,  the Co-operatives Department  and  so\r\n\r\non.  I have all along felt that, in order that the\r\n\r\nsmall farmer can stand on his own legs, a fund has\r\n\r\nto  be  created - either by the creation of a  rural\r\n\r\nbank  or  some  other method  whereby  he  can  be\r\n\r\nadvanced such money as is necessary for him to get\r\n\r\naway  from the influence and clutches of  the  middleman, and if I had my way, this would have  come\r\n\r\nup two years ago. However, there are priorities in\r\n\r\nthe  spending of public funds, and as hon. Members\r\n\r\nI  think know full well, when the Budget comes  up\r\n\r\nthere  is only a limited amount of money available\r\n\r\nand  it  is a matter of fixing priorities.

M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, it is not so, Sir, If\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member remembers, His Excellency's Speech\r\n\r\nat  the  opening of this Session of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\ncontained  a  statement of Government  policy  for\r\n\r\nthis  year that a Rural Development Panel will  be\r\n\r\nset  up  under  the Chief Minister's Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthis is an execution of the announcement of policy\r\n\r\nmade at that time. In fact, it was as a result  of\r\n\r\npressure exerted by me that this has been  set  up\r\n\r\nunder the Chief Minister's Ministry. The reason is\r\n\r\nthat    rural   development   concerns   so   many\r\n\r\nMinistries - it concerns mostly my Ministry; it also\r\n\r\nconcerns  the Ministry of Local Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing;  it  also concerns the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works when rural roads  are  to\r\n\r\nbe built; it also concerns the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nbecause finance is involved to a great extent - and\r\n\r\nit   will  not  be  possible,  under  the  present\r\n\r\nadministrative machinery, for one Minister to  try\r\n\r\nand  expedite any project which concerns  so  many\r\n\r\nMinistries  because  it  has  to  go  through  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  channels. If the hon.  Member  has\r\n\r\nread  the  newspapers, Sir, I did  in  fact  in  a\r\n\r\nspeech  made  in the Rotary Club in  January  this\r\n\r\nyear  point  out  that one of the  dangers  facing\r\n\r\nSingapore is that the administrative machinery  of\r\n\r\nthe Government might not be capable of working  to\r\n\r\na  point  of absorbing the dynamism of an  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  cannot say it  more  clearly  than\r\n\r\nthat.  It  means that the administrative machinery\r\n\r\nhas  its  methods and so on which are  subject  to\r\n\r\ndelays,  and co-ordination is difficult to achieve\r\n\r\nbetween  one Minister and another especially  when\r\n\r\nthe matter concerns three other Ministries. It has\r\n\r\nto go through these channels. I am saying all this\r\n\r\nfrankly, Sir, because the hon. Member has sort  of\r\n\r\nalleged that the Chief Minister has got this money\r\n\r\nas  a  bribe to buy votes from the rural dwellers.\r\n\r\nThat is not so, I can truthfully and honestly say.\r\n\r\nI  said  that the only way to achieve any progress\r\n\r\nin  rural development is for the Chief Minister to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  up  himself and set himself up as  a  dictator\r\n\r\nover  the other Ministers and say, \"This  must  be\r\n\r\ndone,  and  that  must be done.\" It  might  be  an\r\n\r\nadmission   of  administrative  difficulty - it   is\r\n\r\nso - but  I  was  anxious that  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  take  it  over so that  rural  development\r\n\r\ncould proceed at a quicker pace. That is the  real\r\n\r\nreason  why  this vote of $325,000  is  under  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister. In fact, it was announced in  His\r\n\r\nExcellency's  speech  at  the  opening   of   this Session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  enumerated  the  Ministries  which  were\r\n\r\nnormally   involved  in  or  connected   with   or\r\n\r\nconsulted on rural development. I think I am right\r\n\r\nin  quoting him as saying that they were  his  own\r\n\r\nMinistry - the Ministry of Commerce and Industry - the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Local Government, Lands and  Housing,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Communications and Works, and the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance - four eminent Ministries,  but\r\n\r\nnot  including the Ministry of Labour or the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  Ministry.

Welfare\r\n\r\nis somethng which concerns everyone in the island.\r\n\r\nEven  education  is concerned  when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\neducating  the rural folks in fishing methods  and\r\n\r\nso on. We have plans that schools in the rural area\r\n\r\nshould  teach fishing and other rural pursuits  to\r\n\r\nthe students there. Therefore other Ministries are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  but  these  four  Ministries - those  of\r\n\r\nLocal  Government,  Lands and  Housing,  Communications  and Works, Finance, and my own Ministry - are\r\n\r\ndirectly concerned. But as I said, Sir, the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has been brought in because  he  is  the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

He first said that the idea  of\r\n\r\nrural   development  projects  which  will  enable\r\n\r\nfarmers  to  take advantage of modern  methods  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their standards of production was  indeed\r\n\r\nlaudable; but when he ended his speech,  he  urged\r\n\r\nMembers  to vote against the $325,000 provided  in\r\n\r\nthis  vote. Sir, he might be right if we  on  this\r\n\r\nside  have indulged in empty propaganda.  On  this\r\n\r\nrural  development authority, we sincerely believe\r\n\r\nthat  it would be better to go ahead with a  well-planned  machine rather than shout our  heads  off\r\n\r\nbefore the actual event took place. Sir, if we had\r\n\r\nsaid  that this rural development plan had been  a\r\n\r\ndream  of the Chief Minister, or that he had vowed\r\n\r\nto  see  the  establishment of this authority  two\r\n\r\nyears ago, then probably it would be said that  it\r\n\r\nis a publicity thing - just as what the Mayor of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council said yesterday morning that when  he\r\n\r\nwent  to see the floods at Braddell Road two years\r\n\r\nago,  he  promised the people there that he  would\r\n\r\nsurely  give them a mobile dispensary. We  do  not\r\n\r\nfor  a moment believe in fantasy or in unnecessary\r\n\r\npublicity.  We  do  not even spend  any  money  on\r\n\r\nbanners, like the anti-spitting campaign which has\r\n\r\nbeen  launched by the City Council. Our  intention\r\n\r\nis  not to spend money unnecessarily, but to spend\r\n\r\nit on necessary projects which will achieve better\r\n\r\nresults for the people. It is quite justified  for\r\n\r\nallegations  to  be made if we  have  spent  money\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar is probably\r\n\r\nquite  worried  now because he has said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  undertaking a project  which  will\r\n\r\nbenefit a large number of rural people. I hope and\r\n\r\nbelieve that if he has the interests of the  rural\r\n\r\npeople  at  heart, he will give unstinted  support\r\n\r\nfor  this  project  and for all others  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  undertakes in  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was waiting for some valuable information which I thought the Assistant Minister would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide us.

Members  will  recall  that,  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nstrong  opposition from the Nature  Reserve  Board\r\n\r\nand  others  interested in preserving  the  nature\r\n\r\nreserve, I successfully moved in this House on 4th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1957, a resolution to amend the Schedule\r\n\r\nto  the  Nature Reserves Ordinance, the effect  of\r\n\r\nwhich was to reduce the acreage of the area of the\r\n\r\nUlu  Pandan Nature Reserve from 1,374 acres to 371\r\n\r\nacres, thereby confirming the release of about 150\r\n\r\nacres then covered by prawn ponds and releasing  a\r\n\r\nfurther 853 acres for development as prawn ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude, Sir, of those interested in\r\n\r\npreserving  the nature reserve at  that  time  was\r\n\r\nsuch that they were not prepared to concede even a\r\n\r\nsmall  portion of the nature reserve for  purposes\r\n\r\nof  prawn  ponds. They were not prepared  to  talk\r\n\r\nterms  with  me in order to arrive at a reasonable\r\n\r\nsolution  which  might  be  beneficial   to   both\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after this House approved my motion in\r\n\r\nDecember  and gave me the authority to  release  a\r\n\r\nbig  portion of the thu Pandan Nature Reserve, the\r\n\r\nmore   reasonable  elements  of  those  objecting,\r\n\r\nrealising that there was no other way, came to see\r\n\r\nme with a reasonable proposal which would preserve\r\n\r\nthe interests of the nature lovers at the cost  of\r\n\r\nreducing,  by a small portion, the released  area,\r\n\r\nand  by  extending  and regrouping  the  remaining\r\n\r\nportions of the nature reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new proposals, Sir, in effect mean the\r\n\r\nextension  of  two pieces of swamp reserves  which\r\n\r\nare  marked  on  this  sketch  as  A  and  B  (the\r\n\r\nextensions would be in the direction of D  and  E)\r\n\r\nand  thereby  enlarging the nature reserve  as  at\r\n\r\npresent  defined by approximately 171 acres.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  notice that there  is  an  area  of\r\n\r\nreserve marked C on the sketch plan which will  be\r\n\r\ndeleted now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you the exact figures, Sir, it is now\r\n\r\nproposed to excise, instead of the previous  1,003\r\n\r\nacres,  only  832  acres from  the  Pandan  Nature\r\n\r\nReserve,  leaving  a total of  542  acres  in  the\r\n\r\nreserve, a net increase to the reserve of from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n371 to 542 acres, namely, 171 acres. This\r\n\r\nextension of the nature reserve by 171 acres would\r\n\r\nprovide for (a) better administration of the  area\r\n\r\nunder the control of the Nature Reserve Board; (b)\r\n\r\na   fairly  full  range  of  mangrove  animals  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  themselves;  (c) self-perpetuation  of\r\n\r\nmature  mangrove vegetation; (d) a full  range  of\r\n\r\nimportant  mangrove plants; (e) the  retention  of\r\n\r\ntype localities of many species first described as\r\n\r\nnew  to science from specimens obtained there; and\r\n\r\n(f)  easier access for those interested in  nature study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel, Sir, that this is a very fair\r\n\r\nproposition and commend it to hon. Members. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,. Sir, when the Hon. Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  introduced a motion in this  House  last\r\n\r\nDecember  to reduce the Pandan Nature  Reserve  to\r\n\r\nthree areas, of 236, 90 and 45 acres respectively,\r\n\r\nI  pointed out very serious objections to - what  he\r\n\r\nwas  doing. Not only was he destroying a  valuable\r\n\r\nnature reserve for no purpose, but he was in  fact\r\n\r\nendangering  the future of the prawn  industry  in\r\n\r\nthat  area by this destruction, the industry which\r\n\r\nwe  ourselves wish to see developed. His reply  to\r\n\r\nthe  House  on  the scientific arguments  which  I\r\n\r\npropounded was as follows - and I quote from  column\r\n\r\n2880  of Volume 2, No. 40, of the Official  Report\r\n\r\ndated 4th December, 1957:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... I must assure this House specifically that\r\n\r\nall these arguments which the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin has put up have already  been\r\n\r\nput  up  to  the Ministry by the Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nNature Reserve Board, with supporting evidence  as\r\n\r\nput  forward by the Member from the various  other\r\n\r\nprofessors    and   people   of   high    academic\r\n\r\nqualifications, and they have been  considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. The Ministry feels that, as far  as\r\n\r\nfisheries   is  concerned,  it  is  its  Fisheries\r\n\r\nOfficer  who  is best qualified to  speak  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject and who should know his job.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  I had good reason to believe that neither the\r\n\r\nMinister  nor the Fisheries Officer had  in  fact\r\n\r\nmet            the           experts            on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe subject round the table, and at the conclusion\r\n\r\nof  my speech on the same day I made this point - in\r\n\r\ncolumn 2865:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My own belief is this: that if all the experts\r\n\r\non  the subject in the country got round one table\r\n\r\nto go into this matter and pool their knowledge - as\r\n\r\nshould  have been done before - it would  be  found.\r\n\r\nfirstly, that the area of land alienated for prawn\r\n\r\nponds  could be increased beyond the present area;\r\n\r\nsecondly, that a sufficient but different area  of\r\n\r\nmangrove  could be retained at the  Pandan  Forest\r\n\r\nReserve as a feeding area for prawns and as a self-propagating area for biological study; and thirdly\r\n\r\nand finally, the proper balance of nature could be\r\n\r\nachieved. That would be the best possible  result,\r\n\r\nwhile  at present the Government may get the worst\r\n\r\nof both worlds.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am not going to flatter myself that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  accepted what I  had  to  say,  but\r\n\r\nenough  attention was drawn to the matter for  him\r\n\r\nto decide to reconsider the position. I believe  a\r\n\r\nmeeting of experts was arranged - I was not present\r\n\r\nbut   the  Minister  has  told  us  roughly  what\r\n\r\ntranspired - but the final outcome has been that the\r\n\r\nMinister has been broad-minded enough and flexible\r\n\r\nenough  to  come  forward with a  modified  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  will leave intact two areas of 356 and  186\r\n\r\nacres  of  - undisturbed mangrove in precisely  the\r\n\r\nright position from everybody's point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy result then is as I had hoped. There\r\n\r\nwill  now be a sufficient area of mangrove for  it\r\n\r\nto  be self-propagating and to yield its botanical\r\n\r\nand  biological  riches, and, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nexperiments  can  be  made to increase  the  prawn\r\n\r\ncatch  without  too  much risk.  Also,  the  Malay\r\n\r\nfishermen can continue to earn a living by fishing\r\n\r\ndown the river with the undisturbed mangrove still there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Government on thinking again\r\n\r\nand    modifying    its   previously    apparently\r\n\r\nintractable attitude, and we are glad  now  to  be\r\n\r\nable to support this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is true that the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  in  the  debate  in  this  House  in\r\n\r\nDecember  pointed out, as he had  said,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was destroying  valuable areas of nature reserve  and\r\n\r\nendangering  prawn production. I did  assure  that all the arguments \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nput up by the Chairman of the Nature\r\n\r\nReserve   Board  were  considered.  However,   the\r\n\r\narguments  that  were put up to me  at  that  time\r\n\r\nwere: `All or none'- `We want the whole reserve to\r\n\r\nbe  preserved'.  None of them was sane  enough  to\r\n\r\ncome  to me and say, `Look, we realise that  prawn\r\n\r\npond  cultivation  is of vital importance  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore - that  it  is  going  to  expand  the  economy - and\r\n\r\ntherefore we propose that this and this  and  this\r\n\r\ncompromise   should   take  place,   whereby   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the nature reserve could be preserved\r\n\r\nand also that a certain area could be released for\r\n\r\nprawn ponds'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their attitude was very obstinate and I, as a\r\n\r\nMinister  responsible to the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\ngoverning   for  the  benefit  of   the   majority\r\n\r\ninterests  of Singapore, would not be  blackmailed\r\n\r\nby   small  groups  into  making  decisions  which\r\n\r\nbenefit only small groups. And therefore when they\r\n\r\nwere  not  willing to play ball with me,  I  said,\r\n\r\n`Right, I go ahead.' If they had come - and  I  must\r\n\r\nthank  Professor  Oppenheim  who,  after  this  resolution had been adopted, a few months later  met\r\n\r\nme and said, `Look, there can be a compromise';  I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Is that so?\" He said, \"Of course there  can\r\n\r\nbe.\"  I said, \"Why didn't the Nature Reserve Board\r\n\r\npeople  tell  me that there could be a compromise.\r\n\r\nIf  there  was,  as a reasonable man  I  would  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  come  to  a compromise  whereby  both\r\n\r\ninterests would be preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no need for obstinacy, Sir. When I\r\n\r\nsaw  the proposals were reasonable, I said, `I  am\r\n\r\ngoverning in the interests of the country at large\r\n\r\nand  if I can bring both interests together I will\r\n\r\ncertainly  do  so,  and  I  will  not   stand   on\r\n\r\nobstinacy.' And that is why I brought this  motion\r\n\r\nto the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of\r\n\r\nsection   4   of  the  Nature  Reserves  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  235), resolves that paragraph 5  of  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  the  Ordinance be  deleted  and  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  substituted  therefor:- \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All those pieces of land situate in Mukim\r\n\r\nNo.  V  Pandan and Mukim No. VI Peng Kang, in  the\r\n\r\nIsland of Singapore, known as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPandan  Forest Reserve, comprised in lot 136-15,\r\n\r\nMukim No. V Pandan, and in lot 193, Mukim No. VI\r\n\r\nPeng Kang, and estimated\r\n\r\nto  contain approximate areas of 356a.

The report has been with Members  for\r\n\r\nmore than two and a half months. I hope that, as\r\n\r\na   result   of   this   report,   despite   its\r\n\r\nshortcomings,  we  will be able  to  benefit  by\r\n\r\nmaking the necessary adjustments to our election\r\n\r\nlaws,  not  just with the purpose of  trying  to\r\n\r\ncounter  another Party, but of  trying  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  electoral machinery  will  work\r\n\r\nfairly and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the advantage this morning of scanning\r\n\r\nthe Bill to amend the Local Government Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance which was tabled for First Reading  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing, and my impression is that whilst it did\r\n\r\nvery  wisely  adopt some of the  recommendations\r\n\r\ncontained in this report\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If  it  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the Government not only  to  embody\r\n\r\nsome  of  the recommendations which this  report\r\n\r\nhas  made, but at the same time to introduce new\r\n\r\nconditions and propositions with the purpose  of\r\n\r\ncrippling Opposition political Parties,  because\r\n\r\nit is believed that the nature of the support of\r\n\r\nOpposition  political Parties may be  such  that\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions  if introduced  would  block\r\n\r\nthat  support,  then the whole purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nCommission would be defeated. We would be thrown\r\n\r\ninto  the  arena  of party politics  instead  of\r\n\r\ntrying,  sensibly, to work out  a  system  which\r\n\r\nwill work for all time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the report, Sir, time has also\r\n\r\nflowed  since the Commission was first appointed\r\n\r\nand I can only say it is a matter of regret that\r\n\r\none  of the Members of the Commission has  since\r\n\r\ngot into some prominence and has said, in what I\r\n\r\nthink must be the classic under-statement of all\r\n\r\ntime, that he is not an angel. I do recommend to\r\n\r\nthe  Government, if in the future they  have  to\r\n\r\nappoint  more  commissions of this nature,  that\r\n\r\nthey   should   try   to  appoint   persons   of\r\n\r\nunimpeachable character and reputation, and  not\r\n\r\nthose  who are likely to have to declaim in  the\r\n\r\nwitness-box that they are no angels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

On  two  persons there  has  been,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, gentle whitewashing. In the first place I\r\n\r\nrefer to the finding about certain allegations  re\r\n\r\ngarding  Mr Brash which is reported in  pages  21\r\n\r\nand  22  of  the  report. Now, Sir,  this  was  an\r\n\r\narticle published by \"Cynicus\". It is referred  to\r\n\r\nin  paragraph 48 of the report and on page  22  in\r\n\r\nthe  finding. Just to refresh the memory  of  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this House, I will read  the  excerpt again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At a bye-election campaign luncheon in\r\n\r\nSingapore which will not figure on the candidate's\r\n\r\nexpense  sheet, the talk turned to  the  value  of\r\n\r\npublic meetings and a candidate's speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Don't bother about meetings and speeches\", said\r\n\r\nthe   candidate's   adviser.  \"They'll   get   you nowhere.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know\", said the candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Get the secret society boys out\", said the adviser. \"They'll do it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know\", said the candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody at the lunch heard it. Everybody would\r\n\r\ndeny it if names were mentioned. Or they might say\r\n\r\nit  was all a joke. But it wasn't a joke, and  the\r\n\r\nsecret society boys have been called out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The person who was referred to as `the\r\n\r\ncandidate's  adviser' was  Mr  M.  B.  Brash,  an\r\n\r\nAdvocate and Solicitor, who is a member of several\r\n\r\ncommittees of the Liberal-Socialist Party. We  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied he was not an adviser to either  of  the\r\n\r\ncandidates or to the Liberal-Socialist Party,  Mr\r\n\r\nBrash  who appeared before us, gave us his account\r\n\r\nof  the conversation, which was to the effect that\r\n\r\nwhile  discussing with a journalist seated  beside\r\n\r\nhim,  the  value of public meetings in an election\r\n\r\ncampaign,  he had expressed the view  that  public\r\n\r\nmeetings  had proved to be of little value  during\r\n\r\nhis  own  election campaign in 1955, and that  the\r\n\r\nintervention  of  secret  societies  had  been  an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  in that election;  and  he  had\r\n\r\nproceeded to develop this theme with a description\r\n\r\nof  what  had  occurred in the 1955 Elections.  We accept his account\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the conversation. The fact that secret society\r\n\r\nmembers   did  intervene  in  the  Bye-   Election\r\n\r\nactivity   has,  in  our  opinion,  no  connection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever   with   the   conversation   at   that\r\n\r\nluncheon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this witness went into the witness-box\r\n\r\nand  admitted  on  oath that  he  had  spent  over\r\n\r\n$35,000 in his own election campaign. Why  was  no\r\n\r\nreference made to that in the report? How  was  he\r\n\r\nable to spend $35,000 in an election campaign? Why\r\n\r\nis there such a glaring ommission in this report?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item I wish to refer to is contained\r\n\r\nin   paragraph  70,  page  26,  relating  to   our\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister for Labour and Welfare. It says\r\n\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Lee Kuan Yew in his speech in thee\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  on the  18th  July,  1957,.\r\n\r\nreferred  to a case in which he alleged  that  tea\r\n\r\nand  cigarettes had been provided to  a  group  of\r\n\r\npeople who had been helping Mr Koh Choon Hong  in\r\n\r\nhis   election  campaign.  It  appeared  from  the\r\n\r\nevidence we heard that coffee to a total value  of\r\n\r\n$32.05  had  been served from time to time  in  an\r\n\r\noffice,  which  purported to be a branch  election\r\n\r\noffice  of Mr Koh Choon Hong, to about 15  people\r\n\r\nwho  were  said  to  have been  working  for  that\r\n\r\ncandidate. None of the witnesses could tell us who\r\n\r\nthose  person were, or what they were supposed  to\r\n\r\ndo  for  Mr  Koh  Choon Hong, and  there  was  no\r\n\r\nevidence as to whether they were electors  in  the\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar division. Mr Koh Choon Hong  denied\r\n\r\nthat  the office was his and said he know  nothing\r\n\r\nof  the  people  said to have  frequented  it.  As\r\n\r\nregards  the cost of the coffee, it appeared  that\r\n\r\n$19.50 had been paid by a witness named Lim  Tiong\r\n\r\nYap  for coffee consumed up to the 10th June,  and\r\n\r\n$22.50   was  outstanding  in  respect  of  coffee\r\n\r\nconsumed between the 11th and 24th June. Mr  Lirn\r\n\r\nTiong  Yap  alleged  that Mr  Mak  Pak  Shee  had\r\n\r\nprovided  the $19.50 and was responsible  for  the\r\n\r\n$22.50;  and  that Mr Mak Pak Shee  had  arranged\r\n\r\nwith  him  to pay for the refreshments because  he\r\n\r\n(Mr  Mak  Pak Shee) was supporting Mr Koh  Choon\r\n\r\nHong.  Mr, Mak Pak Shee denied the allegation.  We\r\n\r\nfound  that  Mr Lim Tiong Yap was  an  unreliable\r\n\r\nwitness,  and  we  are  unable  to  come  to   any\r\n\r\nconclusion as to whether anyone other than he  had\r\n\r\nprovided  the  $19.50  and  was  responsible   for\r\n\r\npayment   of  the  $22.50  outstanding.  Assuming,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that Mr Lim Tiong Yap's allegation  was\r\n\r\ntrue,  we  do  not consider that any  question  of\r\n\r\ntreating would arise. There was no evidence of the\r\n\r\nidentity  of  the  persons who  had  consumed  the\r\n\r\ncoffee,  and even if they were electors in Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  division, it seems to us quite  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  coffee  was  provided  for  them  by  way  of\r\n\r\nrefreshment in the course of their work,  and  not\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of inducing them to vote for  Mr Koh Choon Hong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the witness who came forward with the\r\n\r\nnotebook gave his evidence in public and was ready\r\n\r\nto  be  cross-examined by Mr Mak  Pak  Shee,  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Minister, or anyone on his behalf.  The\r\n\r\nperson against whom this allegation was made chose\r\n\r\nto  meet the Commission in camera, and nothing  is\r\n\r\nsaid  as to what is transpired in camera. But  one\r\n\r\nthing  is quite clear - that the Assistant Minister,\r\n\r\nusing  his  position  as  Assistant  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare,  had telephoned  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOfficer  of the Singapore Harbour Board,  one  Mr\r\n\r\nArcher, and told him to release this man Lim Tiong\r\n\r\nYap  as and when this man required, whilst he  was\r\n\r\non duty and being paid for, in order that he might\r\n\r\ncanvass  for Mr Koh Choon Hong. Now, Sir, nothing\r\n\r\nis  said about that. Mr Archer admitted it and  I\r\n\r\nmust,  for  the record of this House, deplore  the\r\n\r\nomission of the evidence which was taken on  these two matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter for considerable regret. A\r\n\r\nwhole  host of this evidence would have  withstood\r\n\r\ncross-examination  in an open Commission.  Because\r\n\r\nof  this  lapse  which  I  find  difficult  to  understand,  this  almost  forgetfulness,   of   the\r\n\r\nChairman,  who was legally qualified and  trained,\r\n\r\nto give an opportunity to the persons against whom\r\n\r\nthese allegations were made to know of them and to\r\n\r\ncross-examine  the witnesses, a  lot  of  unworthy\r\n\r\npeople will now have worthy excuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the allegations made were of a very\r\n\r\nserious  nature  and I would  list  them  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  hon. Members. First, the one  against\r\n\r\nChong   Wee  Ling,  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party\r\n\r\ncandidate. This appears on page 17, paragraph 34:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Further information from Police sources was to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that one Aw Sai Soo, a member  of  the\r\n\r\nTai  Chap Wee secret society of 24 Group, had been\r\n\r\nengaged  by Mr Chong Wee Ling at a remuneration\r\n\r\nof  $400 per month to put up election posters  for\r\n\r\nhim;  and  that  he  had been promised  a  further\r\n\r\n$1,000 on polling day, but there was no indication\r\n\r\nas  to  whether the latter sum had  in  fact  been paid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, then, Mr Chong Wee Ling's by election returns were published and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  such  item  was  disclosed.  Even  though  the\r\n\r\nevidence might have been insufficient to  mount  a\r\n\r\nprosecution, it is a matter for regret  that  this\r\n\r\nevidence,  given  presumably by a police  officer.\r\n\r\nshould not have been revealed to him in order that\r\n\r\nhe  could  challenge it, and  there  could  be  no excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next was one against Mr Koh Choon Hong, contained in page 18, paragraph 36:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"According to information from a Police source,\r\n\r\nMr  Koh  Choon  Hong engaged the  Headman  and  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  969 secret society of 24  Group,  four\r\n\r\nmembers  of  other secret societies  of  the  same\r\n\r\nGroup and a member of a secret society of 18 Group\r\n\r\nat  a  daily remuneration of $12 each, to  canvass for votes...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, again it seems to me signal folly not to\r\n\r\nhave  put  this  evidence to Mr Koh  Choon  Hong,\r\n\r\noffer  him  the  privilege of cross-examining  the\r\n\r\nwitness  and going to the witness-box to deny  it.\r\n\r\nThe odds are this evidence must have been reliable\r\n\r\nand should have been properly put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, an allegation against the Labour Front candidate. Mr Keng Ban Ee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"According to information from two separate\r\n\r\nPolice   sources   described  as  reliable,   this\r\n\r\ncandidate  sought and obtained the  assistance  of\r\n\r\none Jiman Bin Simen alias Panjang, the Headman  of\r\n\r\n329  secret society of 36 Group, and promised  him\r\n\r\nthat if he was successful in the election he would\r\n\r\npresent  him with a motorcar as a reward  for  his help.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Unfortunately he was not successful so  I  presume\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the  motorcar  did  hot  arise.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I cannot understand why Mr Keng  Ban\r\n\r\nEe  was not given the opportunity to explain  that\r\n\r\nhe did not buy the motorcar because he did not win the election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for our Member for Cairnhill - and I think he need have no fear that I shall be\r\n\r\nreading  the allegations in reference  to  my  own\r\n\r\ncandidature - it is said in paragraph 41, page 19:\r\n\r\nOne   witness   told  us  that  on   polling   day\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Lau Yong Heng secret society  went\r\n\r\nfrom   house   to  house  collecting  voters   and\r\n\r\ncompelling  them to go to the polling  station  in\r\n\r\ncars  bearing Mr Soh Ghee Soon's symbol. Lim  Toh\r\n\r\nHeng  admitted to us that in 1953 he had been  one of the\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders of the Lau Yong Heng secret society, but\r\n\r\nsaid he had resigned his membership in 1953. He\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>namely, the leader of the secret society-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"said that Mr Soh Ghee Soon had asked him to help\r\n\r\nhim by driving a car on polling day to transport\r\n\r\nvoters to the polling station, and that on polling day he did so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He did so but he did not mention the consideration for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the Commission had given Mr Soh,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill, the opportunity - as  in\r\n\r\nfact  they did give him in another instance  about\r\n\r\nseven of his helpers being City Council employees \r\n\r\n- then  Mr  Soh  would have no just complaint  for\r\n\r\nthis  allegation made against him. But I think  he\r\n\r\nis  entitled  to complain that this  very  serious\r\n\r\ncharge that he had solicited and obtained the help\r\n\r\nof  a  leader of a secret society, was not put  to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Commission, in page 24, paragraph 61, had done this in regard to another allegation against Mr Soh:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Soh Ghee Soon told us that 7 of his helpers\r\n\r\nwere  employees of the City Council. He  said  one\r\n\r\nwas  employed as a clerk at the rate of $5 a  day,\r\n\r\ntwo  were paid $20 each for their services  during\r\n\r\nthe   campaign,   and   the  other   four   worked\r\n\r\nvoluntarily. At the time of the Bye-Elections  Mr\r\n\r\nSoh Ghee Soon himself was a City Councillor. Under\r\n\r\nthe  City Council's Conduct and Discipline  Rules,\r\n\r\ntheir  employees are divided into two  categories,\r\n\r\nRestricted  and  Unrestricted. Those  in  the  Restricted  class are all senior officers and holders\r\n\r\nof  clerical and technical posts above  the  time-scale,  as  well as all employees who in  any  way\r\n\r\ncome  in  contact with the public in  an  official\r\n\r\ncapacity.  One  of  the 7 City  Council  employees\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  Mr  Soh  Ghee  Soon  (one  of  the\r\n\r\nrecipients of $20 for his services) was  a  junior\r\n\r\nofficer  in  the Secretariat and in the Restricted\r\n\r\nclass.  We consider that it was improper  for  Mr\r\n\r\nSoh  Ghee  Soon  to  make use  of  that  officer's\r\n\r\nservices in his election campaign, particularly as\r\n\r\nhe  himself was a City Councillor and, as such,  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  authority  responsible  for   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of discipline among the City  Council staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well,  that  is  the proper way.  There  was  this\r\n\r\nevidence against Mr Soh. It was undesirable.  Mr\r\n\r\nSoh  was  given  the  opportunity - the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  was given the opportunity  to  explain.\r\n\r\nThe   fact   that   he  failed   to   explain   it\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily to the Commission was  a  piece  of\r\n\r\nmisfortune which befell him,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  nevertheless he was given the opportunity  in\r\n\r\nthis instance which he was not in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this was the police statement made\r\n\r\nagainst election activities, not against me,  but\r\n\r\nagainst the campaigning on my behalf, and I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  record here my regret that  such  allegations  were  made without having been put  to  me\r\n\r\nbeing brought to my notice, or indeed been put  to\r\n\r\nthe    persons   against   whom   these   specific\r\n\r\nallegations  were put. It said  first  of  all  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 31, page 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Early  in April, 1957, a dispute arose  in  Craig\r\n\r\nRoad  between  members of the Ji Tok  Kiat  secret\r\n\r\nsociety of 24 Group on the one part, and 206, 309,\r\n\r\nand  the Hai Lok San secret societies of 108 Group\r\n\r\non  the other part, and later the same evening  an\r\n\r\nopen  fight took place in Duxton Road between  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the two Groups, in which bottles  and\r\n\r\nknives   were  used.  The  two  Groups  of  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  were  associated with the  two  Chinese\r\n\r\nclans  which  were predominant in the Duxton  Road\r\n\r\narea,  the 24 Group with the Teo clan and the  108\r\n\r\nGroup  with the Ho clan. Initial efforts to settle\r\n\r\nthe   dispute  by  arbitration  failed   and   the\r\n\r\nsituation  remained in ferment. Mr Lee Kuan  Yew,\r\n\r\nwho was away in England at the time the dispute occurred,  was  informed  of the  situation  on  his\r\n\r\nreturn by Mr Ho Beh Swee. . ., the leader of  the\r\n\r\nHo  clan  in the Duxton Road area and a  Committee\r\n\r\nmember of the Tanjong Pagar Branch of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party. Being aware that a Bye-Election  was\r\n\r\nto  take place soon in the Tanjong Pagar division,\r\n\r\nhe  was anxious that the dispute should be settled\r\n\r\nbecause  he feared that an alignment of the  clans\r\n\r\nand  the secret societies supporting them with the\r\n\r\ncandidates in the forthcoming Bye-Elections  might\r\n\r\nresult in clashes during the election campaign. On\r\n\r\nthe 18th April, 1957, the situation had become  so\r\n\r\nserious  that  Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew  telephoned  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Police in charge of  the  Secret\r\n\r\nSocieties  Branch  of  the Criminal  Investigation\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  warn  him of the  tension  and  to\r\n\r\ninform  him that members of the Ho clan,  who  had\r\n\r\nsupported  him  during  the 1955  Elections,  were\r\n\r\nhoarding  weapons such as bicycle  chains,  poles,\r\n\r\nand  daggers  for protection against  an  expected\r\n\r\nattack  by  members  of the  Teo  clan,  who  were\r\n\r\nsupporters  of  Mr  William  Tan,  the   Liberal-Socialist  member of the Legislative Assembly  for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru division, and he suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nPolice should help to settle the dispute. He  said\r\n\r\nthat he would get in touch wih Mr William Tan and\r\n\r\nthat  they and the leaders of the two clans should\r\n\r\nmeet in the Superintendent's office with a view to\r\n\r\nresolving    the   situation,   to    which    the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent agreed. Mr Lee Kuan Yew then  got\r\n\r\nin  touch  with  Mr  William Tan  who  agreed  to\r\n\r\nmediate  in  the  dispute, and  in  fact  he  [Mr\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Tan] was able to effect a settlement  with\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation of Mr Ho Beh Swee and  Mr  Teo\r\n\r\nChoon  Huat,  the leader of the Teo  clan  in  the\r\n\r\nDuxton  Road  area.  On the 15th  May,  1957,  Mr\r\n\r\nWilliam  Tan, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Ho  Beh  Swee,\r\n\r\nand Mr Teo Choon  Huat  called on the Superintendent  of  the\r\n\r\nSecret Societies Branch in his office and formally\r\n\r\nannounced  to  him  that  the  dispute  had   been settled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, if the Commission had put those facts, I\r\n\r\ncould easily have told the Commission that on  the\r\n\r\nday   when  it  was  being  settled,  the   formal\r\n\r\nannouncement  on 15th May, was in  my  absence.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Tiong Bahru will recall  that\r\n\r\nI  was late because I was held up in court. When I\r\n\r\narrived  at  the  office  of  the  Superintendent,\r\n\r\nSecret  Societies Sub-Branch, Mr Ho, Mr  Teo  and\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  were  there together  with  the  Superintendent  and they informed me that the matter  had\r\n\r\nbeeii  settled.  Now it is this  sort  of  mistake\r\n\r\nwhich  would have been avoided if only  the  facts\r\n\r\nhad  been put, if only, instead of the officer-in-charge  of the Secret Societies Sub-Branch  giving\r\n\r\nevidence  in  camera, he had given  it  either  in\r\n\r\ncamera  in  my  presence,  or  in  public  to   my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report goes on, in paragraph 35, to say with regard to the by-election:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"According to information from Police sources\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  reliable,  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew  was\r\n\r\nsupported  by members of secret societies  of  108\r\n\r\nGroup  and  members of 969 secret  society  of  24\r\n\r\nGroup  of the Cantonese section of Chinatown,  who\r\n\r\ncanvassed  for  votes  for  him  and  put  up  his\r\n\r\nposters. One Police report was to the effect  that\r\n\r\nMr  Ho  Beh Swee was supplying food, refreshments\r\n\r\nand  cigarettes to members of the  Sio  Eng  Hiong\r\n\r\nsecret  society of 108 Group, who were putting  up\r\n\r\nelection  posters  for Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew  in  the\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar area.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Mr  Ho Beh Swee was the same gentlemen  who\r\n\r\nhad  informed  me  of an impending  clash  in  the\r\n\r\nDuxton Road area, who was at that time a member of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Tanjong Pagar Branch Committee.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  Mr  Ho  Beh  Swee unfortunately  was  never\r\n\r\ncalled   to   deny  this - that  he   had   supplied\r\n\r\nrefreshments. In fact, according to my reports, because  of all these clashes with gangs and  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties,  he quietly withdrew from the  election\r\n\r\ncampaign altogether. Now whatever was the truth of the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter, the thing should have been investigated,  Mr  Ho  should  have  been   called,\r\n\r\nbecause  there was an allegation made against  Mr\r\n\r\nHo.  There is, true, no further allegation that  I\r\n\r\nasked  Mr Ho to act on my behalf in this  matter;\r\n\r\nnevertheless, Mr Ho should have been asked, and I\r\n\r\ncan  see no excuse whatsoever for this unfortunate lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to make this allegation in page 18, same paragraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At five public meetings which Mr Lee Kuan Yew\r\n\r\nheld  in  different  parts of  the  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\ndivision   during  the  month   of   June,   1957,\r\n\r\ndetectives  observed members of  secret  societies\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the  crowd and  generally  acting  as stewards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Tanjong Pagar area has probably\r\n\r\nthe  highest number of secret societies, according\r\n\r\nto Sub-Branch officials.

Moreover, we considered that  whenever\r\n\r\nit  was  necessary for a witness to give  evidence\r\n\r\nbefore  us in camera especially on the subject  of\r\n\r\nsecret  societies, that witness  was  entitled  to\r\n\r\nexpect that his identity should remain unknown not\r\n\r\nonly to the public at large but also in particular\r\n\r\nto  the person or persons about whom he was  testifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were conducting an Inquiry and not a trial but\r\n\r\neven if proceedings under certain local Ordinances\r\n\r\nwhere the liberty of persons detained is involved,\r\n\r\nthe   need   for  protecting  witnesses   by   not\r\n\r\ndisclosing their identity is recognised by law and\r\n\r\nthe  evidence of such witnessess is not  given  in\r\n\r\nthe  presence  of nor subject to cross-examination\r\n\r\nby  the  person affected. In our opinion,  similar\r\n\r\nconsiderations apply in our Inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 8th July, 1957, the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  in  moving  his motion, which  brought  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry into being, spoke  words  of\r\n\r\nwisdom  and even foretold the findings of  such  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry. Official Report  Volume  2\r\n\r\nNo. 30, column 2171 contains these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But if an Inquiry Commission were set up which\r\n\r\nis  not  confined  to  the technicalities  of  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  law of corruption, then some astonishing\r\n\r\ndisclosures could take place.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>Words of wisdom, prophetic words, Sir!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe prepared us for some astonishing\r\n\r\ndisclosures  and we were therefore not  astonished\r\n\r\nby paragraph 35 of the Report (Sessional Paper No.\r\n\r\nCmd.  7  of 1958) under the heading \"MR LEE  KUAN\r\n\r\nYEW\"  but  what  astonishes us is  that  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember   was   apparently   astonished   by    the\r\n\r\nastonishing  disclosures in  the  said  paragraph.\r\n\r\nWell,  well, well, what an astonishing sequel!  He\r\n\r\nnow wants this House to note\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"with regret that the Commission of Inquiry into\r\n\r\nCorrupt,  Illegal  or  Undesirable  Practices   at\r\n\r\nElections had made its report (Sessional Paper No.\r\n\r\nCmd.  7  of  1958) without giving to some  of  the\r\n\r\npersons,  against whom allegations  were  made  in\r\n\r\nsecret,  the opportunity to know of such  evidence\r\n\r\nand  to  cross-examine such witnesses and  to  confront them with contrary evidence...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  yet,  Sir,  there is no record  of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  having raised any difficulties  about  the\r\n\r\nCommission taking evidence in camera or asked  for\r\n\r\nany  elucidation of procedure from the Commission.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the terms of the Commission of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nwere  clear  to  him  before  the  Commission  was\r\n\r\nappointed.  Formal notice setting out  the  Commis\r\n\r\nsion  makes  it quite clear that any  witness  who\r\n\r\nstates  that he desires to give evidence in camera\r\n\r\nshall be at liberty to do so and in such case, the\r\n\r\nCommission shall direct that any such evidence\r\n\r\nshall  be  heard  in camera or otherwise  recorded\r\n\r\nwithout   being  made  available  to  the  public.\r\n\r\nLooking  back, this may be loosely worded  but  at\r\n\r\nleast  criticism  cannot be levelled  at  the  Commission  for procedure which was well  within  the\r\n\r\nterms  of reference, and, as I said, the terms  of\r\n\r\nreference  were  clear to the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar before the Commission was appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, Sir, was further made by the Chairman\r\n\r\nof   the   Commission  in  a  broadcast  on   25th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1957. He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Remember also that if you wish to give evidence\r\n\r\nin  private,  the Commission will and indeed  must\r\n\r\ncomply  with  your request and if  you  mark  your\r\n\r\ncorrespondence `confidential', it will be  treated\r\n\r\nas such.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore Standard of 10th October, 1957, there was a story saying\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  12  subpoenaed witnesses  who  were\r\n\r\npresent,  six  offered to give their  evidence  in\r\n\r\npublic while the other six elected to give  it  in\r\n\r\ncamera.  No question seems to have been raised  as\r\n\r\nto  whether  the  candidates in  the  by-elections\r\n\r\nwould  have an opportunity of hearing or, if  they\r\n\r\nso  wished,  submitting rebuttals to the  evidence\r\n\r\nlaid by these witnesses before the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in the Straits Times of 17th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1958  a  story  said  that  of  the  40\r\n\r\nwitnesses  heard by the Commission, half  of  them\r\n\r\ngave  evidence  in  camera. In  the  story  was  a\r\n\r\nparagraph which said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commission examined several witnesses both\r\n\r\nin  open  and private sessions who admitted  their\r\n\r\nconnections  with  secret societies  and  to  have\r\n\r\nhelped  election candidates. No private  query  or\r\n\r\npublic comment was raised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, column 2170 of the Official Report referred\r\n\r\nto  contains  these  words uttered  by  the  hon. Member:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our law, as I have said, is copied from the\r\n\r\nEnglish  law  which  is  effective  under  English\r\n\r\nsocial  conditions where people will give evidence\r\n\r\nand  denounce  others in open court.  Here  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible.  Unless we give witnesses a  guarantee\r\n\r\nof  secrecy, it is impossible to get these  people\r\n\r\nto come forward in court.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Unless  we give witnesses a guarantee of secrecy,\r\n\r\nit  is  impossible  to get these  people  to  come\r\n\r\nforward in court.\" More words of wisdom!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 2202 records the hon. Member as saying:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am quite satisfied to have a separate Court\r\n\r\nprovided that there is sufficient protection given\r\n\r\nfor  it  to make a complete and thorough  inquiry.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  complete privilege,  sympathy  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, and extra judicial powers in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat   it  can  hear  evidence  which  would   not\r\n\r\notherwise  be  received, and can hear  second-hand\r\n\r\nevidence if necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All   these,   Sir,  are  words  of  wisdom!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission did exactly what the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar wished to see  done  and\r\n\r\nnow  the  hon.  Member  says that  the  Commission\r\n\r\nshould  have  done otherwise. What an  astonishing\r\n\r\ndisclosure of a man who has been claiming that he\r\n\r\nalways means what he says but now apparently  says\r\n\r\nthat  he  does not mean what he meant to  say  on 18th July, 1957!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government having appointed the\r\n\r\nCommission believed that they would be able to assess the credibility of witnesses and\r\n\r\nthe degree of credence to be given to the evidence\r\n\r\nsubmitted. What the hon. Member is asking is  that\r\n\r\nhe himself should act as an independent Commission\r\n\r\non  the  witnesses and their evidence  and  decide\r\n\r\ntherefore  on  what he considers the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the judgment of the Commission. The Government\r\n\r\ncaniiot accept any criticism which reflects on the\r\n\r\nintegrity or efficiency of the Commission.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  Commission which is  on  trial  but  the\r\n\r\nsecret  society  penetration of political  Parties\r\n\r\nwhich no one in this House denies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things, Sir, are quite clear about the\r\n\r\nCommission. First, they were clearly impartial  in\r\n\r\ntheir  stringencies  on the  relations  of  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  to all political Parties and  secondly,\r\n\r\nthey gave the source of their evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the second part of the motion\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...and that this House urges the Government to\r\n\r\ntake  action against the persons whom  the  report\r\n\r\nsays  the  Police have reliable evidence of  their\r\n\r\nhaving  solicited and paid for the  assistance  of\r\n\r\ngangsters in their elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What did the hon. Member say on 18th July, 1957? I\r\n\r\nquote from column 2167 of the Official Report:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The by-elections led to a great number of\r\n\r\ncharges  and counter-charges of strongarm methods,\r\n\r\nillegal  methods, corrupt methods, but no election\r\n\r\ncandidate  has filed an election petition  against\r\n\r\nhis  opponents,  nor indeed has  anyone  made  any\r\n\r\nserious complaint to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And in column 2174, he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the cloistered atmosphere of a court such as\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  on  Corruption,  or  a  court  of\r\n\r\nenquiry  or  some  tribunal not hamstrung  by  the\r\n\r\nstrict rules of the law of evidence, a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  corrupt and improper practices can be  brought\r\n\r\nto light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  would  like hon.

The  Hon. the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General would have done so if he had been\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  there was evidence  on  which  to\r\n\r\nfound  a  prosecution and in  the  light  of  this\r\n\r\nexplanation, I am sure that this House will reject this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some more words of wisdom from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar, a very learned member  of  the\r\n\r\nBar! Column 2174 reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The whole of the law relating to corrupt and\r\n\r\nimproper practices is completely unsuitable to our\r\n\r\nconditions, and we cannot bring the crooks to book\r\n\r\nwith these laws.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  has  admitted, Sir, that we cannot  bring  the\r\n\r\ncrooks to book with the present law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear from my speech that the\r\n\r\nGovernment opposes the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe this motion is aimed\r\n\r\nat  the Commission of Inquiry or I would say  that\r\n\r\nthe  mover of this motion has no confidence in the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Commission. I thought  that  this\r\n\r\nCommission was first asked to be appointed by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar and that  he  expressed\r\n\r\ngreat  faith in Commissions of Inquiry.  In  fact,\r\n\r\none  of the Commissions of Inquiry was praised  by\r\n\r\nhim  a great deal, and this House was urged by him\r\n\r\nto see that all its findings should be recorded as\r\n\r\ntruths  and its recommendations implemented.  This\r\n\r\nmotion, however, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseems to give me an idea that there may be\r\n\r\nCommissions  of Inquiry but that some  Commissions\r\n\r\nare  good  and some not so good. Some  Commissions\r\n\r\nwould  be acceptable to the People's Action Party,\r\n\r\nother  Commissions must be totally  rejected.  But\r\n\r\nstill,  the People's Action Party finds that  some\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  Report should be  praised - such  as\r\n\r\ncandidates  buying  coffee for  their  helpers  or\r\n\r\ncandidates wanting to buy a car for one  of  their\r\n\r\nhelpers.  No regret has been expressed  about  the\r\n\r\nfindings   of   the   Commission,   although   the\r\n\r\nCommission  reported  that  there  has   been   no\r\n\r\nconcrete evidence to bring these cases to book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On looking through the Report, I, however,\r\n\r\nregretted  the appearance of paragraph 31  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar was connected  with\r\n\r\nsecret societies and through his good offices  was\r\n\r\nable to settle disputes amongst them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is your colleague, the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\ntook  a  big hand. In paragraph 46, another member\r\n\r\nof  these undesirable people tried to help him  by\r\n\r\ntearing down posters. Furthermore, there are  more\r\n\r\nallegations  in  this  Report  and  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nChapter V is devoted to it under the heading \"USE\r\n\r\nOF  FORCE  AND COMPULSION (Aggressive Attitude  to\r\n\r\nVoters)\". All these I think, Sir, are the parts of\r\n\r\nthe  Report  that  should be very much  regretted!\r\n\r\nThey  should  never have made their appearance  in\r\n\r\nthe   Report!   If  they  have  not   made   their\r\n\r\nappearance,  then  this Report is  good.  However,\r\n\r\nthey have made their appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It astounded me even more that there should be\r\n\r\naccusations   of   candidates  being   helped   by\r\n\r\ngangsters to win the elections with or without the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the candidates. The Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar said that if you look up the  records,\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar is an area which can boast the  most\r\n\r\nnumber  of  gangsters  in  Singapore  and  yet  he represents them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I would say that the Commission should\r\n\r\nhave  specially  written in its  Report  that  the\r\n\r\ngangsters voted for him without his knowledge  and\r\n\r\nthat   some   of  them  helped  him  without   his\r\n\r\nknowledge!  But I would like this House  to  note,\r\n\r\nSir,  that when a Commission is appointed by  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and if we have no faith in  the  members\r\n\r\nthat  are  appointed, or if  we  think  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot do a good job, then we should have said  so\r\n\r\nimmediately upon their appointments, or while  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  of the Commission are going  on,  and\r\n\r\nnot  wait until after the findings are made known,\r\n\r\nand  then  fling allegations at them. I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  allegations flung in this way are apt to  be\r\n\r\nbiased and not fair to all concerned. There may be\r\n\r\na few small faults but generally speaking, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Commission has revealed to Singapore  that  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of maipractices are perpetrated by many\r\n\r\nof these people who want the world to believe that\r\n\r\nthey  are  clean by first bringing a complaint  to\r\n\r\nthis Assembly to have the matter investigated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I think  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party should be blamed  for  what\r\n\r\nhappened  during the meeting held on  Sunday,  2nd\r\n\r\nJune,  1957.

That  big group came  to  disturb  our\r\n\r\nrally  and was, in fact, led by gangsters. I  have\r\n\r\ninformation that this group was led by the Sio Eng\r\n\r\nHiong  secret  society. Why  did  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar not make reference to this?  Why  I\r\n\r\nsay that, Sir, is because I am most concerned. The\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar said, in relation to page\r\n\r\n15, paragraph 31 of the Report, that I settled the\r\n\r\ndispute  between the secret societies.  The  Superintendent  of the Secret Societies Branch  in  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. told me that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nsaid that he represented the Ho clan who belong to\r\n\r\nthe  108 Group, as distinct from the Teo clan  who\r\n\r\nbelong        to        the       24        Group.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Where do you come in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I challenge him to deny\r\n\r\nthat  he  did not  make such  a  statement   in \r\n\r\nfront   of  the  Deputy Superintendent       of \r\n\r\nPolice.      I      was  surprised,  Sir,   that \r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar   did   not   say  \r\n\r\nanything in the  office of  the  Superintendent \r\n\r\nto deny that. I want to  say  that, because  the \r\n\r\nreason  why  I  stepped into  this dispute  was  \r\n\r\nthat the Ho and the Teo clans  in  Duxton  Road \r\n\r\ntold  me that they  had  no  faith  in the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  and  that  they did  not  like  him  to  \r\n\r\ncome  and interfere  in their   dispute   which \r\n\r\ninvolved them  in  that area.  Eventually,  the \r\n\r\nMember    for   Tanjong Pagar   approached   me  \r\n\r\nbecause  he  understood that   both  of   these  \r\n\r\nclans respected me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Whether he shouts,\r\n\r\n\"Hear,  hear!\" or  does not    shout,    \"Hear, \r\n\r\nhear!\", the dispute was  settled    without    a \r\n\r\nfight!  They  did   not belong     to    secret \r\n\r\nsocieties,    as    was alleged  by the  Member \r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar, and I  was really surprised \r\n\r\nwhy  he  did  not  deny that  fact in front  of \r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent  of Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point I want to make clear. When the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the   Commission    of   Inquiry  asked me - I am referring \r\n\r\nto  page  17, paragraph  33 -  whether I  knew  a  certain man by the name \r\n\r\nof   Teck  Hock,  alias  Teck  Ho,  I told  him that I did not know him unless  I  saw  him  in\r\n\r\nperson.   I   made    a  request    that    this person    should     be\r\n\r\nbrought to me in person to  identify whether  I knew  him as Teck  Hock\r\n\r\nor   Teck  Ho,  but  he never  did so, Sir.  He went  on  to  say  that\r\n\r\nTeck  Hock, alias  Teck Ho,  was  formerly  the headman of the Hai  Lok\r\n\r\nSan  secret society and I  told him that I  had no  idea about this.  I\r\n\r\ntold  him,  \"How  do  I know  if he is a member of  that secret society\r\n\r\nwhen  he does not  have any secret society wording   written  on   his\r\n\r\nforehead?\" I told  him, if  he were to say that Teck  Hock or  Teck  Ho\r\n\r\nwas   a  member  of   a secret   society, - these   are the words which  \r\n\r\nappear at the footnote on page 13:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We were particularly shocked when Mr\r\n\r\nWilliam  Tan, a  Member of    the   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly, told  us:  \"I know     many    people connected  with  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties   among    my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I   regret,  Sir,  that this remark or sentence has appeared in all the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and  in  the Malayan Monthly, and  I am   now  so  popularly\r\n\r\nlabelled as a friend of the  secret  societies. The   Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry said he was shocked.  I was  more shocked! Sir,\r\n\r\nactually  when  he  confronted  me  with   the  name  of Teck Ho  as  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Hai  Lok San  secret society,  I was taken aback because\r\n\r\nit  was not written  on his  forehead  that  he\r\n\r\nwas   a  member  of   a secret society. I  told him that, if he were to\r\n\r\nthink  like that,  then among  my friends there  must   be  members   of\r\n\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Hon. the Chief Minister when he said in his\r\n\r\nspeech that this is the type  of  motion  which the   hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar - he is the   Secretary-General of  the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty - likes  to   move, because  he  likes   to play  to  the  gallery.\r\n\r\nThe  hon. Member  knows that this motion may be 85  per cent or 90  per\r\n\r\ncent  true. Because  he regretted that  he  had ever  asked for a court\r\n\r\nof  inquiry to  be  set up,  he  has today,  in order to clear himself,\r\n\r\nmoved   a   motion   as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House notes with regret that the Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  Corrupt,  Illegal  or          Undesirable Practices  at Elections\r\n\r\nhad   made  its  report (Sessional  Paper   No. Cmd. 7 of 1958) without\r\n\r\ngiving  to some of  the persons,  against  whom allegations  were  made\r\n\r\nin      secret,     the opportunity to know  of such  evidence  and  to\r\n\r\ncross-examine      such witnesses  and  to  confront     them     with\r\n\r\ncontrary evidence;  and that  this House  urges the  Government to take\r\n\r\naction   against    the persons whom the report says  the  Police  have\r\n\r\nreliable  evidence   of their  having solicited and    paid   for   the\r\n\r\nassistance of gangsters in their elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to note, Sir, that the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas    rejected    this motion. Even though the Chairman     of     the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry said   that   he    was shocked  at  the   fact\r\n\r\nthat  among my  friends there  were many people connected  with  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties,   I    still that this report, though it is not a hundred per\r\n\r\ncent true, is 95 per cent or 99 per cent true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to have\r\n\r\nhad  the  advantage of hearing the speech  of  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Tiong Bahru.  I  had  a  little\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in linking some of it to  the  motion,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  quite clear that he is  a  very  know\r\n\r\nledgeable man, and I wish that I could have him at\r\n\r\nmy   side   in   other   places   and   in   other\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  With his assistance,  I  think  it\r\n\r\nmight  be possible to achieve what the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanjong   Pagar  has  described   as   quite\r\n\r\nimpossible,  and that is the bringing properly  to\r\n\r\njustice of a number of people who have in the past\r\n\r\nindulged in malpractices in elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar went\r\n\r\na  little  outside that paragraph  in  the  Report\r\n\r\nwhich mentions the 1955 elections and referred  to\r\n\r\none  specific case of an admission. It is all very\r\n\r\nwell,  Mr  Speaker, for people to come  here  and\r\n\r\nrefer to admissions of this kind and yet stay away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  places  where  such  information  could\r\n\r\nreally  be made great use of. The hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  knows as well as I do - and  he  has\r\n\r\nknown  for a long time - as my friend the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister  has  told  us,  just  what   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties are. He knows those difficulties.  He\r\n\r\nknew  them before this Commission was set up,  and\r\n\r\nit  is because of those difficulties that the evidence to which he seems to refer in the second part\r\n\r\nof  his motion is not anything better than second-hand,  or in many cases third-hand. If the  police\r\n\r\nhad  any  relevant admissible evidence,  I  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to take action against perhaps  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people; but if Members will read  what\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  has  said,  they  will  see  that\r\n\r\nnowhere  is  there anything better  than  evidence\r\n\r\nresulting from information which, according to the\r\n\r\npolice  or  to  police sources,  is  described  as\r\n\r\nreliable. Now that is not good enough. On that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  very wrong to seek to institute  a  prosecution - unless it were a prosecution  of  someone\r\n\r\nfor failing to come forward and give evidence that\r\n\r\nis within his knowledge. That has been considered,\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately we have not even got\r\n\r\nenough for that, and we have not got it for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  reasons which are so well known to  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar. There may be people - and\r\n\r\nhaving read this report I firmly believe there are\r\n\r\npeople - who  have committed offences in  connection\r\n\r\nwith  elections, and if I could lay  my  hands  on\r\n\r\nproper  evidence, I should prosecute - but I cannot.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  I could lay my hands on evidence  against\r\n\r\npeople  whom  I could prove have got evidence  and\r\n\r\nhave   refused  to  give  it  to  me,   I   should\r\n\r\nprosecute - but I have not got it. I have not got it\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  need to give  these  pledges  of secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use leaving things to other people.\r\n\r\nThat  does  happen in all communities. People  are\r\n\r\napt  to stand back and say they do not want to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved;  let other people get on  with  it.  \"Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we know it is all wrong. We know this goes\r\n\r\non;  we know that goes on and someone ought to put\r\n\r\nit right.\" Who is that someone? It is the Attorney-General or the Ministers. But how can the Attorney-General, the Ministers, or the police - anyone  concerned - do  anything  about it unless  people  will\r\n\r\nstop  saying, \"It is all wrong. I do  not  approve\r\n\r\nit,  but  I am having nothing to do with  it.\"  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  something that is wrong, come  out  and\r\n\r\nhelp. Perhaps with the help of the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru, any other hon. Member of this House,\r\n\r\nor   any   citizen  or  inhabitant  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nsomething could be done if we all had the  courage\r\n\r\nto come forward and say, \"We need no secrecy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want is the truth. We have not got it.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  we have this Commission which was set  up\r\n\r\nwith this very careful provision for the taking of\r\n\r\nevidence  in  camera. Now, because  we  have  that\r\n\r\nprovision, we have complaints that certain  people\r\n\r\nwere not allowed to cross-examine witnesses before\r\n\r\nthe  Commission.  Mr  Speaker,  to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nsecrecy  of this kind is necessary and to complain\r\n\r\nthat  one is not allowed to cross-examine witnesses\r\n\r\nis  a contradiction that needs no stressing by me.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  contradiction so obvious that  I  doubt\r\n\r\nwhether  any responsible Member of this House  can\r\n\r\npossibly, seriously, support this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  first  the statements of fact  made  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister. He said he cleared the  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference  of  this  Commission  with  me.  If  he\r\n\r\nintended   by  that  to  mean  that   he   cleared\r\n\r\nparagraphs  1,  2, 3 and 4 at page  3  of  Command\r\n\r\nPaper No. 7 of 1958, yes; but if he meant that  he\r\n\r\nhad cleared with me the procedure which is set out\r\n\r\nin  the paragraphs following, that is, 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n\r\n5,  6  and 7, then the answer is no. The terms  of\r\n\r\nreference in the report was a thing with which  I,\r\n\r\nas  the  mover  of the motion, was concerned.  The\r\n\r\nprocedure  was not one with which I was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Minister quoted me quite rightly that  I\r\n\r\nintended  that the Commission should  have  powers\r\n\r\nwhich need not have to be fettered by the rules of\r\n\r\nevidence, that evidence should be taken in  camera\r\n\r\nif required, and that secondary evidence should be\r\n\r\nheard.  But what I am asking the House to note  is\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a  failure to observe  the  rules  of\r\n\r\nevidence,  but  it  is  a  failure  to  observe  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  rule  of natural  justice  that  both\r\n\r\nsides  to a question must be heard; that in  these\r\n\r\ncases - the  ones  which I have  cited  earlier - both\r\n\r\nsides  were not heard. A police officer was heard.\r\n\r\nWhat he said was probably true, but it should have\r\n\r\nbeen given to the person against whom these things\r\n\r\nwere said in order that he could either say yes or\r\n\r\nno,  and further that he might be asked in  camera\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  he had taken into  consideration\r\n\r\nthis, that or the other. When a thing is heard  in\r\n\r\ncamera to the exclusion of the public, it does not\r\n\r\nmean  that  it is heard in camera to the exclusion\r\n\r\nof  the  interested party. In many delicate  cases\r\n\r\nthe  court is cleared. But you cannot have a court\r\n\r\nwhere  the  interested parties have been  cleared,\r\n\r\nand then proceed to hear evidence in camera in the\r\n\r\nabsence of the person against whom allegations are\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission said it called me up on 13th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1958. Yes, it did, and I was surprised because nothing specific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  put  to  me. \"Did gangsters paint the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsymbol  in Trengganu Street?\" I said, \"No, not  to\r\n\r\nmy knowledge.\" \"Well, we want to find out, that is\r\n\r\nall.\"  Many of the findings were never put to  me.\r\n\r\nIn  my  opinion, although the Commission may  have\r\n\r\nbeen right in not putting it to me because it  was\r\n\r\nnot  an allegation against me, it should have been\r\n\r\nput to the man who was then - not at the time of the\r\n\r\nhearing of the Commission, but at the time of  the\r\n\r\nby-election - a Committee member of a P.A.P. branch.\r\n\r\nIt  is  stated in paragraph 35 at page 17  of  the Command Paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"According to information from Police sources\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  reliable,  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew  was\r\n\r\nsupported  by members of secret societies  of  108\r\n\r\nGroup  and  members of 969 secret  society  of  24\r\n\r\nGroup  of the Cantonese section of Chinatown,  who\r\n\r\ncanvassed  for  votes  for  him  and  put  up  his\r\n\r\nposters. One Police report was to the effect  that\r\n\r\nMr  Ho  Beh Swee was supplying food, refreshments\r\n\r\nand  cigarettes to members of the  Sio  Eng  Hiong\r\n\r\nsecret society of 108 Group.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well,  Mr Ho Beh Swee should have been called  up\r\n\r\nand  asked, \"Did you supply?\", even though it  may\r\n\r\nhave  been irrelevant to me. As far as I  was  con\r\n\r\ncerned, it was res inter alios acta, but as far as\r\n\r\nHo  Beh  Swee  was concerned, this allegation  had\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and  published. He was never  told  of\r\n\r\nthis, in fact, if it had been mentioned to me that\r\n\r\nthis  was  said about Ho Beh Swee,  I  would  have\r\n\r\nbrought  him along to be cross-examined  on  this;\r\n\r\nbut  he was never called. That is what I am asking\r\n\r\nthe  House, to note with regret, and I am glad  to\r\n\r\nhear  the  Member for Tiong Bahru agrees  with  me\r\n\r\nthat 95 per cent of this report may be correct.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  at  the outset, and in fact,  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House were taken off balance  by\r\n\r\nthe very calculated stand which he did take at the\r\n\r\nopening,  namely, that whilst all  this  had  been\r\n\r\nsaid  and done, the substance was correct and  the\r\n\r\nonly  regret was that the thing was not done in  a\r\n\r\nway which made it beyond reproach. It is not rules\r\n\r\nof  evidence, as the Attorney-General knows, but it\r\n\r\nis a fundamental principle of natural justice - andi\r\n\r\nalterem  partem. He knows that; I do not  have  to\r\n\r\nteach     him.    But    the    Chief     Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  not  know  it.  It is not laid  down  in  the\r\n\r\nEvidence Ordinance of the Colony of Singapore, but\r\n\r\nit is a fundamental principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this is a matter for even greater\r\n\r\nregret,  these  witnesses who  sought  secrecy  in\r\n\r\ncamera.  Surely they were not afraid to  meet  the\r\n\r\npersons  against  whom  they  were  saying   these\r\n\r\nthings.  They  were police officers, and  probably\r\n\r\namongst  them  was the Officer i/c of  the  Secret\r\n\r\nSocieties Branch whom I had summoned for  help  in\r\n\r\norder  to prevent breaches of the peace.  If  this\r\n\r\nofficer  was  afraid to meet Mr Ho Beh  Swee,  or\r\n\r\nother  members of the Tanjong Pagar Committee  who\r\n\r\nwere  in charge of the elections, and against whom\r\n\r\nhe  might have said something, then there is  some\r\n\r\nthing seriously wrong with the police force. I can\r\n\r\nexpect individuals like To Tung Tak, or whoever it\r\n\r\nis  who  associated with the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Tiong Bahru, to be unhappy  at\r\n\r\nsaying  something about Mr X.Y.Z. in the latter's\r\n\r\npresence.  These  were  police  officers,  trained\r\n\r\npersonnel of the law, and I do not understand  why\r\n\r\ntheir   evidence  was  not  put  to  the   persons concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this at the outset. Many\r\n\r\nspeakers,  including, I may say with some  regret,\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister, have implied that I have noted\r\n\r\nwith  regret, because I was involved and I am  now\r\n\r\ntrying to exculpate myself. No, Sir,If the report\r\n\r\nis  read, nowhere is it said that Mr Lee Kuan Yew\r\n\r\nwent to see the headman of so and so. There is  no\r\n\r\nsuch allegation. It is alleged that some gangsters\r\n\r\nwent  there and helped, and I would have  been  as\r\n\r\ninterested as anybody else, for I would  have  had\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to go into the evidence. And this\r\n\r\nis  police  evidence. Surely the  Attorney-General\r\n\r\nhas   to  admit  that  if  police  officers   need\r\n\r\nprotection  from the public and from an interested\r\n\r\nparty -  be  it  me or Mr Ho Beh Swee - then  I  say\r\n\r\nsomething  is seriously wrong with the instruments\r\n\r\nof policy of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I still intend to proceed with the first\r\n\r\nlimb  of  my  motion, because I think I  am  fully\r\n\r\njustified  in taking note of it; but  in  view  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Attorney-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGeneral has  said,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend, with the leave  of  the House, to proceed with  the  second\r\n\r\nlimb of my motion, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and that this House urges the Government to take\r\n\r\naction  against the persons whom the  report  says\r\n\r\nthe  Police have reliable evidence of their having\r\n\r\nsolicited and paid for the assistance of gangsters\r\n\r\nin their elections.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Attorney-General has said that the police  in\r\n\r\nfact have reliable police evidence, but not of the\r\n\r\nnature that could be produced in a criminal court,\r\n\r\nand  I  therefore  beg leave to  expunge  from  my\r\n\r\nmotion the second limb as stated above. I think  I\r\n\r\nneed  the  consent  of the House,  under  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders, not to proceed with the second limb and  I\r\n\r\nshall  be  obliged if Members will indicate  their\r\n\r\nconsent. This is out of respect for a law  officer\r\n\r\nwho  has  informed me, according to the  evidence.\r\n\r\nBut  as  to the first limb of my motion, I see  no\r\n\r\nreasons whatsoever why this error should have been\r\n\r\ncommitted, particularly in view of the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthe witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would like to say this: if the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  says  he believes that  this  report  is\r\n\r\ncorrect, then it is a matter for some considerable\r\n\r\nregret  that he has not expelled Mr Keng Ban  Ee\r\n\r\nfrom his Party. The report says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"According to information from two separate\r\n\r\nPolice   sources   described  as  reliable,   this\r\n\r\ncandidate  sought and obtained the  assistance  of\r\n\r\none Jiman Bin Simen alias Panjang, the Headman  of\r\n\r\n329  secret society of 36 Group, and promised  him\r\n\r\nthat if he was successful in the election he would\r\n\r\npresent  him with a motorcar as a reward  for  his\r\n\r\nhelp.  Jiman  enlisted members of his  own  secret\r\n\r\nsociety, as well as members of secret societies of 24  Group operating in Jalan Besar area, to assist\r\n\r\nMr  Keng Ban Ee.

On that occasion  I\r\n\r\nhad  the unanimous support of all Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse urging the Singapore Harbour Board to accept\r\n\r\nand implement the recommendations of the Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  which  inquired into the dispute  between\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Harbour Board  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board Staff Association. With the Kallang\r\n\r\nby-election on, and the proposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited  Socialist  Front  which  is  a  new\r\n\r\nganging - up  of  the old actors  on  the  political\r\n\r\nstage,  it  would be sanguine of me to expect  the\r\n\r\nsame unanimity in getting this motion through this\r\n\r\nHouse. I have come here today prepared to meet the\r\n\r\nkind  of  niggling excuses from  Members  who  had\r\n\r\npledged, in April, to support me in such a  motion\r\n\r\nif  in fact by the next sitting of the House,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board had not  implemented  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Court of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be acquainted with the real core of the\r\n\r\ndispute  before  I go into the specific  findings.\r\n\r\nAnd  quite  frankly  I  do  not  think  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, as Minister for Labour and Welfare, will\r\n\r\ndisagree  if I said that the real core,  the  real\r\n\r\nreason  why this thing has blossomed in  this  way\r\n\r\nwith a threatened strike, is because the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board wants to break Mr Jamit Smgh,  who\r\n\r\nis the Secretary-General of the Staff Association,\r\n\r\nand  the Chief Minister is thoroughly dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Jamit Singh's conduct and is not in  the\r\n\r\nleast  bit  inclined to intervene or  prevent  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board Staff  Association  from\r\n\r\nbeating  the  brains out of Mr Jamit Singh.  That\r\n\r\nbriefly and succinctly is the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I can view with equanimity the\r\n\r\nbreaking  of  any individual trade union  official\r\n\r\nprovided it is fair and he asked for what  he  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to get. But I will not view with equanimity\r\n\r\na  move calculated to destroy someone who happened\r\n\r\nto    have    displeased   the   Chief   Minister,\r\n\r\nparticularly if it involves at the same  time  the\r\n\r\nbreaking up of a union; and that is what in effect\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Harbour Board intends to do, and the\r\n\r\nChief Minister intends to sit back and let them do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the strike has been called off because\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Trade Union Congress  had  made  an\r\n\r\nappeal  that  there should be no strike  and  that\r\n\r\navenues  should be explored for settling  it.  But\r\n\r\nlet  us  be  frank and honest. The real reason  is\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Harbour Board says, `Well,  all\r\n\r\nright,  this is the time. Let's call  in  all  the blacklegs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  you, the Government, give us all the arms  of\r\n\r\nthe police, Singapore Harbour Board Reserve and so\r\n\r\non,  and we'll break them up. Let's see who wins.'\r\n\r\nThe   Union,  quite  wisely,  took  stock  of  the\r\n\r\nposition and thought that the time for a fight was\r\n\r\nperhaps some other day on some other occasion. But\r\n\r\nthat  does  not  absolve - although  the  fight   is\r\n\r\navoided   because   the   Union   understood   the\r\n\r\ninappropriateness of the time - it does not  absolve\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Labour  and  Welfare  nor  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  from responsibility  in  seeing\r\n\r\nthat  this  dispute is solved in a way which  does\r\n\r\ncredit  to courts of inquiries, which does  credit\r\n\r\nto peaceful methods of solving labour disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the core of the dispute that remains\r\n\r\noutstanding is briefly this. Now there are 10 men,\r\n\r\n9 to 10 men - my  list shows 9, the Chief Minister says  10-men\r\n\r\nwho  have  not been reinstated, none of them.  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister says that is because the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board cannot find the men.  I  have  been\r\n\r\nplagued  and  pestered by these men every  time  I\r\n\r\nwent  to  the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff  Asso\r\n\r\nciation  and  I  am astounded that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board Chairman cannot find  them  because\r\n\r\nthey have been told time and time again to present\r\n\r\nthemselves - which they did - and never  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ngetting  employment  and reinstated.  And  I  have\r\n\r\noffered  to, and I will give the names,  addresses\r\n\r\nand  present the list. I do not know if the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister would consider this is harassing tactics,\r\n\r\nbut  if he wishes, I will lead the nine people  to\r\n\r\nhis  office, to prove to him that they  are  still\r\n\r\nthere waiting for jobs. But if he feels that  this\r\n\r\nis  not gentlemanly, then I will just provide  him\r\n\r\nwith the names and addresses and hope that he will\r\n\r\ndo something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is just the fringe of the dispute. The\r\n\r\nreal  dispute  is: does the Union,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  Staff Association,  represent  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  workers  in  the  Harbour  Board  to\r\n\r\nwarrant  recognition?  And  the  reason  why   the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Harbour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard  has  refused to meet the Union to  talk  it\r\n\r\nover  is  because it appears that if he meets  the\r\n\r\nUnion he has, ex hypothesi, acknowledged that  the\r\n\r\nUnion  represented the daily-rated workers,  which\r\n\r\nhe  does  not acknowledge, therefore he  will  not\r\n\r\nmeet the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is a recommendation here that\r\n\r\nthere should be a joint negotiating machinery  and\r\n\r\nthat  a ballot should be taken to see who or which\r\n\r\nis  the  union the majority of the members of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board staff support. I asked the\r\n\r\nquestion  last year of the Chief Minister  and  he\r\n\r\nsaid  he  was enquiring from the trade  unions  to\r\n\r\nfind   out   their  views  because   although   he\r\n\r\nunderstood that this was the practice in  America,\r\n\r\nhe  was  not quite sure whether it was appropriate\r\n\r\nhere.  Well,  Sir, since then at the Ford  factory\r\n\r\nthe  employers have agreed with the employees that\r\n\r\nthat  would  be  a  very convenient  and  suitable\r\n\r\nmethod and a ballot was taken. Secondly, the Trade\r\n\r\nUnion Congress has issued a statement, not just on\r\n\r\nthe  initiative of the Secretary who might be said\r\n\r\nmay  be sympathetic to the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association, but after it had gone  through\r\n\r\nthe governing council of the Trade Union Congress,\r\n\r\nthat  the  taking of a ballot is a fit and  proper\r\n\r\nmethod  of  finding out whether  or  not  a  union\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  majority  of  members   under   a\r\n\r\nparticular employer. And I would like very briefly\r\n\r\nand  simply to have the answer of the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare. In view of these developments,\r\n\r\ndoes  he  intend to make further inquiries?  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  the answer is yes. How long  will  he\r\n\r\ntake? Will it go on until next year by which  time\r\n\r\na decision may never have been taken by him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I said before that there is a lot of\r\n\r\npolitics involved in all this and it came out very\r\n\r\nclearly   to  the  forefront  recently  when   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board, almost  in  a  state  of\r\n\r\ndesperation, said, `Ah, well, never  mind  if  the\r\n\r\nUnion  goes  on strike.' It has got a  negotiating\r\n\r\ncommittee already with six other Unions which  the\r\n\r\nCourt       of       Inquiry       had       found\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  not represent any sizeable proportion, or any\r\n\r\nproportion  at all, of the members of the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard.  Now,  in the appendix to the  report,  the\r\n\r\nCourt  set  out  the membership  register  of  the\r\n\r\nUnions  which  the Singapore Harbour Board  claims\r\n\r\nrepresent its employees. If I may just briefly run\r\n\r\nthrough it, on page 10 of the report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBLU (Singapore Harbour Board Labour\r\n\r\nUnion) - number  of  members  on  the  books,   491;\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions states 322 probably  old\r\n\r\nmembers,  169 new members, another register  shows\r\n\r\n316 members, membership declining rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SW&SLU (Ship Wharf and Ship Labour Union) - number\r\n\r\nof  members, 325; subscriptions book inspected  by\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade  Unions;  in  the  light   of\r\n\r\nsubscription receipts, membership declining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSCET (Confederation of the Singapore Chinese\r\n\r\nEngineering Tradesmen) - number of members, 292; Registrar of Trade Unions\r\n\r\nunable  to  say whether all working for  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HBEU of S (Harbour Board Employees Union of\r\n\r\nSingapore) - number   of  members,   270;   official\r\n\r\nnotification  of  this  figure  not  submitted  to\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSU (Malay Seamen's Union of Singapore) - number\r\n\r\nof members, 117; this figure said by the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  the  Union to represent employees of Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board; Registrar of Trade Unions unable to\r\n\r\nsay whether this statement correct. States however\r\n\r\nthat  only  16 members appeared to have  paid  subscription.  The  remainder  paid  no  subscription\r\n\r\nduring 1957, and many paid nothing at all for  the last 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBEWU (Singapore Harbour Board Engineering\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Union) - number  of  members,  34;  after\r\n\r\nSeptember 1956 nobody paid subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBS & WWU (Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard Stevedore and Wharf Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion) - number of members, 307; only\r\n\r\n62 applications for membership duly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompleted. Registrar of Trade Unions said that  he\r\n\r\nwas  told by officials of the union that  245  who\r\n\r\nhad  defaulted had recommenced to pay subscription\r\n\r\nin June - just before the inquiry started. And the\r\n\r\nsum  total  of all that book membership  does  not\r\n\r\nclear 1,200 members out of a total labour force of\r\n\r\nover 8,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, how long can one pretend that these\r\n\r\nUnions  exist when they do not, that  members  are\r\n\r\nthere when they are not? The question of principle\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister for Labour and  Welfare  must\r\n\r\ndecide  is  this:  is  he prepared  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nemployer  to  take  advantage  of  the  organs  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  break a union, when  in  fact  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Inquiry has recommended that  a  ballot\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken to see whether or not the  Union\r\n\r\nhas  the support of the majority of members of the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board? Is the Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare prepared to stand back and tell the Board,\r\n\r\n'Yes,  that's  right.  You  carry  on  with   this\r\n\r\nnegotiating machinery with six unions that  really\r\n\r\ndo not exist, and refuse to negotiate with the one\r\n\r\nunion that does exist'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no possibility for the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare escaping responsibility by  his\r\n\r\nsaying,  `Ah, well, this is a matter  between  the\r\n\r\nemployer  and  the Union', because in  this  parti\r\n\r\ncular case the Court of Inquiry had been appointed\r\n\r\nby both sides. And I would like to remind him that\r\n\r\nI  saw  him before the Court was appointed;  there\r\n\r\nwas  delay in its appointment and he told me  that\r\n\r\nthe  delay  was  because he  had  been  unable  to\r\n\r\npersuade the Singapore Harbour Board to accept the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  in advance,  because  he  saw  no\r\n\r\npoint  in  appointing a court  unless  both  sides\r\n\r\nagreed  to accept its recommendations in  advance.\r\n\r\nSubsequently  it  did and then  he  appointed  the\r\n\r\nCourt.  He  cannot absolve himself from the  moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility of seeing that the Court  which  he\r\n\r\nappointed after both sides had promised to  accept\r\n\r\nits   recommendations  does  in  fact   have   its\r\n\r\nrecommendations accepted by both  parties  to  the\r\n\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the unreasonable and\r\n\r\nobstructive  attitude  of  the  Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  in  not  complying with the recommendations\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Report of the Court  of  Inquiry\r\n\r\n(Sessional  Paper  No.  S  7  of  1957)   as   was\r\n\r\nunanimously urged in this House on the 24th day of\r\n\r\nApril, 1958, and calls upon the Government to take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  compel the Singapore Harbour  Board  to\r\n\r\ncomply with the recommendations in that Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, the dispute between the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Staff Association and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board has been the  subject  of\r\n\r\nmany  speeches in this House; even as far back  as\r\n\r\nDecember last year, the hon. Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\npainted  a  very  sorry  picture  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  this  particular staff  association\r\n\r\ngoing  on  a  hunger strike on the advice  of  its\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary. I have listened to the  points\r\n\r\nbrought forth by the hon, mover of the motion  and\r\n\r\nit  would  appear from his speech that  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  two  main  points to be  settled,  and  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the fact that these two  main  points\r\n\r\nhave  not been settled, he felt it incumbent  upon\r\n\r\nhim to move the motion standing in his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what is the first point? He said that nine\r\n\r\npersons  had not yet been reemployed. He  said  in\r\n\r\nthis  House that these nine persons had  presented\r\n\r\nthemselves to the Harbour Board and had  not  been\r\n\r\ntaken  back.  I understand from the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nthat   these  nine  persons  have  not   presented\r\n\r\nthemselves  and that they were not able  to  trace\r\n\r\nthem   although  registered  letters   have   been\r\n\r\naddressed to them. Representatives of the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  Staff Association came to see  me  about  a\r\n\r\nweek ago on this point, too. I pointed out to them\r\n\r\nthat  the Harbour Board could not reemploy  people\r\n\r\nwho could not be found, and if they were really in\r\n\r\nevidence,  they  should present  themselves.  They\r\n\r\nsuggested to me about a week ago that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  bring  the  nine men to  my  office  on  my\r\n\r\nundertaking  to take these nine men  back  to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board.  It is not a harassing  tactic  at\r\n\r\nall.  In  fact  I welcome it. I suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who saw me that if they felt it infra dig, for them to bring the nine men to see the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Harbour Board, they could  bring\r\n\r\nthem  to  me and I would bring them to the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard and see that they get re-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that much for the first point, that nine\r\n\r\nmen  will  be  re-employed if  they  will  present\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and  if the hon. Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar will bring them to my office, it will indeed\r\n\r\nbe my duty and my pleasure to see that they are re-employed by the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to the second point which is of\r\n\r\ngreater  importance - the  taking  of  a  ballot  to\r\n\r\nascertain  whether or not a union  represents  the\r\n\r\nmajority of employees in a particular organisation \r\n\r\n- the  hon. Member quoted the Ford Company and said\r\n\r\nthat  there balloting had been accepted.  The  two\r\n\r\ncases  are not the same. In the case of  the  Ford\r\n\r\nCompany,  what  was required was  to  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nemployer that the majority of the workers belonged\r\n\r\nto  the union or desired to be represented by  the\r\n\r\nunion. In the case of the Harbour Board, there are\r\n\r\nseven  different  unions,  although  it  must   be\r\n\r\nadmitted  that the Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation was the first union to be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first union to be registered but its\r\n\r\nmembership  was only thrown open to  clerical  and\r\n\r\ncognate   workers,  never,  never  to  daily-rated\r\n\r\nemployees until the present General Secretary came\r\n\r\non the scene. How did he bring it about? He did so\r\n\r\nby  a  change in the constitution of the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board Staff Association to embrace  daily-rated  employees. He started with the registration\r\n\r\nof  a new union called the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nWorkers   Union  for  daily-rated  employees.   He\r\n\r\noperated   from  the  premises  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board Staff Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do  not like to go into the manipulations  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  taking place in the Singapore  Harbour Board Workers\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion   and  into  what  has  happened   to   that\r\n\r\nparticular  union, but what is more  important  to\r\n\r\nthe  issue  is that under our present Trade  Union\r\n\r\nOrdinance only seven persons are required to  sign\r\n\r\nan application form, to organise a trade union. To\r\n\r\nagree  that a ballot should be taken of  employees\r\n\r\nin   any   organisation  when  there  are  already\r\n\r\nregistered   trade  unions  representing   certain\r\n\r\nsections of employees in that organisation  is  to\r\n\r\nallow a particular union to work in such a way  as\r\n\r\nto  (I would not like to say intimidate because it\r\n\r\nis   so  difficult  to  prove)  capture  all   the\r\n\r\nemployees  in the organisation. This is definitely\r\n\r\nwrong  and  I, as Minister for Labour and  Welfare\r\n\r\nand  as  a  man  connected with  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  for  so  many years, have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion, quite reluctantly, that the taking  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  ballot in the Singapore Harbour Board  is\r\n\r\nnot in the best interests of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we blame the Singapore Harbour Board on this\r\n\r\npoint,  blame  them for something  for  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister - I  myself - have taken  the  full  responsibility? The only thing that can be levelled at the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board today is the re-employment  of  the\r\n\r\nnine  persons, but the Harbour Board has said time\r\n\r\nand  time  again that these nine men will  be  re-employed  if they can be found, if they will  just\r\n\r\npresent themselves. Let us not cloud the issue  by\r\n\r\nsaying that the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  has\r\n\r\na   list   of  the  nine  names.  When   the   two\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association came to see me they  said  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  produce the nine men and I  am  still\r\n\r\nwaiting  for them to do so. Produce the  nine  men\r\n\r\nand  the first point to the motion would have been\r\n\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I do not like to criticise the activities\r\n\r\nof  any trade union leader. I do not like it.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  it  becomes abundantly clear to me that  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  any  trade  union  leader  is  not\r\n\r\ndirected  in  the interests of a trade  union  but\r\n\r\ndirected in his personal interests, I must  resist\r\n\r\nany attempt at intimidation to force me to toe the\r\n\r\nline.  The  General  Secretary  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board Staff Association saw me  and  said\r\n\r\nthat if I would just call a meeting of the Singapore  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board and the Staff Association  he\r\n\r\nwould  withdraw the strike notice. In other words,\r\n\r\nhe put the onus on me that if I do not call a meet\r\n\r\ning,  the strike would take place and I should  be held responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the way to conduct a trade union. If\r\n\r\nit is genuinely felt that a trade dispute requires\r\n\r\nstrike action, go ahead, but do not do it in  such\r\n\r\na  way  as  to hoodwink the workers. He  has  been\r\n\r\nrunning back and forth. Every time he goes back to\r\n\r\nthe  Staff Association, he says, `Ha! ha!  I  have\r\n\r\ngot  this  okay.  Boleh, la, boleh  menang;  tungu\r\n\r\nsekijap,  boleh  menang.' It is not  necessary  to\r\n\r\nbluff the workers like that. It is not necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it is most significant that the strike\r\n\r\nnotice  expires this morning and I would ask  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to  take note of that. Not  content  with\r\n\r\ntrying  to intimidate the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare, there is this attempt to intimidate  this\r\n\r\nHouse  into accepting a motion which is definitely\r\n\r\nmost unfair and unfounded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I moved an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  motion at  the  April  sitting\r\n\r\nurging  the Singapore Harbour Board to  carry  out\r\n\r\nthe recommendations of the Court of Inquiry. I was\r\n\r\nmost  elated  by the result of the  resolution.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  workers must work in order  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir pay. Workers must stand together, unite,  in\r\n\r\norder  that they may better their lot. But I  also\r\n\r\nbelieve  that when they stand together to  bargain\r\n\r\nfor  what  would  be  more favourable  conditions,\r\n\r\nthere are also people who will come in to make use\r\n\r\nof  them  in order to further their own  political\r\n\r\naims.  I  am against this sort of manoeuvring.  We\r\n\r\nare for the workers. We want them to have a higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living. We want them to  be  treated\r\n\r\nfairly  but  we do not want them to  be  tools  of\r\n\r\npeople who promote their own interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the case of the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  presented to us many times. We  have  heard\r\n\r\nthat  on  the  orders of the Secretary,  the  paid\r\n\r\nSecretary,   Harbour   Board   workers   went   on\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrike.  They received no pay but I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether the paid Secretary received his pay.\r\n\r\nThey had on his orders went on a hunger strike.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to know whether the man  who  ordered\r\n\r\nthem  on hunger strike also refrained from  taking\r\n\r\nfood, or that he must grow stronger at the expense\r\n\r\nof the followers who were sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have before us a complaint that there\r\n\r\nare  workers  who  have not been given  jobs  even\r\n\r\nafter  the  Court of Inquiry had recommended  that\r\n\r\nthey should be re-employed. There are two sides of\r\n\r\nthe  question. One side says they are there.  They\r\n\r\nhave  presented themselves but there are no  jobs.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  we  have  heard  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  say that he would take them to  the  Harbour  Board if they would come to see him and they\r\n\r\nwould  have their jobs back. If this is the  case,\r\n\r\nthen   there  is  no  complaint  whatsoever.   The\r\n\r\ncomplaint should be withdrawn. In fact I was  also\r\n\r\ninterviewed  one  day  by the officials  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the loss of jobs, but after inquiring  from\r\n\r\nsources I did find that the claims had not been as\r\n\r\ntrue as they should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under such circumstances, bringing of a\r\n\r\nmotion  and putting up a complaint like this  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  assurance from the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand  Welfare  that they will be given  back  their\r\n\r\njobs  is  wasting  the time of  this  Assembly.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  think  that this dispute  is  not  one\r\n\r\nbetween  the  labourers and the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard; it arose from the General Secretary wanting\r\n\r\na pass to get in and out of the Harbour Board; and\r\n\r\nwhen   he  could  not  get  the  pass,  it   means\r\n\r\neverything in this world to him - there is a loss of\r\n\r\nprestige  and the workers must suffer  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  when he has restored himself in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nhis   workers  as  the  all-powerful  man  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I heard, and from a very unbiased\r\n\r\nstand,  is that the Singapore Harbour Board should\r\n\r\nrecognise  this union or that union; or one  union\r\n\r\nmust  be allowed to represent the workers  to  the\r\n\r\nexclusion  of the other unions. Well,  if  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to do that, then let\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  have a change in the trade union laws and  say\r\n\r\nthat  if  there are two unions existing,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust cancel one. But so long as the law agrees  to\r\n\r\nallow people to form trade unions, then every  one\r\n\r\nof  the  trade unions should have standing in  the\r\n\r\neyes of the law and the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not going to talk about\r\n\r\nrecognition  of these unions at length.  The  most\r\n\r\nimportant matter is not the recognition of unions,\r\n\r\nbut  that every worker should have a job! If there\r\n\r\nare  not  enough jobs to go round, then no  matter\r\n\r\nwhether you have one union or many unions, it will\r\n\r\nbring  us  no nearer to what we want. It will  not\r\n\r\nhelp the workers a little bit! We must have unions\r\n\r\nthat  really fight for the workers. But, if unions\r\n\r\nare there to see that the workers are not going to\r\n\r\nget  what  they  want, but what the leaders  want,\r\n\r\nthen I am sure Singapore will be happier if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have such people who call themselves  leaders\r\n\r\nof unions. These are the bogus leaders!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

I am reading now from page 7 of Sessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\">\"THE ISSUE OF RECOGNITION</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) It is because of the disorder in ad\r\n\r\nministration  that  it was  difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\narrive at a clear-cut finding on the issue related\r\n\r\nto the second term of reference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was quite clear that the seven unions.\r\n\r\nnamely, the Singapore Harbour Board Labour  Union,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Wharf and Ship Labour  Union,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Harbour  Board  Stevedore  and   Wharf\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union, the Confederation of the Singapore Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering Tradesmen, the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nEngineering  Workmen's Union, the  Malay  Seamen's\r\n\r\nUnion of Singapore and the Harbour Board Employees\r\n\r\nUnion of Singapore, were not representative of all\r\n\r\ndaily-rated employees of the SHB, nor in  fact  do\r\n\r\nthey  represent  a  majority or  even  a  sizeable\r\n\r\nproportion of such group of workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I repeat the last words of that sentence - \"not\r\n\r\nrepresentative of all daily-rated employees of the\r\n\r\nSHB, nor in fact do they represent a majority,  or\r\n\r\neven  a  sizeable  proportion, of  such  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers.\"  I  had read earlier to this  House  the\r\n\r\nfinding  of  the  book membership of  the  various\r\n\r\nunions  involved and what I hope to hear from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and his supporter (the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon) is why is that finding wrong,  and\r\n\r\nwhy  should  that finding be rejected,  and  as  a\r\n\r\ncorollary   to  that  finding  why   should   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation  be  rejected.  The  recommendation\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... We would suggest that such evidence be\r\n\r\ncollected  in  the  form of  a  secret  ballot  by\r\n\r\nmembers whose names appear on the membership cards\r\n\r\nof  the  SHBWU  [Singapore Harbour Board  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion]  and  the  SHBSA [Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association].  The  question  to  be  asked\r\n\r\nshould  be  whether or not each one of  these  men\r\n\r\nsupports  the  SHBSA. The ballot could  be  easily\r\n\r\narranged by the Ministry of Labour in co-operation\r\n\r\nwith  the  Registrar  of  Trade  Unions  and   the\r\n\r\nSupervisor of Elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   very  clearly  and  simply  sets  out   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations which the Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that the Singapore Harbour Board had  agreed\r\n\r\nbeforehand  to  accept, and which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong), in  a  debate  on\r\n\r\n24th  April,  1958, said that he  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board to accept and implement and that  if\r\n\r\nit  did  not do so by the next sitting,  he  would\r\n\r\nsupport  me  in  a stronger motion to  compel  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister has given\r\n\r\nreasons - I  do  not know whether it  is  1\ufffd  or  2\ufffd\r\n\r\nreasons - why  the ballot should not be implemented.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  he  said  the  Ford  Company  was\r\n\r\nslightly different because the ballot was taken as\r\n\r\nthere was no other union involved and therefore it\r\n\r\nwas  taken just to find out whether more than half the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers  were in the union. I should have  thought\r\n\r\nthat  if  there  were  more  unions  involved,   a\r\n\r\nfortiori  it  would be very necessary  to  have  a\r\n\r\nballot  to find out which of the unions have  more\r\n\r\nthan half the membership but it seems that this is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why it should not be allowed. But  the\r\n\r\nreal  reason - the first one is just a half  reason,\r\n\r\nthe  second one is the real reason and I give  him\r\n\r\none  point  for that - he has decided in  his  words\r\n\r\nthat  it is now (after dilly-dallying for  a  year\r\n\r\nand  more)  not  in  the  best  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  I  thought that was what  the  Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  was supposed to do - to find out  what  was\r\n\r\nthe  best thing to do in the interests of both the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the employers and this  is  what  it\r\n\r\nsuggested.  The  Hon. the Chief  Minister  for  no\r\n\r\nrhyme  or  reason now tells the House - but  for  no\r\n\r\nobvious  rhyme or reason although there  are  some\r\n\r\nnot  so very obvious ones, that I can have a  good\r\n\r\nguess  at - that it is not necessary to go  on  with\r\n\r\nthis,  and  that  it is not in the best  interest,\r\n\r\nbecause there are six other unions already  there,\r\n\r\nand  that he is not going to allow any trade union\r\n\r\nofficial   to  capture  the  membership   or   the\r\n\r\npotential  staff. In his own words, he  would  not\r\n\r\nallow  any  trade union official  to  capture  the\r\n\r\nworkers for his union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I thought that is the purpose of a\r\n\r\nunion. When a union is formed, the first thing  it\r\n\r\nwants  to  do  is  to  expand membership.  When  a\r\n\r\npolitical  party is formed, it is formed  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of collecting members. If, of course,  it\r\n\r\nfails in collecting members, then a new one has to\r\n\r\nbe  formed for the same original purpose.  He  now\r\n\r\nsays  that  that  is  a  reprehensible  object  to\r\n\r\nachieve, and particularly as it is likely that the\r\n\r\nobject  has  already been achieved,  he  will  not\r\n\r\nallow a ballot to be taken. Let us face the facts.\r\n\r\nIf on taking a ballot the Staff Association is not\r\n\r\nexpected  to  get half the ballot  and  these  six\r\n\r\npiddling  unions were expected to get the  members\r\n\r\nto  support  them, then I suggest to the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  his stand would definitely be that it is  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers to have a ballot and\r\n\r\nhe  would  have arranged for it long  ago.  It  is\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause he expects a ballot to expose the emptiness\r\n\r\nof  the  six  unions, with whom  I  am  told  some\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  types  are  associated,  that   the\r\n\r\nballot  will not be taken.

But he did tell us in a debate  on  24th\r\n\r\nApril that he would not want to take sides and that\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  to  see  what was  just  and  fair.

This must be avoided. One way of  avoiding\r\n\r\nsuch  a case would be to appoint a court of inquiry to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind out things. And I would say that in many cases\r\n\r\nthe  best way to settle a dispute would be  not  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the employer and the employee,  both\r\n\r\nthinking  that they are right, but to leave  it  to\r\n\r\nindependent   people,  independent  and   impartial\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  no axes to grind.  And  I  think\r\n\r\nCourts of inquiry should be established:\r\n\r\narbitration  courts  should be established.  And  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  one  day  we  must  have  compulsory\r\n\r\narbitration  with a panel of people  agreed  to  by\r\n\r\nemployers and employees alike, and they will sit to\r\n\r\narbitrate.  And  I  would say that  whatever  their\r\n\r\ndecision  should  be, both sides  should  agree  to their decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case where the matter has been brought\r\n\r\nup  to a court. The court has set out its findings,\r\n\r\nthe court has made its recommendations. It consists\r\n\r\nof  people trusted by all sides and I think that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  wrong for any party not  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of such a Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... We would like to urge the Harbour Board to\r\n\r\naccept  those recommendations.\"- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the middle of the last paragraph of his speech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It will create a good precedent for other\r\n\r\nemployers and employees to follow if we have courts\r\n\r\nof  arbitration  or enquiry appointed  at  a  later date.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  so he moves his amendment. We forgive many  of\r\n\r\nhis  failings because he is so obviously a sincere,\r\n\r\nif  often a misled man. We know that he is  genuine\r\n\r\nabout youth clubs, he does worry about them. He may\r\n\r\nnot  know  much  about other  things  in  life  but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  he tries very hard to  do  the  right\r\n\r\nthings. As he was, at one time, so very anxious  to\r\n\r\nimpress  upon me - \"Never mind who is right. What  is\r\n\r\nright,\"  says  he, and I am quoting it  back  as  a\r\n\r\nmoral  re-armament principle which he  has  quoted.\r\n\r\nNever  mind whether the Chief Minister is right  or\r\n\r\nthe  General  Secretary  of the  Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  is right! What is right is already  what  he\r\n\r\nstated  the last time, that the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court  should be accepted and implemented.  If\r\n\r\nthis  is the price he has to pay to join the United\r\n\r\nSocialists Front - he has his basic relief  in  moral\r\n\r\nre-armament - then I say that he is really  embarking\r\n\r\non  a most hazardous adventure that he may yet live to regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 2; Noes, 24; Abstention, Nil.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     Ayes.

Until now, under the\r\n\r\nBishop of Singapore Ordinance of 1911, the\r\n\r\nAnglican Bishop of Singapore has been the body\r\n\r\ncorporate vested with the power to manage the\r\n\r\nbuildings belonging to the Diocese. This is not\r\n\r\nreally the function of the Bishop but the function\r\n\r\nof the Synod of the Diocese which, as I have\r\n\r\nalready stated, is a local body properly\r\n\r\nresponsible for conveyancing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollection of rents, payments  of  quit\r\n\r\nrents  on properties and the general carrying  out\r\n\r\nof these duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of this Bill, it is expressly stated\r\n\r\nthat the Bishop of Singapore shall be divested  of\r\n\r\nthe lands hereditaments and premises specified  in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule and all rights estates and interests\r\n\r\ntherein   and  these  shall  be  vested   in   the\r\n\r\nCorporation, that is to say, the Secretary of  the\r\n\r\nSynod of the Diocese of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a straightforward Bill and I think there is no need to add anything more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of\r\n\r\nMr Speaker as Chairman and such Members as may be\r\n\r\nnominated by the Committee of Selection.

Of  these,  543  units  were  allocated  to\r\n\r\napplicants  from the housing register,  while  the\r\n\r\nbalance of 671 units were allocations to rehousing\r\n\r\neases  (including  fire  victims),  families  from\r\n\r\nclearance areas, transferees, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the request for names and points\r\n\r\nawarded,  I  would refer the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nto  my written answer to his previous question  on\r\n\r\nthe  same subject on the 17th July, 1957; also  to\r\n\r\nmy   oral   answer  to  his  question  on   public\r\n\r\ninspection  of the applications register.  I  have\r\n\r\nnothing to add to these answers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  answer refers to a similar question  of\r\n\r\nmine  dated 17th July, 1957 and this is the answer\r\n\r\nI got from the Minister at that time:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am informed by the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  that  the  Trust has let  no  new  premises\r\n\r\nduring the period January/June, 1957, and that any\r\n\r\nlettings  during  this period have  been  to  fill\r\n\r\ncasual  vacancies or in connection with  transfers\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trust considers it highly undesirable to\r\n\r\ndivulge  information as to the names of applicants\r\n\r\nwho    have    been   successful   in    obtaining\r\n\r\naccommodation in vacated premises or the names  of\r\n\r\ntenants   who  have  been  transferred  to   other\r\n\r\npremises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the reply now means that it is the  same  as\r\n\r\nwhat  I  got  last year - \"highly undesirable\".  Why\r\n\r\nshould it be \"highly undesirable\"? Why should  the\r\n\r\npublic not know about the allocation of houses  by\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. and the points awarded to applicants?\r\n\r\nThe question is this, Sir:\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. works in secret. If the Minister is  to\r\n\r\nsay  that it is highly undesirable for applicants'\r\n\r\nnames  to  be divulged to the public, I may  agree\r\n\r\nbut after allocation when everybody knows that Mr\r\n\r\nSo  and so has got a house, then why should it  be\r\n\r\nundesirable to divulge the name of that successful\r\n\r\napplicant? I cannot see why? Why should it be made\r\n\r\na  secret? In market or in some other allocations,\r\n\r\nI   am  quite  sure  that  immediately  after   an\r\n\r\nallocation  is  made, the names of the  successful\r\n\r\napplicants are made public but in this case  where\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. is `concerned, everything is kept very\r\n\r\nsecret. Personally I am of the opinion that  there\r\n\r\nmust be some fishy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness about this question of allocation.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam) at\r\n\r\none time accused the S.I.T. of corruption. I think\r\n\r\nin  this instance there is some sort of corruption\r\n\r\nor preference is given to friends in the matter of\r\n\r\nallocation. If not, why then should this  question\r\n\r\nbe treated as top secret? The answer is that there\r\n\r\nmust  be some sort of underhand work being carried\r\n\r\non by some officers of the S.I.T.: I would not say\r\n\r\nthat everyone of them is involved in this but some\r\n\r\nofficers - be they junior or senior officers.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see any harm in making known the names of the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  applicants and the  number  of  points\r\n\r\nthat  they are awarded. There is quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  amongst the  applicants  on  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the points system of allocation  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  fact  that some of them  with  stronger\r\n\r\ncases  have  not been given accommodation  whereas\r\n\r\nothers  with  weaker cases or cases of  a  similar\r\n\r\nnature   have  been  successful.  These  are   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints. But according to the Annual Report  of\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T., there is no complaint by  the  public\r\n\r\nabout the points system. I refer to page 19 of the\r\n\r\nAnnual Report for 1957 of the S.I.T.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The volume of correspondence in connection with\r\n\r\nhousing  applications  has  reached  a  total   of\r\n\r\napproximately  100 letters per day. When  analysed\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  these letters complain  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage of premises available for allocation, not\r\n\r\nthe  points  system  by  which  the  premises  are\r\n\r\nallocated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir, if the question of allocation  is  made\r\n\r\npublic, I am sure that the S.I.T. will not receive\r\n\r\n100  letters  per  day. The second  part  of  that\r\n\r\nstatement says that there are no complaints  about\r\n\r\nthe  points system. It is just utter nonsense. How\r\n\r\ncan  the  public complain about the points  system\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  not told about the actual  points\r\n\r\nawarded? How can they know about the points system\r\n\r\nand  how  can they complain about it when they  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  about  it?  It is  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nshortage  of  premises  as  the  S.I.T. has  been\r\n\r\nbuilding  thousands of houses but it is a question\r\n\r\nof houses not being allotted. The S.I.T. awards  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of points to an applicant. As soon  as  he\r\n\r\napplies for a house, he is given a receipt and  on that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceipt  is quoted  the supposed   number    of  points  awarded to  him but   is   that  figure  \r\n\r\nwhich is awarded on the  receipt itself correct? The    correct   points awarded  to  applicants \r\n\r\nare kept secret and not known to the applicants or   to  anybody.  That figure  on the  receipt \r\n\r\nis just a vague figure.  I will  read what  the Annual   Report    says about    this    points \r\n\r\nsystem. I refer to page 20 of the Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The applicant is informed of the points awarded at the time of registration and of the\r\n\r\ngeneral  factors  which are  taken into account in  the  assessment  of points.  The  fixed  or \r\n\r\n\"confirmed       value\" points   are   assessed after the investigation of the case and are not  disclosed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,     after      the  investigation   of    a case, the confirmed  or \r\n\r\nfixed  points  are  not disclosed    to     the  applicant.  Now,  in  a statement,  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nsays  that there is  no  complaint   about   the points  system. If  the actual or confirmed  or \r\n\r\nfixed points awarded to an applicant are not disclosed to him, how can he know how many points he has been awarded?  The figure on the receipt serves no useful\r\n\r\npurpose in any way either to the applicant or to anybody.  Why then have the figure on the \r\n\r\nreceipt?  In the old days, there was no figure of points awarded shown on the receipts.  Lately, the S.I.T. has adopted a new policy by stating the number of points awarded on the receipts but that that figure is not the \"confirmed\" or fixed value points. Everything is kept  top secret in the files  of the   S.I.T. and  only known to members of the\r\n\r\nEstate Committee of the S.I.T.  Even a  trustee of  the S.I.T. does not know   the  number   of\r\n\r\npoints   awarded.   Why should it be worked  on such lines, that it  is only the members of the\r\n\r\nEstate Committee of the S.I.T. who are told  of the  actual  number  of points    awarded    to applicants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the allocation of houses by the S.I.T. is strictly based on the points system, then\r\n\r\nlet the public know the points awarded and they should  not be kept  in suspense  as  to   when\r\n\r\nthey can expect to  get houses.  If the correct points  are made  known to  the  applicant,  he\r\n\r\nknows  his chances  and he will not go round  bothering   Assemblymen and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity   Councillors.   I have  experienced  many cases  of  people   who come  to me to ask  me,\r\n\r\n\"When   can  I  get   a house?\"  A receipt  may show  eight points  but when  I  write  to  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. they  tell   me that  the eight  points\r\n\r\nare  not the actual  or confirmed        points awarded     to      the\r\n\r\napplicant:   \"We   have within  our  files  the confirmed   or    fixed\r\n\r\npoints.   That   figure means  nothing at all.\" So why show that figure\r\n\r\non   the  receipt?   By keeping   this   points system  a  secret,  you\r\n\r\ncannot blame the public for    harbouring     a suspicion            of\r\n\r\ncorruption? How can you blame  them? There  are many  cases in which  I\r\n\r\nhave  experienced  that an  applicant  with a lower  point  is  given\r\n\r\npriority    over     an  applicant with a higher  \r\n\r\npoint.  There are  many  cases of such a nature,  but the point that I am  \r\n\r\nreferring  to  is   the face   value   of   the receipt  and  not   the confirmed  points.   So\r\n\r\nthat             causes dissatisfaction   among the   applicants.   One applicant will say that\r\n\r\nanother  applicant  has lesser  points than  he has; then why should he be             allotted\r\n\r\naccommodation        in preference    to    his application? This  kind of thing will certainly cause   suspicion   and lead  people  to  think that  there  is  monkey business in the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw the attention of the Minister to how applications for\r\n\r\naccommodation are dealt with by    the   S.I.T.   An applicant approached me about  one and  a  half years ago. He had about 7  to 8 points on  the face   value   of   his receipt. \r\n\r\nI wrote to the S.I.T. about his  case.  The  reply which I  got from them was that  the\r\n\r\napplicant   must   wait until the completion of the  Kallang fiats.  He waited until early this\r\n\r\nyear.  Subsequently   I wrote   again  to   the S.I.T. telling   them that  the Kallang flats\r\n\r\nwere            nearing completion. They  wrote back  saying that there was  no allocation yet.\r\n\r\nThe applicant then came and  told me that there was  a  house in Dorset Road  which was  vacant\r\n\r\nand  he  asked  me   to write   again  to   the S.I.T. and draw  their attention    to    this\r\n\r\nvacant  house.   So   I wrote   to   them   and mentioned   that    the applicant would  prefer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse  to him, in view of the fact that he  had  8\r\n\r\npoints?   The  S.I.T. replied  saying  that   his\r\n\r\napplication  could  not be considered  for  Dorset\r\n\r\nRoad  or Owen Road and that it could only  be  con\r\n\r\nsidered  for the Kallang flats. When the applicant\r\n\r\ncame to see me again, I told him that I could  not\r\n\r\nhelp  him  any  further. So he approached  another\r\n\r\nsource which I think the Minister knows very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> As I was saying, he\r\n\r\napproached another source and, as a result, to the\r\n\r\nsurprise  of  the Minister, he is now  staying  in\r\n\r\nthat very same house in Dorset Road about which  I\r\n\r\nwrote  to  the  S.I.T.! And  yet  they  said  this\r\n\r\nperson's application could only be considered  for\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang  fiats! But when he  approached  that\r\n\r\nother source, he got his house in Dorset Road! How\r\n\r\ndid he manage it? I hope the Minister will tell me\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government claims that it is a\r\n\r\ndemocratic Government and that it is going to have\r\n\r\na  Housing Authority very soon. How soon we do not\r\n\r\nknow. We have been told by the Minister again  and\r\n\r\nagain  that  very  soon a Housing  Authority  will\r\n\r\nreplace  the S.I.T. I was told that it would  come\r\n\r\nin  May. This is now July - two months- a nd there  is\r\n\r\nstill  no  sign of the tabling of a  Bill  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that a Housing Authority will replace  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. I hope that the Minister in his reply  will\r\n\r\nalso  inform  us when this Housing Authority  will\r\n\r\ncome  into  being to replace this  top-secret  and\r\n\r\niron curtain S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the S.I.T. work strictly to the points\r\n\r\nsystem, I am quite sure that they will be relieved\r\n\r\nof all complaints, irrespective of the shortage of\r\n\r\naccommodation.  Members of the Assembly  and  City\r\n\r\nCouncillors  will similarly be relieved  of  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints, which come into their hands every day,\r\n\r\nabout  allocation of Trust accommodation. In fact,\r\n\r\nI  would have tabled a motion deploring the policy\r\n\r\nof  the  S.I.T. on this issue, but because of  the\r\n\r\nassurance  given by the Minister that the  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority will come into being soon to replace the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nS.I.T., I have only tabled a motion for the\r\n\r\nAdjournment.  I  do  hope that when  this  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority  is created there will not be  any  such\r\n\r\npolicy   as   that   no  one   should   know   how\r\n\r\naccommodation  is  allocated and  how  points  are\r\n\r\nawarded. All these things should be made public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the complaints from the\r\n\r\nresidents  of  Trust  houses on  Jalan  Teck  Whye\r\n\r\nEstate.  I refer to the reply given to me  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  this morning on this point.  I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad that of the four complaints enumerated he  is\r\n\r\ngoing to look into complaints Nos. 2, 3 and 4, but\r\n\r\nnot  No. 1 which concerns excessive heat.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister   can  look  into  three  out   of   four\r\n\r\ncomplaints, why cannot he look into all four?  You\r\n\r\nhave said you can only look into three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Speaker has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir; I was\r\n\r\nreferring to the Minister and not to you. From the\r\n\r\nreply  given by the Minister, Sir, it  is  evident\r\n\r\nthat  he agrees that the houses on Jalan Teck Whye\r\n\r\nEstate  are  really  hot  and  that  the  heat  is\r\n\r\nintolerable, because if he did not agree, he would\r\n\r\nnot  have  said that, by putting asbestos ceilings\r\n\r\non  these houses, the temperature would be lowered\r\n\r\nby  only  two degrees. So he has committed himself\r\n\r\nby  agreeing  that  they are hot.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nblame  should fall on the S.I.T., or the  planners\r\n\r\nin  the  S.I.T.  That the houses are  hot  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the cost or the rents of the  houses,\r\n\r\nbut it is because of the planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These complaints from S.I.T. residents about\r\n\r\nexcessive heat are not the first of their kind.  I\r\n\r\nwas a resident of one post-war house myself and  I\r\n\r\ntoo  complained  of  excessive  heat.  Within   my\r\n\r\nconstituency, that is Queenstown, the residents of\r\n\r\nRedhill Estate also complain of excessive heat  in\r\n\r\ntheir  houses.  Now,  after  receiving  all  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints of excessive heat, cannot the S.I.T. im\r\n\r\nprove  on  the conditions of living? It is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of the extra cost of raising  the  roof.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister said this morning that  raising  the\r\n\r\nroof  would  cost  much more than  putting  on  an\r\n\r\nasbestos  ceiling. If at the time of  construction\r\n\r\nof   the   houses  the  S.I.T. had   taken   into\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration  complaints of excessive  heat  from\r\n\r\nother quarters, they could easily have improved on\r\n\r\nthe construction of the houses and raised the roof\r\n\r\nfor  purposes of better ventilation and  reduction\r\n\r\nof  heat.  Why did not the S.I.T. do this  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  construction? The  result  is  that,  by\r\n\r\nproviding  cheap  houses, the S.I.T. are  forcing\r\n\r\ntheir tenants to suffer from the heat. I think  it\r\n\r\nis  the  policy of the S.I.T. that if you want  to\r\n\r\nlive  in comfort, thea you must go and five  in  a\r\n\r\nbig  bungalow;  but if you want  them  to  provide\r\n\r\ncheap  houses, then you must live under conditions\r\n\r\nwhich they provide, that is, with a ceiling as low\r\n\r\nas eight feet. I went into one of these houses the\r\n\r\nother  day,  and at the back of the building,  the\r\n\r\nheight  of the roof is only about 7 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nI  ask  the Minister if he can bear to live  in  a\r\n\r\nhouse with a roof only 7 feet 6 inches high,  with\r\n\r\na  ceiling made of zinc or asbestos. The  Minister\r\n\r\nis pointing to himself. I am sure he will come out\r\n\r\nwith a statement that although he is a Minister he\r\n\r\nis  staying in a little out-house from a bungalow.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, if a man can have a little out-house  with a bungalow, I am quite sure that  that\r\n\r\nout-house  will  be  just as  comfortable  as  the\r\n\r\nbungalow itself. It is not the same type of  house\r\n\r\nas  that built by the S.I.T., and if the owner  of\r\n\r\nthat  bungalow cannot build a decent out-house,  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  he  would  ever build that  out-house.  The\r\n\r\nMinister will say that he is residing in a  little\r\n\r\nout-house, so he has experience of the discomforts\r\n\r\nof  living in a little out-house. I challenge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and any officers of the S.I.T. to  come\r\n\r\nand stay in one of the houses built by the S.I.T.,\r\n\r\nnot  for  a day, but just from 10 a.m. to 4  p.m.;\r\n\r\nand if they can bear the heat, then I say that the\r\n\r\nresidents  should be prepared to do  so  also.  If\r\n\r\nthey  feel  that  they cannot, then  it  is  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  look  into  this  question  of\r\n\r\nexcessive heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these complaints came to the notice of the\r\n\r\nActing Minister and the Assistant Minister on 17th\r\n\r\nMay  this  year.  They both took  the  trouble  to\r\n\r\narrange for a meeting with the residents of  these\r\n\r\nhouses  and toured the area with officers  of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. They left their office work - for which  they\r\n\r\nare  paid - and went to that estate to  see  how the residents \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuffered. Until today no information has been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  residents. What action  have  they\r\n\r\ntaken? It is only when I tabled a question that  I\r\n\r\ngot a reply and knew what the Minister intends  to\r\n\r\ndo. It is because of that big protest meeting that\r\n\r\nhas  prompted the Minister to take action. Had  it\r\n\r\nnot been for that big protest meeting, and had  it\r\n\r\nnot  been  for  my question, I doubt  whether  the\r\n\r\nresidents  would  have been told what  action  the\r\n\r\nMinister intends to take or has taken. Sir, is  it\r\n\r\nright  to  keep them in suspense? At  the  protest\r\n\r\nmeeting  the residents went so far as  to  move  a\r\n\r\nmotion  to boycott the District Council elections.\r\n\r\nIt  was only through my persuasion that the motion\r\n\r\nto  boycott the elections was dropped. So  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  the  Minister or  anybody  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side receives any complaints, he should\r\n\r\ntell  the complainants of what action he has taken\r\n\r\nor intends to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> When I read the matter which\r\n\r\nwas  to be raised as a motion for the Adjournment,\r\n\r\nI  thought the Member for Queenstown was going  to\r\n\r\ntalk   on  the  Government's  housing  policy   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sir, in his long diatribe  I  could\r\n\r\nnot  find  anywhere  in his speech  where  he  has\r\n\r\nrelated  in any way at all the question of  Govern\r\n\r\nment's housing policy to the S.I.T. He spent  much\r\n\r\nof  his time in criticising the S.I.T. in relation\r\n\r\nto the administration of the Trust itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make the position clear to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Oueenstown.  The  Trust,  Sir,  is  a\r\n\r\nstatutory body and its authority and functions and\r\n\r\nthe  extent to which it is subject to the  control\r\n\r\nof  Government  are prescribed  in  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\ncreating that body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> That is no reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> This is one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy   Government  intends  to  create  a   Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority  vested with full powers  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nGovernment's housing policy, and since the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Oueenstown   has   asked   me   about   this\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing Authority, I can say definitely now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  Bills  on  the  Housing  Authority  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department of the S.I.T. will  be  ready\r\n\r\nfor  First Reading at the next sitting of this  As\r\n\r\nsembly. However, it must be emphasised that  while\r\n\r\nI  have  certain responsibilities and powers,  the\r\n\r\nday-to-day   administration  of  the  Trust,   and\r\n\r\neventually the Housing Authority, must remain  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the members of the  Board.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of creating statutory bodies is to provide\r\n\r\nspecial  services and to entrust  or  delegate  to\r\n\r\nthem certain functions and duties within the broad\r\n\r\nlines of policy laid down by Government which they\r\n\r\nare  expected  to  carry  out  in  a  manner  they\r\n\r\nconsider  best and which, with their attention  to\r\n\r\ndetail  and administrative routine, they can  more\r\n\r\nefficiently carry out. It is therefore,  Sir,  not\r\n\r\nconducive to good administration for Government or\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  himself  to  interfere  with   the\r\n\r\nexecution by the Board of their ordinary functions\r\n\r\nand their day-to-day administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Bukit Panjang Estate, I\r\n\r\nreplied  this morning to the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nthat  at least three of the complaints put forward\r\n\r\nby the residents of Bukit Panjang Estate are being\r\n\r\nattended  to.  I  can tell the hon.  Member  this,\r\n\r\nSir - it was not as a result of the protest meeting,\r\n\r\nbut  it was as a direct result of the visits  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Acting  Minister for  Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing  and the  Assistant  Minister,\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  Chairman  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust.  In other words,  the  protest\r\n\r\nmeeting which took place at Bukit Panjang about  a\r\n\r\nfortnight  ago had nothing at all to do  with  the\r\n\r\nrepairs  and  alterations  which  are  now   being\r\n\r\ncarried out by the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was of course the question of heat. Here\r\n\r\nagain,  Sir, I do not know whether the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  is aware about it, but  there  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today probably over 200 houses built  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. for labourers and also for  the  other\r\n\r\nranks of the police force, and there are some also\r\n\r\nat the Guillemard Road side of the Kallang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirport,  which  have  no  ceilings:  neither  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. nor the S.I.T. have received any complaints\r\n\r\nfrom the residents of these houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of allocation. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  refer  the Member for  Queenstown  to  a\r\n\r\nreport  of he Housing Management Sub-Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Housing Advisory Committee  published\r\n\r\nby   H.M.  Stationery  Office.  London,  page   8,\r\n\r\nparagraph 23. Now that reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We recommend that whatever method of selection\r\n\r\nis  used, local authorities should generally  make\r\n\r\nknown the principles on which tenants are selected\r\n\r\nand the general practice of which account is taken\r\n\r\non individual applications. The primary importance\r\n\r\nof  this, in present circumstances especially,  is\r\n\r\nself-evident.  The  precise weight  given  to  the\r\n\r\nparticuar   factors  should  not  necessarily   be\r\n\r\ndisclosed. Moreover, we doubt whether it  is  wise\r\n\r\nto   make   any   general  practice  o   informing\r\n\r\napplicants  exactly  what their  position  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting list is at the particular date, as  it  is\r\n\r\nto   be   expected   that  the  circumstances   of\r\n\r\napplicants,   and  therefore  their  position   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  one  another on the  list,  will  be\r\n\r\nconstantly changing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this is the present policy of the Trust  and\r\n\r\nit  is  based  broadly on these  conclusions.  The\r\n\r\napplicant is informed of the points awarded at the\r\n\r\ntime  of the registration and of the general  practice  which  takes into account the assessment  of\r\n\r\npoints. The fixed or confirmed value of points  is\r\n\r\nassessed  after investigation of the case  and  is\r\n\r\nnot  disclosed. The allocation list of  applicants\r\n\r\nand  their points are circulated for the  approval\r\n\r\nof  the Estates Committee and are confidential  to\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board. This provides some safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst injustice to other tenants not selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
