Members join me in extending you\r\n\r\nour congratulations and our co-operation on your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nre-election to the Chair. It is nearly  two  years\r\n\r\nsince  you  were first elected to the office.  Your\r\n\r\nexperience  as  Speaker  must  be  unique.  In  two\r\n\r\nsuccessive Parliaments you sat over a House without\r\n\r\nan  Opposition. First, the Opposition boycotted the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Next, they boycotted the general elections.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the extraordinary circumstances,  a\r\n\r\nlegislative   chamber  without  the   stimulus   of\r\n\r\nprovocative criticism, those of us who were in  the\r\n\r\nlast  Parliament  are  confident  that  under  your\r\n\r\nguidance,  this  House will keep the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nmachine  in  good  shape,  and  also  sustain   and\r\n\r\ncultivate the attitudes of tolerance and calculated\r\n\r\ndeference to opposing views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who are natural optimists, or not long\r\n\r\nacquainted  with the social science of  psephology,\r\n\r\nmay  believe that the return of all 58 Members from\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P, reflects the unanimity of views amongst\r\n\r\npeople outside. My colleagues and I, who have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough more harrowing times, cannot afford  to  be\r\n\r\nso naive, or so ingenuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, the pro-Communist groups, under the\r\n\r\nbanner  of the Barisan Sosialis collected  over  30\r\n\r\nper cent of the votes and 13 out of 51 seats. True,\r\n\r\ntheir  fortunes have declined. This is  partly  the\r\n\r\nresult  of our social and economic policies, partly\r\n\r\nthe   result  of  higher  political  sophistication\r\n\r\namongst  the  voters. But it is mainly  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir   own   irrational  rigid  orthodoxy,   their\r\n\r\nobsequious subservience to directives from outside.\r\n\r\nThey  have mechanically chanted ridiculous  slogans\r\n\r\nand  asserted  incredible untruths - that  Malaysia\r\n\r\ndoes  not  exist, that \"Malaya\" includes Singapore,\r\n\r\nand that the Republic is a sham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, had the Communists decided to contest the\r\n\r\nelections  through the Barisan Sosialis,  or  other\r\n\r\nfront  organisations, like the Communist-led  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  or  the  old  boys' associations  and  the\r\n\r\ncultural groups, I would not have been surprised if\r\n\r\nthey  had collected over 15 per cent of the  votes,\r\n\r\nwhich would have ensured them some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsix  to  eight seats in this House. If they persist\r\n\r\nin  orthodoxy, and their orders continue to  be  as\r\n\r\nunrelated to the realities of the situation in  and\r\n\r\naround Singapore as they have been in the last five\r\n\r\nyears,  and  more  important, if our  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  policies make the progress they  have  made\r\n\r\nover  the  last  five  years, then  by  1973  their\r\n\r\nelectoral support may further sink down perhaps  to\r\n\r\nbelow  10  per cent. But I doubt if I can  give  as\r\n\r\ncheerful  an estimate in the corresponding  decline\r\n\r\nof  their  cadre  strength. One of  the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nreasons why their electoral support has declined is\r\n\r\nthat   they   have  withdrawn  their  trained   and\r\n\r\nexperienced  cadres  from open  front  activity  to\r\n\r\nconserve their strength for future deployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the 58 Members in this House, 26 Members\r\n\r\nhave  never  known what it is to be in a Parliament\r\n\r\nwith   an  Opposition.  Indeed,  16,  having   been\r\n\r\nreturned unopposed, have never known the rough  and\r\n\r\ntumble  of a contested election. To them, I commend\r\n\r\nHansard,  the report of proceedings of  this  House\r\n\r\nsince  May 1955, particularly the years 1955, 1956,\r\n\r\n1959,  1961 to 1963. In 1955, the Governors stopped\r\n\r\npresiding over sessions of the Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nA mainly elected Legislative Assembly of 32 Members\r\n\r\nof  whom 25 were elected was allowed to meet  under\r\n\r\nan independent Speaker. Three Members were from the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  I  am  the  sole  survivor  of  that  first\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the clerks of Parliament and I have\r\n\r\npersonal   knowledge   of   the   boisterous    and\r\n\r\nrumbustious past of this House. There was no dearth\r\n\r\nor  differences  of  opinions, or  independence  of\r\n\r\nviews,  sometimes sincerely, and often  vehemently,\r\n\r\nheld.  Hansard  records the  clash  of  minds,  the\r\n\r\nexchange of retorts courteous and not so courteous,\r\n\r\nthe conflict of ideas and ideologies, and the face-to-face confrontation of the exponents of different\r\n\r\nideologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reveal all the bounce, the abrasiveness and\r\n\r\nthe  self-confidence that Singapore had  and  still\r\n\r\nhas.  They  made for lively meetings. Debates  were\r\n\r\noften bitter and vicious. The fact that we now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  such  a homogeneous group in 58 Members  does\r\n\r\nnot   mean   that  it  will  remain  so  hereafter.\r\n\r\nOpposition in this Chamber will and must inevitably\r\n\r\nreturn.  But the Opposition will not be individuals\r\n\r\nclaiming to act as the conscience of the people, or\r\n\r\noffering  themselves as the necessary accoutrements\r\n\r\nof parliamentary democracy on the spurious argument\r\n\r\nthat,  because  there  is no Opposition,  therefore\r\n\r\nthere  is no parliamentary democracy. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot that gullible and credulous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, when it returns, will comprise a\r\n\r\ngroup  offering an alternative policy, and offering\r\n\r\nthemselves as a credible alternative government  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  policies they expound.  This  could\r\n\r\ncome  about in one of two ways, one less  desirable\r\n\r\nthan the other. First, it could come as a result of\r\n\r\nsevere  economic setbacks, the failure to meet  and\r\n\r\novercome the problems coming upon us in the  l970s.\r\n\r\nThen  the  Opposition that emerges will be extreme,\r\n\r\neither  orthodox  Communist  or  revisionist,   or\r\n\r\nTrotskyite. Then divisions will be sharp and angry,\r\n\r\nand the country the worse for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the more desirable alternative, economic\r\n\r\nsuccess  and enhanced social stability, and further\r\n\r\nreduction  in  electoral support for  Communist  or\r\n\r\nextremist  policies. With stability and prosperity,\r\n\r\nthe sense of national urgency and unity which binds\r\n\r\ntogether  a  people faced with common danger,  will\r\n\r\nslacken and a more relaxed mood will set in. A  new\r\n\r\nrestlessness will bestir the people, a  desire  for\r\n\r\nimprovement and change, or just change for change's\r\n\r\nsake,  will  appeal  to a younger  generation.  The\r\n\r\nemergence of a party or parties either to the  left\r\n\r\nor  right of the P.A.P, must result. But they would\r\n\r\nbe constitutional alternatives, willing to work the\r\n\r\nsystem, prepared to compete and attain power within\r\n\r\nthe  system, and to surrender it by the same  rules\r\n\r\nthrough which they came into office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the crucial 1970s, it is as well that in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P, we hold together in national consensus a\r\n\r\nwide  cross-section  of  our  society,  from  semi-skilled and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskilled   workers  like  the  Members  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  and Geylang Serai, both former employees\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Telephone Board and leaders of its\r\n\r\nunion,  clerical groups represented by the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Kallang and Toa Payoh, teachers and principals\r\n\r\nlike  the  Members for Telok Blangah and  Moulmein,\r\n\r\nuniversity  lecturers  and  professors   like   the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  Katong, Joo Chiat and  Alexandra,  to\r\n\r\nprofessional men and business executives  like  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Bukit Panjang, River Valley and  Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu.  Our task, Mr Speaker, is to help you ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  parliamentary machine is well-maintained\r\n\r\nand  tuned to meet the new circumstances that  will\r\n\r\nevolve in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that hon. Members will debate\r\n\r\nmatters  before them frankly and freely. More  than\r\n\r\nhalf  of  hon. Members, however, have  never  taken\r\n\r\npart  in  a debate with an Opposition like that  we\r\n\r\nhad  from  1961 to 1963. Then attack was  not  only\r\n\r\nvenomous  and sharp, but ruthless and unprincipled,\r\n\r\nand criticism was intended not to point out defects\r\n\r\nand secure improvements but designed electorally to\r\n\r\nkill  and  destroy the other side by fair means  or\r\n\r\nfoul. Hon. Members will have to learn and practise,\r\n\r\nas  much outside as inside Parliament, the cut  and\r\n\r\nthrust  of  debate, the retort and  rejoinder,  the\r\n\r\nrebuttal  and  riposte. I am  told  that  simulated\r\n\r\nflying  in  a cockpit is nearly the same  thing  as\r\n\r\nactually  flying an aircraft, except for the  eerie\r\n\r\nfeeling  a  pilot gets when he finds himself  aloft\r\n\r\nand alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than four years from 1955 to 1959, I was\r\n\r\na Member of this Chamber occupying the seat, if not\r\n\r\nthe  title, of Leader of the Opposition.  At  every\r\n\r\ncrisis,  crowds thronged the Gallery to  watch  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  being castigated and  whipped  for  its\r\n\r\nmany  misdemeanours. I changed  places  and  became\r\n\r\nLeader of the Government from 1959 onwards. It  was\r\n\r\nour turn to be pulverised. From 1961 to 1963 crowds\r\n\r\nwere  drawn  like  a magnet to this  Chamber,  some\r\n\r\nwaiting outside to hear, if they could not see, the\r\n\r\npack of Barisan wolves come in for the kill of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. lamb.  I  do not believe that  these  large\r\n\r\nnumbers    of   pro-Communist   sympathisers    and\r\n\r\nsupporters have all vanished or been converted just\r\n\r\nbecause  they  left disappointed,  as  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nwolves were chastised in the encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst this will not be\r\n\r\na  Parliament  with the suspense and excitement  of\r\n\r\nits  earlier  years, nevertheless,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nmomentous times ahead for all of us, and this House\r\n\r\nwill  have  enough  drama if  not  anxiety  in  the\r\n\r\ncrucial years ahead. Hon. Members will speak  their\r\n\r\nminds freely and forcefully. Our future is at stake\r\n\r\nand  we  must give the lead in thinking and feeling\r\n\r\nin  the  country. If the new Members we now welcome\r\n\r\nto our fraternity learn and drill themselves, there\r\n\r\nis  no reason why, when actual blood is drawn in  a\r\n\r\nsubsequent Parliament, that it should not  be  from\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may you preside over us to a\r\n\r\nmore secure and triumphant Third Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It  is  not  only\r\n\r\nbecause  Britain will be withdrawing her forces  by\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1971. The whole security and political\r\n\r\nsituation  in South and Southeast Asia  is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  change. The balance of  forces,  which\r\n\r\nhave more or less held the position since 1954 when\r\n\r\nthe  French  relinquished power over the  whole  of\r\n\r\nVietnam, and the Americans stepped into the  breach\r\n\r\nin  the  south, is now poised for a possible  major\r\n\r\nshift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momentous changes in the political and security\r\n\r\npattern  of  the region have already  been  set  in\r\n\r\nmotion.  By  the end of the term of this Parliament\r\n\r\nin  1973,  it  is  probable that new  security  and\r\n\r\npolitical  patterns  would have  begun  to  emerge.\r\n\r\nPeace  and  security will have to be ensured  under\r\n\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These historic events will have a profound\r\n\r\ninfluence  on  our  future.  Perhaps  it  was   the\r\n\r\nawareness  of this that made Singapore vote  almost\r\n\r\nunanimously for the P.A.P. In the next five to  ten\r\n\r\nyears,  issues of life and death will be determined\r\n\r\nmore   by   factors  around,  rather  than  within,\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In English)</i>: My Government will seek to achieve\r\n\r\nthree objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, optimum use of the time available to build\r\n\r\nup   an  effective  defence  capability  which,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction   with   Malaysia   and    our    other\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   partners,  can   ensure   continuing\r\n\r\nsecurity.  This  must be done at minimum  cost,  so\r\n\r\nthat  most  of our resources will go into  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. It means that, although we have  small\r\n\r\nnumbers  on  active service, we  shall  have  large\r\n\r\nnumbers in the reserve service. These\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserves will be well and regularly trained,  ready\r\n\r\nfor   combat,  but  otherwise  they  will   be   in\r\n\r\nproductive employment, contributing to the economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and progress of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, greater economic growth, higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  with the elimination  of  restrictive\r\n\r\npractices,  abuses  of fringe  benefits,  and  more\r\n\r\nefficient management. With ever lower costs we must\r\n\r\nreach  out for more export markets. The continuance\r\n\r\nand  consolidation of stable political  and  social\r\n\r\nconditions,  sensible  relations  between   labour,\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  government,  these  are  the  pre-conditions   for  increased  investments   in   the\r\n\r\nindustrial   and   servicing  sectors   to   create\r\n\r\nmeaningful jobs for ever-increasing numbers of  our\r\n\r\nmore educated citizens seeking better jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, enhancement of national consciousness of\r\n\r\nthe problems that will come upon us in the next few\r\n\r\nyears.   We  must  all  learn  to  place   national\r\n\r\ninterests  above  personal or sectional  interests.\r\n\r\nInternally,    high   morale   -   internationally,\r\n\r\nconfidence   in   our  continuing   stability   and\r\n\r\nefficiency  -  this combination will enable  us  to\r\n\r\nachieve new records in high performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad outlines of policy for each Ministry in\r\n\r\nmy  Government are set out in an addendum* to  this \r\n\r\nAddress.

In Precinct N.l, 3 blocks  of\r\n\r\nmulti-storey flats and shops at Palembang Road have\r\n\r\nbeen completed and when occupied will transform the\r\n\r\nskyline of this once dilapidated area into a modern\r\n\r\nhigh  rise centre. In Precinct 5.1, on the site  of\r\n\r\nthe  old  Outram  Prison, 8 blocks of  multi-storey\r\n\r\nflats  and  shops and another 4 blocks  of  lock-up\r\n\r\nshops are nearing completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the complete success of urban renewal\r\n\r\nincludes  substantial participation by the  private\r\n\r\nsector in high quality buildings. To encourage  and\r\n\r\npromote  this, administrative changes and incentive\r\n\r\nmeasures   have  been  introduced.   For   example,\r\n\r\napproved  projects such as hotels, office buildings\r\n\r\nand  luxury  apartments in designated  areas,  will\r\n\r\nhave  property tax reduced to 12 per cent per annum\r\n\r\nfor 20 years. In addition, a legislation will be re-introduced to enable genuine developers to  recover\r\n\r\ntheir   rent-controlled  properties  in  designated\r\n\r\nareas  for redevelopment. Tenants of these affected\r\n\r\npremises  will be compensated fairly, and  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven   adequate   time  to  move  to   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation    which   includes    Housing    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of State lands by public tender of 14\r\n\r\nstrategic  sites  suitable  for  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nprojects   from   hotels,  entertainment   centres,\r\n\r\nfloating   restaurants  to  office  buildings   and\r\n\r\nshopping  centres on attractive terms has  resulted\r\n\r\nin  7  out  of the 14 sites offered being sold.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  negotiations have now  reached  a  stage\r\n\r\nwhere 3 more sites along the \"Golden Mile\" may soon\r\n\r\nbe  taken up for hotel development. Plans  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  made to release more State lands for private\r\n\r\ndevelopment to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet a wide range of high quality development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Physical Planning and Building Control</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State and City Planning Project assisted by\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations Development Programme  (Special\r\n\r\nFund)  has  been launched and will  operate  for  4\r\n\r\nyears to produce comprehensive long-range land  use\r\n\r\nand  transportation plans which will provide proper\r\n\r\nguidance,  and greater flexibility in  the  control\r\n\r\nand  use  of our scarce land resources.
