Those are  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  essentials  without which no  Parliament  can\r\n\r\never hope to flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will, as time goes on (if they\r\n\r\nhave not already done so), come to experience that\r\n\r\nsense  of  love,  reverence  and  pride  for  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   which  the  dignity  of   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nestablishments   and  the  orderly   practice   of\r\n\r\nParliamentary democracy will inevitably breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an Assembly which has grown in stature\r\n\r\nduring the past few years. There is much that  has\r\n\r\nyet to be done and accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, for example, the question of the\r\n\r\nindependence of the Assembly Staff which  has  not\r\n\r\nas  yet been achieved, but on which the Honourable\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister touched during the course  of\r\n\r\nthe  past  session and on which, I  am  sure,  he,\r\n\r\nother  Honourable Members and I myself would  wish\r\n\r\nto say a few words during the coming session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the pressing problem of the speedier\r\n\r\nproduction  of our Official Reports - our  Hansards.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  to  my mind, a matter of urgent necessity\r\n\r\nthat recognition be given to the importance of the\r\n\r\nquestion of speedy production of our Hansards, not\r\n\r\nonly in relation to the convenience of Members but\r\n\r\nalso  in relation to prestige. Other legislatures,\r\n\r\nlarge  and small, have been able to produce  their\r\n\r\nHansards   overnight.  The  problem  facing   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is  one of ways and means of  increasing\r\n\r\nthe   number  on  our  reporting  staff  and   the\r\n\r\nfacilities now available in the Printing Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the perfection of our system\r\n\r\nof  simultaneous interpretation in  this  Chamber.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous interpretation is an art which is  so\r\n\r\nnew  to  Singapore and which is of such difficulty\r\n\r\nand  complexity  that  one must  expect  \"teething\r\n\r\ntroubles\", and these \"teething troubles\", I  fear,\r\n\r\nare  still present; but they will disappear in the\r\n\r\ncourse of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the problems which confront this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  with  goodwill,  forbearance   and\r\n\r\nassistance from Honourable Members, I am confident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  those problems will be solved and the steady\r\n\r\npace  of our growth will be maintained.

But I find  that  the  usual\r\n\r\nsentiments expressed in other Parliaments on  such\r\n\r\noccasions are, by and large, inappropriate for the\r\n\r\nsituation,  which we are in. It is  inappropriate,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, to express regret at our having\r\n\r\nlost  your powers of eloquence, humour and wit  by\r\n\r\nyour  being elevated to the Chair and, at the same\r\n\r\ntime, to congratulate ourselves on having acquired\r\n\r\na   wise,  just  and  impartial  arbiter  of   the\r\n\r\nproceedings of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task which we have invited you to continue\r\n\r\ndischarging  is  not the simple one  of  following\r\n\r\ntraditions  and precedents. You have been  Speaker\r\n\r\nof  the last Assembly, in which the beginnings  of\r\n\r\nthe  rules of debate were laid down, and the  tone\r\n\r\nand  atmosphere  of this Chamber  slowly  evolved.\r\n\r\nBut, with the introduction of multilingualism, the\r\n\r\ntask  to which you have been elected has now  some\r\n\r\nof   the   complications,  which  a  Chairman   of\r\n\r\ninternational  conferences  must  face.   Can   we\r\n\r\nmaintain decorum and an air of intimacy in  debate\r\n\r\nin  spite  of the fact that the Chairman and  many\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House will not know what is  being\r\n\r\nsaid  until  it is irretrievably recorded  in  the\r\n\r\nofficial  tapes? Can such a Chairman  develop  the\r\n\r\nintuition and the powers to fathom evil intentions\r\n\r\nof wicked tongues before these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords  have been uttered? Can there be a sense  of\r\n\r\nhumour and an atmosphere of conviviality as one is\r\n\r\nbeing  harangued in a language not understood  and\r\n\r\neven  through an interpretation not always clearly\r\n\r\nunderstandable? The past year has  given  us  some\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the problems,  which  we  have  to\r\n\r\nresolve  if  we are to maintain this  House  as  a\r\n\r\ndebating  and a thinking Chamber, and not  just  a\r\n\r\nforum for declamations and denunciations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I congratulate you on having\r\n\r\nwon  the unanimous support of all Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  by  the fair and judicious manner in  which\r\n\r\nyou  have  discharged your duties? And may  I,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Government Bench, assure you of  our\r\n\r\ncontinued  support in maintaining  this  House  in\r\n\r\ngood  humour  and good order and  in  keeping  the\r\n\r\ncountry in good heart?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Mr Speaker, Sir, you  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  known  each other when we were both  members\r\n\r\nfor some time of the City Council, and previous to\r\n\r\nthat  of  the Board of Commissioners.  I  believe,\r\n\r\nSir,  it was in 1955 that you were called upon  by\r\n\r\nthe Governor to take on what was then, to my mind,\r\n\r\nthe  most difficult task of being the Speaker  and\r\n\r\nsetting  the  tracks  of the  Legislature  on  its\r\n\r\nproper  course. When your name was announced,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as  the  future  Speaker  of   the\r\n\r\nLegislature, I personally was confident  that  the\r\n\r\nright  choice had been made, because, having  been\r\n\r\nassociated with you and having worked with you  on\r\n\r\nthe Commission, I knew that you had won the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence and respect of that body on  which  you\r\n\r\nserved.  To my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, a necessary\r\n\r\nprerequisite to an efficient and impartial Speaker\r\n\r\nis the confidence and respect of the Assembly over\r\n\r\nwhich  he  presides.  You  had  that  respect  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  then, and you won that confidence  and\r\n\r\nrespect by hard work, by not talking out of  turn,\r\n\r\nby  not talking on irrelevant things, and when you\r\n\r\ndid say things, all the people who listened to you\r\n\r\nwere convinced that you spoke because you had  to,\r\n\r\nbecause you believed in what you said, and it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary that it had to be said. You came here to\r\n\r\nthis  Legislature - I was not in  it  then - and  from\r\n\r\nwhat  I could gather from the past Members of  the\r\n\r\nLegislature,  you  too  won  the  confidence   and\r\n\r\nrespect of that House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my honour to serve in the second\r\n\r\nLegislature here. I have now seen you work for the\r\n\r\nlast year and I see that you have again gained the\r\n\r\nconfidence  and respect of this House to  such  an\r\n\r\nextent  that you have been unanimously re-elected.\r\n\r\nMight I, with respect, Sir, say that, in so far as\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  is  concerned,  we  will  conduct\r\n\r\nourselves  in  the way that every good  and  loyal\r\n\r\nOpposition must?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my\r\n\r\nParty, U.M.N.O., I congratulate you on your  being\r\n\r\nelected as S peaker of this Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the constitutional talks in London, we\r\n\r\nagreed that the post of Speaker should be held  by\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir,  for  a period of one  year  after  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, and that after that period  it\r\n\r\nwould    be   left   to   the   elected   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in  this  Assembly  to  elect   a\r\n\r\nSpeaker of their own choice.
