It has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided that for assessment purposes in  1960\r\n\r\nthe  Valuation Lists of both the City  Council  and\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Board should be based on the 1959 annual\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment is considered a tax on property-owners\r\n\r\nto  benefit  the poorer people in order to  provide\r\n\r\nmore amenities like roads, standpipes, bus shelters\r\n\r\nand  other such amenities. However, it has now been\r\n\r\ndecided  by Government that for 1960 we  shall  use\r\n\r\nthe 1959 assessment list and the rectification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanomalies in the assessment of properties  will  be\r\n\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent revision of properties in the City\r\n\r\narea  was  expected  to bring about  an  additional\r\n\r\nrevenue  of $6 million. It has been estimated  that\r\n\r\n99  per cent of this additional revenue comes  from\r\n\r\nthese  property-owners and commercial  enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe  money  thus collected will be used to  provide\r\n\r\namenities  for the benefit of all other inhabitants\r\n\r\nof  the  island. However, it is not practicable  to\r\n\r\nbring in this additional revenue of $6 million  for\r\n\r\n1960  because  of  certain misunderstandings  which\r\n\r\nhave  arisen  as  a result of the rectification  of\r\n\r\nanomalies   in   the  assessments.   Although   the\r\n\r\nGovernment knows that most of these properties  are\r\n\r\nvery  much  under-assessed, it is not  possible  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture to proceed with the original  scheme\r\n\r\ndue   to  some  unscrupulous  landlords  of   rent-controlled houses who, although not affected by the\r\n\r\nrecent  revision,  thought it fit  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  try  to raise the  rents  of  their\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government believes that until such time as sufficient information has been\r\n\r\neffectively   disseminated  amongst  the   tenants,\r\n\r\naction  should  be deferred. For equitable  reasons\r\n\r\nand  administrative convenience, it has also at the\r\n\r\nsame time decided that in the City area as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Board area, the Valuation List for  1960\r\n\r\nshould be based on the 1959 annual values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE STATE ARMS AND FLAG</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AND NATIONAL ANTHEM BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

It  provides  for  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to make regulations for the control\r\n\r\nof  the  use  of the State Arms, Flag  and  Anthem.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  new symbols of  an  authority  and\r\n\r\nloyalty and it is right that there should be  rules\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they are accorded the respect  they\r\n\r\ndeserve.  These rules will cover matters  like  the\r\n\r\nplaces and times at which the Arms and Flag of  the\r\n\r\nState  may  be  publicly displayed  or  the  Anthem\r\n\r\nplayed.  Some  of  the  rules  will  prescribe  the\r\n\r\ncorrect way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof flying the Flag and how the State Arms should be\r\n\r\ndisplayed, or prescribe that the State Flag  should\r\n\r\nbe  flown  in Government buildings such as  Courts,\r\n\r\nSecretariats, and so on. There will also have to be\r\n\r\nrules  about the display of the State Flag by ships\r\n\r\nin  harbour; but more important, there will have to\r\n\r\nbe  rules to prevent afront to or abuse of our  new\r\n\r\nsymbols  of loyalty. For example, some bright  free\r\n\r\nenterpriser  might take it into his head  to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  State Flag or the State Arms as a trade  mark.\r\n\r\nThen  you might find the market flooded with under-clothing, toothpaste, hair lotion and goods of that\r\n\r\nsort  using the State Flag or Arms as a trade mark.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  you  will  agree  that   such\r\n\r\nmisdirected patriotism must be discouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also have to be rules to prohibit the\r\n\r\nindiscriminate  playing of the National  Anthem  in\r\n\r\npublic places. It will not do for every bar in town\r\n\r\nto open and close for the day to the strains of the\r\n\r\nNational Anthem; nor would it add to the dignity of\r\n\r\nthe State National Anthem if it were jazzed up into\r\n\r\na rhumba or a samba or a conga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, in other words, seeks\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the  new State  symbols  are  not\r\n\r\nwilfully  brought  into  contempt,  ridicule,   and\r\n\r\nhatred.

The main intention of the Bill is to give\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public,  especially  the   poorer\r\n\r\nclasses who patronise the pawnshops, the benefit of\r\n\r\ncheaper pawnshop facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to alter the\r\n\r\nconstitution of the Pawnbrokers Licensing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the membership of the\r\n\r\nBoard.  At present, of the six members who comprise\r\n\r\nthe  Board,  the Chairman and one other person  are\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the  Minister.  One  member  is  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police or his representative,  and\r\n\r\nthree persons are appointed by the Justices of  the\r\n\r\nPeace from among their own number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Government considers, however, that in\r\n\r\nview  of  the constitutional changes, it  would  be\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate that all appointments other  than\r\n\r\nthose   of  the  Commissioner  of  Police  or   his\r\n\r\nrepresentative should be made by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 extends the redemption period of the\r\n\r\npledge  from three months to six months. This  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  pawners, especially the poorer  ones,  who\r\n\r\nwould  have  a  better chance of not  losing  their\r\n\r\npledges to the pawnbrokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 now makes it necessary for pawnbrokers\r\n\r\nto  take out insurance cover, not only against fire\r\n\r\nas at present, but also for loss by theft, robbery,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have drawn attention to a case early\r\n\r\nthis  year  where a pawnshop was robbed of  $50,000\r\n\r\nworth  of  pledges.  Pawners would  suffer  if  the\r\n\r\npledges were not insured against such loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 reduces the interest rate from the\r\n\r\npresent maximum rate of 2 per cent per mensem or 24\r\n\r\nper  cent per annum to 1 per cent per mensem or  12\r\n\r\nper  cent per annum on the amount of the loan. This\r\n\r\nreduction  will bring the interest rate  into  line\r\n\r\nwith the new Moneylenders Ordinance in that 12  per\r\n\r\ncent  per  annum has been fixed for secured  loans.\r\n\r\nThis   reduction  would  afford  financial   relief\r\n\r\nespecially  to the poorer classes of  pawners,  who\r\n\r\npawn their belongings, often belongings they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot afford to do without, in order to get  money\r\n\r\nquickly for one urgent reason or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that they have pledged their\r\n\r\nbelongings,  they still have to  pay  24  per  cent\r\n\r\ninterest for the money they get as against  12  per\r\n\r\ncent  under the Moneylenders Ordinance for  seizure\r\n\r\nof loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their business, pawnshop owners do not depend\r\n\r\nentirely   on  the  interest  payable  by  pawners.\r\n\r\nPawnbrokers also get the benefit from the  sale  of\r\n\r\nunredeemable pledges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been made by the Pawnbrokers\r\n\r\nAssociation  that  the proposed  reduction  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  interest  rate  by  half  would  seriously\r\n\r\naffect  the  pawnshop business  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\nvirtually  having to run them at  a  loss,  leading\r\n\r\npossibly to the closing down of the business.  They\r\n\r\npointed  out that the interest rate had  just  been\r\n\r\nreduced  from  3 or 4 per cent to  2  per  cent  in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out, however, that the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  abolishing the previous tender  system\r\n\r\nand instituting the present licensing system was to\r\n\r\nencourage more pawnbrokers into the field. However,\r\n\r\nthis  seemed  to  have failed, and  the  pawnbroker\r\n\r\nbusiness is very much of a monopoly in the hands of\r\n\r\nfour or five families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this and the representations made, I\r\n\r\nshall, at the end of the Second Reading, move  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill be committed to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes the necessary amendments to those\r\n\r\nsections and Schedules of the Ordinance where it is\r\n\r\nproposed that all unredeemed articles exceeding $50\r\n\r\ninstead of $100 as at present should be disposed of\r\n\r\nby  public  auction.

Any  article  pawned  for   an   amount\r\n\r\nexceeding  $50  must  be something  of  value,  and\r\n\r\ndisposal by public auction would at least give  the\r\n\r\npawner a last opportunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto get it back by bidding for it, though whether he\r\n\r\ndoes it or not is another matter.

(New Series) 2 of 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to launch into a\r\n\r\nlong  dissertation about the role that symbols play\r\n\r\nin  the  political  and social life  of  a  people.\r\n\r\nSuffice  it to say that they are accepted  features\r\n\r\nof any government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National flags, crests and anthems express\r\n\r\nsymbolically the hopes and ideals of a people.  The\r\n\r\nsymbols  by  themselves may  be  meaningless.  What\r\n\r\ngives  them  meaning  are the  ideas  and  emotions\r\n\r\nbehind the symbols. We respect not the flag as such\r\n\r\nor  the State arms or the anthem but the sentiments\r\n\r\nand ideas they represent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possession of a national flag, anthem and\r\n\r\ncrest  is,  for  a people, symbols of self-respect.\r\n\r\nThrough  these  a  people acquire  identity  and  a\r\n\r\npersonality of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbols we have had so far were symbols that\r\n\r\nemphasised  our subjection to the will  of  others.\r\n\r\nThey   were  symbols  of  dominance,  of  authority\r\n\r\nimposed from the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is a self-governing State, it\r\n\r\nis  right  and proper that it should have  its  own\r\n\r\nsymbols  of  authority  and loyalty.  Only  through\r\n\r\nthese  new  symbols can we express the spirit  that\r\n\r\ntoday moves our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in designing the new symbols, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  worked in close co-operation  with\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties because we want these symbols to\r\n\r\nexpress the sentiments and aspirations, not of  any\r\n\r\nparticular  group,  Party or section,  but  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, symbols are a very tricky\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They  can mean whatever a  person  wants\r\n\r\nthem  to  mean.  The same symbol  can  be  given  a\r\n\r\nfriendly or an unfriendly interpretation.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe  same  sort of difficulty over words which  are\r\n\r\nfar  more precise in their meaning than colours and\r\n\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House, for example, Sir, is divided into a\r\n\r\nGovernment  and an Opposition precisely because  we\r\n\r\ncannot  get  a  unanimous  interpretation  on  such\r\n\r\nseemingly    harmless   words   like   \"democracy\",\r\n\r\n\"socialism\", and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in order to prevent any too free a\r\n\r\ntranslation of the new symbols that we  have  taken\r\n\r\nthe  precaution  of  providing,  as  it  were,   an\r\n\r\nauthorised  translation of the  symbols  which  our\r\n\r\nflag and State arms carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour red stands for universal brotherhood\r\n\r\nand  equality  of man. Whatever the colour  of  our\r\n\r\nskin,  the  shape of our nose and eyes,  the  blood\r\n\r\nthat  gives  us  life is of one  colour - even  among\r\n\r\nthose  who  claim  to have blue blood.  The  colour\r\n\r\nwhite  signifies  purity and  virtue.  So  the  two\r\n\r\ncolours  combined signify that we hope  to  achieve\r\n\r\nbrotherhood and equality through purity and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent moon signifies a country eternally\r\n\r\nyoung.  This is expressive of one of the  essential\r\n\r\nqualities  of  our  people, for not  only  are  our\r\n\r\npeople physically young but they are also young  in\r\n\r\nspirit and outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refutes the traditional picture which\r\n\r\ndepicts  Asian  countries as countries  which  have\r\n\r\ngrown  senile, as countries burdened  with  ancient\r\n\r\nand meaningless traditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture is not true of Asia today. It is a\r\n\r\nyouthful, restless Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore, like the new Asia, therefore,\r\n\r\nfinds  its inspirations in what it hopes to  do  in\r\n\r\nthe  future  rather than what it has  done  in  the\r\n\r\npast. Only the old, grown weak and complacent, hark\r\n\r\nnostalgically back to the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the youthful who are more conscious of\r\n\r\nthe future waiting to unfold before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the five stars represent the ideals on which\r\n\r\nthe  new  State of Singapore is founded - democracy,\r\n\r\npeace,  progress, justice and equality.  Those  who\r\n\r\nwould  destroy  these are our  enemies.  Those  who\r\n\r\nwould repudiate them are false prophets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These symbols are also incorporated in the State\r\n\r\narms  which also has a lion and a tiger.  The  lion\r\n\r\nrepresents  Singapore and the tiger our links  with\r\n\r\nthe people of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the State national anthem \"Majulah\r\n\r\nSingapura\", it has already been tacitly accepted by\r\n\r\nthe  people  as  their song. It has been  sung  and\r\n\r\nplayed  as Singapore's anthem unofficially on  many\r\n\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have liked so much to\r\n\r\nend  this debate by getting the whole House to give\r\n\r\nits  rendering  of  this  stirring  anthem,  but  I\r\n\r\ngather, Sir, that the rules of debate would have to\r\n\r\nbe  completely relaxed for what, I am  sure,  would\r\n\r\nhave been a historic performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag, the State arms and the anthem are new\r\n\r\nsymbols  of national pride. They are expressive  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  spirit  of self-reliance  and  dedication\r\n\r\nwhich inspires our people today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, I wish\r\n\r\nto congratulate particularly the Hon. the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  who, I am of the opinion, has  been  very\r\n\r\ncompromising in accepting constructive suggestions.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have achieved today, by our  decision  to\r\n\r\ngive full support to the motion before us is indeed\r\n\r\nhistorical, and history will show that what we have\r\n\r\nfully supported today will also receive the support\r\n\r\nand acclaim of our future posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we sit in opposition to the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's Party, we do not hesitate here  to\r\n\r\nmake  known  our  appreciation of his  attitude  of\r\n\r\ncompromise   which  is  significant.   One   should\r\n\r\nremember   that  in  the  history  of   the   Malay\r\n\r\nArchipelago, if I am not mistaken it was  in  1292,\r\n\r\nthere  existed an emblem which our own State emblem\r\n\r\nnow  closely  resembles, in part if not  in  whole.\r\n\r\nThis  serves to remind us here in Singapore,  which\r\n\r\nis one of the component islands of Malaysia, of the\r\n\r\nsolidarity  of  the  indigenous  people  of   these\r\n\r\nislands.  Therefore, because of this, on behalf  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. particularly,  we  wish  to  support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   wholeheartedly   for   bringing   into\r\n\r\nexistence  a new State emblem with such a  historic\r\n\r\nbackground dating back to 1292, to be the symbol of\r\n\r\nour  joint  struggle on the road to full  political\r\n\r\nindependence - a thing we have yet to achieve  today.\r\n\r\nFor  that  reason,  I say that the  State  flag  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed by U.M.N.O. The State flag (upper half  in\r\n\r\nred and the lower half in white with a crescent and\r\n\r\nfive  stars,  as  described  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture   just   now)   has  a  true   significance\r\n\r\nparticularly  to  U.M.N.O. and  generally  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Islam because we believe, as followers of\r\n\r\nIslam,   that   the  five  stars - apart   from   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation given by the Minister - also symbolise\r\n\r\nour  firm faith in our religious beliefs, for  they\r\n\r\ncould symbolise the five main pillars of Islam.  To\r\n\r\nus  the State flag signifies the firm belief in God\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker, my remarks\r\n\r\nabout  the State flag similarly apply to the  State\r\n\r\ncrest. It can be said that the significance of  the\r\n\r\ncrest  is  a  matter which can be put  into  effect\r\n\r\nbecause  it shows that a tiger and a lion can  meet\r\n\r\nin  peace. This is a good omen for Singapore in its\r\n\r\napproach  towards a progressive State for which  we\r\n\r\nare all aiming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, we know that the Tunku has\r\n\r\nstated  that  the Australians should  learn  Malay.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is indeed wise that the State  motto\r\n\r\nand national anthem should be in Malay. I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Opposition will unanimously\r\n\r\nsupport  the idea that Malay should be  the  lingua\r\n\r\nfranca  of  Malaysia. If possible, the  Australians\r\n\r\ntoo could learn the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  regarding  our  State  flag,   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture says the five  stars  on  it\r\n\r\nsymbolise  democracy,  peace, progress,  prosperity\r\n\r\nand  justice. Democracy is signified  by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat our State is a democratic State, and peace  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the State wishes to have a peaceful\r\n\r\nsociety.  We are opposed to a warlike society.  Our\r\n\r\nState,  although  a youthful State,  must  progress\r\n\r\ngradually.  Justice  in our present  society  means\r\n\r\nthat whether a thing is reasonable or unreasonable,\r\n\r\nwe must deal with it justly and with discipline. In\r\n\r\nour  State  there is no class or race  division  or\r\n\r\nreligious   prejudice.  What   these   five   stars\r\n\r\nsymbolise is very appropriate to our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent moon represents a rising and\r\n\r\nyouthful  State. At present we are still young;  we\r\n\r\nare  a young people and energetic, and we will grow\r\n\r\nstronger. The colour red symbolises that we are all\r\n\r\nbrothers,  irrespective of race  or  religion.  The\r\n\r\ncolour  white symbolises that in our new State  the\r\n\r\npeople  are pure and virtuous, unlike the  previous\r\n\r\ncolonial government where there were some evils. On\r\n\r\nthe  national crest, i.e. the State arms, the tiger\r\n\r\nand the lion represent ultimate merger of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith   Malaya,  when  the  people  of  Malaya   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  live together. The  title  of  our\r\n\r\nnational anthem is \"Majulah Singapura\" - meaning that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  progressing every day. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nfully  support our State flag, national anthem  and\r\n\r\nState arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of this country are already learning\r\n\r\nthe score of the national anthem. Those who are  in\r\n\r\nor  out of school must also be familiar with it.

I was just wondering how the\r\n\r\nincidents in Cyprus could be incorporated into  our\r\n\r\nflag!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of\r\n\r\nunity  and  the  fact that U.M.N.O. representatives\r\n\r\nconveyed  that  idea  as  being  feasible;  and  in\r\n\r\nCyprus,  Archbishop  Makarios attributed  this  new\r\n\r\nunity  to  the  fact that when both sides  regarded\r\n\r\nthis  as  practical, then they had a new  approach,\r\n\r\nand these are his words, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Humanity fell into disaster and was involved in\r\n\r\nhatred  and enmity, because she lost the right  way\r\n\r\nwhich guides to brotherhood, solidarity and love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And he said that he hoped to create in Cyprus a new\r\n\r\npattern of unity under God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already heard it reported that in\r\n\r\nAustralia  the Prime Minister of our good neighbour\r\n\r\nhas  said  that  it  is difficult  to  have  merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the Federation  because  of\r\n\r\ncertain  differences in outlook. I think that  this\r\n\r\nnew approach suggested by U.M.N.O. could be one  of\r\n\r\nthe  ways  that  could bring about  unity  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry and between us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this spirit, Sir, I support the motion\r\n\r\nbefore the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today is a historic day\r\n\r\nand a most happy occasion, not only for me but also\r\n\r\nfor all Members of this Assembly as well as for all\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore, because in  this  House\r\n\r\ntoday  all  Parties,  both the Opposition  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   have  been  able  to   forget   their\r\n\r\ndifferences  of  opinion and unite  on  a  national\r\n\r\nissue which we are discussing today. As a Member of\r\n\r\nthis  House, I am very proud because this is a good\r\n\r\nexample  of agreement on a national issue which  is\r\n\r\nof common interest to us all. We are able to forget\r\n\r\nour  divergent  policies  and  our  differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion.  May the adoption of this motion  and  the\r\n\r\nacceptance of the new flag for our new State with a\r\n\r\nnew status signify that the people of Singapore are\r\n\r\nprepared  to live and fit themselves to live  as  a\r\n\r\npeople of a free, independent State!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who would interpret the colours\r\n\r\nof  red and white with various connotations, as was\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  Hon. the Minister for  Culture,  the\r\n\r\nmember of U.M.N.O. and the member of S.P.A. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said that the colours red and white had  been\r\n\r\nthe  emblem  of past Malay superiority  during  the\r\n\r\ntime of Hang Tuah or during the Sri Vijaya Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a matter for the historians to ascertain.\r\n\r\nBut  for  us,  the  people of  Singapore,  who  are\r\n\r\nmembers of a multi-racial society, I would say that\r\n\r\nif  we  wound  a part of our body, red  blood  will\r\n\r\nflow.  The red colour therefore signifies  that  we\r\n\r\nare one, that we believe in unity, and that we live\r\n\r\nin  unity  without  any discrimination  whatsoever;\r\n\r\nwhilst the white colour symbolises our sincerity of\r\n\r\npurpose,   and  that  we  are  prepared   to   make\r\n\r\nsacrifices in the interests of unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the stars embodied in our emblem it\r\n\r\nhas  been said that they symbolise the five  tenets\r\n\r\nof  Islam;  and  also that they signify  democracy,\r\n\r\npeace, progress, justice and equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these interpretations can be accepted\r\n\r\nby  posterity  according to the progress  of  their\r\n\r\nideas  and  their level of thought. But for  us  we\r\n\r\nshould feel proud because we have been able to base\r\n\r\nour aspirations and sentiments on five precepts  of\r\n\r\nlife.  If  Indonesia  is well-known  for  its  five\r\n\r\nprecepts  of Panchasila and Afro-Asia for its  five\r\n\r\ninternational  codes  of  behaviour,  we  too,   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as a new State, have brought  forth  our\r\n\r\nfive basic principles and call them Panchasila,  or\r\n\r\nfive  codes of behaviour. Panchasila is a  Sanskrit\r\n\r\nword meaning five principles of behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, concerning our State Arms - the lion and the tiger - it is generally accepted that the\r\n\r\nlion  had been the symbol for Singapore since  Sang\r\n\r\nNila  Utama  first set foot in Singapore.  Likewise\r\n\r\nthe  tiger is also known for its strength,  and  is\r\n\r\nincorporated in the State Arms of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  As  the Hon. the Minister for Culture  has\r\n\r\nsaid,   this   signifies  the  unity  between   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and Singapore. The lion is  an\r\n\r\nanimal which is only found in Africa, and the tiger\r\n\r\nis  an animal well-known in Asia, equally noble and\r\n\r\nstrong.  This  can  also  therefore  mean  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   the  spirit  of  Afro-Asia   has   been\r\n\r\nassimilated as from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the national anthem, this was composed\r\n\r\nby  a  composer from among the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  an atmosphere where the people are imbued  with\r\n\r\nthe    spirit   and   determination   to    achieve\r\n\r\nindependence. It was thus that the national  anthem\r\n\r\nwas  composed and was accepted by the  people,  and\r\n\r\nfinally  accepted  by  this  Assembly  to  be   our\r\n\r\nnational anthem. Our pride is even greater  because\r\n\r\nthe    national   anthem   typifies   the   earnest\r\n\r\naspirations of the nation - the sincerity and loyalty\r\n\r\nof  the  people. This expresses the  unity  of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  the  singleness of purpose of the  people,\r\n\r\nand  will  be a slogan which will unite the  people\r\n\r\ntogether, irrespective of race, creed and beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the three national emblems - the State Arms,\r\n\r\nthe  State  flag and the national anthem - have  been\r\n\r\naccepted by all sections of the people through  all\r\n\r\ntheir  representatives who are present today.  This\r\n\r\nindeed is a very significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning for us to unite ourselves in a spirit  of\r\n\r\nself-sacrifice, and the struggle for  the  creation\r\n\r\nof a fully-pledged independent and sovereign state.\r\n\r\nLet us resolve then that we will defend these State\r\n\r\nemblems to the utmost, so long as the waves of  the\r\n\r\nsea  wash  our shores, the State flag of  Singapore\r\n\r\nflutters   in  the  breeze,  the  national   anthem\r\n\r\nresounds in the air, and the State Arms be seen  at\r\n\r\nall times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Since  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen liberated, we should have a national anthem, a\r\n\r\ncrest  and  a  flag  for  ourselves.  These  become\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Therefore, for our Singapore,  we  have\r\n\r\nprepared    them.   These   are    acceptable    by\r\n\r\neveryone - after  having consulted  all  the  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in this Legislative Assembly.  Everyone\r\n\r\nhas agreed to all the three. The crest consists  of\r\n\r\na  red  shield on which are emblazoned  a  crescent\r\n\r\nmoon   and   five  stars  in  white.  The  crescent\r\n\r\nrepresents  the growing Singapore. The  five  stars\r\n\r\nstand for democracy, peace, progress, justice,  and\r\n\r\nequality.  The red colour symbolises the  universal\r\n\r\nbrotherhood  and equality of man. The white  colour\r\n\r\nsignifies  purity and virtue. The whole  shield  is\r\n\r\nsupported by a lion on the left and a tiger on  the\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties have also agreed to all these things.\r\n\r\nThey  can  interpret the five stars as \"Panchasila\"\r\n\r\nor  in any way they like. Coming to the flag, it is\r\n\r\nred  on the upper half and white on the lower half.\r\n\r\nOur  national  symbols are not based  on  creed  or\r\n\r\nraces. These symbols are acceptable to everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the object\r\n\r\nof  the  State flag, the State crest and the  State\r\n\r\nanthem  is to evoke in the hearts and minds of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  feelings of loyalty and unity towards  the\r\n\r\nState of which they are constituent members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we set on this task of drawing up a symbol\r\n\r\nwhich  would  receive universal acclamation,  there\r\n\r\nwere  certain  principles which  had  already  been\r\n\r\nordained by the rules of heraldry. I would like  to\r\n\r\npay  a tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister for the\r\n\r\nthorough  and methodical manner in which he  delved\r\n\r\ninto  these rules of heraldry, and for having  done\r\n\r\nthe spade-work of the \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" of drawing\r\n\r\na  flag and a crest. Amongst other things, I learnt\r\n\r\nof  the necessity of having supporting figures  and\r\n\r\nbalance,  and  lions  rampant  and  other  abstruse\r\n\r\nthings  connected  with animals.  But  surprisingly\r\n\r\nenough,  if one looks at the book of flags and  the\r\n\r\nbook   of  crests,  there  is  a  limit  to   human\r\n\r\ningenuity. The number of basic symbols that one can\r\n\r\nuse  is  limited,  and the juxtaposition  of  these\r\n\r\nsymbols is also limited. The number of combinations\r\n\r\nof  colours  which  would  strike  the  human  mind\r\n\r\nvividly is also relatively limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think we have a great deal to\r\n\r\nrejoice  over in having drawn up a simple  striking\r\n\r\nsymbol  which  has,  with the blessings  which  all\r\n\r\nParties have given it today, every reason to endure\r\n\r\nas  the  emblems of the State and which will  evoke\r\n\r\nloyalty  and unity in our people.

That\r\n\r\nsection reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"5.-(l) The Board shall consist of-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a Chairman;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a Deputy Chairman; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) three other members,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>all  of whom shall be appointed by the Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Governor in Council\" now, of course, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before the 31st of August this year, the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Board was: a Chairman, a  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman  and three other members. On the  31st  of\r\n\r\nAugust this year, the period of appointment of  the\r\n\r\nChairman came to an end and his appointment as such\r\n\r\ntherefore lapsed. The period of appointment of  one\r\n\r\nof  the  four other members also came to an end  on\r\n\r\nthe  31st  of August this year, and his appointment\r\n\r\ntherefore also lapsed, leaving three members on the\r\n\r\nBoard on the 1st of September this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Gazette of Friday, 4th September, 1959,\r\n\r\nthere appeared on page 470 thereof the names of two\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board. One was Mr Goh Kee Song, who\r\n\r\nwas gazetted as Chairman of the Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard for a term of one year, with effect from  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember,   1959.   The  other  appointment,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  which  immediately  followed   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of the chairman, is that  of  Mr  Lui\r\n\r\nBoon  Poh  as  a member of the Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard for a term of one year, with effect from  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1959.  So that,  as  from  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember,  these  two members,  it  would  appear,\r\n\r\nbecame members of the Board. I understand that  the\r\n\r\nother  three members of the Board have  since  then\r\n\r\nsent   in   their  resignations.  I  have  searched\r\n\r\nthroughout  the Gazettes for further  notifications\r\n\r\nas  to  the  names of other members who have  taken\r\n\r\ntheir places, but, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable to\r\n\r\nfind  those names. That is the first point which  I\r\n\r\nwish to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. I\r\n\r\nhave  already  quoted  part of  section  5  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board Ordinance to the  House.\r\n\r\nNow, subsection (2) of section 5 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No person who is in the public service of the\r\n\r\nColony  shall  be  appointed to the  Board  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  in Council [now, of course, the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara]\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  therefore, there is a group of persons who are\r\n\r\nexcluded  from service on this Board and  they  are\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  in  the public  service  of  the\r\n\r\nColony.  There is a definition of \"public  officer\"\r\n\r\nin  section  2  of  the Ordinance  which  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"public officer\" means a person holding any\r\n\r\noffice of emolument under the Crown in the Colony;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which means a Government servant, in other words. I\r\n\r\ntake it, Mr Speaker, Sir, that section 5 (2) takes\r\n\r\nwithin  its  net a bigger group of persons  than  a\r\n\r\npublic  officer.  Had it only intended  to  exclude\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers, section 5  (2)  quite  easily\r\n\r\ncould have read, \"No person who is a public officer\r\n\r\nshall be appointed to the Board by the Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.\" But the Legislature had seen fit to use a\r\n\r\ndifferent phrase, \"who is in the public service  of\r\n\r\nthe Colony shall be appointed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...\". Therefore, the expression \"who is in the public\r\n\r\nservice of the Colony\", as I understand it,  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  a  more extensive meaning  than  \"public\r\n\r\nofficer\".  If the House accepts that,  let  us  now\r\n\r\nexamine  the nature of the appointments which  have\r\n\r\nappeared in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Kee Song, I understand, is a young accountant who, until quite recently, was studying\r\n\r\naccountancy  in the University of Melbourne.  After\r\n\r\nhaving  passed  his  accountancy  examinations   he\r\n\r\nreturned to Singapore and found employment  in  the\r\n\r\nCity Council. After the advent of the P.A.P. in the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and under the Mayorship  of  the  now\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, Mr Goh Kee Song\r\n\r\nwas   appointed  Acting  Registrar   of   Vehicles.\r\n\r\nLatterly, he was also appointed to the position  of\r\n\r\nActing  Assessor  of the City Council.  So  he  now\r\n\r\nholds,  in so far as the City Council is concerned,\r\n\r\ntwo  positions - Acting  Registrar  of  Vehicles  and\r\n\r\nActing  Assessor. And he has now been appointed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board as its Chairman. The\r\n\r\nfirst question that arises, therefore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  this: is this appointment a correct  one?\r\n\r\nDoes it violate the provisions of section 5 (2)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board Ordinance? It would,\r\n\r\nI  suppose, be contended by the Minister that  City\r\n\r\nCouncil   employees   are  not   public   officers.\r\n\r\nCertainly  that would be correct because  a  public\r\n\r\nofficer is a person in the employment of the Crown.\r\n\r\nBut  section  5 (2) of the Ordinance  says  \"public\r\n\r\nservice of the Colony\". And if City Council service\r\n\r\nis  not public service, Mr Speaker, Sir, then what\r\n\r\nis  that  public service, beside that of Government\r\n\r\nservice  in  which a public officer finds  himself,\r\n\r\nwhich  is public service within the meaning of  the\r\n\r\nsection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase \"public service\" has received judicial\r\n\r\ninterpretation  and  that  interpretation  will  be\r\n\r\nfound,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in  Words  and  Phrases\r\n\r\nJudicially  Defined,  volume  4,  page  436,   1944\r\n\r\nedition.  May  I  read  under the  heading  \"Public\r\n\r\nService\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A railway act provided that if at any time it\r\n\r\nshould  be made to appear to the Board of Trade  to\r\n\r\nbe  requisite for the public service,  the  company\r\n\r\nshould lay down additional rails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  question  that arose there, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwas, what is the meaning of public service? And the\r\n\r\nquotation  which  I  am now  going  to  read  is  a\r\n\r\nquotation  from  a  judgment  delivered   in   that\r\n\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was argued that the expression \"requisite for\r\n\r\nthe  public service\" means requisite for the public\r\n\r\nservice of the Government or of Her Majesty. But we\r\n\r\nsee  no reason for taking \"public service\" to  mean\r\n\r\nno  more  than  Government public  service  or  the\r\n\r\nservice of Government acting for the public. And we\r\n\r\nthink any service which would supply wants felt  by\r\n\r\nthe public or which the public might reasonably  be\r\n\r\ndesirous of having on its own behalf is included.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of that judgment, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  submit,  with respect, that \"public service\"  as\r\n\r\ndefined in section 5 (2) of the Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  Ordinance  takes in  the  category  of  City\r\n\r\nCouncil   employees.  If  I  am  correct  in   that\r\n\r\nsubmission,  then the appointment of  Mr  Goh  Kee\r\n\r\nSong  as Chairman is certainly ultra vires. On  the\r\n\r\nother  appointment - Mr Lui Boon Poh. He is  also  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the City Council. I understand  that  he\r\n\r\njoined the City Council under the mayorship of  our\r\n\r\nnow  present  Minister  for  National  Development.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  joining City Council service, he  was  a\r\n\r\nsalesman.   But   he   was  appointed   as   Acting\r\n\r\nSuperintendent,  Town Cleansing  Department.  Since\r\n\r\nthen  he has made such a good job of it that  I  am\r\n\r\nnow  told  he is Deputy Administrator of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  What  I  said  with  reference   to   the\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir,  in  so far as  the  illegality  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  or,  shall  I  say,  the  ultra   vires\r\n\r\nposition is concerned, applies equally to  Mr  Lui\r\n\r\nBoon  Poh. So that if the other three members  have\r\n\r\nresigned and no other appointments have been  made,\r\n\r\nit  appears  to  me  that there are  now  only  two\r\n\r\nmembers  on  the  Board. Since  both  of  them  are\r\n\r\nmembers in the public service of the Colony,  their\r\n\r\nappointments are ultra vires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also draw the attention of the House to\r\n\r\nsection   9   of  the  Singapore  Telephone   Board\r\n\r\nOrdinance which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The quorum at all meetings of the Board shall be\r\n\r\ntwo members present in addition to the Chairman  or\r\n\r\nDeputy Chairman, and, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of the Chairman, the Deputy  Chairman\r\n\r\nshall preside at such meetings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  read  that  to mean, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  in\r\n\r\naddition  to the Chairman, there must be two  other\r\n\r\nmembers to form a quorum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to describe in\r\n\r\ndetail  the  position  of the  Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard, when I was first asked by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto take over its functions, so that the public will\r\n\r\nunderstand why we have these appointments.  When  I\r\n\r\nfirst  took over the Singapore Telephone Board,  I\r\n\r\nfound,  to my horror, that the General Manager  was\r\n\r\npaid  $4,150  a month, not including other  special\r\n\r\nbenefits  like leave pay, special housing allowance\r\n\r\nand other various benefits; that the Deputy General\r\n\r\nManager is over 60 years of age, or nearing 60, and\r\n\r\ngetting  about $4,000 a month; and that there  were\r\n\r\nmany other anomalies which had to be rectified.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,   we   felt   that  a   certain   amount   of\r\n\r\nreorganisation work had to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August this year, Mr Speaker, the retiring\r\n\r\nChairman of the Telephone Board, Mr Loke Wan  Tho,\r\n\r\ncame  to  see me and he indirectly asked me whether\r\n\r\nhe  would be granted permission to stay on. I  told\r\n\r\nhim  that the policy of the new Government  was  to\r\n\r\nreorganise  all  statutory  Boards  so   that   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people could be looked  after.  I\r\n\r\nfurther  requested him to do this, \"If you will  be\r\n\r\nkind  enough to ask the other three members of  the\r\n\r\nBoard   to   retire   on  their  own   initiative?\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the other three members of  the  Board\r\n\r\nsubmitted their resignations. Mr Speaker,  we  had\r\n\r\nnothing  personal against the members  of  the  old\r\n\r\nTelephone Board as such, but we felt that  all  the\r\n\r\nfive  members  of  the  Board represented  business\r\n\r\ninterests.  In order to look into other aspects  of\r\n\r\ntelephone facilities - for instance, the rural  areas\r\n\r\nhave been completely ignored in the past: the trade\r\n\r\nunion world has also been completely ignored in the\r\n\r\npast - we  set about the task of reorganisation.  Our\r\n\r\nobject   was   to  have  as  much  as  possible   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative   field  in  the   newly-constituted\r\n\r\nTelephone Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1st of September, Mr Goh Kee Song was\r\n\r\nappointed Chairman of the Singapore Telephone Board\r\n\r\nwhen Mr Loke Wan Tho's term of appointment lapsed.\r\n\r\nI  must  clarify, Mr Speaker, what and who is  Mr\r\n\r\nGoh  Kee Song. The Member for Farrer Park has  said\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Goh Kee Song was from the University  of\r\n\r\nMelbourne. That is not correct. I had never met Mr\r\n\r\nGoh  Kee Song until he joined the City Council.  He\r\n\r\nwas  from the University of Tasmania, and, I think,\r\n\r\nas  usual, the Member for Farrer Park's sources  of\r\n\r\ninformation, or his informants, were wrong. Mr Goh\r\n\r\nKee  Song  studied accountancy, as the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park said, not long ago. He has  not,  like\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park, taken up law before the\r\n\r\nwar.  But he is an expert in his trade. He  studied\r\n\r\naccountancy  and,  I believe, got  his  accountancy\r\n\r\ndegree  as  far  back as eight or nine  years  ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough he would not have the same amount of  grey\r\n\r\nmatter  as the Member for Farrer Park has, he  has,\r\n\r\nhowever,  got  a  degree  in  commerce.  He  is   a\r\n\r\nChartered  Accountant and had worked  in  Australia\r\n\r\nfor  some  years before he joined the City Council.\r\n\r\nFrom  what  I knew about him, Mr Speaker,  he  was\r\n\r\nengaged   in   Australia  by  a  firm  of   English\r\n\r\naccountants  in Singapore at the rate of  $1,400  a\r\n\r\nmonth. He came to Singapore and worked in this firm\r\n\r\nfor  nearly  a  year. Because of the discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  local accountants in this particular  firm\r\n\r\nand  the  fact  that he was not  willing  to  serve\r\n\r\nexpatriates and Europeans - as the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  would like him to serve - for whom he got  much\r\n\r\nbusiness, he got fed up with the job and he sent in\r\n\r\nhis  letter  of  resignation. Later,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nvacancy  in  the  City Council to supervise  a  $30\r\n\r\nmillion contract in Ulu Pandan in which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park had a hand - $30 million being handed\r\n\r\nover   to   an  expatriate  firm  and  paying   the\r\n\r\nconsultants   $2  million  in  fees   without   any\r\n\r\naccounting or engineering supervision from the City\r\n\r\nCouncil. So Mr Goh Kee Song was asked to supervise\r\n\r\nthe  contract  which  the Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nduring  his  time in the City Council  did  not  do\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Mr Speaker, that Mr Goh Kee Song\r\n\r\nhas  held  two  positions since the new  Government\r\n\r\ncame  into  power. First, he was made the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Vehicles  and then the City Assessor  but,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, this is because of the past policy in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council in which the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhad a hand. There was no attempt made to malayanise\r\n\r\ncertain  departments  and when  the  City  Assessor\r\n\r\nleft-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Although he  holds\r\n\r\ntwo  positions  and has been made Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board,  may  I  say  that  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chairman  of the Singapore Telephone  Board\r\n\r\nwas in charge of more than two establishments? I am\r\n\r\nsure, Mr Speaker, you will agree that Mr Loke Wan\r\n\r\nTho  is in charge of about 100 establishments,  and\r\n\r\nhe  still  finds  time to attend an hourly  meeting\r\n\r\nonce  a  month,  leaving the  job  to  the  General\r\n\r\nManager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I hope you will allow me to\r\n\r\nexplain  the position of Mr Lui Boon Poh on  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park also tried to cast some\r\n\r\nremarks.  It  is  true that Mr Lui  Boon  Poh  who\r\n\r\nrecently  joined the City Council was  a  salesman.\r\n\r\nThere are many types of salesmen, as there are many\r\n\r\ntypes  of  lawyers. Some lawyers are Q.Cs, standing\r\n\r\non  their  own rights without having to kow-tow  to\r\n\r\nbig  businessmen in order to eke out an  existence.\r\n\r\nSome  lawyers make their living through means which\r\n\r\nare  contemptible. We read in the Press in the last\r\n\r\nfew   days  how  some  of  them  chase  after   car\r\n\r\naccidents. Now, Mr Lui\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoon  Poh, as I have said, joined the City Council.\r\n\r\nHe  was  a  salesman  but he did  not  receive  any\r\n\r\nadditional financial benefit. Neither did  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nKee Song who was paid $1,400 a month; he joined the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  and was also paid  $1,400  a  month.\r\n\r\nThese  persons  did not join the  City  Council  to\r\n\r\nreceive additional financial benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are always persons in society belonging to the old school who judge persons by\r\n\r\nthe  education they have received. May I  add  that\r\n\r\nMr Lui Boon Poh's education was up to Standard VIII\r\n\r\nlevel and so is the case with more than half of the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  in  the  P.A.P.?  I  remember   during\r\n\r\nelection  time  that  it  was  the  habit  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties to cast aspersions on candidates\r\n\r\nof my Party saying that they were either barbers or\r\n\r\nhawkers   and   that  they  received  very   little\r\n\r\neducation.   Mr  Speaker,  we  judge  a   person's\r\n\r\nstandard  by  his contribution to society,  by  his\r\n\r\nwillingness to sacrifice and by his devotion  to  a\r\n\r\ncause.  We  do not care how much education  he  has\r\n\r\nreceived or what he was, whether he be a hawker,  a\r\n\r\nsalesman or even a petty trader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mistake which the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  made was to mention that there are at present\r\n\r\ntwo  members on the Telephone Board. There  are  at\r\n\r\npresent  three members on the Board and  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Deputy Prime Minister,  who  is  now  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the Singapore Telephone Board, will  fill\r\n\r\nthe  vacancies very soon. The third member  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard, in addition to Mr Goh Kee Song and Mr  Lui\r\n\r\nBoon Poh, is Mr Tan Siak Kew who has been asked to\r\n\r\nstay on because he also wants business interests to\r\n\r\nbe  represented  on the Singapore Telephone  Board.\r\n\r\nThere  are three persons and the Board has, in  the\r\n\r\nshort  course of two months, done much  to  rectify\r\n\r\ncertain of the anomalies which existed in the past.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the anomalies is that at present there  is\r\n\r\nnot   even  one  local  officer  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board  who has got the Senior  Cambridge\r\n\r\nqualification,  so  that  the  expatriates,   whose\r\n\r\ninterests the Member for Farrer Park has at  heart,\r\n\r\nwill stay on forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not a lawyer and I am not in a position to argue with the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nas  to  whether Mr Goh Kee Song and Mr  Lui  Boon\r\n\r\nPoh,  being  members  of  the  staff  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  come  under  the terminology  of  \"public\r\n\r\nofficers\".  But, Mr Speaker, I rely on  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, Inche Ahmad Ibrahim, and  he  has\r\n\r\nassured the Cabinet that these two persons  do  not\r\n\r\ncome  under  the  definition of the  words  \"public\r\n\r\nofficers\"  as  defined in the  Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.
