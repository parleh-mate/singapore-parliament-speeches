I do not think the hon.\r\n\r\nMember is justified in saying that the debate has\r\n\r\nbeen interrupted unnecessarily. It was quite an\r\n\r\nimportant motion that was debated the whole of\r\n\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat I mean to say is this, that this question of\r\n\r\nmerger is very important and should be clearly\r\n\r\ndecided upon so as to show what kind of phoney\r\n\r\nmerger the P.A.P. is trying to bring about to the\r\n\r\npeople. We in the Barisan Sosialis, especially the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, have indicated at the time\r\n\r\nof moving the amendment that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nalready been exposed in bringing about a phoney\r\n\r\nmerger. Several questions were raised but there was\r\n\r\nno reply whatsoever from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of citizenship after merger and the\r\n\r\nsignificance of the so-called nationality  have  so\r\n\r\nfar  not  been  properly  clarified  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the people of Singapore. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a great deal of unnecessary  issues\r\n\r\nand  side issues on the nationality and citizenship\r\n\r\nproblems  to confuse the vision of the  people.  It\r\n\r\nwas  reported  in  the leading newspapers  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry - the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the Nanyang  Siang\r\n\r\nPau - on the 26th and 27th of November that the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General had stated the distinction between\r\n\r\n\"citizenship\" and \"nationality\". The State Advocate-General  said that according to the merger proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Prime  Minister, the present  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  those  in the Federation  would  be\r\n\r\nequally   considered  as  nationals  of   the   new\r\n\r\nFederation on Merger Day. That is to say, they will\r\n\r\nenjoy equal rights and privileges on Merger Day and\r\n\r\nwill  thereafter  shoulder  equal  obligations  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities without any distinction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  all. Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.A.G.'s explanation\r\n\r\nof  nationality is correct. We can  see  that  this\r\n\r\nquestion of nationality has a meaning only  as  far\r\n\r\nas  foreign countries are concerned, but  from  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper report of the 26th November, we also read\r\n\r\na  statement issued by the Prime Minister's  Office\r\n\r\npinpointing the opinion given by the S.A.G. In this\r\n\r\nstatement,  it is stated that whether a  person  is\r\n\r\ncalled a Federation national or citizen, he has  no\r\n\r\naddition to or subtraction of his rights.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  meaning of the statement issued by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office? I think it is  nothing  but  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the  views  of the  people  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nnationality   and  citizenship.  If   this   merger\r\n\r\narrangement  materialises, I  would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the local citizens in Singapore  would  be\r\n\r\nable to have a common political life with those  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. Would it also mean that  according\r\n\r\nto   the  merger  arrangement  made  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  unemployed  citizens  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be able to get employment in the Federation?\r\n\r\nThere  is another question, that is, after  merger,\r\n\r\nwill  the  Federation  Government  treat  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  without  any  discrimination  whatsoever?\r\n\r\nFrom  this Statement issued by the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice,  we  can  see  that a  citizen  is  usually\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be a person enjoying certain  rights\r\n\r\nwithin  his  own  country,  and  the  question   of\r\n\r\nnationality is only applicable to the status  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  in  the international field. So  from  this\r\n\r\nparagraph  we  can see clearly that  the  so-called\r\n\r\nnationality   is   only   applicable   to   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  this  so-called  equal  status  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  is  only applicable to  our  own  country\r\n\r\nalone.  Therefore,  we can  see  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndistinction  between citizenship  and  nationality.\r\n\r\nThis  distinction  is  not inexplicable.  Then  why\r\n\r\nshould the Prime Minister have to give radio  talks\r\n\r\nand   press   conferences  on   several   occasions\r\n\r\nregarding this question? In spite of all  talks  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, the people of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnot understood what he is trying to drive at. So it\r\n\r\nis  obvious  that our Prime Minister is  not  being\r\n\r\nfrank and honest. He is afraid that the people will\r\n\r\neasily discover that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis merger is a phoney one. Whenever the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas occasion to talk about citizenship and nationality,\r\n\r\nhe  usually  tries to be very evasive and  talks  about\r\n\r\nunimportant  things  in order to cover  up  his  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger which is a sell-out. As a result of this, he has\r\n\r\nhad to give directions to the State Advocate-General to\r\n\r\nprepare  a  statement in regard to the nationality  and\r\n\r\ncitizenship questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the phoney merger arrangement made\r\n\r\nby  the Prime Minister will bring about three different\r\n\r\nclasses  of  citizens.  The  first  are  those  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  who have absolute control in the  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe   second  are  those  Singapore  citizens  who  are\r\n\r\neligible  to  elect  representatives  to  the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament  in  the Federation. The  third  are  those\r\n\r\ncitizens not born in Singapore and are not eligible  to\r\n\r\napply  for  Federal  citizenship.  This  last  type  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  not be able to take  part  in  national\r\n\r\naffairs  although  they  have  to  carry  out  whatever\r\n\r\nresolutions are passed by the Central Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, according to the phoney merger of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, we can see that there is no true merger\r\n\r\nor  a reunification of Singapore with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  As  a  matter of fact, our Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to come to a compromise with the Federation  to\r\n\r\nsell out Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate on merger has\r\n\r\nalready  entered  the 11th day in this  House  and  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Barisan Sosialis, that is, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, has given in his seven-hour speech his\r\n\r\nanalysis of the phoney merger of the P.A.P. leadership.\r\n\r\nAccording to his analysis, this phoney merger is a sell-out of the interests of the people of Singapore.

I  think  they want to try to save  themselves\r\n\r\nfrom  their  precarious position. What will the  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger  of the P.A.P. bring to the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nIt will bring to them the loss of citizenship rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the true merger as proposed by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the  people of the two territories  will  be\r\n\r\nbetter able to enjoy a common political life with equal\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights so that they will be able to have  a\r\n\r\npolitical reunification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain clearly that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is trying to bring about this phoney merger  to\r\n\r\nsave  themselves from their difficult position. We  all\r\n\r\nremember that in 1959, the P.A.P. -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.

Now  they are discarded by the people  because\r\n\r\nthey  have gone against their Party platform  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  disregarded  the  opinion of  the  people.  Their\r\n\r\nnumber  has  been reduced from 43 to 26 in this  House,\r\n\r\nwhich means that they have a majority of only one seat.\r\n\r\nSo  now  nobody can be sure whether any  of  the  Back-Benchers might not come over to this side of the  House\r\n\r\nafter  examining their conscience and listening to  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leadership realise the expansion of the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  forces in both Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore especially, the new socialist forces have\r\n\r\nbecome  quite formidable, so that the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nhave  now  to resort to mean methods to save themselves\r\n\r\nfrom  their  precarious position. They try to  get  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the S.P.A. in this House. They, want to  co-operate  with a Right-wing figure, namely,  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill, so that they can stand together. During\r\n\r\nthe  debate  in this House, they have expressed  almost\r\n\r\nthe  same  views. From this, it is very clear that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  going to the Right. Outside this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthey are making use of the radio and the newspapers  to\r\n\r\ndisseminate fear by branding some persons as Communists\r\n\r\nin  order that the people will not have the guts to  go\r\n\r\nagainst them. They are trying to distract the attention\r\n\r\nof the people so that they can bring about their phoney\r\n\r\nmerger  which  is  a sell-out of the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.  So  they  are  trying  to  save\r\n\r\nthemselves  at  the  expense  of  others.  The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  have even gone to the extent  of  splitting\r\n\r\nunions  and brought politics into the unions. They  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to create suspicion among the races.  They  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to gain the support of the English-educated  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can perpetuate their divide-and-rule policy.\r\n\r\nApart  from  all this, the P.A.P. leadership  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, begged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  assistance from the Federation in  order  to  save\r\n\r\nthemselves from their present predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, the so called phoney merger  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  nothing  but a sort of association  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation  on  the  basis  of   a\r\n\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In the end, the lives\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore will be more difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we want to have a true\r\n\r\nmerger. We in the Barisan Sosialis endorse true merger,\r\n\r\nso  that  Singapore  citizens will be  able  to  become\r\n\r\nautomatically   Federal   citizens    and    so    that\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  can  be elected from  among  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens, the number to be in proportion to the  number\r\n\r\nof  its  citizens. Singapore citizens will be  able  to\r\n\r\nstand  for  election  on  a national  basis,  including\r\n\r\nelection  to  the  Federal  Parliament  and  the  State\r\n\r\nAssembly.  In  this way, there will be a  strong  force\r\n\r\nfrom  the  representatives of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  we will be able to amend unreasonable legislation.\r\n\r\nIn this way also, workers, farmers, businessmen and the\r\n\r\nproduce of Singapore citizens will be enjoying a better\r\n\r\nlife because they have Federal citizenship. And in this\r\n\r\nway  too,  the peoples of the two territories  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  enjoy common citizenship rights  and  lead  a\r\n\r\ncommon political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we want to distinguish between the\r\n\r\nadvantages  and  disadvantages  of  merger.   We   must\r\n\r\nascertain  the opinion of the people whether merger  is\r\n\r\nadvantageous  or  disadvantageous,  and  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nmerger we must have. This question should be decided by\r\n\r\nthe  one man one vote method. Who should represent  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore in the talks on merger between  the\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore? Well, we can have  a  general\r\n\r\nelection to answer this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am in full support of the amendment\r\n\r\ntabled  by  our Party Chairman, who is the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  In  this amendment,  we  want  to  seek  a\r\n\r\ngenuine merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Assembly has been\r\n\r\ndebating  for  over  two  weeks  the  question   of\r\n\r\nsupporting  in  principle the  merger  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories, and the amendment moved by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown. I do not want to  waste  any  more\r\n\r\ntime of the Assembly over the same question, as  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have replied to the criticisms  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Assemblymen. But there are several\r\n\r\npoints  which I feel I must bring out for emphasis.\r\n\r\nThese  points  have  already  been  emphasised   by\r\n\r\nseveral Assemblymen in this House. What are these?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debate began, several speakers have\r\n\r\nstressed that the interests of the people must come\r\n\r\nfirst,  that  we must always listen to the  people,\r\n\r\nand  that  the interests of the Party  should  come\r\n\r\nnext. This is correct, of course. My colleagues and\r\n\r\nI  entirely  agree with this point. And because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the present political situation in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  come about. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say this:\r\n\r\nif  we are not carrying on in the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then our Party will be broken up.  But  we\r\n\r\nare  acting  in  the interests of  the  people  and\r\n\r\ntrying  to  fulfil our promises to them. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  worried about the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nopponent political Parties. This is the essence  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the question of merger was raised, the\r\n\r\npublic  and  newspaper editorials have given  their\r\n\r\nopinions.  They have all said that it is inevitable\r\n\r\nthat  there will finally be merger. It  is  only  a\r\n\r\nquestion of time. The coming of merger is just like\r\n\r\nthe sun rising from the east, and the water flowing\r\n\r\ninto the sea. This is a natural course, and is also\r\n\r\na  natural  law. Nobody can change this course.  If\r\n\r\nanybody wants to cover up this truth by tactics and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring, he is only ignoring the  tide  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  era,  which is impossible. I have  already\r\n\r\npointed out that all this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural law. And so as the sun will, of course,\r\n\r\nrise from the east, it will set when the time\r\n\r\ncomes. That cannot be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since many Assemblymen have\r\n\r\nalready emphasised the importance of the livelihood\r\n\r\nof the people, may I stress further by asking\r\n\r\nwhether merger between Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya is also one of the questions relating to\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of the people of Singapore? In my\r\n\r\nopinion, it is so. It concerns very much the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people. The Assemblymen of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have talked about many things,\r\n\r\namongst them, socialism. May I say that in my view,\r\n\r\nas Singapore is a small island of 225 square miles\r\n\r\nand without natural resources, it will find it\r\n\r\ndifficult to realise socialism by itself? That is\r\n\r\nwhy we have to seek a merger of the two territories\r\n\r\nin order to realise socialism. After the\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories, socialism can\r\n\r\nbe achieved in Singapore. Otherwise, all talks and\r\n\r\nplans are only mere words on paper, and are without\r\n\r\nany effect. The population of Singapore keeps on\r\n\r\nincreasing. Can all these talks help to solve the\r\n\r\nacute problems facing us today in Singapore? We\r\n\r\nfeel we cannot achieve certain aims or realise\r\n\r\ncertain objectives by just delivering empty talks\r\n\r\nor writing thesis. We can only achieve our\r\n\r\nobjectives through concrete work and practical\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out further that it is because we\r\n\r\nstress the importance of placing the interest of\r\n\r\nthe people above the interest of the Party that we\r\n\r\nare not willing to do the things that the Members\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis have done. They are acting\r\n\r\nlike clowns in their attempt to confuse the vision\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to answer also some of the charges made by the Barisan Sosialis. They have stressed several points during these few days. I\r\n\r\nwant, to reply to the charges they have levelled\r\n\r\nagainst us. My colleagues have already given their\r\n\r\nreplies to some of them and there is no need for me\r\n\r\nto repeat them. But I feel it is necessary for me\r\n\r\nto point out some of the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges.  In the course of the debate during these  few\r\n\r\ndays,  they  have repeatedly accused us of selling  out\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the people of Singapore by this  merger.\r\n\r\nLet  us  define the words \"sell-out\". We recognise  the\r\n\r\nfact that the people of Singapore and the people of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  are brothers.  They  have  been\r\n\r\nseparated  for  16 years by artificial means.  How  can\r\n\r\nthis reunification be considered as a kind of sell-out?\r\n\r\nTo sell out means to sell what belongs to us to someone\r\n\r\nelse.  But since the Federation of Malaya is our sister\r\n\r\nState, how can we say that we are selling ourselves  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya? Since the  people  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya are like our brothers, we  are  of\r\n\r\nthe  same family. Therefore, now is the time for us  to\r\n\r\nunite  together. How can an act which brings about  the\r\n\r\nreunification  of the two territories be  termed  as  a\r\n\r\nsell-out?  I hope other Assemblymen in this House  will\r\n\r\ngive a further definition of the word \"sell-out\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to reiterate that at the\r\n\r\ninauguration   of   our   Party   sometime   ago,   the\r\n\r\nreunification  of the two territories was  one  of  our\r\n\r\nobjectives.  We have been working hard  since  then  to\r\n\r\nrealise  this objective. In other words, we  have  been\r\n\r\nworking  hard  to  fulfil the hope  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is also the fulfilment of one  of  our\r\n\r\npromises to the people. The people elected us  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  in the hope that we can bring about a  better\r\n\r\nlife  for  them. As representatives of the  people,  we\r\n\r\nhave to respect their views, wishes and hopes. But when\r\n\r\nwe respect the views and wishes of the people by acting\r\n\r\naccordingly, our friends in the Barisan Sosialis accuse\r\n\r\nus  of  turning Right. If this is their kind of  logic,\r\n\r\nthen  I think the definition of words in the dictionary\r\n\r\nshould be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few days, Assemblymen of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have incessantly accused us of trying to  push\r\n\r\nthrough this merger in order to safeguard our political\r\n\r\nposition.   My   colleagues  and   I   can   say   here\r\n\r\ncategorically  that we do not form the Government  just\r\n\r\nfor our own benefit.

Our  efforts\r\n\r\nand our work are only to benefit the people and to give\r\n\r\nthem  a better life. We are doing all his, and not just\r\n\r\nto  preserve our power as they have been saying. I feel\r\n\r\nthat  they are not interested in the livelihood of  the\r\n\r\npeople. We have been elected as representatives of  the\r\n\r\npeople.

Perhaps the hon. Member does not\r\n\r\nknow  the  meaning  of a point of  order.  That  is  an\r\n\r\nargument.  The Member for Moulmein has not  spoken.  He\r\n\r\nwill have an opportunity of answering that argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just as the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Moulmein  has  said,  as  representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, we are not carrying out our work just to fulfil\r\n\r\nour  own wishes and hopes. Instead, we are working  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of the people and to fulfil their  wishes\r\n\r\nand  hopes. That is why we have spent so much time  and\r\n\r\nenergy  to achieve this aim. During these few  days  of\r\n\r\ndebate,  you  can  read from the  newspapers  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation   in  Singapore,  especially  the   political\r\n\r\nsituation, is fluctuating. There are ups and downs. Why\r\n\r\nis this so? I think we can all understand this. We will\r\n\r\nexert ourselves and try to do whatever we can. That  is\r\n\r\nto  say, we must have a good beginning and we must have\r\n\r\na  good  end.  We  will  carry  on  with  our  work  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the principles in which we believe.  We\r\n\r\nwill not act like our accusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for several days we have been debating the question of citizenship rights without any conclusion. We have all along emphasised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  citizenship. The Barisan Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nadvocating  a  merger  like  that  of  Penang   and\r\n\r\nMalacca.  We have already said - and it is  reported\r\n\r\nin  the  newspapers - that if we were to merge  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya as the twelfth  state  on\r\n\r\nthe   basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca,  then  those\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  who  were  not   born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  have to apply again  for  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. This will be a loss to the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is also unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is a repetition\r\n\r\nof  an  argument  which has been  advanced  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment benchers time and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I was only quoting a very short passage.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is that the Members of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  all  along  said  that the  people  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned with the question of citizenship. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Assembly has been debating this  question\r\n\r\nfor  so many days. This is one of the reasons.  Why\r\n\r\nis there such a heated debate on this question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not want to act like the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  who,  by  their\r\n\r\narguments, have advocated many fanciful  plans.  We\r\n\r\nare  practical.  Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  have been separated for 16 years.  We  must\r\n\r\nnow  seek  the reunification of the two territories\r\n\r\nin order to bring a better life to our people. Only\r\n\r\nthrough  merger  can we bring better  opportunities\r\n\r\nand  better  rights  to the  people  of  these  two\r\n\r\nterritories.  My  colleagues have also  touched  on\r\n\r\nseveral of these points and I do not want to repeat\r\n\r\nthem. But there is one point I want to stress,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is that we have never been conceited or self-complacent. We are practical men. We dare  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  in  a  short  period of a few  years  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the livelihood of the people. We can  only\r\n\r\nsay  that we want to try and achieve that.  But  if\r\n\r\nmerger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the two territories can come sooner, then  this\r\n\r\nwill help greatly towards achieving this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I resolutely oppose the\r\n\r\namendment  moved  by the Member for  Queenstown.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that this amendment is unnecessary and, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out, it is only a sugar-coating which\r\n\r\nhas, in fact, no true meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  important question about the Singapore people\r\n\r\nhas  been  debated for several days. Originally,  I\r\n\r\ndid  not have the intention to participate  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate, but being a representative of the people, I\r\n\r\ncannot shut my mouth on this important issue  about\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. If I do not speak  a  few\r\n\r\nwords,  then  I  will not be doing justice  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have constantly heard of the\r\n\r\nsell-out merger and the genuine merger. I will  try\r\n\r\nin  this  House  to  speak on this  question.  Some\r\n\r\npeople have said that the P.A.P. have sold out  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore. But  one  of\r\n\r\nthem  has said, \"How can the P.A.P. Government sell\r\n\r\nout  the  interests  of  the  people?  If  we  were\r\n\r\nchildren, it might be possible for them to sell us;\r\n\r\nbut  we  are adults, so how can they sell us?\"  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore cannot become Federal citizens\r\n\r\nunder this definition. This can be termed as a sell-out. Singapore has to contribute $90 million to the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. This,  of  course,  can  be\r\n\r\njustly  said to be a sell-out, since we are  giving\r\n\r\nup  our  money to them. From where then can we  get\r\n\r\ntaxes  to  replace this sum? Of course,  the  taxes\r\n\r\nwill  have  to come from the people themselves.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  before merger,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nraised  taxes by 100 per cent. But if after merger,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  to give $90  million  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, then that  means  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore will have to spend more. It\r\n\r\nwill  therefore  have  to increase  taxes.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthere will be a 200 per cent increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The separation of Singapore from Malaya was\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  colonial  masters.  However,  the\r\n\r\nheroic people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  been  resolutely against  colonialism.\r\n\r\nThey have fought for independence and the reunification\r\n\r\nof  the  two territories. The inauguration platform  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in 1954 was able to meet the demands of the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people. Therefore, the P.A.P. was voted\r\n\r\ninto  office  with the support of the people.  However,\r\n\r\nbefore  long,  they  changed their quality,  and  worse\r\n\r\nstill  now, they have given orders, like an emperor  on\r\n\r\nthe  throne, in order to create widespread terror. They\r\n\r\nhave completely forgotten their promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that under colonial\r\n\r\nrule  and  dictatorship, the people  are  oppressed  by\r\n\r\nmilitary  forces and fooled by culture.  The  political\r\n\r\nrights of the people have been exploited. The political\r\n\r\nconcept  of  the governed all over the world  has  been\r\n\r\nraised to a considerable extent. In every corner of the\r\n\r\nworld,  the voices of anti-colonialism have been  heard\r\n\r\nconstantly fighting for freedom and democracy. Now, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership have tried to use a phoney method  to\r\n\r\nreach the objective of selling out the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have noted the Prime Minister's remark that if\r\n\r\nSingapore does not merge with the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nthen the Federation Government will cut off its water\r\n\r\nsupply and Singapore will be finished. Now, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, coming on the heels of the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nremark, have announced that the water level in the\r\n\r\nreservoirs is low and there is not enough water for\r\n\r\nconsumption. They have now imposed water rationing,\r\n\r\ncausing inconvenience to the people. However, during\r\n\r\nthis rainy season, the water level must be quite high\r\n\r\nand yet the Government is still imposing water\r\n\r\nrationing -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are dealing with merger. What\r\n\r\nhas the fact that we have rainfall or no rainfall got\r\n\r\nto do with merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nonly use this point of argument to substantiate the\r\n\r\nfact that the P.A.P. Government is cheating the people.\r\n\r\nJust a short passage -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that short passage is a bit too\r\n\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Well then, I will try\r\n\r\nmy best.

I do not think we should debate\r\n\r\nwater rationing now. Let us go on to the merger\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right then, and\r\n\r\nthank you very much. I will bow to your ruling. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have just said that the P.A.P. are now\r\n\r\ntrying all kinds of tactics and resorting to all kinds\r\n\r\nof means to deceive the people. This is contrary to\r\n\r\ndemocratic progress and the aim of a true merger. The\r\n\r\ncolonialists in Singapore and the general masses have,\r\n\r\nin the past, acquired a three-quarters Merdeka for\r\n\r\nSingapore, but now this three-quarters Merdeka is not\r\n\r\nsufficient to resolve the problems of the people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the people of Singapore will have to\r\n\r\ncontinue with their anti-colonial struggle to realise\r\n\r\nthe reunification of all the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaya. The leadership of the P.A.P. say that since\r\n\r\nthere is no longer colonialism in Singapore, then\r\n\r\neverything can be resolved by this so-called merger\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. But,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, if the merger proposed by the P.A.P. is a\r\n\r\ntrue merger and is wanted by the people in both\r\n\r\nterritories, then, of course, it can be a merger. But\r\n\r\nis this so? The Prime Minister of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya said clearly in the Federal Parliament that what\r\n\r\nhe wanted was not a true merger between Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. Singapore was only accepted\r\n\r\nas a partner and the citizens of Singapore could not\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the Federation. Everybody knows that\r\n\r\nif the citizens are separated, then the people cannot\r\n\r\nbecome one and the country cannot be united. The people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving  in  this divided country and with  separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship will be just like a bird in a cage that\r\n\r\nwill  be manipulated by the master. This is a  true\r\n\r\nfact   which  everybody  can  see  clearly.  People\r\n\r\nwithout citizenship rights cannot do anything.  The\r\n\r\nfundamental principle of merger should be that  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories should be reunited, with the people\r\n\r\nin  the  two territories enjoying equal citizenship\r\n\r\nrights and sharing a common political life. But the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has talked at  length  on  various\r\n\r\nproblems  such as autonomy in labour and education.\r\n\r\nI  would  say that without citizenship  rights  all\r\n\r\nthese autonomies are useless and are only something\r\n\r\nto  deceive  the people. Without true merger,  true\r\n\r\nunification and equal citizenship rights,  all  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the people cannot be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour policy of the P.A.P. is not so very\r\n\r\nprogressive as it is claimed to be. The workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have gained very good working conditions\r\n\r\nthrough  their own efforts and not because  of  the\r\n\r\nwork   of   the   P.A.P.  They  have  gained   very\r\n\r\nadvantageous  working conditions because  of  their\r\n\r\nown  efforts  and  because of the  co-operation  of\r\n\r\ncertain employers. This is not the result of the so-called pro-labour policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see how the P.A.P. is exposed in the\r\n\r\npresent  situation involving students.  This  shows\r\n\r\nthat  its  education policy is not as sound  as  it\r\n\r\nclaims to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merger question brought up by the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nbeing  used  only  as a smokescreen  to  blind  the\r\n\r\nvision  of  the people of Singapore.  Mr  Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, the people of Singapore are not absentminded.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  by-election  in  Anson,  there  was  a\r\n\r\npromise  made  by the P.A.P. that we would  achieve\r\n\r\nindependence through merger. What was  the  result?\r\n\r\nThe  people in Anson lost confidence in the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSo the beautiful promise made by the P.A.P. did not\r\n\r\nget  the support of the people. So the Party  which\r\n\r\nhas  lost  the  confidence of the people  has  been\r\n\r\nshown for what it is, and yet it is still trying to\r\n\r\ncling to power. The P.A.P. Government is trying  to\r\n\r\nplay political tricks to deceive the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  and to influence their political  life.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  the intention of the P.A.P.? If this  is  not\r\n\r\nso,  then  why should the opinion of the people  be\r\n\r\ndisregarded, and why should the P.A.P. try to force\r\n\r\nthrough  a  merger in spite of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\npeople are not in favour of that type of merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government has lost the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the people, then the people have  the\r\n\r\nright to doubt the proposals brought forward by the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  especially in regard to the  proposals\r\n\r\naffecting their livelihood. They will not let these\r\n\r\nproposals pass so easily. They will want to ask for\r\n\r\nan  explanation from the Government, and they  will\r\n\r\nraise criticisms on the question concerned. In  the\r\n\r\nlast  few months, they have been very unhappy about\r\n\r\nthe  talks  going on behind the scenes between  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  and the  Federation.  This  has\r\n\r\nraised doubts in their minds. The details of  these\r\n\r\ntalks concerning merger have not been disclosed and\r\n\r\nmade  public.  In  fact, they should  not  be  kept\r\n\r\nsecret.  The people have a right to know  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen going on. The P.A.P. Government are trying  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the terms of the merger a secret. Maybe  they\r\n\r\nhave  something which they do not want to  disclose\r\n\r\nto  the  people. So the people have every right  to\r\n\r\nsuspect them. Formerly, the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nsold Christmas Island. So the people think that the\r\n\r\nminority in the P.A.P. leadership may be trying  to\r\n\r\nsell  the island of Singapore as well, because they\r\n\r\nare very secretive about things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the course of this\r\n\r\ndebate, we have unmasked the P.A.P. and we can  now\r\n\r\nsee  its true appearance. The doubts and suspicions\r\n\r\nof   the  people  have  been  very  justified.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s promise that we would achieve independence\r\n\r\nthrough  merger has been proved to be  false.  What\r\n\r\nkind of merger is this? Is Singapore to go in as  a\r\n\r\nState  like Sarawak, Borneo and Brunei? These three\r\n\r\nterritories can join the Federation as States,  but\r\n\r\nit  is  not  so in the case of Singapore. Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  considered as a  partner.  Strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking,   this   is   not  compatible   with   an\r\n\r\nindependent  State.  The  P.A.P. merger   is   not\r\n\r\nconducive to the interests of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. In fact, this merger arrangement\r\n\r\nwill place the people of Singapore on an unequal status\r\n\r\nwith  the  people  of  the  Federation,  so  that  true\r\n\r\nindependence for Singapore cannot be achieved. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is trying to make Singapore a satellite  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the question of citizenship is of the\r\n\r\nutmost   importance.  How  should  this   question   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  be solved? The P.A.P. Government  has  not\r\n\r\naid  anything  about  uniting the  people  if  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  in a common citizenship. On the  contrary,\r\n\r\nit  is  trying  to  separate  Singapore  citizens  from\r\n\r\nFederation citizens. It is not trying to get automatic\r\n\r\nFederal   citizenship  rights  tor  the   citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  can  we  say  that  Singapore   is   an\r\n\r\nindependent  State if there are two types  of  citizens\r\n\r\nliving in it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nanyang Siang Pan of 20th July, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   is  reported  to  have  said  at   a   Press\r\n\r\nconference - over  the radio - that the  status  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore may be on an unequal basis  with\r\n\r\nthat  of the citizens of the Federation. He brought  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria  and  France  as examples to  substantiate  his\r\n\r\nstatement.  He said that a person may be a  citizen  of\r\n\r\nAlgeria,  but it does not necessarily mean that  he  is\r\n\r\nalso  a citizen of France. Therefore, he can only  tote\r\n\r\nwithin  Algeria, but if he wants to vote in  France  he\r\n\r\nmust  first apply for French citizenship. This is  what\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  said at a Press  conference  over\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore. We all know that Algeria is a  colony\r\n\r\nof France and that its people are opposing the colonial\r\n\r\nrulers.  They  are  struggling  for  independence.   At\r\n\r\npresent, France has sovereignty over Algeria and it  is\r\n\r\ntrying to keep Algeria as a colony. Therefore, there is\r\n\r\nno question at all that the people in Algeria are on an\r\n\r\nequal  status with those in France. But in the case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  is  trying  to  achieve  independence\r\n\r\nthrough  merger,  there is every reason  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  become  Federal citizens,  otherwise  the\r\n\r\nmerger  is not genuine and the status of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbe likened to that of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgeria.  Now  the  minority in the  P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  agree  that  Singapore  can  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal citizens. So it is up to the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nfight  for  this citizenship right for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th July, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is reported to have said at a Press conference\r\n\r\nthat  if  the Opposition Parties in Singapore  were  in\r\n\r\nfavour of automatic Federal citizenship rights for  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore, he would ask them  to  get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  their Federation friends to speak  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament on this question so that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens can automatically become Federal citizens. You\r\n\r\ncan  see that the Prime Minister has forgotten what  he\r\n\r\npromised  during  the general elections  of  1959.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  he shirk his responsibility when he has already\r\n\r\nmade a promise to fight for the interests of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore?  Why should he give  the  money  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore so easily to the Federation?  From\r\n\r\nthis, we can see that the P.A.P. will do one thing  and\r\n\r\nsay  another  thing. In other words,  their  deeds  and\r\n\r\ntheir  words  are  entirely different.  Now  they  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that the people know that the  question  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is very important and that their rights are\r\n\r\nbeing  sold out. Therefore, they have introduced a  new\r\n\r\nterm \"Federal national\" to console the people. They say\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore citizens will become Federal  nationals\r\n\r\non Merger Day. This method has been employed to explain\r\n\r\naway the non-existence of the equal status between  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  both territories. The use of such  a  legal\r\n\r\nterm to deceive the people is not right. The Federation\r\n\r\nwhen dealing with court cases will treat you as Federal\r\n\r\nnationals,  and you will be punished according  to  the\r\n\r\nlaw because you are Federal nationals. And when you are\r\n\r\ncitizens, you will be treated likewise. In the case  of\r\n\r\npassports, it will be the same. You will have a Federal\r\n\r\npassport  and so you should be proud of it because  you\r\n\r\nare  not  holding a British passport. But you will  see\r\n\r\nthat   this  equal  treatment  is  the  same   in   all\r\n\r\nindependent States. But this is not enough  to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe people. If there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  equal  status  between  the  two  peoples  of  both\r\n\r\nterritories,  then  how is it that  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncannot become Federal citizens after merger? Why should\r\n\r\nthe  Federation disallow Singapore citizens  to  become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens? So from this point we can again  see\r\n\r\nthat this is a phoney merger to deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again we ask: how is it Singapore citizens can only\r\n\r\nvote  in  Singapore and not anywhere in the Federation?\r\n\r\nIf there is equality between the two peoples, how is it\r\n\r\nthat  the  election of representatives will not  be  in\r\n\r\nproportion to the number of citizens? Now we know  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  only  have  15  seats  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.  This  means  that some  200,000  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens will he deprived of their citizenship rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation is the  desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of both territories, and we believe that  broad\r\n\r\nmeasures  in Singapore and the Federation are good  for\r\n\r\nthe people. They can live together like brothers. There\r\n\r\nis  no conflict of interests among them. They can  live\r\n\r\ntogether in an independent State after merger. In  this\r\n\r\nway,  they  will have fuller co-operation and  will  be\r\n\r\nunited  all the more if there is true merger, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  desire of the people. This true merger will  bring\r\n\r\nto  the  people of both territories a reunification  of\r\n\r\nthese territories and common rights, so that the people\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  enjoy political  rights  with  more\r\n\r\nfreedom than the people of any other independent  State\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Party in power should not act against the desire\r\n\r\nof  the  people by depriving them of their  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.  If they should do so, then the people will  be\r\n\r\nall  the  more dissatisfied. If the people are deprived\r\n\r\nof  their  economic  rights, then  they  will  be  more\r\n\r\ndissatisfied.   We  must  try  to   bring   about   the\r\n\r\nreunification of all races in both territories. In this\r\n\r\nway,  we will have greater economic benefits, and there\r\n\r\nwill  be fuller co-operation between the two States  in\r\n\r\nthe  field  of industrialisation, and job opportunities\r\n\r\nwill be created for the people of both territories. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample,  if  there  is  closer  economic  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the two States, then this co-operation will  be\r\n\r\nconducive  to  the interests of both territories.  Only\r\n\r\nthose  who are against the interests of the peoples  of\r\n\r\nboth territories are opposed to a genuine merger. So  I\r\n\r\nam  speaking in support of the amendment to the  motion\r\n\r\ntabled by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, what we have heard in the last two  weeks\r\n\r\nare   nothing  but  slogans,  \"sell-out\",  \"losing  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the people\" and so on and so forth. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to waste the time of the Assembly by  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  this. They have been using all kinds of confusing\r\n\r\nterms to confuse the people. But before I reply to what\r\n\r\nthey  have  said against us, let me tell a Malay  story\r\n\r\nfrom the Sejarah Melayu. The hero in this story is  the\r\n\r\nSultan  of  Malacca  who loved the Princess  of  Gunong\r\n\r\nLedang.  He  asked for her hand, but the princess  said\r\n\r\nthat if the Sultan wanted to marry her, he should build\r\n\r\nfor her a gold and silver bridge from Malacca to Gunong\r\n\r\nLedang,  and to provide seven dishes of the  hearts  of\r\n\r\ncertain  animals, a dish of deer, and  a  bowl  of  the\r\n\r\nblood of Rajah Ahmad, a son of the Sultan. \"If you  can\r\n\r\ndo  all  this, then I promise to marry you.\" I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  even  a seven-year old child will know  that  the\r\n\r\nPrincess  of  Gunong  Ledang  was  not  sincere   about\r\n\r\nmarrying the Sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the lengthy speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown for 7\u00bd hours, and the lengthy speeches made\r\n\r\nby the other Barisan Sosialis Members which were all of\r\n\r\nthe  same content, we know that the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis are just like this  Princess  of\r\n\r\nGunong  Ledang. They are not sincere in seeking  merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the Federation  of  Malaya.  No\r\n\r\nmatter  how  the Member for Queenstown and his  friends\r\n\r\ntalk  of their being in favour of merger, and no matter\r\n\r\nhow  they  play with words to turn our merger  proposal\r\n\r\ninto  a  phoney  merger and a kind  of  sell-out,  they\r\n\r\ncannot cover up their intrigues and real intentions  to\r\n\r\nsabotage merger,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. purposely to advocate a kind of merger  which  is\r\n\r\nnot   in  keeping  with  the  present  conditions   and\r\n\r\nsituation prevailing in the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  everybody will agree that before dealing with  an\r\n\r\nissue  of national importance, disputes between parties\r\n\r\nand  groups of people that cannot be resolved  amicably\r\n\r\nshould  be  resolved and conciliated  through  peaceful\r\n\r\ndiscussions, and an understanding arrived  at.  But  if\r\n\r\nall  the  parties concerned have no real  intention  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem, then the problem cannot be  solved\r\n\r\neven if they continue to talk for days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Barisan Sosialis are not in favour\r\n\r\nof merger. This belief is not groundless. The amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the Member for Queenstown is a good example.\r\n\r\nWho does not like the 630,000 citizens of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the Federation after merger? But the\r\n\r\nraw  fact and objective realities have made us  advance\r\n\r\nour  merger  in accordance with these objective  facts.\r\n\r\nUndeniably the colonial rulers' divide and rule  policy\r\n\r\nhas sown the seed of suspicion among the various races.\r\n\r\nBefore we can thoroughly disperse the suspicious  frame\r\n\r\nof  mind existing in the Malays and Chinese about  each\r\n\r\nother,  if  we  ask  the Federation to  give  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights to Singapore citizens,  and  if  we\r\n\r\nmake  this a pre-condition for merger between  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories, then it is unrealistic. But for  the  sake\r\n\r\nof  the future of Singapore and in the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore,  we  do  not  want  to  advance\r\n\r\nunrealistic conditions for merger. We want  to  discuss\r\n\r\ncalmly and peacefully with the Federation of Malaya  in\r\n\r\norder  to  resolve this question, so  that  the  sister\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore can achieve reunification with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya early. The proposal in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on  merger tabled in this Assembly is  the  most\r\n\r\nproper  and adequate merger proposal under the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis are unreasonable. They do not\r\n\r\nwant  merger  for the following reasons. Firstly,  they\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Malays in the Federation are suspicious\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore. They are, therefore,  now\r\n\r\nputting  in  this amendment to the motion in  order  to\r\n\r\nfrighten  the Malays in the Federation. Secondly,  they\r\n\r\nknow  clearly  that under their so-called true  merger,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  labour  and education policies  and  other\r\n\r\npolicies  will come under the control of the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In spite of the fact that they  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  argue and to persuade the people to  accept\r\n\r\ntheir  true merger proposals, and to hand over autonomy\r\n\r\nin  labour  and education to the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nthey  know  very  well that this cannot  be  done.  The\r\n\r\nleaders  of the Barisan Sosialis know that they  cannot\r\n\r\nconvince the principals, students and their parents  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  education  policy  of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  That is why they have proposed their  kind  of\r\n\r\nmerger, that is, to hand over autonomy in education  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. Is this not a good  example\r\n\r\nto  show  that  they  do not want merger?  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  on  the  one hand, criticise  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Federation as incorrect and wrong.  They\r\n\r\nsay  that  after merger, many Chinese students  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  will  come  to Singapore  to  join  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  here.  This means that they do  recognise  the\r\n\r\nfact  that there is autonomy in education in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut,  on the other hand, they say that in order to seek\r\n\r\ntrue  merger they are willing to hand over autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation to the Federation of Malaya. Is this kind  of\r\n\r\ntalk not contradictory?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13th September, the Member for Queenstown made a\r\n\r\nstatement in the Press asking the P.A.P. Government  to\r\n\r\nstate  whether it agreed with the education  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. I say this is  childish  and\r\n\r\nunnecessary.   If   the  Chinese-educated   people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore could immediately accept the education policy\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya, then there would have been\r\n\r\nno  need  for the Prime Minister to say that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  ask the Federation Government to grant Singapore\r\n\r\nautonomy in education. Now I want to ask the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown if he knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat will happen if the Barisan Sosialis' so-called\r\n\r\nmerger   does  materialise.  First,  if  in  future\r\n\r\nstudents of the 28 Chinese middle Schools  want  to\r\n\r\nsit  for  the  Government common examination,  they\r\n\r\nwill  have to answer the papers either in Malay  or\r\n\r\nin  English. Second, the Chinese middle schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore from Junior I to III or Senior I  to  III\r\n\r\nor  the  present  4:2 system will be  abolished  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  Third,  the Government will  not  be  able\r\n\r\nthereafter  to  use public funds  to  give  aid  to\r\n\r\nChinese   schools  and  to  build  Chinese   middle\r\n\r\nschools.  Fourth, the question of giving assistance\r\n\r\nto  and the development of Nanyang University  will\r\n\r\nbe a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Member for Queenstown and his colleagues\r\n\r\nreally  believe  that  they  have  the  ability  to\r\n\r\npersuade Chinese education circles to accept  these\r\n\r\nconditions?  If they have this great ability,  then\r\n\r\nlet  them describe here what they can do. Let  them\r\n\r\nmove a motion in this Assembly asking the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  accept the education policy  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Resign!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock - they   all  smack  of  the   same   smell.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they would not call upon us to resign. I\r\n\r\nwant to ask the Member for Queenstown, the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, this question.  Does  he\r\n\r\nknow  that the P.A.P. gives equal treatment to  the\r\n\r\nfour  streams  of education, and that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents have a chance to sit for their examination\r\n\r\nin their mother tongue!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the recent incident about the boycotting of\r\n\r\nthe examinations. All the efforts of the Government\r\n\r\nto  promote  equal  treatment for  all  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation  have  been sabotaged by instigators  who\r\n\r\nincited  the  students to boycott the examinations.\r\n\r\nThey  have  accused  the Government  of  trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Chinese education. The events in the  past\r\n\r\nfew  weeks  have proved to us that for the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents  and educators in Singapore to accept  the\r\n\r\neducation policy of the Federation of Malaya is not\r\n\r\nas  easy  as  the  Barisan Sosialis have  imagined.\r\n\r\nTheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews are unrealistic. If autonomy in education  is\r\n\r\nin  the hands of the Federation Government, then it\r\n\r\nwould  not be easy to handle the consequences.  All\r\n\r\nthis  goes to show that the leaders of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are not sincere in their talk. On the  one\r\n\r\nhand, they shout for merger, but on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthey try to sabotage it. On the one hand, they  say\r\n\r\nthey  want  to persuade the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nhand  over  autonomy in education to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment;  but on the other hand,  they  secretly\r\n\r\nincited   the  students  to  boycott   the   common\r\n\r\nexamination, accusing the Government of  trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Chinese education. They have  brought  out\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of  slogans deliberately to  smear  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, saying that the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to destroy Chinese education. Now,  who  is\r\n\r\ndestroying Chinese education? Who has been  trying\r\n\r\nto  hinder  the development of Chinese  education?\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government is not like the governments\r\n\r\nin  many  other countries in South-East Asia  which\r\n\r\nhave closed down many Chinese schools. Instead, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has built many  Chinese  Primary\r\n\r\nand  Secondary schools. It has spent large sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  building Chinese schools, both  Primary  and\r\n\r\nSecondary.  The  Government  is  also  prepared  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Chinese-educated to  go  right  up  to\r\n\r\nuniversity   level.  Does  this   show   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is trying to destroy Chinese education?\r\n\r\nThose  people  who accuse us of this act  can  only\r\n\r\nraise  some  kind of argument which is  groundless.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, they have asked us to let those  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  passed the Junior IV examination  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed to sit for the Senior II examination.  They\r\n\r\nuse  all kinds of unreasonable arguments to  accuse\r\n\r\nthe   Government  of  trying  to  destroy   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the people who drafted this declaration want to rouse suspicions among the various communities. They are really trying to do\r\n\r\nthis  to  achieve their own aim. In our society  in\r\n\r\nMalaya,  if  people try to play up communalism  and\r\n\r\nspark   off  feelings  of  communalism,  then   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  will be disastrous to all  of  us.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  ask  this  question  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown and the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, who claim that they are trying to seek\r\n\r\ncomplete merger. Do they want to hand over autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education  to  the Federation of  Malaya  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  and  thus  abolish  the  giving  of  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to the four streams of education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that if we can\r\n\r\nachieve complete merger, he is willing to hand over\r\n\r\nautonomy  in education and labour to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  May I ask him whether he can  persuade\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese-educated people in Singapore to accept\r\n\r\nthe Rahman Talib Education Report of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya? If he really believes at this stage that\r\n\r\nhe  has that ability, especially after the incident\r\n\r\nof  the  boycott of the examinations, then I  would\r\n\r\nadvise him to see a doctor about his health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown and the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson have argued that the education system in  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories should be unified so as  to  avoid\r\n\r\nits  developing  along two different  lines,  which\r\n\r\nwill have disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all hope that the people of the two\r\n\r\nterritories  can  have a unified education  system.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. But the divide and rule policy  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rulers has separated Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and, as a result, we have  the\r\n\r\npresent  unhealthy  situation  here.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nprevent  these  education systems developing  along\r\n\r\ntwo different lines, we are trying to seek an early\r\n\r\nmerger so as to unify the education systems in  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories through negotiations after merger.\r\n\r\nIf  merger  cannot be realised soon, then Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be isolated under the Greater Malaysia Plan.\r\n\r\nThe   education  systems  in  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya will then be  going  towards\r\n\r\ndifferent  extremes  and  the  people  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories will go along different lines,  further\r\n\r\nand  further away from each other, so that  in  the\r\n\r\nend,  only  by  the  use of  force  can  merger  be\r\n\r\nachieved. This would be disastrous. At present, for\r\n\r\nthe  purposes  of  realising an  early  merger  and\r\n\r\nreunification of the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterritories, we have to resort to practical  plans.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  insist  that the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nshould  accept our education policy, and it is  not\r\n\r\neasy for us to persuade the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  education policy of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  That is why we want to ask the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya to let us have autonomy in education. In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, we have their sympathy and they have\r\n\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the representatives of the Barisan Sosialis have said over and over again that our proposed merger is a sell-out. What do we sell\r\n\r\nout?  Is  it  the citizenship right?  The  624,000\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore will retain their citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.  For  what  are  we  sold  out?  From   the\r\n\r\nimpression  we have gained after all these  events,\r\n\r\nwe  know that the people of Singapore have acquired\r\n\r\ntheir  present  citizenship  rights  through   many\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Now, what they are afraid of is  that\r\n\r\ntheir  acquired citizenship rights  will  be  lost.\r\n\r\nThat  is their only fear. Here, I wish to quote  an\r\n\r\nexcerpt from the Nanyang Siang Pau of the  1st  of\r\n\r\nDecember.  The  Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  at  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  has  agreed to convene a  forum  of  local\r\n\r\norganisations  to discuss the question  of  merger,\r\n\r\nand  they have requested Government t Ministers  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  and, explain  to  them  the  questions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  merger.  The Government  has  agreed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report here, the Directors of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee  of  the  Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  have  all agreed that in  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  have tried very hard and have gone through\r\n\r\nmany  difficulties before they have acquired  their\r\n\r\npresent  citizenship right, and this  right  should\r\n\r\nnot  be endangered. Now, from the speeches by these\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, we gather that what they  fear  is\r\n\r\nthat  the citizenship right, already acquired, will\r\n\r\nbe  lost. If those people who accuse us of  selling\r\n\r\nout were to look at the White Paper on merger, they\r\n\r\nwould  see that after merger, the 624,000  citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  will still retain their  citizenship\r\n\r\nright and they can still take part in elections and\r\n\r\nstand    for   election   in   Singapore   to    be\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   in   the  Singapore   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly or in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Federal Parliament. Is this a sell-out? A sell-out  must mean that you must have something to sell\r\n\r\nout. If you do not sell out anything, how can it be\r\n\r\ntermed  a sell-out? If they do not understand  this\r\n\r\npoint, let them go back to school and start afresh,\r\n\r\nlearning  their lessons there and to look up  their\r\n\r\ndictionaries. The citizenship already acquired will\r\n\r\nbe retained. Now, if this can be termed a sell-out,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  that  those people should  consult  a\r\n\r\ndoctor. The Member for Queenstown has forgotten his\r\n\r\npledge  when he joined the P.A.P. He has signed  an\r\n\r\nagreement that in the case of leaving -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think this is a repetition.\r\n\r\nThis  argument has already been put forward by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment benches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As a man, he\r\n\r\nshould  keep his promise. What do we sell out?  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  have  secured  an  education\r\n\r\npolicy which gives equal treatment to all the  four\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education. The people  have  got  this\r\n\r\nafter going through many difficulties. Now, is this\r\n\r\na  sell-out? If there is a merger on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang and Malacca, then this would truly be a kind\r\n\r\nof  sell-out,  because under it, many  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will lose their citizenship right. If  we\r\n\r\ngo  according  to  the conditions proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,  then  our  policy   of   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to all the four streams of education will\r\n\r\nbe  sold out. If there is anyone who is selling out\r\n\r\nthe people, it must be the Barisan Sosialis. We can\r\n\r\nstill  use four languages to express our  views  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. But if we follow the Barisan Sosialis'\r\n\r\nso-called complete merger, then I believe  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Assemblymen will not be able  to  sit\r\n\r\nhere  again  because they cannot express themselves\r\n\r\neither in English or in the national language.  But\r\n\r\nunder  the P.A.P. proposed merger, the equal status\r\n\r\nof  the four streams of education and the right  to\r\n\r\nexpress oneself in the four languages will still be\r\n\r\npreserved.  Then  how can you  term  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nmerger  a  sell-out? When our merger proposals  are\r\n\r\nrealised,  businessmen and merchants  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan still carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  their business as usual, but under the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  merger, I am afraid many merchants  will\r\n\r\nlose their business. That can then be termed a kind\r\n\r\nof  sell-out. We do not sell out the people. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, we have tried to preserve the fruits of\r\n\r\nthe  people, and we have tried hard to reunify  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories  so that the  people  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  can come closer together as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has raised several points,\r\n\r\nbut because time is rather short and as many of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  already given  their  replies,  I\r\n\r\ntherefore do not propose to waste too much time  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly. Based on the reasons given above,  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  oppose  the  amendment  moved   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Queenstown. In order to  achieve  an\r\n\r\nearly  merger,  we have to recognise the  practical\r\n\r\nobjective  of  reunifying the  people  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past few  days  we\r\n\r\nhave been debating the amendment brought forward by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown. In the course  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate,   we  have  on  many  occasions   got   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  hear  the contradictions  made  by\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government benches. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nthe  motion  moved by the Minister for Health  says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is the true objective of all nationalists\r\n\r\nto  achieve  a  merger between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation. On the other hand, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers in the Government, on the one hand, contend\r\n\r\nthat  only the Communists are afraid of merger  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they are opposing merger.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, they say that those who want a complete\r\n\r\nmerger  are  the communists. On the one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers say that  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation should merge so that Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncan  become Federal nationals. They also  say  that\r\n\r\nFederal   nationals  mean  the  same   as   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens,  so why should they oppose our  amendment\r\n\r\nto the motion? Is it not a contradiction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  advocate a complete and  genuine  merger.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we have been accused of being anti-national.  The  motion of the Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nsays  that it is the true objective of all patriots\r\n\r\nto reunify the two territories of Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation.  On the one hand, the Government  makes\r\n\r\nthe  accusation that we in the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nafraid   of   being  controlled  by   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the event of merger.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it  says that if we hand over our  education\r\n\r\nand  labour  rights to the Central  Government,  it\r\n\r\nwill be bad for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been accused that our demand for equal\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights is only for the interest of  the\r\n\r\nChinese, and that this is a good example of Chinese\r\n\r\nchauvinism. On the other hand, the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  said that in the event of a genuine  merger,\r\n\r\nthe  Bank of China would not be allowed to continue\r\n\r\nits  business here, that is to say, China would not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to continue her trade with Singapore. So\r\n\r\nwho  is  guilty  of Chinese chauvinism?  We  demand\r\n\r\nequal  rights for the citizens of both territories,\r\n\r\nbut  the  Government Members have  a  very  strange\r\n\r\nexplanation  for the term \"equality\". For  example,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bras Basah said that you cannot come\r\n\r\nhere  and  you  cannot go there, and that  this  is\r\n\r\nequality.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we  have  heard\r\n\r\nover  the  last few days speeches which  were  very\r\n\r\nstrange. The logic used was also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery strange. If their logic is accepted, then  the\r\n\r\nonly  reasonable conclusion to be  drawn  is  this.\r\n\r\nThose who claim to be patriots and nationalists may\r\n\r\nwell  be those traitors who are trying to sell  out\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the people. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthose  accused of being anti-nationalist and  anti-patriotic - according to the inference  to  be  drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  the logic of Members of the P.A.P. - can  be\r\n\r\nsaid to be true patriots and nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have  introduced  the  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion  because of necessity. Everyone of us  knows\r\n\r\nthat  Parliament  is the pivot  of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem and that, therefore it should not indulge in\r\n\r\nsaying  things  which are not true. It  should  not\r\n\r\ncall a horse a deer, or a deer a horse. A horse  is\r\n\r\na horse and a deer is a deer. There should never be\r\n\r\na  dispute about that. Now before our clever  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  came to this House to debate the question\r\n\r\nof  merger,  he  talked  a great  deal  over  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  he  was  widely  reported  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers. He tried to tell us that a horse is the\r\n\r\nsame  as  a  deer  because both of them  are  four-legged. He said that the citizens of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbecome   Federal   nationals  and  that   therefore\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens and Federal nationals  mean  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing. If he had not spent a lot of  time  in\r\n\r\ntrying to say that a horse is a deer and a deer  is\r\n\r\na  horse,  that  the constitutional arrangement  is\r\n\r\nactually  a  merger when it is  not  so,  and  that\r\n\r\ncitizens  are nationals when in fact they  are  not\r\n\r\nso,  we  would  not  have  found  it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  our  amendment to the  motion  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision   that  all  Singapore  citizens   should\r\n\r\nautomatically  become Federal  citizens  on  Merger\r\n\r\nDay.  This amendment put forward by us is the means\r\n\r\nto  test  whether the merger is true or  phoney.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  those  in this House  who  are  out  to\r\n\r\nprotect parliamentary democracy should not come  to\r\n\r\ntell lies in this dignified House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

We want to achieve  that\r\n\r\nso  that the people of Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nwill be able to share a common political life after\r\n\r\nmerger.  This  is  the  basic  objective   of   all\r\n\r\nsocialists.  If  the P.A.P. is  a  socialist  Party\r\n\r\nwhich adheres to the principles of socialism, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why they should oppose common citizenship\r\n\r\nrights for the people of the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the rights of\r\n\r\na citizen and those of a Federal national, are they\r\n\r\nthe  same? In this connection, I would like to know\r\n\r\nwhether  the arrangement as contained in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper is a true merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo persons have spoken on this matter. One was the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya,  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman, and the other was the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  our State. In the discussions between these two\r\n\r\npersons,  there  can only be one truth.  The  Tunku\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the present constitutional  arrangement\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two territories is not a merger,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister of Singapore said that it is  a\r\n\r\nmerger.  The  Prime Minister of the Federation  set\r\n\r\ndown   terms  in  a  letter  dated  13th   November\r\n\r\naddressed to the Prime Minister of Singapore  which\r\n\r\nare  very  clear.  In the fourth paragraph  of  his\r\n\r\nletter,  he stated that he had already agreed  that\r\n\r\nall  Singapore citizens would reserve their present\r\n\r\nrights  and become automatic nationals of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation.  In  the  next  paragraph,  the   Tunku\r\n\r\npointed  out clearly that the demand for  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion  of citizenship on merger could  not  be\r\n\r\naccepted in his Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, addressed to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore. This letter proved that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of the Federation was  willing  to\r\n\r\naccept  Singapore  citizens  as  Federal  nationals\r\n\r\nunder  the  Federation constitutional arrangements.\r\n\r\nBut  he did not accept the automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens into Federal citizens.  On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, our Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  repeatedly  informed the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat the definition of \"citizenship\" is the same as\r\n\r\nthat of \"national\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that there\r\n\r\ncan  only be one truth. In the conversation between\r\n\r\nthe   Prime   Ministers  of  the   Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore, there can only be one person who  speaks\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  And everyone of us is aware  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  who speaks the truth is the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government Members and the\r\n\r\nMinisters  criticise us saying that we the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  fight for citizenship rights  because  we\r\n\r\nare  going to stand for election in the Federation.\r\n\r\nThey say that that is wrong because the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have fought for the rights of citizenship\r\n\r\nand  for  participation in the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople since the operation of socialism. We can see\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of reports in the newspapers  recently,\r\n\r\nfighting for the rights of citizenship. As early as\r\n\r\n1947  a group of Singapore merchants initiated this\r\n\r\ntype  of  movement to struggle for  the  rights  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. The right of citizenship is to protect\r\n\r\nthe  right of everybody, participation in political\r\n\r\nlife and the livelihood of the people. How can  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. say that the fight for citizenship is by the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and is only for the interests of a\r\n\r\nfew of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to talk about\r\n\r\nwhether  we can get what we want. Just now  I  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  to  seek the  reunification  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights in the country is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of socialism. In Singapore the  present\r\n\r\nruling  P.A.P. Government has been elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. The P.A.P. Government has  no\r\n\r\nright   to  hand  over  so  many  rights  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government without preserving the rights\r\n\r\nof   the  citizens  of  Singapore  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. Rut the P.A.P. Government,  elected  by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, is not willing  to  fight\r\n\r\nand will not fight for equal citizenship rights for\r\n\r\nthe  citizens of Singapore. Instead, they say  that\r\n\r\nit is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunreasonable to fight for citizenship  rights,  and\r\n\r\nthey  accuse us of trying to confuse the people  by\r\n\r\ndemanding  equal citizenship rights. This  kind  of\r\n\r\nargument by the ruling P.A.P. has angered many. The\r\n\r\nfight  for  citizenship  rights  is  a  matter   of\r\n\r\nprinciple. But whether we are able to achieve  this\r\n\r\nis  not a matter of principle. When we want  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething,   in   addition   to   resolution    and\r\n\r\nwillingness, we have to know how we are going to do\r\n\r\nit, and what strength we have got to achieve it. On\r\n\r\nthe  question  of fighting for citizenship  rights,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of Singapore did not  mobilise\r\n\r\nthe  people. Instead, he went to the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya to play golf by himself alone. Of course, he\r\n\r\ncould not achieve anything by doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We should especially\r\n\r\nnow  fight  for  what  we  should  fight  for.  But\r\n\r\ninstead,  they have not tried to do so.  The  Tunku\r\n\r\nsaid that he was not willing. But he did not say it\r\n\r\ncould not be done. On this question, the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  has quoted the Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya at random, and has  been  misquoting  the Federation laws in trying  to  declare\r\n\r\nthis and that, but in the end the whole thing is in\r\n\r\na mess, and everything is confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the motion by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  is unnecessary  because  the\r\n\r\nsearch   for   the   reunification   of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories, Singapore and the Federation, and  the\r\n\r\navoidance  of their separation have all along  been\r\n\r\nthe objective of Malayan nationalists and patriots.\r\n\r\nIn the platform of the P.A.P., merger is one of the\r\n\r\nobjectives.   In  the  platform  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, merger is also one of the objectives. But\r\n\r\ntoday the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  embarrass  us  by  putting  forward  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  Is it not because we are opposed to  their\r\n\r\nform  of  merger? Therefore, their  motion  include\r\n\r\nsuch  phrases  as  \"patriots\" and \"nationalism\"  in\r\n\r\norder  to  confuse the vision of the  people.  They\r\n\r\nthink  that  if  the  Barisan Sosialis  oppose  the\r\n\r\nmotion  by  the Minister for Labour, it will  prove\r\n\r\nthat the Barisan Sosialis are not patriotic but are\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist. I want to ask: if we  oppose  the\r\n\r\nmotion   by  the  Minister  for  Labour,   are   we\r\n\r\nunpatriotic? Are we not nationalists? I think  that\r\n\r\nis  not  the  correct way to judge. I want  to  ask\r\n\r\nthem: when the Prime Minister of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya said that he did not want merger between the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories, did they say that the  Tunku  was\r\n\r\nnot  patriotic and was not a nationalist for having\r\n\r\nsaid that? From this we can see that whether he  is\r\n\r\npatriotic  or  nationalistic cannot be  decided  by\r\n\r\nwhether he supports the motion of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  For  instance, if the  Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance  support  the motion of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour,  can  they  be  termed  as  patriotic   and\r\n\r\nnationalistic?  Even  now the British  colonialists\r\n\r\nand  rulers  are  not  opposed  to  merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya. Can we then\r\n\r\nsay  that  they  are  also  patriotic  and  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. Government have all along stressed the question of autonomy in labour and education as proposed in the White Paper on merger.\r\n\r\nThey have repeatedly stressed that there should  be\r\n\r\nsuch  a guarantee under the proposed constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement.  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, constitutional safeguards are useless.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is that in the present Constitution of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, it is not stated  that  the\r\n\r\npeople should not have freedom of assembly, speech,\r\n\r\nassociation and travel. The Constitution  does  not\r\n\r\nalso  provide  for  the  deprivation  of  political\r\n\r\nrights  and  citizenship  rights.  But  today  when\r\n\r\ncertain citizens of Singapore wish to travel to the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, permits may be required.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  when the students of Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ntravelled  to the Federation, they were accused  of\r\n\r\ndoing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso   without  first  having  obtained   a   permit.\r\n\r\nEverybody   knows   the   case   of   the   Chinese\r\n\r\neducationist, Mr Lim Leng Geok. He spoke on behalf\r\n\r\nof Chinese education, but in the end he was accused\r\n\r\nof  not being patriotic and loyal to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  My  contention is that  written  safe-guards  in the Constitution cannot bring  peace  to\r\n\r\nthe  people. On the other hand, the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  wants autonomy  in  labour  and\r\n\r\neducation  shows  that it knows that  many  of  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Federation of Malaya, particularly\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  education  and  labour,  cannot  be\r\n\r\naccepted by the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to enumerate a few instances to show that\r\n\r\nthe people do not believe in written safeguards  in\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution.   This  is  because,   firstly,\r\n\r\neverybody knows that the Federation Government  has\r\n\r\nthe right, through the Central Parliament, to amend\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution.  Secondly,  and  this  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant,  the people of Singapore have themselves\r\n\r\nlearnt  from two years' experience that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership are not doing things according  to  what\r\n\r\nthey have promised to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the first Anniversary Souvenir of the P.A.P. the Secretary-General, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, wrote an article on the stand of the P.A.P. In this\r\n\r\narticle,  he says, \"What we want is an independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic   Malaya.\"  Our  political  beliefs   and\r\n\r\nobjectives  can  be achieved through  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means. In a democratic  Malaya,  any\r\n\r\ncitizen,  as long as he is willing, will  have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  persuade the people to form a democratic\r\n\r\nMalaya  or  even  a  Communist Malaya.\"  Today  the\r\n\r\npeople know that the P.A.P. have forgotten what  they\r\n\r\nhave  said. The P.A.P. have all along stressed that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  belong  to  the  Russian  bloc,  the\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. bloc  or the anti-Communist  bloc.  All\r\n\r\nthis  is written in the first. Anniversary Souvenir\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  All  this is what  the  Secretary-General, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said in this Souvenir.\r\n\r\nBut today his stand has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today everyone of us knows that the Tunku is a staunch anti-Communist. Whether or not the Tunku's anti-Communist attitude is correct is another\r\n\r\nmatter.  But  we  know that since the  Tunku  is  anti-Communist, only is he anti-Communist in Malaya, but his\r\n\r\nstand  on  anti-Communism has been extended beyond  the\r\n\r\nshores of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Nanyang Siang Pau of 25th November\r\n\r\nsaid when reporting a Reuter's news item issued on 23rd\r\n\r\nNovember.  It reported the Tunku's answers in  a  Press\r\n\r\nconference when replying to questions put by reporters.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  journalist asked the Tunku whether he  thought\r\n\r\nthat  after the establishment of Malaysia, there  would\r\n\r\nbe  a greater opportunity for him to counter the threat\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  Communists, Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  replied,\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I  think it is correct to say so.\"  In  all  his\r\n\r\ntalks, the Tunku has stressed that his main interest in\r\n\r\nMalaysia was mainly to oppose Communism. I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  criticise the Tunku and say whether he was  correct\r\n\r\nor not in saying such things. But I just want to remind\r\n\r\nthe people that the P.A.P. has changed its stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now want to quote from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nParty  organ  of 7th November, 1958. This is  from  the\r\n\r\neditorial  of  the  21st issue. The  title  is,  \"Anti-Communist,  non-Communist and pro-Communist.\"  It  then\r\n\r\nsays  that to be anti-Communist means to fall into  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  reactionaries. This is  a  useless  and\r\n\r\nnegative   policy.  The  end  would  be  disaster   and\r\n\r\nunfortunate.  This  is to support people  like  Syngman\r\n\r\nRhee and Chiang Kai-shek in their fight against the 600\r\n\r\nmillion  Chinese people. The revolution  in  China  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  greatest event in recent history.  The  most\r\n\r\ninsignificant  thing that can be done  in  Asia  is  to\r\n\r\noppose  this  revolution and to oppose the 600  million\r\n\r\nChinese. That would be a most futile thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore are acting\r\n\r\naccording to their own experience. They fully know that\r\n\r\nwhat the P.A.P. have uttered in so many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords  on  paper  are useless. How can  they  make  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  believe that  once  autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation  and labour is written into the Constitution,\r\n\r\nthis  autonomy will be safeguarded and the people  will\r\n\r\nbe  well assured? This is especially so when, in  their\r\n\r\ntwo  years  of office, the P.A.P. have not carried  out\r\n\r\ntheir  policy  on labour and education,  as  they  have\r\n\r\npromised.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to point  out  once\r\n\r\nmore  that according to the P.A.P. type of merger,  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore cannot have pan-Malayan franchise\r\n\r\nand become citizens of Malaya. Then what is the meaning\r\n\r\nof  this  merger?  According to  the  P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger, the future citizens of Singapore, wishing to be\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the Federation of Malaya,  will  have  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  Five-year  or  ten-year  residential\r\n\r\nqualification.   They  will  be  restricted   by   this\r\n\r\nqualification and limitation. According to the contents\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P.'s White Paper on merger, i.e., after this\r\n\r\nkind of merger is realised, the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  status of Singapore cannot even be compared to the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the Bornean territories before  they  merge\r\n\r\ninto the new Federation. On the question of citizenship\r\n\r\nrights,  the Member for Queenstown and the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson have both given very clear explanations. It  is\r\n\r\nnot necessary for me to reiterate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want now only to reply to several questions which\r\n\r\nthe Ministers and P.A.P. Assemblymen have asked us. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture and the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nhave repeatedly asked us whether we agree to the Rahman\r\n\r\nTalib Report. I want to tell them categorically that it\r\n\r\nis  not  necessary for a citizen of a country to  agree\r\n\r\nentirely with the policies of the ruling Party and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  On this question, we advocate that the citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore should automatically become  citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation on Merger Day. It does not mean that  we\r\n\r\nagree   with   all  the  policies  of  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. The policy of a country is decided  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  other  words, it  depends  on  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.  Whether  or not we agree to the  Rahman  Talib\r\n\r\nReport, we already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplained this very clearly on the 28th of August.  Our\r\n\r\nParty Assemblymen have also quoted what we said on that\r\n\r\nday in regard to these questions. But I want to mention\r\n\r\nit  here once more. From what the P.A.P. Ministers have\r\n\r\nasked  us, we can see that their views are that  anyone\r\n\r\nwho  wants to be a citizen should agree with the policy\r\n\r\nof  the ruling Party. Now, this explains why there  are\r\n\r\nso  many  people in Singapore who have not yet acquired\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights. In fact, there are no provisions in\r\n\r\nthe  constitution of any democratic country to say that\r\n\r\na  citizen  should support the policies of  the  ruling\r\n\r\nParty in order to become citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya have been separated by the British colonialists for 16 years. After this 16 years, the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nhas   a   Right-wing  Government  which  supports   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  But on the other hand,  in  Singapore  we\r\n\r\nhave a Left-wing people who dominate the population and\r\n\r\nwho    support   socialism.   Even   capitalists    and\r\n\r\nreactionaries who want to organise Parties must  do  so\r\n\r\nin the name of socialism in order to get the support of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  So  from these two sets of  circumstances\r\n\r\nexisting in the two territories, we can see that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  great deal of difference. If the present  Right-wing  Government  in  the Federation  does  not  accept\r\n\r\ncomplete   merger   then  that  is  but   natural   and\r\n\r\nunderstandable. But the question is, if the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment is not willing to have complete merger, then\r\n\r\nwe  should, on our part, try to seek other ways of  co-operation  between the two territories.  In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace, the Government should hold meetings with all the\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in Singapore. It should also  consult\r\n\r\nthe people's organisations to seek ways and means of co-operation  between  Singapore and the  Federation.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should by no means try to rush matters  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake of their own power. The Government should not\r\n\r\ntry to hand over the destiny of the people in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  the Right-wing Government in the Federation.  There\r\n\r\nare  many  Members in this House, including Members  in\r\n\r\nthe Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have  said that merger is necessary. It should  be\r\n\r\nsomething  which  has come out of necessity  from  both\r\n\r\nsides.  I will ask them to consult the people and  find\r\n\r\nout  from  them  whether they are  willing  to  have  a\r\n\r\nmerger.  I  have  just  said  that  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  have  two different sets  of  circumstances\r\n\r\nand, therefore,  things  which  are  beneficial   and\r\n\r\nadvantageous to the Federation Government need  not  be\r\n\r\nadvantageous to the people of Singapore. The Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  is a feudalistic and capitalist Government.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  case  of Singapore, the  great  force  is\r\n\r\nsocialism. So in these circumstances, to use  force  to\r\n\r\nrush  through the P.A.P. type of merger will not  bring\r\n\r\nprosperity  and well-being to the country.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which is worth our consideration. The  people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore,   especially   the   Chinese,   support\r\n\r\nsocialism,  but  the ruling clique  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nprefers  the capitalist system. So if we have a  merger\r\n\r\naccording  to  the P.A.P. plan, then  the  question  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism  will become more and more acute.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  P.A.P. has itself said in  a  publication\r\n\r\nduring  the election that the struggle against economic\r\n\r\nexploitation  can  easily be described  as  a  communal\r\n\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have spoken from the Opposition side.\r\n\r\nThey  have  pointed out that according to the  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger proposed by the P.A.P., it is doubtful that  the\r\n\r\nlife of the people in Singapore will improve. This  has\r\n\r\nnot  been denied by the Minister for Finance. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  he cannot even assure us that after merger  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore will be able to enjoy a prosperous\r\n\r\nlife with many employment opportunities. The P.A.P. think\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore are dissatisfied with  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation and so they want to have  merger  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible. But the dissatisfaction of the people\r\n\r\nwith the present situation cannot be resolved by merger\r\n\r\nalone. The dissatisfaction has mainly stemmed from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there is a strong force of colonialists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  years  I  have been a Member of the Government.  I\r\n\r\nknow the difficulties of forming a government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand ruling the country. But the question is whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  when  confronted  with  difficulties,   is\r\n\r\ncourageous enough to face them and tell the people  the\r\n\r\nactual cause of such difficulties. On the contrary, the\r\n\r\nGovernment, instead of doing this, is trying  to  cover\r\n\r\nup  these  difficulties in defence of the colonialists.\r\n\r\nGenerally  speaking, the dissatisfaction of the  people\r\n\r\nhas  come about because the Government is arrogant  and\r\n\r\ndictatorial  in  its  attitude.  Instead  of  examining\r\n\r\nitself for its faults, the Government is trying to  get\r\n\r\nassistance  from  the  Right-wing  Government  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There appears to be something\r\n\r\nwrong   with  the  interpretation.  It  is  not  coming\r\n\r\nthrough. Would the hon.

He must necessarily, through his  words  and\r\n\r\ndeeds,  organise  the  people so that  they  will  come\r\n\r\nforward  and take part in a social reform.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nknows what kind of Party is in power in the Federation.\r\n\r\nIn  an  article written by the Minister for Culture  on\r\n\r\n19th  April, 1959, he stated that the communal  parties\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  were  generally of  the  opinion  that  the\r\n\r\npresent economic system should be maintained. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,   the  P.A.P. want  to  maintain  a  capitalist\r\n\r\nsociety.  If  after merger we still remain a  socialist\r\n\r\nParty, we will continue to fight for the objectives  of\r\n\r\nsocialism  and  we  will still  continue  to  create  a\r\n\r\nsociety  in which there is no exploitation  of  man  by\r\n\r\nman.  If  we  do  all this, it will  be  considered  as\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities.  It will  be  natural  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to say so. The Federation Government  will  not\r\n\r\nlike  to have such a Party and it will not allow people\r\n\r\nto carry out social reforms or overthrow the capitalist\r\n\r\nsystem.

Mr Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\na short while, I will\r\n\r\nbe talking about our stand because, in the course of\r\n\r\nspeeches made by the Ministers of the Government,\r\n\r\naccusations were made against us to the effect that we\r\n\r\nare afraid of being arrested by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. In his speech, the Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\nsaid many, many things about communism, communalism,\r\n\r\nsocialism and nationalism. I will take about one or two\r\n\r\nminutes to explain this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not care whether our actions\r\n\r\nare advantageous or disadvantageous to the Communists.\r\n\r\nOur main aim is to do things which are in the interest\r\n\r\nof the people. The Prime !Minister himself has said\r\n\r\nthat things which are conducive to the interest of the\r\n\r\npeople may also be conducive to the interest of the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Therefore, on this question of merger, we\r\n\r\nare not afraid of being scolded or being called any\r\n\r\nnames by anybody. We want to go about merger in the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people and the socialists. Now the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. says that as the fight for citizenship rights is\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the Communists, we must not pursue it.\r\n\r\nThis is not acceptable to us. The Ministers in the\r\n\r\nGovernment have said that a Communist is only known to\r\n\r\nhimself and his God. Of course, you also have\r\n\r\nintelligence agents who know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to say whether a sell out of Singapore, is not\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the interest's of the people. I think\r\n\r\nthis question can only be answered by the people\r\n\r\nthemselves, apart from God and the P.A.P. itself. We\r\n\r\nhave stated that we are content to have a complete\r\n\r\nmerger even if it may bring frustration to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  socialists. As long as the people  have  equal\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights with those in the Federation, we\r\n\r\nin  the  socialist front are prepared to make  such\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  If  the Federation  Government  cannot\r\n\r\naccept  Singapore  citizens as  Federal  citizens,\r\n\r\nthen we should try to find other ways .and means to\r\n\r\nbring about more co-operation between Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe    Federation,   The   two   territories    are\r\n\r\neconomically  associated and they are complementary\r\n\r\nto  each  other. We do not care about the political\r\n\r\nbeliefs  of  each  Government so long  as  the  co-operation  between the two Governments will  enable\r\n\r\nthe  people  of both territories to find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to bring them closer together. Our contention\r\n\r\nis   that  if  the  Federation  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept complete merger, then  we  can\r\n\r\nhave a form of confederation or .even complete self-government.  I do not see anything wrong  in  this.\r\n\r\nEven  in  complete self-government, foreign affairs\r\n\r\nand the defence of Singapore can be handed over  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Government in  the  Federation.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  all  along  been  in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nexistence of the Internal Security Council  because\r\n\r\nthey   want  to  have  an  excuse  to  shirk  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\npointed out that trade unions and so on should  not\r\n\r\nbe   interfered  with  by  the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil. This explains why the P.A.P. want to  have\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council so that they can have\r\n\r\nan excuse to shirk their responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me show whether the P.A.P. are sincere\r\n\r\ntowards  the Federation Government. It is  a  pity\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister is not in this House today\r\n\r\nfor he will not be able to prove to us that what I\r\n\r\nam  going  to say is false. Before the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto power I had occasion to discuss with the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister the relationship between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation. He told me that the best way  would  be\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore and the Federation to merge so  that\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  would   be   a   local\r\n\r\ngovernment. If that is the case, it would be easier\r\n\r\nfor  the  people to take charge of the  government.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister  also  said  that  if  we  did\r\n\r\nanything good, credit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor it could be claimed by the local government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But if we did anything bad, it could  be\r\n\r\npushed on to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we see that the P.A.P. is stressing and\r\n\r\nrepeating again and again autonomy in education and\r\n\r\nlabour.  This  is only a realisation  of  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  thought at that time.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  said  that the situation  after  merger\r\n\r\nwould  be one in which Singapore will have autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education and labour, that is to say, the  pro-labour  policy  will  be a  credit  to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment and the system of equal treatment of the\r\n\r\nfour language streams will also be a credit to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the arrest of people and the toeing of the\r\n\r\nRight-wing line in the international field and .the\r\n\r\ninability  to improve the livelihood of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  the  blame  could  be  put  on  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  This  is  the true  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger. This intention, in my opinion,  does\r\n\r\nnot  show  the  sincerity  of  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntowards the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has this to say on the present situation in Singapore. The Prime Minister in his analysis had occasion to tell me, before I left the P.A.P., that Singapore could only have three types of situations. The first situation would be one in which the S.P.A. would come in again to take office. The second situation would be one in which the P.A.P. Government continued in\r\n\r\noffice until the constitutional talks in 1963.  The\r\n\r\nthird  situation would be one in which a  Left-wing\r\n\r\nParty  rose to take office. According to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  it this Left-wing Party should  come  in\r\n\r\nand  take  office, it would mean the suspension  of\r\n\r\nthe   constitution  and  chaos  in   our   society.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Prime Minister said that  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nwas in favour of having a Right-wing Government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  since  it would be beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. And if  the  P.A.P. should\r\n\r\ncontinue to hold office so that the status  quo  is\r\n\r\nmaintained,  then nothing harmful would  happen  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. But in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nLeft-wing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment, the result would be the suspension  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitution.   And  this  situation  would   also   be\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous to the Federation Government.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  view  of  the Prime Minister on the  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   He   knows   that   under   the    present\r\n\r\ncircumstances, genuine Left-wing forces are  trying  to\r\n\r\noverthrow  the  P.A.P. Government  and  replace  it  by\r\n\r\npeaceful   means.  He  knows  that  this  is  possible.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he himself feels that there is no evidence\r\n\r\nto  explain that Singapore would be in chaos if a Party\r\n\r\nwhich  is more Left than the P.A.P. should take office.\r\n\r\nSo  the only way he could choose now is to prevent  the\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  forces  from taking over the  place  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the P.A.P. must depend on\r\n\r\nits own strength to maintain its position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was waiting very patiently to hear the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper Serangoon relate all  this  to  the\r\n\r\nmerger  problem.  As I have indicated  earlier  on,  he\r\n\r\nseems  to be arguing against his own amendment.  If  he\r\n\r\nwill come back to his amendment, perhaps we will get\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I feel that what I\r\n\r\nhave said is not irrelevant but explains why the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants to bring up their original motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances as I have mentioned, the only\r\n\r\nway  for the P.A.P. is to contest with Lim Yew Hock for\r\n\r\nthe support of the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. is no longer a Left-wing Party. It\r\n\r\nis  no  longer enjoying the confidence of  the  people.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the motion of the Minister for Labour there\r\n\r\nis  some  mention of colonialists, in actual fact,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is not scolding the colonialists any more.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party Ministers try  to  analyse  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  forces in their speeches. For  example,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister said in Hong Lim Green  on  22nd\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1959,  at  a  mass rally,  that  behind  the\r\n\r\nSingapore People's Alliance, there were three types  of\r\n\r\nforces. The first force was the compradores in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal  banks.  The  second force lies  in  Britain  and\r\n\r\nAmerica,  who  are supporting Lim Yew Hock.  The  third\r\n\r\nforce  lies  in  the Ministers of the  Federation,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the Education Minister,. Inche Johari.

The Minister for Finance says that our amendment\r\n\r\nto  the  motion has been brought up in order to  create\r\n\r\ntrouble  and  confusion among the people. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture even goes to the extent of saying angrily,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  you must be careful. The locomotive of  history\r\n\r\nwill  come  and run over you.\" Why should  they  be  so\r\n\r\nangry? Well, this reminds me of a story written by Hans\r\n\r\nAnderson  of Denmark. The story is entitled,  \"The  new\r\n\r\ncloak  of  the Emperor.\" I do not wish to  relate  this\r\n\r\nstory  at  length. But I would suggest to the Ministers\r\n\r\nthat they go and buy a copy each of this book published\r\n\r\nby the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOxford  University  Press  in London,  entitled  \"Fairy\r\n\r\nTales  by Hans Anderson\".

When a boy pointed out\r\n\r\nto  him that he was actually wearing a cloak which  was\r\n\r\nnon-existent, he became very angry. Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill  tell  you this. Many students in Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nknow  this fact very well. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  you will allow me to relate  this  story\r\n\r\nbriefly  because the Minister for Finance seems  to  be\r\n\r\nchallenging me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Let us get on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  already  said that the Minister for  Culture  has\r\n\r\nemphasised that merger is inevitable. He said that  the\r\n\r\nlocomotive  of history might run over us.  I  ask  him,\r\n\r\n\"What is this locomotive of history?\" Is it the P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nNo.  Is  it the Federation Government? I will say  \"No\"\r\n\r\nagain.  The locomotive of merger is to be found in  the\r\n\r\nforces of those who are anti-colonialist. The so-called\r\n\r\nGreater  Malaysia and the so-called merger between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore will  chart  the  course  of\r\n\r\nevents  very clearly. Merger is inevitable because  the\r\n\r\nforces of anti-colonialists are constantly expanding in\r\n\r\nthese territories. This is not only so in Singapore but\r\n\r\nalso  in  the whole of South-East Asia. We can even  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  this  and  say  that  anti-colonialism  extends\r\n\r\nthroughout the whole world. The anti-colonialist forces\r\n\r\nare expanding. They are the locomotives of history. You\r\n\r\ncan  see  this anti-colonial struggle in the Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.   If   the  P.A.P. are  no   longer   anti-colonialist, then it is they who will be  run  over  by\r\n\r\nthe locomotive of history. The locomotive of history is\r\n\r\nrunning  very  fast.

The Government\r\n\r\nhave  used  the  term \"national\" to  explain  away  the\r\n\r\ndifference between \"citizenship\" and \"nationality\".  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  intention will  not  be  successful.  We\r\n\r\nresolutely oppose the White Paper on merger proposed by\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  We  oppose  this  even   though   it\r\n\r\nstipulates that Singapore will have autonomy in  labour\r\n\r\nand  education. We should think in terms  of  long-term\r\n\r\nobjectives and interests. This is better than  what  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged in the Government's White Paper and certainly\r\n\r\nmore  beneficial to the people. The Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nis  asking the Assembly to support the motion.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe  platforms  of  the United People's  Party  is  the\r\n\r\nconcepts   of   merger  between  the  two  territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we believe that merger should be  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger.   But   the   constitutional  arrangements   as\r\n\r\nenvisaged in the White Paper are not conducive to  that\r\n\r\naim.  The  motion is contradictory to what is contained\r\n\r\nin  the  White  Paper. If we accept  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour's   motion,  we  will  be  opposing  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  proposal,  because under  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nthere will be two kinds of citizenship. Therefore,  our\r\n\r\nstand is to accept the principle of merger as contained\r\n\r\nin  the  motion  by  the Minister for  Labour,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   accept  the  amendment  by   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, as we have accepted it, because merger  means\r\n\r\nequal  citizenship rights. These are not contradictory.\r\n\r\nWhen   we   consider  the  amendment  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  we  feel that the White Paper by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  will be more acceptable after the  amendment,\r\n\r\nbecause there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  two kinds of citizenship  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.

Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis generally accepted in countries which are pledged to\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  form of parliamentary government  that\r\n\r\nthe  main  function of the Opposition is to oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That  is  the reason  why  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nexists.  Even  in  the older established  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracies  like England, occasions have  arisen  when\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  has felt that it is not  its  duty  to\r\n\r\noppose the Government but to support it. Such occasions\r\n\r\nare  those  which concern the safety of the State,  the\r\n\r\npeople  as a whole, and the country at large.  That  is\r\n\r\nso,  Mr  Speaker,  even in the older  countries  where\r\n\r\nsocieties  are stable, and where religious differences,\r\n\r\nracial  differences  and  the little  annoyances  which\r\n\r\ncreate  trouble  in democratic institutions  have  been\r\n\r\neliminated. In a young and small country such as  ours,\r\n\r\nwhich has set its destiny purposely and avowedly on the\r\n\r\nparliamentary   road,  and  where  we   have   not   an\r\n\r\nestablished society in the sense that society at  large\r\n\r\nthinks  coherently as one interest,  it  is  even  more\r\n\r\nvital  and more urgent, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  certain\r\n\r\nareas of government should not be purely party matters.\r\n\r\nSo  far  as  I  am concerned personally, I have  always\r\n\r\nadvocated that there are certain areas of government in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  are  not party matters  but  national\r\n\r\nmatters.  It is not only the concern of the Government,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  also  the concern of the  Opposition  that\r\n\r\nwhatever   political   creed  or   whatever   political\r\n\r\nphilosophy we may have, there is one common  ground  on\r\n\r\nwhich all Parties must meet, and that is he advancement\r\n\r\nand the betterment of our country. I think the question\r\n\r\nof  merger,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is one such  subject.  I\r\n\r\nspeak  not  as a member of my Party nor as a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  as  a Member of this House, which  necessity\r\n\r\nmust  be  interested in the ultimate  destiny  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry and its place in Asian history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was privileged to take part in that historic forum where I think the Minister for Finance spoke for the Government; the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nspoke for the Barisan Sosialis; the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nspoke  for  the United People's Party; and  I  for  the\r\n\r\nAlliance. Sir, in respect of one of the questions  that\r\n\r\nwas posed to the forum, I advocated that the Government\r\n\r\nshould call a round-table conference on the question of\r\n\r\nmerger.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it was not my intention  to\r\n\r\nembarrass  the  Government  by  calling  a  round-table\r\n\r\nconference. But I honestly and sincerely felt then, and\r\n\r\nI  do feel now, that merger is not a P.A.P. matter.  It\r\n\r\nis not a party matter. It is a matter that concerns the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., as well as the Alliance, the Workers' Party  or\r\n\r\nany  other political Party in Singapore. That is how  I\r\n\r\nfelt  then,  Mr Speaker, Sir, and that is how  I  feel\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Order Paper, Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  this  motion which was proposed on  the  20th  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  1961, since when, as you so often have  said\r\n\r\nat  every sitting of this Assembly - meaning the 21st  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  1961 - an amendment was proposed thereto.  We\r\n\r\nare still on the amendment, and with some luck we might\r\n\r\nget  through with it this evening. And for this, I hold\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister entirely to blame. If he had adopted\r\n\r\nan  entirely  different attitude  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger, and had posed this whole problem to the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  without giving a party slant  to  it,  I\r\n\r\nventure  to  suggest to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  all\r\n\r\nearnestness  and seriousness, that we  might  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  debating the amendment 11 days after it has  been\r\n\r\nmoved,  and I think a lot of the acrimonious discussion\r\n\r\nthat  has gone on in this Chamber could well have  been\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have accused the Government of\r\n\r\nsalvaging  its  bankrupt fortunes by  trying  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout a merger. The position, in reality, is this: that\r\n\r\nall  the  Parties - the Singapore People's Alliance,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand every single Party that contested the elections  in\r\n\r\nthe year 1959 - accepted merger as the ultimate political\r\n\r\nsolution  for  Singapore. So we are  all  committed  to\r\n\r\nmerger,  now, tomorrow or in the future, and  the  only\r\n\r\nthing  that  kept us away from merger  was  whether  we\r\n\r\ncould get merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether we could get merger, it\r\n\r\ndepended on how readily the Federation Government would\r\n\r\nreact  to  any suggestion of merger from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. It has so happened that up till sometime in\r\n\r\nMay  1961,  the  Federation Government had  steadfastly\r\n\r\nrefused to discuss the question of merger, and it  only\r\n\r\nbecame  possible  to  discuss it  when  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, speaking through the Prime Minister of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  Tunku Abdul Rahman, made  an  announcement\r\n\r\nthat he thought that the time was opportune. I think it\r\n\r\nwas  the leader of the Barisan Sosialis who asked  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the House, directed at the Government - why\r\n\r\nwas  it that the Tunku, who had so steadfastly set  his\r\n\r\nface  against a merger, should, on the face of  it,  so\r\n\r\nsuddenly  appear to change his mind? Not only  did  the\r\n\r\nleader  of the Barisan Sosialis ask this question,  but\r\n\r\nvarious  Members  from the Barisan Sosialis  side  also\r\n\r\nasked  the  Government that. But  no  answer  has  been\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may  conjecture  a\r\n\r\nreason for it. The Barisan Sosialis have suggested that\r\n\r\nthe  real  reason  why  the Federation  Government  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  a  merger at this stage is that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore has been shooting a line  to  the\r\n\r\nTunku  about  Communists  in Singapore  and  about  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, and has so worked up the Tunku  that\r\n\r\nhe  has  got frightened and thought it better  to  have\r\n\r\nmerger now. That is the line the Barisan Sosialis  take\r\n\r\non the question why the Tunku has agreed to a merger. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  agree  with  that line  at  all.  That  rather\r\n\r\npresupposes that the Tunku does not know what is  going\r\n\r\non  in  Singapore. I venture to suggest to the  Members\r\n\r\nbehind me that the Tunku is very well informed of  what\r\n\r\nis going on in Singapore. With due respect to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - and I hope he does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  take offence - perhaps the Tunku is as equally  well\r\n\r\ninformed of what is going on in Singapore as the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I\r\n\r\ndo not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Tunku was sold\r\n\r\na  pup  by  the Singapore Prime Minister. He  knew  the\r\n\r\nsituation and he knew that he had to act. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, with great respect to the Member for Cairnhill,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe the Tunku would agree to  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  merely because the Member for Cairn-hill  is\r\n\r\nhis good friend. Histories of countries and nations are\r\n\r\nnot  decided  on  this basis - \"He  is  my  good  friend.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I will give him what he wants.\" If that were\r\n\r\nthe  basis  for any sort of merger, we might  have  had\r\n\r\nmerger three or four years ago. But we did not have it.\r\n\r\nSo what then is the reason for the sudden volte-face of\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku? Some reason must be forthcoming. I  venture\r\n\r\nto  suggest one reason. Whether it is a correct one  or\r\n\r\njust  a conjecture or a fairy tale I do not know. Since\r\n\r\nall  of  us are indulging in fairy tales, perhaps,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, you might allow me one little fairy tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Federation was set up and Singapore was\r\n\r\nsplit from the Federation, it suited the purpose of the\r\n\r\nBritish  and  the  Federation  Government  to  separate\r\n\r\nSingapore. That was the only reason that kept us apart.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Federation had wanted us then and the  British\r\n\r\nhad  wanted to keep us, I think we would have  gone  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The real reason why we were  separated\r\n\r\nwas  that the Federation then thought Singapore  should\r\n\r\nbe kept apart, and this also happened to tally with the\r\n\r\nBritish desire to keep Singapore as a Colony. That  was\r\n\r\nabout  15 or 16 years ago. History has moved very  fast\r\n\r\nin   this  region.  Although  Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  at  the back like to flog the dead  horse  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism, it is well and truly dead today. Not  even\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis can revive it, however much  they\r\n\r\ntry.  It  is well and truly dead, and the British  know\r\n\r\nit.  The  British  are  smart, much  smarter  than  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. The British know that  the  days  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism are dead and gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the little fairy story that\r\n\r\nI  want to tell you; that the British have gone to  the\r\n\r\nTunku  and told him, \"Look, Mr Prime Minister, we  are\r\n\r\nclearing  out  of Singapore, and that is  God's  truth.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is going to be your baby. You have  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  it.\"  Well, the Tunku is a responsible  man.  He\r\n\r\nknows that if the toenail is infected, the poison  will\r\n\r\nsoon  travel to the heart and the brain. He has got  to\r\n\r\ndo  something  about it. It is not a  question  of  the\r\n\r\nTunku  wanting to help Singapore and Singapore  wanting\r\n\r\nto  help  the  Federation. It is a question  of  mutual\r\n\r\nnecessity.  I  have always maintained  the  proposition\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation  must sooner  or  later  take  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is not today that I am saying this but  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  this on every single occasion  and  at  any\r\n\r\nsingle  opportunity that I have had of  ventilating  my\r\n\r\nviews on this. I have always said so. I took this  line\r\n\r\nat   the  C.P.A.  Conference  here  when  I  told   the\r\n\r\nFederation representatives, \"You will have to  take  us\r\n\r\nin  whether you like it or not.\" And they have to  take\r\n\r\nus  in. There is no question of anybody being sold  to\r\n\r\nsomebody.  It  is a question that our mutual  interests\r\n\r\nhave  to bring us together. Our economic interests  are\r\n\r\nsuch  that  we have to join up with the Federation  and\r\n\r\ntheir  political interests are such that they  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  us  in.  It  is  our good fortune  that  on  this\r\n\r\nparticular  occasion, our interests meet  and  coincide\r\n\r\nand there is a mutual desire to come together, and that\r\n\r\nis  why we have come together. It is not a question  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister of Singapore selling a line to  the\r\n\r\nTunku,  that  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  at  it;  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is ridden with Communists, and all that  sort\r\n\r\nof thing; because, on that, the Tunku is much more well\r\n\r\ninformed than are the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, if you will forgive me, I want to tell\r\n\r\nanother  little fairy story before I wind  up  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject of fairy stories. Sir, we have heard about  the\r\n\r\ninternecine quarrels among the P.A.P. These  have  been\r\n\r\ngoing on since the Government took power in June\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1959,  up  to the time they openly parted company.  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong and the Prime Minister were  lying  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  bed - uneasy bed-fellows. But they would  have\r\n\r\ncontinued to remain uneasy bed-fellows quarrelling with\r\n\r\neach  other.  The person who parted them, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir - and  this is the fairy tale - is the Tunku himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tunku made the announcement that merger was  a\r\n\r\npossibility,  then  it was that the bed-fellows  parted\r\n\r\ncompany.  That  was  the point of time  when  the  open\r\n\r\ndifferences of the P.A.P. came about. That was the time\r\n\r\nwhen  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong, the ex-Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah,  decided  that he could not carry  on  with  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, and the Prime Minister knew that he was\r\n\r\ngetting  the better of Mr Lim Ching Siong. As soon  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation  announced  a\r\n\r\nmerger,  they parted company. That, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  my  second fairy story - and I did not get that  from\r\n\r\nHans Anderson's Fairy Tales!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think it was the Member for Anson who used be phrase \"a political amendment\", and by a political amendment, I think he meant an amendment not\r\n\r\nreally  mean what it said on the face of it. My quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  the motion and with the amendment is this - and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the difficulty, and that is why we  have  had\r\n\r\nthis  12-day  debate in this House - that the  Government\r\n\r\nwas trying to get the better of the Barisan Sosialis by\r\n\r\nthis motion. The Government said, \"We will propose this\r\n\r\nmotion  and we will see how the Barisan Sosialis  react\r\n\r\nto  it.\"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I blame the Government  for\r\n\r\nthis.  As  I  have  indicated  previously,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue.  This is not a little  party  struggle\r\n\r\nacross this table here. The interests involved are  too\r\n\r\nvital, too urgent and too important for the survival of\r\n\r\nthis little island of ours for this issue to be made  a\r\n\r\nparty struggle and for the Prime Minister to score over\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis. The Barisan Sosialis reacted  as\r\n\r\nhumans would. They said, \"If you are trying to get  the\r\n\r\nbetter of us, we will try and get one better over you.\"\r\n\r\nThey have proposed an amendment which is even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  deplorable than the motion itself. Because  I  am\r\n\r\nconvinced in my own mind that the Barisan Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nnot  politically such children as they make  themselves\r\n\r\nout  to be. If you are trying to negotiate with another\r\n\r\ncountry  about  merging with them, you, as  responsible\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  country, know exactly  what  would  be\r\n\r\nacceptable to the other side. You know what  the  fears\r\n\r\nof  the  other side are. If you are really sincere  and\r\n\r\nhonest  in  your  desire to come to them,  you  do  not\r\n\r\nkindle  those  fears to get some sort of understanding.\r\n\r\nYou try and play those fears down. After having secured\r\n\r\nan   agreement,   you   then  try   to   revive   these\r\n\r\ncontroversial issues, and try to quench the fears which\r\n\r\nthe  other side has. Whether those fears are reasonable\r\n\r\nor not is not the point at the moment. But the point at\r\n\r\nthe moment is that those fears do exist and we have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  them as fears, whether or not  we  are  true\r\n\r\nsocialists,  as the Member for Thomson  has  said.  The\r\n\r\ndifficulty of the Member for Thomson, in my  own  view,\r\n\r\nis  this.  He  is  an earnest young  socialist.  As  an\r\n\r\nearnest  young socialist, he thinks that  human  beings\r\n\r\nshould  behave in a certain way. The government of  the\r\n\r\nworld should be carried out in a certain way. If it  is\r\n\r\nnot carried out in a certain way, then he blows up. But\r\n\r\nthat  is  not how life is lived. We have to accommodate\r\n\r\nourselves  to  other points of view. If the  Federation\r\n\r\nthinks in a certain way and if we do not agree with  it\r\n\r\nand if we have to come back to the Federation, then  we\r\n\r\nhave  to readjust our way of thinking, our way of life,\r\n\r\nand even our political institutions maybe, in order  to\r\n\r\naccommodate them. After merger and using the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess, we can help to rectify any errors and  try  to\r\n\r\ndilute  some  of the difficulties which, in  our  view,\r\n\r\nexist over there. This is the way and that is the  time\r\n\r\nto do it. But while going to the Federation and saying,\r\n\r\n\"We  want a merger, we want reunification, we  want  to\r\n\r\ncome  back to our brothers,\" we yet say, \"Oh,  we  will\r\n\r\nonly  come  back  if a, b, c and d are  given  to  us,\"\r\n\r\nknowing full well that it was a, b, c and d which  kept\r\n\r\nus  apart  from  1945  up to now.  Therefore,  to  that\r\n\r\nextent, I consider this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment a political amendment, and I am confirmed  in\r\n\r\nthis  view  by what I have read in a Press  statement - I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is called The Wartawan - published in November\r\n\r\n1961 - where a number of political Parties were asked  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  their  views.  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis, was asked to\r\n\r\ncontribute and he did so - and what an excellent article\r\n\r\nit  is.  I  intend  to  use it today.  In  one  of  the\r\n\r\nparagraphs, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It has now become obvious that only the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  want merger while the Federation  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want  merger. For merger to materialise, it\r\n\r\nmust have the consent of both parties.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is what I thought and that is what Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  thought. But listening to the debate  on  either\r\n\r\nside,  between  the Barisan Sosialis  and  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\napparently the consent of both sides does not matter. I\r\n\r\nwill read on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved at this juncture.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I will read it again, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved at this juncture.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am informed - I am subject to correction here -  that\r\n\r\nalthough  the  paper was dated November  1961,  it  was\r\n\r\npublished for reading before 31st October, 1961. I make\r\n\r\na  point  of the date because this motion was moved  on\r\n\r\n20th  November,  1961,  and the amendment  thereto  was\r\n\r\nmoved  on 21st November, 1961. When this amendment  was\r\n\r\nmoved by the Barisan Sosialis, the Secretary-General of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, who, I take it, is to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  today  what  the Prime Minister  was  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party in 1959 and is the mouthpiece  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party, adumbrating the policies of the Party,  the\r\n\r\nhopes  and fears of the Party, and the person who  puts\r\n\r\nout  analyses of the situation - political,  economic  or\r\n\r\notherwise - as  seen by the Party. The analysis  then  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation on 31st October, 1961, from the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, was this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved at this juncture.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs  it a correct analysis. If it is a correct analysis,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the point and purpose of this amendment?  What\r\n\r\ngame is the Barisan Sosialis playing? Is it to make the\r\n\r\napproach so difficult that the answer must be  a  \"No\".\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I am fortified in  that  suggestion\r\n\r\nbecause,  in  the speech by the Member for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nnot  only  did  he say that he wanted all  the  640,000\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens to become automatically  registered\r\n\r\nas  Federal citizens and Singapore to come  in  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth State, but he made this further very astounding\r\n\r\nstatement  which rather surprised me - I am  subject  to\r\n\r\ncorrection   if   I  misunderstood   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - \"I  want  it written into  the  Constitution\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  not be possible to have  any  of  these\r\n\r\npersons deregistered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> For political\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, political reasons maybe\r\n\r\nor  economic reasons, but what I am suggesting  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown is that this is not the  way  to\r\n\r\nget a merger of any sort, be it phoney or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

'That  is\r\n\r\nthe  point  and purpose of this amendment. Here  again,\r\n\r\nmay I quote the mouthpiece of the Barisan Sosialis -\r\n\r\nthe  super-analyst of the present political  situation?\r\n\r\nOn page 3, column 2, about midway down, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Tunku, in discussing his present views on\r\n\r\nmerger,  stated that because of the differences arising\r\n\r\nfrom  separate policies, complete merger at the present\r\n\r\nmoment  would  cause some degree of uneasiness  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the  people of both territories.  He  stated\r\n\r\nagain.  \"But one thing is certain and that is we cannot\r\n\r\ntake  Singapore  with us in complete merger  without  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of unhappiness and trouble.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the Barisan Sosialis know all this. They know  that\r\n\r\nunhappiness  will be caused there and I  am  sure  they\r\n\r\nalso  know  that unhappiness will be caused here  in  a\r\n\r\ncomplete merger. And yet we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  had  it  for  ten days now, \"We want  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  This  is the only way to make  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  happy  and our brothers  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nhappy.\" Now which is the honest statement, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI ask you?

Therefore, our duty  is  to\r\n\r\nthink  of  the  next  step which  will  bring  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories together, because the longer we delay until\r\n\r\nideal conditions arrive, the more difficult it is going\r\n\r\nto  become.

He\r\n\r\nsays,  \" We must take a step forward,\" and I think,  in\r\n\r\nmy   own  view,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals are a step forward. Where the Government  has\r\n\r\ngone  wrong, I blame the Prime Minister. He is  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  I  repeat  it again,  \"I  blame  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\"  Because he has insisted that his  proposals\r\n\r\nare  a  merger and nothing short of a merger, confusion\r\n\r\nhas arisen in Singapore not only amongst the people but\r\n\r\neven amongst enlightened people - people like the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. They cannot understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one conception of a merger in the political\r\n\r\nsense   is  this.  When  two  parties -  A  and  B - come\r\n\r\ntogether,  A  loses its identity in B or  B  loses  its\r\n\r\nidentity in A, or the two of them get so mixed  and  so\r\n\r\nfused that a new identity of C is created. That is what\r\n\r\none normally understands by a merger. If only the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had  told  the people  of  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious radio talks and Press conferences that  he  has\r\n\r\nhad,   \"This   is  not  a  merger.  This   is   not   a\r\n\r\nconfederation.  This  is  a constitutional  arrangement\r\n\r\nbetween the Federation and ourselves. This is the  only\r\n\r\npossible thing which can be achieved at the moment  and\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help  dampen down the  fears  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  and  bring  the  two  territories   closer\r\n\r\ntogether,\" in the hope that the fears which  now  exist\r\n\r\nin  the minds pf the peoples of the two countries would\r\n\r\nbe  dampened  down,  I think a lot of  the  acrimonious\r\n\r\ndebate - may   I  repeat  that  phrase  for   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's benefit - a lot of the acrimonious debate -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You believe\r\n\r\nthey will agree by changing the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> A lot of the acrimonious debate -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I, on a point of\r\n\r\nexplanation, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But I thought that my interjection might  help\r\n\r\nto enliven matters.

Sir,If only  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had  said all that, a lot of the  fire  would\r\n\r\nhave been taken out of the Barisan Sosialis, the matter\r\n\r\nwould   then   have  been  looked  at  in  its   proper\r\n\r\nperspective, and we would have been able to discuss  it\r\n\r\nwithout  the acrimony that there was in it. Because  it\r\n\r\nseems  the  Prime  Minister has provided  material  for\r\n\r\nargument  on the other side - \"This is not  a  merger  .\r\n\r\nThis  is  not a merger, and therefore I will  not  have\r\n\r\nanything  to  do with it.\" That is the line  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen taking all this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Answer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is the line they have been taking.\r\n\r\n\"If  it  is a merger, then all Singapore citizens  must\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens.

Therefore, I do  not  agree  with  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I move the amendment, which is the best sort\r\n\r\nof  merger.\" That is the line we have had all the time,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir. It is as simple as that. And we have\r\n\r\nbeen listening to it for 12 days!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in this. Inche Boestamam has said, \"There  are\r\n\r\nthree alternatives for Singapore. One is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger, the other is a confederation, and the third  is\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to  remain a Colony with  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council abolished and the British remaining in\r\n\r\ncharge of foreign affairs and defence: Might I ask  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis: if they are really keen on a  merger\r\n\r\nor  a confederation with the Federation of Malaya,  how\r\n\r\ncan   they,   in   any  honesty,  suggest   the   third\r\n\r\nproposition? They know what the fear of the  Tunku  is.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a  personal  fear. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,It\r\n\r\nreflects  the feelings of the people of the Federation.\r\n\r\nIf  we  say, \"We want a merger because we want  to  get\r\n\r\nback  to our kith and kin\", to whom apparently we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sold out - Mr Speaker, Sir, we are being sold\r\n\r\nout  to  our  kith and kin in the Federation,  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  do not like that kind  of  sell-out.\r\n\r\n'They do not mind being sold out to somebody else.  But\r\n\r\nif  the sell-out is to our kith and kin, they object to\r\n\r\nit vigorously. But if it is to be a sell-out to British\r\n\r\ninterests,  they do not mind that; not a  bit.  If  the\r\n\r\nthird  proposition  is  a  genuine,  serious  political\r\n\r\nproposition made in all honesty, bona fide, then it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly   incompatible  with  proposition   one   and\r\n\r\nproposition two. And the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  are  not political children. They know what  they\r\n\r\nare  doing.  They  know  the third  proposition  is  an\r\n\r\nimpossibility.  If  they mean (1) and  (2),  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimpossibility. But if they do not mean (1) and (2) ,  it\r\n\r\nis  a definite possibility. How will the Tunku react to\r\n\r\nan  independent Singapore without the British? How will\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  react  to  a Singapore  with  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council in the hands of the  local  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment? Of course, the answer possibly  could  well\r\n\r\nbe  that the Tunku has no business to object. But I ask\r\n\r\nthem  to give the answer against the background of  our\r\n\r\nwanting  to  get back to the Federation. This  problem,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, must he viewed not with what is absolutely\r\n\r\nright or what is absolutely wrong, it is not an ethical\r\n\r\nproblem  or a problem in politics, but it is a  problem\r\n\r\nagainst  the background of our wanting to get  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. We must view this problem against that\r\n\r\nbackground, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  then provide the answers which will bring  us\r\n\r\nnearer  and nearer, and not say that the rights  of\r\n\r\nman   are  being  denied,  as, according  to   the\r\n\r\nsocialist  way  of thinking, that  is  wrong,  and.\r\n\r\naccording to the Communist way of thinking, that is\r\n\r\nright. These things do not get us anywhere. Let  us\r\n\r\nbe practical about this problem. Let us look at the\r\n\r\nproblem  not  as  Sosialist  or  Communist  or   as\r\n\r\nbelonging to this and that political party. I am  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean, and I want to see the right thing done\r\n\r\nby  Singapore.  And  if, as the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon says, the Communists are going to  get  a\r\n\r\nbad deal in the Federation then I am very sorry for\r\n\r\nthem.  The  Member is not here.  The  line  he  was\r\n\r\ntaking  was  to  ask the House what  guarantee  the\r\n\r\nCommunists will have of security in the Federation.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask him whether he is a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think he said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Lim Ching Siong has openly\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  he  is not a Communist - not  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  papers,  I understand, but  to  the  English\r\n\r\nPress. If Mr Lim Ching Siong has denied that he is\r\n\r\na  Communist, then he is not a Communist. And if he\r\n\r\nhas  stated that he is not a Communist, then I must\r\n\r\nonly  assume, Mr Speaker, Sir, that he  made  that\r\n\r\npositive  statement because he was not a Communist,\r\n\r\nand  he did not like being called a Communist,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  did not like the foreign Press  to  think\r\n\r\nthat  he was a Communist.

All that needless  is\r\n\r\n\"he is not a Communist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what objection then could the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  have  to  Mr  Lim  Ching   Siong\r\n\r\nparticipating   in  the  Tunku  politics   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation?  He  is  not a  Communist.  He  has  no\r\n\r\nobjection to Mr David who is a socialist.  He  has\r\n\r\nno  objection to Mr Seenivasagam who is a Rightist\r\n\r\nSo   why  worry?  He  does  not  object  to  ultra-Rightists. He does not object to an ultra-Leftists.\r\n\r\nBut he objects to the Communists. Who can say he is\r\n\r\nwrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  object  to the Communists, Mr Speaker,  Sir,I\r\n\r\nthink  I  am  a  reasonable man. I will  object  to\r\n\r\nanything  which  seeks  to destroy  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  The essence of Communism, as I  understand\r\n\r\nit,  is  to  destroy the democratic system  and  to\r\n\r\nbuild thereafter their society. I object to that. I\r\n\r\ndo  not object to their economic creed, where  they\r\n\r\nwant  every man to be equal economically. It  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  creed, Mr Speaker, Sir. But when  they\r\n\r\ncome to destroying the existing social system,  the\r\n\r\nexisting   form  of  government,  and  then   build\r\n\r\nsomething on it, I am against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the point and purpose of breeding\r\n\r\nCommunism  in the Federation? Stamp it  out.  The\r\n\r\nTunku is right. But leave the socialists alone. The\r\n\r\nsocialists  want  to build on the existing  system.\r\n\r\nThey  use the existing forms of government to build\r\n\r\nan  equal society. That is absolutely correct. That\r\n\r\nis the form of government we want to fight for. But\r\n\r\nif  it subscribes to a creed which seeks to destroy\r\n\r\nthe existing system of society, the existing system\r\n\r\nof  government,  and the existing way  of  life  to\r\n\r\nwhich we are all committed, I say, destroy it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, and quite rightly too.

But if by  a  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger they intend to carry across to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore that this is something which you must not\r\n\r\ntouch,  this is something which will do the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore more harm than good, then I  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  them.

To  whom   are\r\n\r\nSingapore's 70 per cent Chinese being sold? Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  talk  like this.

I\r\n\r\nhave  always felt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the first\r\n\r\nduty  of  a public leader is not to excite communal\r\n\r\npassions;  not  to  make  any  statement  which  is\r\n\r\nlikely,  or  remotely likely, to stir  up  communal\r\n\r\npassions  or  communal  feelings.  Fortunately   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the last 30, 40 or  50  years,  our\r\n\r\nleaders,  he they colonialists, or be they anything\r\n\r\nyou  like,  have steadfastly avoided  the  communal\r\n\r\nline in all issues. They have never made statements\r\n\r\npublicly and openly which are likely to excite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunal passions. Communal passions are there, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  and let us not kid ourselves.  They\r\n\r\nare  there.  If only we scratch them, we  will  see\r\n\r\nthem.  And  a  virulent form too.  And  I  tell  my\r\n\r\nBarisan  friends  behind us not to make  statements\r\n\r\neither  inadvertently  or  advertently  which   are\r\n\r\nlikely   to  cause  communal  trouble  and   excite\r\n\r\ncommunal feelings. Therefore, let us not talk about\r\n\r\nselling our kith and kin. Selling our kith and  kin\r\n\r\nto whom, may I ask the Barisan Sosialis? Let us not\r\n\r\nmake  these  wild statements which  are  likely  to\r\n\r\nexcite  the people of Singapore into thinking  that\r\n\r\nsomebody  is  betraying them.

Sir, I am sure the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon must have been one of the brighter  stars\r\n\r\non  the  Government side. I had  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nrespect for him when he was on the Government side.\r\n\r\nWhenever  he spoke. I always listened to  him  very\r\n\r\ncarefully because I knew he was one of the brighter\r\n\r\nstars in the P.A.P. As he has now come across here,\r\n\r\npossibly  the star is if anything a little brighter\r\n\r\nnow,  because he has not got to shine amongst other\r\n\r\nstars.  The brighter stars are over there, I always\r\n\r\nlistened  to  the Member for Upper  Serangoon  with\r\n\r\ngreat  interest. After all, I am from  the  English\r\n\r\nstream, and  I like to listen to people  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  swimming  in other streams in order  that  we\r\n\r\nmight   understand  each  other's  point  of  view.\r\n\r\nListening to his arguments, both on the motion  and\r\n\r\non  the  amendment -  although  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  made the point  that  he  wanted\r\n\r\nmerger straightaway as the twelfth State, just like\r\n\r\nJohore and any other State - (I am afraid to make  a\r\n\r\nforceful   statement   because   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown might pull me up), I got the  idea  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Upper Serangoon was  advocating  a\r\n\r\ncause   which  is  not  a  merger  cause.  He   was\r\n\r\nexpressing   fears  of  the  Federation  Government\r\n\r\ngetting control of this, that and the other. And he\r\n\r\ngave  his  arguments as to why fears  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  being  aroused. Now, if the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nreally mean what they say in their amendment,  then\r\n\r\nI  cannot  see  how the Member for Upper  Serangoon\r\n\r\ncould  have spoken in the way he did. He used  such\r\n\r\nphrases as this, \"the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation's    feudalistic    and    capitalistic\r\n\r\nGovernment\".
