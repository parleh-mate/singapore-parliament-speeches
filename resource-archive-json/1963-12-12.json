I would like to know whether Government documents used in the Legislative Assembly could also be printed in all the four official languages. The Prime Minister has said that he intends to appoint a Puisne Judge\r\n\r\nto  be  the  Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to know the position on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. I hope there will be more\r\n\r\nsupplies  of  different  kinds  of  books  for   our\r\n\r\nreference in the Assembly Library. This will help us\r\n\r\nto  understand better the situation and all  matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  State  and  to  the  society   in\r\n\r\nSingapore in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe Member has raised several points. I do not think\r\n\r\nI  need  labour  the House with a long  harangue  on\r\n\r\nlines diametrically opposite to those that have been\r\n\r\ndelivered  by Members in the Opposition,  apart  for\r\n\r\nthe   fact   that  if  we  had  not   made   special\r\n\r\narrangements for terms and conditions of merger, the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu would not have been here today\r\n\r\neven in spite of the split vote in his constituency.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to speak English or Malay, he would  be\r\n\r\nout,  disqualified, and unable to take part in  this\r\n\r\ndebate. First of all, whilst we do not expect him to\r\n\r\nthank  us for our forbearance and the great care  we\r\n\r\nhave taken to see that people like him should not be\r\n\r\npenalised,  at least we do not expect  him  to  come\r\n\r\nhere   and  cause  unnecessary  trouble  by  raising\r\n\r\nproblems about equality of languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of the Speaker. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  announced its intention, and this is  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich   requires   the  consent   of   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Needless to say,  if  the  consent  has\r\n\r\nalready been obtained, an appointment may well  have\r\n\r\nbeen made. The problem is whether we can satisfy the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government  to come  to  some  arrangement\r\n\r\nwhereby  one  of the judicial officers can,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, either be seconded or otherwise freed, do\r\n\r\nthese duties. At the right time and when finality is\r\n\r\nreached, the House will be informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the Library. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether the Member for Jalan Kayu believes that  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  Library  is  really  meant  for  political\r\n\r\ntracts  and dissertations. If he did, then  I  think\r\n\r\nreally  the place for it is the National Library.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  all the treatises and pamphlets  which  he\r\n\r\nwants  to read, for instance, about infantile  Left-wing adventurism and how generally not to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmake  Marx  and Lenin look like fools in  Singapore,\r\n\r\ncan  be  obtained in the National Library.  But  the\r\n\r\nAssembly Library is normally concerned with  records\r\n\r\nof  proceedings of this Legislature and treatises on\r\n\r\nrules, procedures and Standing Orders of this House.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  saying that there is no  vast  store  of\r\n\r\nliterature  in the other languages. They  all  have:\r\n\r\nChinese,  Tamil and, not least, Malay.  But  whether\r\n\r\nthere are any useful publications to help Members in\r\n\r\nthe  deliberations of this House is another  matter.\r\n\r\nIf the Member for Jalan Kayu can make out a case why\r\n\r\nhe  has  been  at a disadvantage because  he  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand,   for   instance,   Erskine    May    on\r\n\r\nparliamentary  practice  and  procedure,  we   might\r\n\r\nseriously  consider setting up a team of translators\r\n\r\nto  translate such useful treatises on parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocedures, if he really finds that there is a  need\r\n\r\nfor  that, and that he is at a disadvantage  because\r\n\r\nhe does not understand the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, only two days ago the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  in  his  speech that he welcomed opinions  and\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from  even  his  own  Back-benchers  and\r\n\r\nMembers from the Opposition. But when we put forward\r\n\r\nsuggestions such as this one, he does not take  them\r\n\r\nseriously. I remember the Member for Jalan Kayu  has\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  the  P.A.P. always  raise   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the Communist bogey. If everything  can\r\n\r\nbe  explained  away on the pretext of the  Communist\r\n\r\nbogey,  then nothing can be resolved. If he can  use\r\n\r\nthis term to evade every question, why should it  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to have any debate in this House?  I  hope\r\n\r\nthose  Members of the P.A.P. who were in this  House\r\n\r\nsome time ago, and who are now still here, will help\r\n\r\nto persuade the P.A.P. leadership to implement truly\r\n\r\nthe  use  of the four official languages, orally  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  written, in this Legislative  Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Prime  Minister  has  not  forgotten  the\r\n\r\npromise he made some time in the past. What is wrong\r\n\r\nwith making this suggestion to use the four official\r\n\r\nlanguages, orally as well as written, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  the printed papers? I would like him to let  us\r\n\r\nknow   whether   there  are  any   difficulties   in\r\n\r\nimplementing  this suggestion. We cannot  deny  that\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly occupies quite an important\r\n\r\nposition,  dealing as it does with  all  matters  of\r\n\r\nState and public affairs in Singapore. Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis necessary that the four official languages should\r\n\r\nbe  used  in  the  Legislative Assembly.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  of course, will remember that  there  are\r\n\r\nMembers in this House who do not understand English.\r\n\r\nIf  all the documents are in English, then those who\r\n\r\ncannot  master the English language will, of course,\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to take part in the business  of\r\n\r\nthis House. Our suggestion is to enable every Member\r\n\r\nto  understand the matter under discussion  and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  that is conducted in this House so  as  to\r\n\r\nhelp   in   conducting   the  Assembly   proceedings\r\n\r\nsmoothly.  The Prime Minister thinks that those  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand  will have  only  themselves  to\r\n\r\nblame. We hope that the books in the Library will be\r\n\r\nin  other  languages  as well  as  in  English.  The\r\n\r\nAssembly Librarian will be in a position to look for\r\n\r\nthe relevant books. In addition to books in English,\r\n\r\nwe  also hope there will be books in Chinese,  Malay\r\n\r\nand Tamil available in the Assembly Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what books to supply to the Library, this\r\n\r\nquestion  can  be  thrashed  out  by  the  Librarian\r\n\r\nhimself.  Why should the Prime Minister  talk  about\r\n\r\nbuying  books on Marxism and Leninism? In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave   never  asked  for  these  books.  Hence   the\r\n\r\nGovernment are not sincere in wanting to solve  this\r\n\r\nquestion.   On  the  other  hand,  they   want   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members to make suggestions as to how  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the running of this Assembly --- [Interruption]\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Jalan Besar should not say that.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  the librarians of this Assembly or keepers\r\n\r\nof  the  Library. We should trust the Librarian.  He\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  get  all  the  relevant   books\r\n\r\n--- [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

We have now elected a  Speaker  and  a\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, and these persons are Members of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

If the Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\nserious  about  getting a Puisne  Judge  to  be  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  his  appointment to  be  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament, how is that we  still  have  to\r\n\r\nwait for the appointment of this Puisne Judge as our\r\n\r\nSpeaker?  Why should they elect a Deputy Speaker?  I\r\n\r\nwant  to know whether it is because they are  unable\r\n\r\nto  find a Puisne Judge to be Speaker. Whether it is\r\n\r\nbecause of the P.A.P.'s arrogance that some  of  the\r\n\r\nJudges do not want to come here to be the Speaker of\r\n\r\nthis  House? Who insult the Judges?

He  has  always\r\n\r\nallowed  himself  to be led by the nose  by  others.\r\n\r\nNow,  what  more  does he want to complain?  He  now\r\n\r\ncomplains that there are not enough books for him to\r\n\r\nserve  as  references.  He also  complains  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot understand the books in English. Even  if  we\r\n\r\ngive you books and documents in Chinese, you may not\r\n\r\nbe  able to understand too. Even if we translate all\r\n\r\nthe  documents and even the Budget into Chinese, you\r\n\r\nwill  not  understand it, you will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncomprehend it. What is the use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should thank the institution of this Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,  because the Government is providing  $500\r\n\r\nallowance per month to enable them to criticise  and\r\n\r\nattack the Government. In how many countries can you\r\n\r\nfind these things in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractice?  Not to talk about freedom of  speech.

Now  in\r\n\r\nthis   House  Assemblymen  have  various  kinds   of\r\n\r\nprivileges. They are not liable to court action  for\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches  made  in this  House  and  are  not\r\n\r\nrestricted  under  normal laws.  Now,  this  is  the\r\n\r\nspirit of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These few days we have to put away all our work to\r\n\r\ncome  to  this  House to listen to  their  speeches.\r\n\r\nWhatever   they   talked  was  like   a   stereotype\r\n\r\ngramophone  record played over and over again,  like\r\n\r\nan old grandmother's tale - long and stinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members are even boasting about the\r\n\r\nlength  of their speeches, requesting us to  compete\r\n\r\nwith them in the length of speeches. That is not the\r\n\r\npurpose  of this House. Neither is it the  principle\r\n\r\nof  legislative proceedings. They want to  have  all\r\n\r\ndocuments,  the  Budget and Bills to  be  translated\r\n\r\ninto the three remaining official languages. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  they have the right and the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmake  their speeches in Mandarin. But do  they  know\r\n\r\nhow  much money will have to be spent in translating\r\n\r\nall  these  documents and papers into all the  three\r\n\r\nother  official languages? This sum could very  well\r\n\r\nhave  been used for other useful purposes,  such  as\r\n\r\nbuilding  roads and providing social  amenities  and\r\n\r\nfacilities. Even if we provide documents and  papers\r\n\r\nin  Chinese, the Member for Jalan Kayu  may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to understand them. He has raised the question\r\n\r\nof books in the Library.

In the same way, we should also\r\n\r\nbe  given  the opportunity to acquire more knowledge\r\n\r\nand  know more things through literature in  various\r\n\r\nlanguages.

What\r\n\r\nthey  should  have done is to ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  increase the amount  allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last four days we have had dreary speeches\r\n\r\nabout  the  unemployment  position.

Even  in\r\n\r\nthis  House this equal treatment cannot  be  put  to\r\n\r\nwork. The P.A.P. is playing about with this question\r\n\r\nof  giving  equal treatment. We are not  asking  for\r\n\r\nsomething  that cannot be done. It is  not  fair  to\r\n\r\nhave everything only in the English language. If  we\r\n\r\nare  really sincere in giving equal treatment to the\r\n\r\nfour languages, then it should first be done in this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I think I had better bring\r\n\r\nthe  debate back to the rails.

The Assembly\r\n\r\nLibrary is not an ordinary library meant for general\r\n\r\nreading.  The  purpose of the  Library  is  to  have\r\n\r\ntreatises on parliamentary procedure and practice as\r\n\r\nin   Britain   and  other  parts  of   the   British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  which have adopted this  parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice.  There  are, therefore, no  Chinese  books\r\n\r\nwritten on this anywhere in the world, nor for  that\r\n\r\nmatter Malay hooks or Tamil books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if Members of the Opposition  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  find  any  particular  kind  of  text-book  of\r\n\r\nassistance,   i   will   seriously   consider    the\r\n\r\nproposition  that  translations  should   be   made.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] One at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I intend to meet all the points that have been raised. As for the Library, as I have said, if the Barisan really want any other reading material, then the proper place is not the Assembly Library but the National Library. When we come to the Ministry of Culture estimates, that is the time\r\n\r\nto  point out whether or not the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nis  doing its duty in providing reading material and\r\n\r\nliterature  in the Chinese language - indeed  in  any\r\n\r\nother language, Tamil and Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I really ask them to consider whether, in fact,\r\n\r\nthey want to pursue this matter. If they really want\r\n\r\nto,  then  I  say I am quite prepared.  The  leading\r\n\r\ntextbook   on   Constitutional   and   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nPractice  is  Erskine May's, a book  of  over  1,000\r\n\r\npages, full of technicalities. If necessary, I  will\r\n\r\neven consider a commission to translate it if it  is\r\n\r\nof  any value to Members opposite. Other than  that,\r\n\r\nwe   get   donated  to  us  proceedings   of   other\r\n\r\nParliaments  in  the British Commonwealth;  free  of\r\n\r\ncharge, they give them to us and we put them in  the\r\n\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the point of substance is - I agree\r\n\r\nthis  is  a point of substance - about notice papers,\r\n\r\nand   so  on.  Members  will  notice  that  at   the\r\n\r\nceremonial  opening of the Assembly the Order  Paper\r\n\r\nfor  that day was printed in four languages. If  the\r\n\r\nstaff  of  this  Assembly  plus  the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Printing Office can cope with  the  work,\r\n\r\nwe  will  likewise do every single  Order  Paper.  I\r\n\r\nconcede that. What I would like to point out is that\r\n\r\nwe have inherited a Government Printing Office which\r\n\r\nonly  prints in English. The Ministry of Culture  is\r\n\r\nat  the  present moment trying to build up a section\r\n\r\nthat  can  print in Malay, Tamil and  Chinese.  When\r\n\r\nthat section is built up, and provided we can at the\r\n\r\nsame time build up a coterie of translators, we will\r\n\r\nlet all Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   all  notifications  in  all  four  languages.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] Do they want it? Surely I am assuming\r\n\r\nthat  they do not want us to do it only in  Chinese.\r\n\r\nIf we do it, then we have got to do it also in Malay\r\n\r\nand Tamil.

W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it is because the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was speaking English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the plain fact of the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  this. This was decided by  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommission  back  in 1957 and the  Members  opposite\r\n\r\nbesides  the Member for Jalan Kayu may not be  aware\r\n\r\nof this. But it was found that it is impossible with\r\n\r\nthe  administration at present constituted with both\r\n\r\nthe  clerical  staff - the Government  Printing  side\r\n\r\n- and   interpreters   at  our   disposal   to   have\r\n\r\nsimultaneous records of all documents distributed to\r\n\r\nMembers  in  four  languages.  And  therefore,   for\r\n\r\nconvenience sake, they retain the use of English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be quite frank and say that it will\r\n\r\nnever  be  possible  at any time  to  run  all  four\r\n\r\nrecords in all four languages. It is something which\r\n\r\nnot even the United Nations can successfully do. But\r\n\r\nI  do  promise the Members opposite that  whilst  we\r\n\r\nwill  always maintain the liberty of each Member  to\r\n\r\nuse   his   own  language,  the  moment  there   are\r\n\r\nsufficient   men  and  material  and  the   printing\r\n\r\ncapacity to do it, the records will be kept  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language.  And I do urge  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu to utilise the opportunity we offered him\r\n\r\nin  the last Assembly and in this Assembly to really\r\n\r\nmake an effort, otherwise if in five years' time  we\r\n\r\nhave  built  up this whole apparatus,  he  may  find\r\n\r\nhimself illiterate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, about the Speaker. But before I go to\r\n\r\nthat,  I  would  like to make this  point.  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers  on the opposite side run a very grave  risk\r\n\r\nof playing this dangerous line of saying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  are not equal. Sir, I am prepared to  meet\r\n\r\nthis problem all the time and every time. But I  say\r\n\r\nthat  they have already been well isolated from  the\r\n\r\nmass  of  the public, playing all kinds of dangerous\r\n\r\nexternal lines. The foreign policy of the P.K.I. is\r\n\r\nthe internal policy of the Barisan. Now they play on\r\n\r\nlanguage  and sentiments. It is our job to see  that\r\n\r\nthese  very sensitive and highly-charged issues  are\r\n\r\nplayed down. And I say, if they have a genuine point\r\n\r\nto  make, I will meet it genuinely. But generally to\r\n\r\nsay  that  we are not treating the Chinese  language\r\n\r\n- and  really they are only interested in the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage; let us be quite frank about that  - equally\r\n\r\nwith  the  others,  I say that it  is  not  only  an\r\n\r\nuntruth  but a positively dangerous line to  pursue.\r\n\r\nIf  they have a genuine complaint and if they do not\r\n\r\nreally understand what is being said in the notices,\r\n\r\nI  will consider during Assembly sittings to try  to\r\n\r\nget some translators seconded from the Courts to try\r\n\r\nand   help   them.  But  this  is  not   a   genuine\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  or incapacity to comprehend.  This\r\n\r\nis  deliberate mischief making, and I say they do so\r\n\r\nat  their  peril. This is a country  with  a  plural\r\n\r\nsociety. If we play one without taking into  account\r\n\r\nthe  sensitivities of the others, there will be real\r\n\r\ntrouble. So I urge them not to pursue this line. Our\r\n\r\npolicy  of equal treatment for the four streams  was\r\n\r\ndecided by an All-Party Commission, that it is  only\r\n\r\nfeasible   to  have  one  administrative   language.\r\n\r\nWherever possible - at ceremonial openings, and so on\r\n\r\n- we  put it in all languages. If really there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed,  they  do  not understand it,  I  am  prepared\r\n\r\nduring  Assembly sittings, as I have said, to  bring\r\n\r\nin  interpreters. But to play this as  a  propaganda\r\n\r\nline is a very dangerous line. I will meet it. I say\r\n\r\nwe  will  survive. But I am not so sure whether  the\r\n\r\ncountry  can  stand these stresses and strains.  One\r\n\r\nthing  is definite. If the next wretched riot  takes\r\n\r\nplace,  like  the Bertha Hertogh riot, we  will  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough policemen to guard the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu and all the Members opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the Speaker. I had hoped that\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite would have shown a certain  amount\r\n\r\nof decorum and good taste. They say they welcome our\r\n\r\ndesire to appoint a High Court Judge concurrently as\r\n\r\nSpeaker  of this Assembly. They have cast aspersions\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps  no High Court Judge wishes  to  be  a\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, you are  in  an\r\n\r\ninvidious  position in that you lean over  backwards\r\n\r\nto  be more than fair to them, because there can  he\r\n\r\nno allegation about that. And I see the advantage of\r\n\r\nhaving an impartial non-party Speaker who is doing a\r\n\r\ncompletely  impartial duty, like a  Judge,  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  office. I have explained publicly  the  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  need  to get the consent  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  because the Judiciary  is  now  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  vote. I do not want to go into the details.\r\n\r\nI  have been pressed now. All right, I will say this\r\n\r\nnow.  The Central Government having taken the advice\r\n\r\nof  not our Judiciary - our Judiciary is quite  happy\r\n\r\nwith this arrangement and is quite prepared to allow\r\n\r\none  of  the  Judges concurrently to act as  Speaker\r\n\r\n- but  the  Federal side of the Judiciary  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey should not duplicate their functions.

But\r\n\r\ntoday  the opposition that was voiced by the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nis  now  voiced  by the Barisan Sosialis.  When  the\r\n\r\nstrong  men in the Barisan Sosialis - Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong, Mr Fong Swee Suan and Mr Woodhull - held the\r\n\r\nposts  of Political Secretaries, they did not object\r\n\r\nto  these posts. But now they say that it is a waste\r\n\r\nof  money. These Political Secretaries are important\r\n\r\nto  the Ministers and to the people of Singapore. If\r\n\r\nthey are loyal to Malaysia, then they are good. So I\r\n\r\nam  surprised  that the question  of  the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries  which was raised by the S.P.A. led  by\r\n\r\nTun Lim Yew Hock is now raised and debated at length\r\n\r\nby the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A. talked at length on the Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  so much so that the Party  disappeared\r\n\r\nfrom the political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narena.  I am afraid that the same fate which  befell\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. would also befall the 13 Members of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the defeated candidates, does it mean\r\n\r\nthat  because they have been defeated they  have  no\r\n\r\nability?  Their  defeat is due to  several  reasons.\r\n\r\nThey  were defeated because their campaign  was  not\r\n\r\nvery  good. They went and intimidated the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  kampongs. But the Political Secretary  who  has\r\n\r\ntoday  been appointed by the Prime Minister was  put\r\n\r\nup  to contest the election at Bukit Panjang to show\r\n\r\nthe  strength  that has ensued in the  past  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  months.  If by being defeated  means  that  a\r\n\r\ncandidate has no ability, then in the case of  their\r\n\r\nown  leader, Dr Lee Siew Choh, the fact that he was\r\n\r\ndefeated means that he has no ability. If he  is  no\r\n\r\ngood, why should he be elected again as Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Party? So, Mr Speaker, I am rather fed up. Four\r\n\r\ntimes  in the past, we had a debate in this Assembly\r\n\r\non  this point. And the voice of Tun Lim Yew Hock is\r\n\r\nstill  ringing in our ears! His voice is still being\r\n\r\nechoed  in this Assembly in the same manner  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  tune.

Surely they must credit us with sufficient,\r\n\r\nif not responsibility, then at least with a sense of\r\n\r\ndecorum  of what is right and wrong in the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the public.

And they were Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir,  unlike the present Political Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr  Fong  Swee  Suan, Mr Lim Ching Siong  and  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull were paid $1,300 to help the Government, to\r\n\r\nbe  loyal to the Government.

Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In debating the matter of the post of\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary,  Sir,  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers have stated that a Political Secretary is  a\r\n\r\nperson   who  liaises  with  the  people   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  that, according to  them,  as  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  to  the  Prime  Minister   was\r\n\r\ndefeated  in  the elections, he is not fit  to  fill\r\n\r\nthat  post. His defeat does not mean that he is  not\r\n\r\nable to carry out the duties of liaison between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  people.  Even  though  he  was\r\n\r\ndefeated  in Bukit Panjang, nevertheless, the  other\r\n\r\n50  constituencies still retain their confidence  in\r\n\r\nhim and believe in his integrity. That is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy the Prime Minister has appointed him to fill the\r\n\r\npost.  In  the  past, three members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  filled  the posts of Political  Secretary.\r\n\r\nWhat  did  they  do? If they say  that  a  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary  is one who liaises between the Government\r\n\r\nand   the   people,   then  those  three   Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries of the Barisan Sosialis had not  carried\r\n\r\nout  the  duties  which the Members in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis now expect them to have done then. They, in\r\n\r\nfact,   channelled  the  propaganda  of  the  P.K.I.\r\n\r\nthrough the Barisan Sosialis to the people. Is  this\r\n\r\nthe  kind of liaison work which the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nexpect  from them? The Barisan Sosialis Members  who\r\n\r\nare  here today say differently and act differently.\r\n\r\nThey are being used by the P.K.I. who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  on  the  side  of  the people  who  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  this is not for  the  benefit  and\r\n\r\nhappiness of the people. All their efforts  are  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of leading the people astray.  At  one\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Political Secretary to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation challenged these people to give  up  their\r\n\r\njobs, but the Political Secretaries from the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  did  not give up their posts because  they\r\n\r\nplaced  great  value  on  the  salaries  they   were\r\n\r\nreceiving.  They were consorting with Azahari  which\r\n\r\nis  detrimental  to the peace of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people as a whole. Therefore, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the incumbent  of  the\r\n\r\npost of Political Secretary to the Prime Minister is\r\n\r\none  who  is capable and who commands the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the people. Even though he was defeated in Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang,  he is working for the benefit and  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people. He nevertheless still  retains  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the  people.  He  is  not  like  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries from the Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nin the past betrayed the people and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, on the subject of\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries, it seems to me that  although\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of the Government have  explained  the\r\n\r\nposition, the Member for Jalan Kayu is still in  the\r\n\r\ndark.  Their heads are dull, despite the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthey have been told of it on many occasions.

They referred to the defeated\r\n\r\ncandidate  for Bukit Panjang. It is clear  that  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition do not owe allegiance  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia. They still owe allegiance to their country\r\n\r\nof origin. That is all, Mr Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, we have taken much of the Assembly's\r\n\r\ntime  to  debate the post of Political Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister. From the Budget we can see that\r\n\r\nthere  is a provision for a Political Secretary  for\r\n\r\neach  Minister. But only four Political  Secretaries\r\n\r\nhave   been  appointed.  From  the  notice  of   the\r\n\r\namendments we observe that queries have been  raised\r\n\r\nonly  on this particular Political Secretary. To  me\r\n\r\nthis  goes to show that they have a special  respect\r\n\r\nboth  to  the  Prime Minister and to  his  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary.   I  have  no  doubt  that  the   present\r\n\r\nincumbent is an efficient and capable man. No notice\r\n\r\nof  amendment  was raised in respect  of  the  other\r\n\r\nthree  Political  Secretaries except  the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister. This clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  13  Opposition Members are really  scared\r\n\r\nbecause  they realise the capability and  efficiency\r\n\r\nof the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.  I\r\n\r\nstill remember the case of the present Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour. He stood in the by-election in Hong Lim  and\r\n\r\nhe  was  defeated, although Mr Lim Ching Siong  and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues supported him then. Although he  was\r\n\r\ndefeated  at Hong Lim, he was appointed a  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister. This was cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern  to  the Barisan Sosialis. When the  present\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour was going to stand for election\r\n\r\nat Queenstown,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was the former constituency of their Chairman,\r\n\r\nrather  than  be  defeated  by  a  former  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, he would rather prefer to be defeated  by\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Chairman of our Party. This, as the Malay\r\n\r\nproverb  says, means that if an elephant  fights  an\r\n\r\nant,  people will laugh. So the Party Chairman chose\r\n\r\nto  fight  the Deputy Prime Minister in the  Rochore\r\n\r\nconstituency but not in Queenstown. This again  goes\r\n\r\nto  prove  the respect that the Political  Secretary\r\n\r\ncommands. That is, although he was defeated  in  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election, he succeeded in being returned\r\n\r\nin  Queenstown. Therefore, it is not surprising that\r\n\r\nthe present incumbent has become the main target  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members, whilst the other  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries who have been appointed and who have not\r\n\r\nbeen  appointed have been left in peace.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen left alone. No mention was made of them in this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think  we\r\n\r\nhave  wasted  much of the Assembly's  time  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.   It   is   nothing  but  purely   personal\r\n\r\nsentiments. It is not the post. If it is  in  regard\r\n\r\nto   the  post,  then  it  should  be  for  all  the\r\n\r\nMinisters. But this concerns the Political Secretary\r\n\r\nto the Prime Minister who is very much feared by the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members.  This  shows  that  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore has chosen a very capable  man\r\n\r\nto hold this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  Members on the Government  side  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we have been debating this  subject  for\r\n\r\nquite  a long time.

On the appointment of\r\n\r\nthe  Political  Secretary,  I  would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether the things he did in the past commanded  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the people and was he really of value  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government and to the people as  well?  Has  he\r\n\r\nsuch merit or not?

The  true\r\n\r\nvaluation  should be related to the performance  and\r\n\r\npersonal  integrity  of  the  person  and  also  the\r\n\r\nnecessity of the post.

I disagree with the assessment\r\n\r\nof  the  Members opposite that it is Indonesia  that\r\n\r\nwill determine our future. I say it is Malaysia that\r\n\r\ndetermines our future. Now, with Malaysia  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of some considerable importance particularly\r\n\r\nin  the first 18 months of the running-in period  of\r\n\r\nthe  new Constitution that there should be Singapore\r\n\r\nmachinery in Kuala Lumpur to sort out the  bits  and\r\n\r\npieces  to ensure that they understand what  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing,  why  we are doing what we are doing.  May  I\r\n\r\nexplain  to the Member who asked this question  that\r\n\r\nthe problem is not why we should have an office, but\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can  have a suitably qualified  man  to\r\n\r\nconduct our affairs in Kuala Lumpur? The reason  why\r\n\r\nnobody   has  been  appointed  is  because  of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty   of   getting  somebody   endowed   with\r\n\r\nministerial  status  to  be  able  to  take  up  our\r\n\r\nproblems,   instead  of  taking  them  up   on   the\r\n\r\ntelephone, in person in Kuala Lumpur. It may be that\r\n\r\nin  the end this is a problem on which we will  have\r\n\r\nto feel our way before we can get a solution. In the\r\n\r\nend,  it may be that Ministers may have to go up  in\r\n\r\nturn  to  keep  liaison  and  get  Kuala  Lumpur  to\r\n\r\nunderstand what our policy and our programme are and\r\n\r\nwhy  we are doing what we are doing. But if it  were\r\n\r\npossible  to  get  somebody  permanently  to  reside\r\n\r\nthere,  and if there is a person who can  be  spared\r\n\r\nfor  these  duties,  then I say he  will  need  this\r\n\r\noffice staff to conduct proper business between  the\r\n\r\nState and the Central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does Mr Kow Kee Seng wish to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> indicated dissent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 6 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether this Senior Trade and\r\n\r\nCultural   Representative's  Office  is   still   in\r\n\r\nexistence  in  Indonesia, whether there  is  such  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative, and what is the use of  this  office\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia?

Members\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  aware that even though  there  are  no\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  relations,  for  instance,  between  the\r\n\r\nBritish  and  North  Vietnam,  there  is  a  British\r\n\r\nConsulate  or  a  Trade  Commission  in  Hanoi.   So\r\n\r\nsimilarly,   even  in  spite  of  the   rupture   of\r\n\r\ndiplomatic relations between Indonesia and  Malaysia\r\n\r\non  the  17th of September, as far as Singapore  was\r\n\r\nconcerned, our trade representation went on up  till\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of  October. Sometime round  about  the\r\n\r\nmiddle   of   October,  for  various  reasons,   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government  Foreign  Office   gave   our\r\n\r\nmission  two  weeks  to wind  up  their  affairs  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and leave, which they duly did.

But\r\n\r\nthis  is a sum that has been set aside in the  event\r\n\r\nthat it is possible to resume trade relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that having spent the whole of the last\r\n\r\nthree   days   exhorting  negotiations  to   resolve\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  they would welcome a  resumption  of\r\n\r\ntrade.  Members on the other side may like  to  know\r\n\r\nthat,   as  far  as  the  Singapore  Government   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it  is always prepared to resume  trade;\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not there is a resumption of diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations is an entirely different matter. It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  in the hands of the Central Government.  All\r\n\r\nof  us  on  this side and, I think, Members  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side  have  seen  the views  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment on it. I would like to repeat what I said\r\n\r\non  the  25th of October, that if there is to  be  a\r\n\r\nnormalisation  of relationship, which  we  all  hope\r\n\r\nthere  will  be, we hope it will be on  a  permanent\r\n\r\nbasis and not a temporary patch-up, generating  once\r\n\r\nagain  a false sense of euphoria soon to be banished\r\n\r\nagain  shortly  thereafter.  In  the  meantime,   if\r\n\r\nconditions permit, we will resume trade relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have listened to the explanation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister. It is clear that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  pays  much attention  to  trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia. You will remember that when\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. came into office in 1959, there  was  a\r\n\r\nspecial mission to Indonesia the object of which was\r\n\r\nto  promote  and  improve  trade  relations  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia. But today it seems that our\r\n\r\nSenior Trade and Cultural Representative is no  more\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia, and yet the Government still provides\r\n\r\na  sum of money in the Budget for this Office.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that  the Government is very anxious  to  \r\n\r\nre-establish  trade  relations  between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, which also is the hope of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We voice the same hope that there must be\r\n\r\na  resumption  of trade relations between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia. The P.A.P.

If he insists on referring to a non-existing  Malayan entity, then one must assume  that\r\n\r\nhe  disavows the fact that he is a Malaysian citizen\r\n\r\nand should not be in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government\r\n\r\nexpresses   the   hope  that,  notwithstanding   the\r\n\r\nrelations   between  Malaysia  and  Indonesia,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is also hopeful that there  may\r\n\r\nbe a resumption of trade relations between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia.  One thing we do not understand  is,\r\n\r\nwhy  does  the  Government not want  to  accept  our\r\n\r\nproposal to resume trade relations between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia? There are reasons for their adopting\r\n\r\ntheir   present   attitude.  Firstly,   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  dealing with  our  future  does  not\r\n\r\naccept the views of our Party. They also run counter\r\n\r\nto the interests of the people. They are prepared to\r\n\r\nwork for Malaysia which is sponsored by the British.\r\n\r\nNow  that  Malaysia  has  brought  difficulties  and\r\n\r\nhardships  to  our  people, without  Malaysia  there\r\n\r\nwould not have been this Indonesian confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng)</b>: Order.

I also want to point out the\r\n\r\nreasons for the attitude the P.A.P. Government  have\r\n\r\nadopted.  Now they are trying to shift the blame  on\r\n\r\nto  other people for our present hardship.  We  want\r\n\r\ntrade relations to be resumed between Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore, and since the P.A.P. have the  same  hope\r\n\r\nand  aspirations,  why should they  not  accept  our\r\n\r\nproposals? Because of the ferocious attitude of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  Government in the Federation,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  forced  to  toe  the  line  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government.

I  then  already\r\n\r\nsuspected,  even before the Member for Jurong  began\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  that we would be in for  another  five\r\n\r\nyears  of sterile, destructive, completely insincere\r\n\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Member for Choa Chu Kang whether what\r\n\r\nhe has said, which will be published tomorrow in,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  all  the newspapers and not just the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  is  going to help resolve  the  present\r\n\r\ntrade boycott between Indonesia and Singapore? If he\r\n\r\nhas  the  interests  of  Singapore  at  heart,  even\r\n\r\nassuming he has not got the interests of Malaysia at\r\n\r\nheart,  does  he  think he is helping  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nencouraging  our neighbours to believe that  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to go down on our bended knees  and  plead\r\n\r\nfor  trade - trade which as clearly borne out in  our\r\n\r\nstatistics  is 8.7 per cent of our national  income?\r\n\r\nOr  is he not spreading alarm and despondency to  be\r\n\r\nused  by the Indonesians and the Filipinos for their\r\n\r\ninternational propaganda to say that Malaysia is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  torn  and divided within itself, unworthy  of\r\n\r\ninternational support? On whose side is he  speaking\r\n\r\nfor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we all want a resumption of trade. But I\r\n\r\nsay,  more  than a resumption of trade, we  want  to\r\n\r\nsurvive as a separate entity in South-East Asia, not\r\n\r\nto  be slowly, one by one, absorbed and dissolved in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia.

Three of them have already  sworn\r\n\r\nthat  this is all a great mistake and have given  up\r\n\r\npolitics.  If they had the courage, they would  have\r\n\r\ncome  out  and fought their erstwhile companions  in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis for having brought trouble into\r\n\r\nthis  country. Who brought about confrontation?  Who\r\n\r\nstarted  this whole thing? Of course, we  know  that\r\n\r\nsome people in this region thought that it would  be\r\n\r\na  good thing if Malaya did not grow bigger. But who\r\n\r\ngave them the entree, the sparking point, with which\r\n\r\nto  intervene in the affairs of another country? The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, together with the Socialist Front,\r\n\r\nlinking up with S.U.P.P., linking up with Brunei and\r\n\r\nAzahari, leading to the revolt, leading to a  United\r\n\r\nNations   assessment.  They  made  the  interference\r\n\r\neasier.  What is the logic of the criticism  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Choa Chu Kang - begin  negotiations?\r\n\r\nAll  right, what for? To resolve confrontation.  All\r\n\r\nright, on what terms and on what conditions on which\r\n\r\nconfrontation will for the time being be  withdrawn?\r\n\r\nHe   said,   \"Malaysia   will   dissolve.\"   Another\r\n\r\nassessment team has been suggested What for?

First, on whose\r\n\r\nside  is he on? On the side of Indonesia or  on  the\r\n\r\nside  of  Malaysia? Second question:  Does  he  want\r\n\r\nthings to get better between Malaysia and Indonesia,\r\n\r\nor does he want things to get worse? Third question:\r\n\r\nHas  what  he has been saying just now, exaggerating\r\n\r\nalarm, loss of trade, differences of opinion between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Kuala Lumpur,  been  really  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that he is against Kuala Lumpur. We\r\n\r\ntake  that  for  granted. But is it  really  in  our\r\n\r\ninterest  - whatever  our  internal  differences   of\r\n\r\npresentation   of   policy  - to   exaggerate   these\r\n\r\ndifferences  and  allow  them  to  be  exploited  by\r\n\r\noutside powers? It is as simple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member took the oath of loyalty in this\r\n\r\nChamber, and he should be loyal to Malaysia. He  has\r\n\r\nnever  even  once - none of the Opposition  - admitted\r\n\r\nthat   Malaysia  is  in  existence.  They  talk   of\r\n\r\nSingapore;  they talk of the Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nLet  me remind them that this is a matter which  may\r\n\r\nbecome extremely serious, and that their words  here\r\n\r\n- frivolous  though  they may be  to  those  who  are\r\n\r\nwatching  these proceedings - if used  and  exploited\r\n\r\ninternationally,  may well add  to  a  worsening  in\r\n\r\nrelations.  In  the  event, are they  alive  to  the\r\n\r\ndangers they are in - that any man against the nation\r\n\r\nwho  actively aids and abets aggression against  the\r\n\r\nnation  is a traitor, and will be punished as  such?\r\n\r\nThere  are five minutes left, and I would  be  quite\r\n\r\nhappy if the Member for Paya Lebar would give  me  a\r\n\r\ndirect  answer on behalf of his Party  to  my  three\r\n\r\nquestions.

I would tell the Government that  the \r\n\r\nLand  Office  has much land under its  control.  The \r\n\r\npeople  have been living on the land for many years,\r\n\r\nfor   scores  of  years.  Some  farmers  have   been\r\n\r\noccupying  pieces of land on short-term as  well  as\r\n\r\nlong-term leases. Now, these several acres  of  land\r\n\r\nto  each homestead after having been cultivated  for\r\n\r\nseveral years will have increased in value and  will\r\n\r\nprovide  succour to their families  and  members  of\r\n\r\ntheir  families who, after several years, will  have\r\n\r\ngrown  up  and will be leaving the land.  They  will\r\n\r\nhave  their own families and will need further  land\r\n\r\nto   develop,  cultivate,  and  to  live   on.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  not  have  adequate  legislation  in\r\n\r\nregard  to land policy to provide for the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when the farmers make applications to the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they  are turned down.

Hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\ncan  tell  you this. But let me touch on this  topic\r\n\r\nfirst. So in the end, when a farmer wants to build a\r\n\r\npig   sty,  his  application  is  turned  down.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the farmers want to live on the land.  This\r\n\r\nis   for  the  purpose  of  making  a  living.   Any\r\n\r\napplication  to  extend the building  or  build  pig\r\n\r\nsties   is  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Yet all these requests have been  ignored\r\n\r\nby  the Government. They say that what I say here is\r\n\r\nridiculous,   because  they  have   understood   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of this. In my constituency there  is  a\r\n\r\nplace  where  there is a prawn pond and the  farmers\r\n\r\ncan support my argument. The Members opposite can go\r\n\r\nthere  to  investigate. Let  the  members  of  their\r\n\r\nbranches go there to find out. My land is not  Crown\r\n\r\nland.  It  is  private land. There is a small  prawn\r\n\r\npond owned by me, and this land is also private land\r\n\r\nacquired through proper means. During the course  of\r\n\r\ntime, prawn ponds have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  built. Some farmers have been arrested by  the\r\n\r\nmilitary authorities because of encroachment on  the\r\n\r\nland.  The result is that I have been approached  by\r\n\r\nthese  people for help. I went along to the military\r\n\r\nauthorities and got the release of these farmers. So\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  in this area think I am an influential\r\n\r\nman and have been able to get their release. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  I have been reelected by them again. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nSo  in  this  frame  of mind  they  think  I  am  an\r\n\r\ninfluential  man, and they make use of  my  name  to\r\n\r\napply  for land in order to tide over the difficulty\r\n\r\nby saying that the land belongs to me. If you do not\r\n\r\nbelieve   what   I  say,  you  can  carry   out   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation to look for the truth. I can challenge\r\n\r\nthem to look for the truth. If the investigation  is\r\n\r\nagainst me, then I am quite prepared to go to court.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they will have to apologise to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture said that I applied for a permit to get land for the purpose of building a prawn pond. But you can go and ask your own jackals in my area who know what the true position is. They are not aware of the true position and they try to force the matter on me. The land actually belongs to the military authorities. They use force to recover the land, thinking that it belongs to me. So they want to deprive me of the land and the benefit thereof. But that does not affect me at all, in so far as the vested interest in the land is concerned.\r\n\r\nAll   this   goes  to  show  that  these   political\r\n\r\nnincompoops of the P.A.P. will resort to  all  sorts\r\n\r\nof  dirty means to attack their political opponents.\r\n\r\nInsofar  as it is to their political interest,  they\r\n\r\ndo not mind. If anything is politically advantageous\r\n\r\nto  their  opponents, then they will resort  to  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  tactics to remove these advantages.  Now,\r\n\r\neven if you occupy a piece of private land, you will\r\n\r\nhave  to get a permit first before you can put up  a\r\n\r\npig sty. In these circumstances, many farmers are at\r\n\r\ntheir wits' end. So I hope the Government will relax\r\n\r\ncertain  restrictions in regard to applications  for\r\n\r\nconstruction of structures and pig sties to help the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the poor farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, this\r\n\r\nlong  theme  of  woe interests the Land  Office  and\r\n\r\ntransactions in the Land Office. They all  have  for\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jalan Kayu very personal and somewhat\r\n\r\npainful  and  unprofitable  connotations.   If   one\r\n\r\nillegally  embarks  on  a business  venture  without\r\n\r\npermission  from the Land Office and is subsequently\r\n\r\ndiscovered, then the law must follow. Why should the\r\n\r\nlaw  now  be  binding, particularly as  one  of  the\r\n\r\neminent Members of this Assembly makes the law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, apart from his personal interests in these\r\n\r\nmatters,  may  I go on to say this?  There  are  two\r\n\r\npoints  he  has made two valid points  of  substance\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think merit a firm reply. First, additions\r\n\r\nto  squatter  huts on Crown land. Second,  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  Crown takes a firm stand against  further\r\n\r\nillegal buildings which, according to him, leads  to\r\n\r\nunhappiness for squatters on private land. This is a\r\n\r\nperennial problem. Crown lands are of two kinds when\r\n\r\nyou  let them out. One is under Temporary Occupation\r\n\r\nLicences,  the other is under a proper  lease.  What\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Jalan Kayu was referring  to  were\r\n\r\nTemporary Occupation Licences. In other words,  land\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  earmarked for  public  development\r\n\r\n- schools,  clinics,  community  centres,  veterinary\r\n\r\ncentres and so on. Sooner or later, maybe this  year\r\n\r\nor  next year, but definitely within the foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture  - five to ten years - there will  be  building\r\n\r\nand  user of land. And the more extensions we allow,\r\n\r\nthe  more compensation will have to be paid  out  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds. It is not our money. It is the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's money. Is the Member for Jalan  Kayu\r\n\r\nseriously   suggesting   that   we,   having    been\r\n\r\nsufficiently  humane in allowing the encroachers  to\r\n\r\nremain   and  giving  them  a  Temporary  Occupation\r\n\r\nLicence  at nominal rent, should further burden  the\r\n\r\npublic   treasury   by   the  prospect   of   bigger\r\n\r\ncompensation  when  the land is ultimately  required\r\n\r\nfor  use?  If  he  does, and he thinks  he  can  win\r\n\r\npopular public support, then I say he should move  a\r\n\r\nresolution  in  this Assembly and we will  hear  his\r\n\r\nreasons why we should pursue his policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that there is a shortage of land\r\n\r\nin Singapore, as can he seen from the efforts of the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  National  Development  in  reclaiming\r\n\r\nKallang  Basin,  the seaside from  Bedok  to  Nicoll\r\n\r\nHighway and Merdeka Bridge, and my own little effort\r\n\r\nin  London  to  get back 300 acres of  farming  land\r\n\r\ninside  the  Naval Base. All this we get  no  thanks\r\n\r\nfor. What we are asked to do is something which,  to\r\n\r\nmy  mind, is manifestly wrong - to burden public land\r\n\r\nwith more tenants who will claim more compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private land is in an entirely different category.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the policy of this Government  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the policy of previous  Governments.\r\n\r\nThis  Government  has  an  assessment  policy  which\r\n\r\nactively   discourages  the  holding  of  land   for\r\n\r\nspeculative purposes, in other words, buying  a  big\r\n\r\npiece  of  land,  squatting on  it,  waiting  for  a\r\n\r\nfraction  of  time  for an increase  in  population,\r\n\r\ndevelopment  around the area which  will  bring  the\r\n\r\nprice  up, and then selling it. Whether a  house  is\r\n\r\nvacant  or not, assessment is put up. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes necessary for the land-owner to utilise  his\r\n\r\nland.  Sir, if this were a Government out to protect\r\n\r\nthe  landlords, squatters would not have got  in  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place, let alone expand their  holdings.\r\n\r\nadding  rooms  to squatter huts. There  is  a  whole\r\n\r\nkampong now in Kampong Chentek, another one  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the area between the Race Course and  Sime\r\n\r\nRoad, private land, squatted. If we had let out  our\r\n\r\nCrown  land  on  T.O.L.s and held them,  this  thing\r\n\r\nwould  not  have taken place. I am not  saying  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  an answer to the problem. Here was  vacant\r\n\r\nland  not  utilised, not looked after, and squatters\r\n\r\nhave  moved  in. The last I saw of  it  was  that  a\r\n\r\ntelephone  has  been installed  and  so  have  water\r\n\r\npipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that ultimately a land policy may\r\n\r\nhave to be formulated in which vacant land user  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  be acquired for public disposal.  But  the\r\n\r\nplain   fact  of  the  matter  remains,   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot prevent the private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland-owner from allowing or not disallowing his\r\n\r\nland for certain uses.

Let me also add  that  those  who\r\n\r\nacquire  citizenship have done so within the context\r\n\r\nthat  they have come to this country freely and have\r\n\r\nbeen given the liberty to exercise the franchise  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That,  however,  does  not   mean   that\r\n\r\nconferment of citizenship would allow such a  person\r\n\r\nliberties  which he would not have exercised  before\r\n\r\nhe  acquired  citizenship. We are  aware  that  many\r\n\r\npeople  have sought citizenship with a purpose  and,\r\n\r\nhaving  acquired the citizenship, their loyalty  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  towards the country which has given  them\r\n\r\nthe  liberty to prosper and enjoy the freedom  which\r\n\r\nthey  have  had. There are a number of  people  who,\r\n\r\nhaving   acquired  and  enjoyed  the  privilege   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  now seek to destroy  the  security  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. The law provides that such people in  this\r\n\r\ncategory  should be asked whether or not  they  have\r\n\r\nabused  the  citizenship that has been  given  them.\r\n\r\nWhatever  action the Government has  taken  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect  has  been done according  to  the  relevant\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance and I do not  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tampines  ought to  complain  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not doing its duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I personally feel\r\n\r\nthat  those persons who are facing the possible loss\r\n\r\nof their citizenship must be given a chance in Court\r\n\r\nto  prove  that they are really guilty  of  being  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the security of Malaya and Singapore  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  innocent may be protected.

The\r\n\r\nincrease from $2,500 in 1963 to $20,000 in  1964  is\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  the  new agreement  on  overtime\r\n\r\nallowances effective from 1st January, 1962, entered\r\n\r\ninto   between   the  Government   and   the   union\r\n\r\nrepresenting  these grades. Overtime  allowance  was\r\n\r\npreviously  paid  to launch-crews  only.  Under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  agreement, it was paid to all Division  IV\r\n\r\npersonnel  which include signalmen and  Port  Office\r\n\r\nstaff. Previously, overtime allowance was paid on  a\r\n\r\ndaily  basis  of a nine-hour day and  time  off  was\r\n\r\ngiven in lieu of work done on Sundays, rest days and\r\n\r\npublic  holidays.  Under  the  agreement  made  now,\r\n\r\novertime allowance is paid on the basis of a 44-hour\r\n\r\nweek.  Time off cannot be given in lieu and  payment\r\n\r\nmust  be  made at double rate for work on rest  days\r\n\r\nand  public  holidays. On all  days  which  are  not\r\n\r\nSundays  and  holidays, duty between 8.00  p.m. and 6.00 a.m. must be paid at one-quarter rate. The main\r\n\r\nincrease  is  due  to  essential  services  of  port\r\n\r\nhealth,  port office and signal stations  which  are\r\n\r\nmaintained on a 24-hour basis throughout  the  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is a service which has been introduced by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  it has been appreciated  very  much\r\n\r\nindeed by the shipping lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am surprised to\r\n\r\nhear the amendment moved by the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  provision is for overtime in order  to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  workers to get more allowance.

It is alleged that during the recent election the P.A.P. forced the members of the Work Brigade to campaign for their candidates in the various constituencies, to\r\n\r\nput  up posters and carry out other propaganda  work\r\n\r\nand to intimidate the voters. Did the members of the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  obey their orders? No, they  did  not\r\n\r\nobey  them, but they were forced to do so. They were\r\n\r\ntold  that if they did not obey the Government, they\r\n\r\nwould not be able to get jobs. Now if they were able\r\n\r\nto  take on jobs as school servants and clerks or in\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  other Government  departments,  they\r\n\r\nwould get at least a minimum salary of $100, whereas\r\n\r\nin the Work Brigade they get less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the Prime Minister tours the rural areas,\r\n\r\nmembers of the Work Brigade are forced to cheer him,\r\n\r\nshout  slogans and welcome him. This is  all  wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Government is using public money to pay them  to\r\n\r\ndo  party work. This is not proper. If some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  are willing to work for the Party, that  is\r\n\r\nanother  matter. But some members told us that  they\r\n\r\nwere forced to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso.  They had to go to the various branches  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to work for the Party and to maintain  them.\r\n\r\nThis is very wrong. We hope that the Government will\r\n\r\nnot  repeat this in future. Some members may be used\r\n\r\nby  you,  but it is best for you not to force  those\r\n\r\nwho do not want to be used by you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu made many allegations against  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade. He said that the Government made use of the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade to campaign and to put up posters  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. during  the recent  election.  He  also\r\n\r\naccused  us  of  forcing the  members  of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  to  do  this  work.  I  think  it  is   not\r\n\r\nsurprising for us to hear what he has said,  because\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade is not with them.  They  can  say\r\n\r\nwhatever  they like. I would like to ask the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu to recollect that when he was on this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House he visited the Work  Brigade  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions because in his area there  are  many\r\n\r\nroads which were built by the Work Brigade. If he is\r\n\r\nnot forgetful, he will remember that I also went  to\r\n\r\nhis  constituency  to look at the roads  which  were\r\n\r\nbuilt  by the Work Brigade. I do not think  he  will\r\n\r\ndeny this. The Government set up this Work Brigade because there is a real need for it. At present, the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  comprises more  than  2,000  members.\r\n\r\nWithout the Work Brigade, these people will have  to\r\n\r\nface the problem of unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their speeches during the past few days, the\r\n\r\nBarisan   have   shown   great   concern   for   the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem of the people. The  Government\r\n\r\nset up this Work Brigade to absorb the youths so  as\r\n\r\nto  give  them training and to provide jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service. Is this not one of the means  of\r\n\r\nabsorbing  our unemployed? Many roads and drains  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas have been built by the Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas know this very well.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the expansion of the Work Brigade  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with our needs and our circumstances.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  want to expand it. The Member  for  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh was once in charge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Work Brigade. At that time he was  full  of\r\n\r\nadmiration  for the Work Brigade, but when  he  left\r\n\r\nthe  Party he made allegations as to how the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nforced  members of the Work Brigade to work for  our\r\n\r\nParty.  But  the people of Singapore know  that  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Work Brigade have made  their  due\r\n\r\ncontribution to the welfare of the people.  Whatever\r\n\r\nallegations  they make will not be believed  by  the\r\n\r\npeople. The Government's explanation perhaps is that\r\n\r\nsome  departments in Singapore have been taken  over\r\n\r\nby the Federal Government, but in spite of what they\r\n\r\nsay,  you just cannot say that there can be  such  a\r\n\r\ngreat   difference  between  the   two   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, because the new Estimates are  only  one-fifteenth of the former Estimates. From this  point,\r\n\r\none can expect that the facilities to be extended to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore will decrease considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on\r\n\r\nthe  question  of the Work Brigade - whether  it  can\r\n\r\nsolve the question of unemployment can be seen  from\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that since its inception there  are  only\r\n\r\n7,000  members in it, and we can see the success  of\r\n\r\nonly  2,000  members.  It is  not  the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the Work Brigade is desirable or  not,  but\r\n\r\nwhether  the  P.A.P think that the Work Brigade  can\r\n\r\nsolve  all the unemployment problems. We cannot  see\r\n\r\nany  good  results from the Work Brigade  under  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. My colleague, the Member for Jalan Kayu,  has\r\n\r\nsaid something, but let me give you further facts to\r\n\r\nshow  that the P.A.P. in organising the Work Brigade\r\n\r\nare  not  really interested in the workers'  welfare\r\n\r\nbut  are merely interested in making use of them  as\r\n\r\ntheir  political instruments. On the matter  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Work Brigade being used to  campaign\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. during the September elections,  we\r\n\r\nhave  already talked about it and there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor me to touch on it any more, but I would like  to\r\n\r\nmention  one  thing.  In Thomson  there  is  a  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  camp.  Now, what are the members  doing  in\r\n\r\nthat area, or what work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave they done? They have only built the road at  51\r\n\r\nmilestone,  Thomson Road, opposite  Thomson  Estate.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  the  road  leads  to  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman  of the P.A.P. Branch there. But there  are\r\n\r\nmany other roads in the Thomson area which are in  a\r\n\r\nvery bad condition. Yet the Work Brigade Camp in the\r\n\r\nThomson area has never been assigned to repair those\r\n\r\nroads. At the 6th and 7th mile called Rambutan Road,\r\n\r\nthere is another road. The condition of the road  is\r\n\r\nvery  bad.  There are many other roads in  very  bad\r\n\r\ncondition,  and other areas in Singapore which  have\r\n\r\nnever been looked after or taken care of by the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade under the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago there was a news item in the Press\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the P.A.P. Thomson Branch  had  a  new\r\n\r\nbuilding and the Work Brigade members were asked  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in the Opening Ceremony to decorate the Branch\r\n\r\nOffice  and  one of the members was electrocuted  in\r\n\r\nthe course of decorating the Office. Now these facts\r\n\r\ngo  to  show that the P.A.P. are making use  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  members  to further  their  political\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang will not be so\r\n\r\nvery  forgetful about what took place  in  the  last\r\n\r\nelections  at  Sembawang,  when  the  Work   Brigade\r\n\r\nmembers were used to help him, and also some members\r\n\r\nof  the  Work Brigade were made use of  to  beat  up\r\n\r\nBarisan members for no reason. Now, this is a  fact.\r\n\r\nAll  those  who  were beaten up  have  their  wounds\r\n\r\nremaining to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. perpetrate evil deeds, they want us\r\n\r\nto  go  along  with them. The question  now  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether those beaten up by the P.A.P. men are  still\r\n\r\nto be seen running about in the streets, but whether\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are going to let members  of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  do  work  for the people and  not  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. itself. That is a matter of policy. If  they\r\n\r\nreally  want  to use the Work Brigade to  solve  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem and to help repair  roads  and\r\n\r\nbridges  and build roads and do other work  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  general public, then we will have no opposition\r\n\r\nto  it. This question is very serious.

If the Government can use the Work Brigade to\r\n\r\nhelp  in  this respect but they cannot or will  not,\r\n\r\nthen we will really condemn them. What value can  be\r\n\r\nobtained  by  allotting money to  support  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade? I would ask the Government. What value  has\r\n\r\nalready  been derived from this provision? Since  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have also said something relating to this\r\n\r\nsubject, that is why I would not like to say more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, let\r\n\r\nme   talk   briefly   about  the   allegations   and\r\n\r\naccusations of the Member for Thomson.

I do not know  whether  he\r\n\r\nunderstands  human nature, because you can  force  a\r\n\r\nchap  to  do  a  certain thing, but  you  definitely\r\n\r\ncannot force him to intimidate another man. He  said\r\n\r\nthat   these  people  helped  the  P.A.P. in   the\r\n\r\nelections. Well, the Work Brigade is a force of over\r\n\r\n2,000  young  men. This is a democratic country  and\r\n\r\nthese  people have their own beliefs.  They  are  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  religions and they have  affiliations  to\r\n\r\ndifferent Parties. If some of them want to help  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. outside  their office  hours,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason why they should not do so. For that matter, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  some  of them may have helped  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. As regards intimidation and the beating up\r\n\r\nof  people, I think the Barisan boys have beaten  up\r\n\r\nand have intimidated more of our chaps. In fact,  if\r\n\r\nwhat they say is true, they can resort to the law;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  can  make a report to the police and then  the\r\n\r\nlaw will take its own natural course of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another allegation made that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his tours of the constituencies  makes\r\n\r\nuse  of  the Work Brigade. That is true.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his tours of the constituencies  has  in\r\n\r\nattendance  staff from every department because  the\r\n\r\npurpose of his tours is to find out from the  people\r\n\r\nwhat  they  want.  Therefore, he  has  with  him  in\r\n\r\nattendance  people from the Public Works Department,\r\n\r\npeople  from  the  Work  Brigade,  people  from  the\r\n\r\nC.B.S.,  people from the P.U.B., so that whenever  a\r\n\r\nrequest is made of him on the spot, he will be  able\r\n\r\nto  weigh  and will be able to discuss  the  problem\r\n\r\nwhich the people have right on the spot. In the same\r\n\r\nway, the Work Brigade is a disciplined force. We use\r\n\r\nit  to control the huge crowds that turn up whenever\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister visits the constituencies.  Now,\r\n\r\nthey  say  that the Work Brigade is a useless  body,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am glad to hear from the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nthat if we can prove that the Work Brigade does work\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the public, he will fully support\r\n\r\nit.  I  do not know whether he goes around with  his\r\n\r\neyes  closed  or  whether he just goes  to  Thomson.\r\n\r\nSingapore  does  not consist only of Thomson.  There\r\n\r\nare  51  constituencies in Singapore and  there  are\r\n\r\nlots   of   things   to  be  done   in   all   these\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  So it does not mean  that,  because\r\n\r\none  or two roads in Thomson are being made up,  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade has not done work elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, Sir, and for the information\r\n\r\nof  this  House, I would like to tell him  that  the\r\n\r\nWork   Brigade   in   1963   undertook   this   work\r\n\r\n- construction and maintenance of rural  and  kampong\r\n\r\nroads, construction and repair of timber bridges  in\r\n\r\nrural areas. Sir, if I read the whole list, it  will\r\n\r\ntake  a  long  time. There is on this list  here  20\r\n\r\nitems   which  the  Work  Brigade  has  done   - land\r\n\r\nreclamation,   site   preparation   for    Sembawang\r\n\r\nresettlement  areas.  Now, it does  not  mean  that,\r\n\r\nbecause in Thomson there are two roads made up,  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade has not been doing anything. There  is,\r\n\r\nfor instance, the Kallang River\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprovement scheme, co-operation of Jalan Damar  and\r\n\r\nTanah  Merah  sanitary  scheme,  and  also  in   the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  improvement  schemes  under   the\r\n\r\nheading of fish prawn culture.

They are trying to whip up\r\n\r\ndiscontent  among the members of the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nagainst the Barisan Sosialis by saying so.

This sort  of\r\n\r\ntalk  is  more  or  less intimidation  against  some\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Work Brigade who are now supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis.

What  is  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  about?  It is that the P.A.P. are  misusing\r\n\r\npublic  funds  by  establishing an  organisation  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  its own political Party. The Government\r\n\r\nare trying to adopt the policy of starvation against\r\n\r\nsome  unemployed youths in Singapore and induce them\r\n\r\nto  join  the Work Brigade under the guise  of  road\r\n\r\nconstruction  and other work. But  the  real  motive\r\n\r\nbehind  all  these acts is to make use of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade for its own political ends. And this we  are\r\n\r\nopposed.  We  are against all methods by  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment try to make use of public funds for their\r\n\r\nown  political ends. That is all I wish to say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Chairman, as far as I remember, when we started\r\n\r\nthe   organisation  of  the  Work  Brigade,  it  was\r\n\r\nactually mooted by the Member for Hong Lim with  the\r\n\r\nidea of alleviating the problem of unemployment. The\r\n\r\noriginal  intention of the Government in setting  up\r\n\r\nthe  Work Brigade was, on the one hand, to help some\r\n\r\nunemployed persons to have relief work in  order  to\r\n\r\nearn  their livelihood; on the other hand, to assist\r\n\r\nvillagers  in  getting more sanitary  amenities  and\r\n\r\nother  health  services in the various rural  areas,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the construction of drains, the removal  of\r\n\r\nlallang,  and  such other work. So the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nwas  originally set up to serve the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember that we had a camp in Sembawang to absorb\r\n\r\nsome  unemployed youths in that area. In fact,  most\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Sembawang camp of the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\ncame  from the villages around this area. This shows\r\n\r\nthat  the Work Brigade has the support of the people\r\n\r\nin  general.  If  we  do not close  our  eyes  while\r\n\r\nwalking  around Singapore Island, then  we  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  there  are a lot of Work Brigade men  at  work\r\n\r\nclearing  the  drains, assisting farmers  to  remove\r\n\r\nweeds  and  lallang, and helping them do  some  work\r\n\r\nwhich they are unable to do themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Barisan Sosialis has the effrontery to turn\r\n\r\nround  and  say that we are making use of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade for our political purposes. I remember  when\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis left the P.A.P. there  was  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  members  in  the Work  Brigade  who  were\r\n\r\nsupporters  of  the Barisan Sosialis then  and  they\r\n\r\nwere  expelled because they were trying to  obstruct\r\n\r\nwhatever  measures the Government were  adopting  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the rural areas. Some of these people  even\r\n\r\nwent  to the extent of burning the bicycles  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  people and assaulting some members  who  were\r\n\r\nnot members of the Barisan Sosialis. As a result  of\r\n\r\ntheir  behaviour, there was a lot of chaos  in  the\r\n\r\nWork   Brigade  camps.  These  trouble-makers   were\r\n\r\nexpelled  because of their misbehaviour in the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  and because of their attempts  to  whip  up\r\n\r\nrebellious feelings in the Work Brigade.  They  even\r\n\r\ntried  to  turn  members of the  Work  Brigade  into\r\n\r\nrioters. I remember the Member for Thomson  said  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech that in the event of some union  members\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  Barisan  Sosialis, they  would  be\r\n\r\npersecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Nanyang undergraduates, I\r\n\r\nremember  there  were lorry loads  carrying  Nanyang\r\n\r\nundergraduates   with  the   banners   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,   and  some  banners  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  appealing to the public to vote  for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. We have seen all this but  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  say  that  all  the undergraduates  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  are supporting the Barisan Sosialis.

I just mentioned  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity in passing to show that there was nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  in  some members of the Work Brigade  helping\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. This was because these members believe in\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of the P.A.P. and they  came  out  to\r\n\r\nsupport the P.A.P. There was nothing wrong in it  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Jurong a few moments\r\n\r\nago said that he was not saying that all members  of \r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade were bad hats but, on  the  other \r\n\r\nhand,  he  said that in the Work Brigade there  were \r\n\r\nsome  members who have been forced to join the  Work \r\n\r\nBrigade  by  the Government's starvation  policy.  I\r\n\r\njust  do  not  understand how there could  be  2,000\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Work Brigade if they were forced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government's starvation policy to join the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.

It is because the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  did  not help the Barisan Sosialis  in  the\r\n\r\nelections that they turn round and accuse  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  of  certain things. Now, if  we  apply  the\r\n\r\nargument further, we say that Nanyang University has\r\n\r\nbeen  used  by  the  Barisan  because  some  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents have been helping them. Can you say all  of\r\n\r\nthem belong to the Barisan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the existence of the Work Brigade at present is significant.

We know the work done by it. We  also\r\n\r\nknow  the  motive behind the setting up of the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.   What  we  oppose  is  that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  making use of the  Work  Brigade  to\r\n\r\nattain   their  political  ends.  The  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  said certain members of the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nwere expelled because they burned bicycles and cars.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, do you think that people  really\r\n\r\nbelieve  this?  Can the Government  allow  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade members to burn bicycles and cars?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that as far as we know, some\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Work Brigade were expelled  because\r\n\r\nmany of them did not want themselves to be made  use\r\n\r\nof  as  spectators to welcome the Prime Minister  on\r\n\r\nhis  visits.  They did not want to  obey  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  as a result they were expelled.  They\r\n\r\nwere  expelled  because they did not want  to  allow\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  be  made use of  by  the  P.A.P.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the P.A.P. do not want to admit it, because\r\n\r\nthis  is shameful. If they do not want to admit  it,\r\n\r\nit  is our duty to reveal the facts to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my area, Paya Lebar, during the\r\n\r\nelection,  at  night, there were two lorry-loads  of\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade members who encamped near the Airport.\r\n\r\nThey patrolled the area and pulled down the election\r\n\r\nposters  of  their opponents.

Can these people be considered as  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  gangsters, beating up people  during  the\r\n\r\nlate nights, as though this country has gone back to\r\n\r\nthe  law  of  the jungle?

The tongue  speaks\r\n\r\nfor  the  heart.  Therefore,  members  of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade are very angry. They have served the  public\r\n\r\nby  cleaning drains and making up roads. The Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   threw  wild  allegations  - salary   $150;\r\n\r\nrunning  dogs  of Lee Kuan Yew, and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.

Of course, the  members  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade did not dare do such a thing. But they\r\n\r\ndid  it because they were thinking of their work and\r\n\r\nof  their  stomach.

I would like to ask \r\n\r\nthe Government   some  questions  in   regard   to   \r\n\r\nthe inspection of houses, structures, chicken-sheds  \r\n\r\nand pig-sties built by the farmers. This department also\r\n\r\nhas the duty of inspecting attap houses built by the\r\n\r\nfarmers.  Of  course,  we do not  agree  that  attap\r\n\r\nhouses  can  be built at any place. But we  can  see\r\n\r\nonly  a  few  houses  in  certain  areas  where  the\r\n\r\npopulation  is  not dense. We can  see  one  or  two\r\n\r\nhouses in certain areas with families staying there,\r\n\r\nkeeping  poultry and rearing pigs and chickens.  But\r\n\r\nthis  department  has sent out notices  to  demolish\r\n\r\ntheir  houses.  But when I visited those  places,  I\r\n\r\nfound the chicken-sheds and huts were so small  that\r\n\r\nthey  could not even accommodate the Minister's car.\r\n\r\nEven   such   structures  were  given  notices   for\r\n\r\ndemolition.  For the sake of making a living,  those\r\n\r\npeople  have  to  set up small  sheds  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  livelihood. Yet the Government  are\r\n\r\ngiving them notices to demolish the structures. Even\r\n\r\ntheir  applications to extend the buildings,  houses\r\n\r\nand  sheds  have been turned down, Even requests  to\r\n\r\nrepair leaking roofs have been turned down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to see the Chief Building Surveyor and he\r\n\r\ntold   me   that  this  was  a  matter   under   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Minister. He himself  could  not\r\n\r\ndo  anything. Since he said that he could do nothing\r\n\r\nin this respect, I thought that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   farmers  might  go  to  see   the   Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned. But the Minister did not care to see them\r\n\r\nbecause these problems did not affect him. So he was\r\n\r\nnot  unduly  worried about it. But these things  are\r\n\r\nclosely  linked  up  with  the  livelihood  of   the\r\n\r\nfarmers.  The ordinary chicken-sheds, pig-sties  and\r\n\r\nstructures are also being dealt in this way  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There were houses which  were  somewhat\r\n\r\nextended; the extensions were not very extensive and\r\n\r\nyet  they were prohibited and notices were given for\r\n\r\nthem  to  be  demolished. Of course, there  must  be\r\n\r\ncases  where the Government could remind the farmers\r\n\r\nin  advance about what could be done and what should\r\n\r\nnot  be  done because the farmers in general  cannot\r\n\r\nknow   the   niceties  of  laws,   regulations   and\r\n\r\nprocedures   of   the  different  departments.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should spend some time explaining to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  so  as to guide and teach them. Then  there\r\n\r\nwill be fewer cases of farmers building unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this point in order to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be flexible. It should  not  try  to\r\n\r\ndemolish such unauthorised structures whenever  they\r\n\r\nare  built. The Government should, at least, in  its\r\n\r\npublicity work, enlighten the farmers on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San and Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

He\r\n\r\nalleged  that  I was not interested  in  seeing  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. As far as I can remember, I am available to\r\n\r\nanybody who has a legitimate grievance to air, and I\r\n\r\ndo  not  remember any of the farmers wanting to  see\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give notice to quit or notice of demolition\r\n\r\nunder   certain  circumstances.  Firstly,   if   the\r\n\r\nbuilding  is unauthorised; secondly, if the  repairs\r\n\r\nor  the  enlargement is not according to  the  plans\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   been   submitted,  or  the   enlargement   is\r\n\r\nunauthorised.  We have staff in our  department  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to help these farmers if they  really\r\n\r\nwant to undertake legitimate repairs. In most of the\r\n\r\ncases that we have come across, they are not repairs\r\n\r\nbut   enlargements   and   extensions   of   illegal\r\n\r\nbuildings.  As  I have said before,  there  must  be\r\n\r\ncontrol,  not  only over attap huts, but  even  over\r\n\r\nwell   constructed  modern  flats.  There  must   be\r\n\r\ncontrol,  otherwise there would  be  chaos  in  this\r\n\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time there is an unauthorised erection, we\r\n\r\nsend  people there to investigate, and in most cases\r\n\r\nwe  find  that they are either unauthorised  or  the\r\n\r\nreconstruction  that has taken  place  has  involved\r\n\r\nadditional  floor area to the building.  Very  often\r\n\r\nadditional  living units complete with living  room,\r\n\r\nkitchen and toilet facilities have been added to the\r\n\r\noriginal  building. If these were allowed to  go  on\r\n\r\nunchecked,  very soon you would have an  area  where\r\n\r\nyou  would  find that there is no access, and  where\r\n\r\nusually  it is a fire trap, as in the case of  Bukit\r\n\r\nHo  Swee and the two fires that happened recently in\r\n\r\nGeylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if a farmer really wants to build,\r\n\r\nhe  can always come and see our staff; submit a plan\r\n\r\nwhich is according to specifications and which  will\r\n\r\nallow him to have a healthy house, As the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  has said, some of these  units  are  so\r\n\r\nsmall  that  even a car cannot be put in. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthese  are  not  fit for habitation. Must  we  allow\r\n\r\nunits of this type to be put up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He  has  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand dollars a month. He has a car and  he  owns\r\n\r\nhouses.  He  does not know the difficulties  of  the\r\n\r\nvillagers and the farmers.

Our constructive  suggestions\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  rural development  have  not  been\r\n\r\npublicised adequately, and there has been a  lot  of\r\n\r\nallegations against the Government for their failure\r\n\r\nto improve the lot of the poor farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning there were about 20 families in the\r\n\r\nLim  Chu Kang area who have had their farms,  houses\r\n\r\nand vegetables affected adversely. This morning when\r\n\r\nI went there I saw a riot squad, policemen, red vans\r\n\r\nand  radio  cars  and some Malays  carrying  knives,\r\n\r\nwooden sticks and parangs. Bulldozers were also used\r\n\r\nover  the  vegetable farms. How did  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs   come   about?  This   is   the   so-called\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention of helping  the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nlive  in flats, so that action can be taken to drive\r\n\r\nthem away from their farms.
