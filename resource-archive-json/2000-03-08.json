Items  being  considered  for  improvement\r\n\r\ninclude  landscaping, play equipment, park furniture and  the\r\n\r\nwidening of footpaths.  This will be over and above  the  on-going  maintenance  works provided by the various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had earlier deferred the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  scheme  due  to the economic  downturn.   Since  the\r\n\r\neconomy  has  recovered, we will proceed  to  reactivate  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  The Ministry of National Development is currently in\r\n\r\nthe  process of working out the implementation details of the\r\n\r\nscheme.   The  Committee is looking into the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nstarting one or two pilot projects in the second half of this\r\n\r\nyear.   This will enable the Committee to learn the best  way\r\n\r\nto   improve   the  physical  environment  of   the   private\r\n\r\nresidential  estates.  Selection criteria  will  include  the\r\n\r\nphysical  condition of the estate, and the level of community\r\n\r\nbonding and support among the residents in the estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary  Secretary, in  the  selection  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  estates, can I volunteer some of the private estates\r\n\r\nin  my constituency because I had actually proposed this idea\r\n\r\nsome years ago and it had not been taken up?

The  private  sector  is  driven  by  the\r\n\r\nbottomline,  be  it  profit and loss  or  value-added.   This\r\n\r\nphilosophy  is  usually embraced by the entire  organisation,\r\n\r\nliterally  through  thick  and  thin,  through  mergers   and\r\n\r\nacquisitions or through industry restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with this, performance targets are in place\r\n\r\nfor   the   majority   of  private  enterprises.    Employees\r\n\r\ncontribute  accordingly and generally  cannot  but  feel  the\r\n\r\npulse  of  the  underlying industry.  This  is  most  evident\r\n\r\nduring the recession and the restructuring of the electronics\r\n\r\nsector.   Retrenchment,  as  we  all  know,  was  a   painful\r\n\r\nexperience  for  those  affected. The reality  was  that  the\r\n\r\nprofitability of their companies had a direct impact on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token and to complement a fast changing and\r\n\r\ntechnology-driven   economy,   the   public    sector    will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  be expected to deliver acceptable  value-added.\r\n\r\nThis  is  particularly  so  as  technology  will  force  more\r\n\r\ntransparency  on  the  entire  supply  chain,  including  the\r\n\r\ndelivery of public services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, every public sector employee will soon be forced\r\n\r\nto  focus on customer satisfaction at each level, and  to  be\r\n\r\nmore innovative and entrepreneurial in his approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our limited manpower resources would be another\r\n\r\nreason for narrowing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany  disparity in the terms of employment between the  public\r\n\r\nand  private sectors.  If nothing else, a disparity makes for\r\n\r\ndifficult  deployment of capable civil servants to for-profit\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies or even the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps inevitable that a performance-based\r\n\r\nvariable may eventually dominate the overall compensation  of\r\n\r\na  typical worker in Singapore.  In the private sector,  this\r\n\r\nalready  takes the form of actual bonuses paid out  or  stock\r\n\r\noptions.  An appropriate equivalent would have to  be  worked\r\n\r\nout  for civil servants in the long run and, in fact, for all\r\n\r\npublic sector employees. Otherwise, the call for them  to  be\r\n\r\nmore entrepreneurial would ring hollow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Prime Minister on how\r\n\r\nthe  vision of a more entrepreneurial public sector  will  be\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the need to\r\n\r\nintegrate communication and response to the public as part of\r\n\r\nthe assessment of civil servants, especially among its elite.\r\n\r\nIn  this  sense, my remarks follow on what the MP for  Marine\r\n\r\nParade GRC has spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have come to expect greater\r\n\r\nconsultation and participation in public life.  In the 1980s,\r\n\r\nthe  then  Deputy  Prime Minister, Mr  Goh  Chok  Tong,  made\r\n\r\ngreater consultation one of the central aspects of the second\r\n\r\ngeneration   government.   Institutions  for  feedback   were\r\n\r\ncreated, consultation increased, town councils were  used  to\r\n\r\ndevolve more authority and participation to the local level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decade since Prime Minister Goh has come into\r\n\r\noffice, further steps have been taken. CDCs now try to  bring\r\n\r\nGovernment  even  closer  to the  people.  The  Singapore  21\r\n\r\ninitiative set up by Prime Minister Goh aims for the ideal of\r\n\r\n\"active citizens\".  This vision is not of a strong people and\r\n\r\na  weak  Government.  Nor is it a vision of  people  opposing\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Singapore 21 envisions the ideal  of  a  society\r\n\r\nwhich  people  and  Government work together,  and  both  are\r\n\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When future generations look back on these 10 years,\r\n\r\nhistory  may well judge that greater consultation and greater\r\n\r\nparticipation  are part of the legacy left by Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh and his team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, there are some who believe that\r\n\r\nwhat we have experienced is more of a function of the present\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's personal style.  Some may  point  out  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  is  not  explicitly  the  vision  of  a  third\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  leaders.  Many hope that they  will  come  to\r\n\r\nembrace  this vision, but there is no guarantee  at  present,\r\n\r\nand  this is why I turn to the question of the civil  service\r\n\r\nand  institutionalising  their  ability  and  willingness  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate and respond to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a recent debate in the public press which I\r\n\r\nshall  not touch on.  However, it is clear that the questions\r\n\r\nraised were not simply about the National Library or the Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  Park, but broader issues, such as whether there should\r\n\r\nbe  benchmarks for the civil service in dealing  with  public\r\n\r\nconsultation  or whether the examples touched  upon  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate can and should be improved in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I personally remain optimistic. Promises made are\r\n\r\ngenuinely  meant and the change and improvements  will  come.\r\n\r\nBut I would urge the processes that promote change should  be\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised. They should be made part  of  a  permanent\r\n\r\nway of how we do things and how we assess the performance  of\r\n\r\nour   civil  servants.   One  very  important  step  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection  would be to integrate this aspect of communication\r\n\r\nand  response  to  the  public in  the  assessment  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants, especially the elite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do this, we are setting the right signal that\r\n\r\nconsultation  is  vital.   By  including  communication   and\r\n\r\nresponse to the public, we will be moving beyond exhortation.\r\n\r\nThe  process of consultation will increasingly be part of the\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  success.  It will no longer be  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nask,  \"Is  the  job done, and how well?\"   It  will  also  be\r\n\r\nasked, \"How was it done?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all decisions can be consulted. Some are\r\n\r\nmarket sensitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOthers  may  touch  on security secrets.  Exceptions  can  be\r\n\r\njustified.  Nor of course does consultation mean that  public\r\n\r\nsuggestions will always be adopted.  In this regard, we  must\r\n\r\naccept  that  consultation is a complex quality  to  measure.\r\n\r\nBut the effort must be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partial analogy can be drawn to the efforts already\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  the Government in improving service  quality.\r\n\r\nThis  has  focused  on  over-the-counter  services  such   as\r\n\r\nreducing  queues  in various departments. Such  services  are\r\n\r\nimportant,  and improvements are relatively easy to  measure.\r\n\r\nWhile  consultation engagements are more complex to  measure,\r\n\r\nthey  are  no less important qualities.  In fact,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  they  will be increasingly demanded by an  increasingly\r\n\r\neducated and cosmopolitan Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because public consultation is more complex, and because\r\n\r\nit   would  be  increasingly  demanded,  the  process  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  begin  now.  Let greater public  consultation  and\r\n\r\nparticipation  go  from  a promise  to  a  basic  premise  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  Singapore.   Let  public  consultation   and\r\n\r\nparticipation be institutionalised for the future.  I hope in\r\n\r\nthis  way, the present Government will lay a foundation stone\r\n\r\nupon which succeeding governments and generations of citizens\r\n\r\ncan build their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, for the past\r\n\r\ndecade,  companies in the United States have been continually\r\n\r\nrestructuring their operations to make themselves leaner  and\r\n\r\nmore  profitable.  Now other countries, including Japan,  are\r\n\r\ndoing  the  same things. In Singapore, we have seen companies\r\n\r\nrestructuring  not because of economic difficulties,  but  to\r\n\r\nbecome more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and the rapid change in technology are\r\n\r\naltering  the way companies operate and the way we work.  Are\r\n\r\nwe  ready  for such drastic changes to our working life?   We\r\n\r\ncould  try  to dig in our heels in an attempt to  stop  these\r\n\r\nchanges.  But this would not serve any good.  If we insist to\r\n\r\nresist  change,  we will do ourselves more  harm  than  good.\r\n\r\nInstead,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  need to react fast and prepare our workers early to  face\r\n\r\nthe challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has to be redesigned to successfully meet the new\r\n\r\ndemands   of   the   knowledge-based  economy   and   sustain\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   For example, companies  have  to  redesign\r\n\r\ntheir  work process to be more responsive to customers. Staff\r\n\r\nhave  to  be empowered with more knowledge and technology  to\r\n\r\ncreate more value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While work redesign is not a new concept, it has taken\r\n\r\non  a  new dimension brought about by our ageing society  and\r\n\r\nhigher  retirement age.  Presently, retirement age is set  at\r\n\r\n62 but, in due course, it will be raised to 67.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides creating greater efficiency in work processes,\r\n\r\nwork  redesign  can  help workers stay employable  for  life,\r\n\r\nthrough customising work processes for this specific purpose.\r\n\r\nWork  redesign will also remove the stigma attached  to  some\r\n\r\nlow-level jobs.  Moreover, the higher the productivity  gain,\r\n\r\nthe better chances there are of our workers to receive better\r\n\r\nearnings and able to enhance their quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector should also consider ways to\r\n\r\nstreamline different schemes of service, better deploy staff,\r\n\r\nand  respond  to the higher expectations of a  more  educated\r\n\r\nworkforce and sustain high productivity gain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me cite the example of PSB. From 1996, clerical\r\n\r\nofficers  were  transformed  into administrative  executives.\r\n\r\nWith  80%  of school leavers going for higher education,  PSB\r\n\r\nfound it difficult to recruit clerical grades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not just a change in title. PSB redesigned the\r\n\r\nwork process, in consultation with the union. The job content\r\n\r\nwas expanded to incorporate higher end administrative duties.\r\n\r\nThe   salary  scales  were  also  adjusted.  A  comprehensive\r\n\r\ntraining programme was put in place to help existing staff to\r\n\r\nacquire  the  new  skills  for the  enriched  role  and  more\r\n\r\nresponsible tasks they have to perform. This project\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenables  PSB employees to pursue more development  programmes\r\n\r\nto  enhance  their  employability.   They  are  now  enjoying\r\n\r\nbetter  career  progression path and a  more  rewarding  work\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Public Service Division will also consider\r\n\r\nsuch  work design initiative for applicable job areas in  the\r\n\r\npublic sector to increase the value of the existing jobs  and\r\n\r\nprovide  structured  training for employees  to  develop  new\r\n\r\ncompetencies.  As our civil servants upgrade their skills  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  these  high value added jobs,  they  will  be  more\r\n\r\nemployable  and  be  paid more.  The work redesign  programme\r\n\r\nshould be widely considered in the public sector, not only to\r\n\r\ncreate  greater efficiency but also to better deploy manpower\r\n\r\nto  areas  where  there is staff shortage, such  as  school's\r\n\r\noffice to help ease teachers' administrative workload.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our model of\r\n\r\ngovernance  has  been  one  of a stable  and  strong  central\r\n\r\ngovernment  and civil service, and it was an excellent  model\r\n\r\nfor  the building of Singapore in the past 34 years.   As  we\r\n\r\nnow  compete in the world with the world's best countries and\r\n\r\non  a global playing field, the challenges of nation building\r\n\r\nand   economic  development  are  completely  different  from\r\n\r\nbefore.   As such, there is a serious need for us  to  review\r\n\r\nhow our Government is organised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain sectors of governance need to have strong and\r\n\r\ncentral  control, but others can be more open  and  flexible.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  feel  that  the  governance of  Singapore  should  be\r\n\r\noutsourced  as  much  as possible with  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors taking on more responsibilities than before.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no necessity for the Government to have  a  strong\r\n\r\nhand  in  every  aspect of economic development  and  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the USA and Taiwan, there are fine examples of how\r\n\r\nthe  private sector is the key driver of economic development\r\n\r\nand  there  is  very little central control exerted  in  many\r\n\r\nareas   of   the   countries'  management.    Secondly,   the\r\n\r\ntransparency of policies and practices will do good for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neveryone. At the moment, those outside the Government service\r\n\r\nhave   very  little  visibility  and  do  not  have  a   good\r\n\r\nunderstanding of public policies.  Any attempt  to  get  more\r\n\r\ninformation  typically  results in  a  bureaucratic  form  of\r\n\r\nobstacles.  In my opinion, the more the people in the private\r\n\r\nsector  know and understand our policies, the more  efficient\r\n\r\nthe whole system will be.  Things will move even faster.   So\r\n\r\nI  urge the Government to be more transparent and share  more\r\n\r\ninformation with Singaporeans when they require.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have excellent and brilliant people in the civil\r\n\r\nservice.  My experience with them in the last three years has\r\n\r\nallowed me to understand them more, and conclude that we have\r\n\r\ngood and committed people in the civil service.  However, the\r\n\r\nprivate and people sectors assume that the civil service know\r\n\r\nall  the  issues facing the world outside the civil  service.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  civil servants assume that citizens  know  all  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the Government well.  The lesson  that  I  have\r\n\r\nlearned  is  that  this is not true at all.   This  therefore\r\n\r\nmeans that there is an important need for greater interaction\r\n\r\nand  exchanges, including the hiring of more people from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector into the key civil service positions.  We need\r\n\r\nto   create  a  true  partnership  relationship  between  the\r\n\r\npeople/private and the public sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept that the private sector individuals be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the governance of Singapore should be  seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered.  I suggest that we have two or three  people  who\r\n\r\ncan  be  involved  in  Cabinet style discussions  to  discuss\r\n\r\npolicies,  who  are from outside the central government.   My\r\n\r\nreason  for  suggesting this is because our  system  is  very\r\n\r\ncentral  leadership focused and key issues are  discussed  at\r\n\r\nCabinet or by a core group of people in leadership positions,\r\n\r\nand  decisions are made by the same people.  Similarly,  such\r\n\r\noutsiders can also be mirroring the Permanent Secretaries and\r\n\r\nsenior  civil  servants in some policy discussions.   A  more\r\n\r\nrounded  discussion will lead to more polished policies.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  any  Government position, it is valuable  to  have\r\n\r\npeople from outside the circle who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  be a source of valuable input and, at the same time,  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for their suggestions, quite different from using\r\n\r\nthem just as input tools as we do today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil service reward system also needs to be\r\n\r\nlooked into, and I feel that they must not be left out in the\r\n\r\nbooming  knowledge-based economy.  Policy  makers  must  feel\r\n\r\nmotivated that they should benefit from the booming  economy,\r\n\r\njust  as  everyone  else in Singapore.   I  suggest  a  share\r\n\r\nownership  scheme  and  also  a  more  flexible  compensation\r\n\r\npackage  to  allow them to participate in the  economy.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  a  unit  trust could be set up for  investments  in\r\n\r\nstart-up  companies in Singapore, and this can be part  of  a\r\n\r\ncivil servant's compensation package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need a more aggressive approach of policy making\r\n\r\nand  be  willing to take more risks.  My impression  is  that\r\n\r\nmany  key  civil servants rather not rock the boat  and  they\r\n\r\nrather implement safe policies so that their careers are  not\r\n\r\naffected  as a result of a wrong or failed policy.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  rewarded for daring  to  be  different  and\r\n\r\nproposing radical changes, even if the policies are  not  the\r\n\r\nbest and stable of all the policies implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I suggest that the Government's spin off\r\n\r\nvalue-added components of the statutory boards of  Government\r\n\r\nand of GLCs into companies, then fund these new companies and\r\n\r\nlet the founders and initiators who may be civil servants  to\r\n\r\nleave  the  civil service and run these businesses backed  by\r\n\r\nfunds from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that we have an\r\n\r\nexcellent  civil  service  in place,  staffed  by  many  good\r\n\r\npeople.   What I am suggesting is a change in our system  and\r\n\r\nnot  the  people,  and it is not intended  to  point  at  any\r\n\r\nparticular group of Singaporeans.  Collectively,  all  of  us\r\n\r\nhave  a  very important role to play and I think if  we  work\r\n\r\ntogether, we can make a big difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, with an aging population and\r\n\r\nrapid   business   reorganisation  and  restructuring,   more\r\n\r\ncompanies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  retrain  workers  in  order  to  stay  competitive  and\r\n\r\nprofitable.   Workers who experience periods of  unemployment\r\n\r\nin  between  jobs  can  no longer look forward  to  life-time\r\n\r\nemployment  in  a  single company.  It is  therefore  in  the\r\n\r\nworkers'   interest  to  make  benefits  provided  for   them\r\n\r\nportable, so that they have adequate protection as they  move\r\n\r\nfrom job to job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee medical benefits are prime examples.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these are not portable in the private sector.   It\r\n\r\nmakes it harder for older workers to change jobs or find  new\r\n\r\njobs after retrenchment, especially if they have some medical\r\n\r\ncondition.   New employers would be reluctant to  take  these\r\n\r\nolder  workers and will take them as a burden  of  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers with the medical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has adopted a portable\r\n\r\nmedical  benefit  scheme for the civil servants  since  1994.\r\n\r\nWith  this portable Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient  (MSO)\r\n\r\nscheme,  our civil servants are given an additional  Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution of 1% in lieu of the traditional hospitalisation\r\n\r\nbenefits.  The officers can use the money to pay for  his  or\r\n\r\nhis  dependant's  inpatient bill or for a more  comprehensive\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance such as IncomeShield.  In addition,  there\r\n\r\nis  another  subsidy for outpatient expenses for the  officer\r\n\r\nand  his  eligible dependants capped at $350 per year.   This\r\n\r\nscheme  is  portable as the officer can keep  the  additional\r\n\r\ncontribution  in  his  Medisave account.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that PSD  also consider making the $350 subsidy  for\r\n\r\noutpatient  treatment portable.  Instead of keeping  the  sum\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  used,  the  balance should  also  go  into  an\r\n\r\nemployee's Medisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MSO scheme has been in place for six years. I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is timely for the PSD to review the percentage  of\r\n\r\nadditional Medisave contribution and the $350 annual cap  for\r\n\r\noutpatient  subsidy  for  our civil servants  under  the  MSO\r\n\r\nscheme.   I  would  also  like to urge  the  PSD  to  work  a\r\n\r\nmechanism  to ensure that such provision will be adjusted  as\r\n\r\nmedical costs increase with time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the cost cutting measure, our civil servants\r\n\r\nhad  their wages cut by 6.2% through the annual variable  and\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable  components.  Now that  we  have  \"V-shape\"\r\n\r\nrecovery,  the  Government, as an employer, should  recognise\r\n\r\nthe public sector employees' sacrifices.  As the  recovery is\r\n\r\nan uneven one, their pay cut has not been fully restored.   I\r\n\r\nhope   the   Government,  as  an  employer,  could   consider\r\n\r\nrecognising  the sacrifices of the civil servants  by  giving\r\n\r\nthem a one-off special Medisave contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to\r\n\r\nthank  the  Member  for  Cheng San  GRC  for  explaining  the\r\n\r\nbackground, as it makes my presentation more easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that the civil service medical benefit is\r\n\r\none  of  the prime selling points for civil servants all  the\r\n\r\nwhile.   In  1994,  the  civil  service  actually  introduced\r\n\r\nchanges, and these changes were what Mr Yeo had touched upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the key components of the civil service change was the\r\n\r\naspect of co-payment in medical benefits.  We also know  that\r\n\r\nthe  private sector is looking to the civil service  and  the\r\n\r\npublic sector to set the tone, and sees the Government  as  a\r\n\r\nrole model for staff and welfare benefits.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  are encouraging the private sector to get on to this  co-payment  scheme  and yet it is not picking up.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why it is not picking up is because the civil service\r\n\r\nhad introduced this scheme in 1994 and up to now had made  no\r\n\r\nrevision.   People see it  as a stagnation of  benefits  when\r\n\r\npay  and  wages go up, cost of medical benefit goes up.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  the two aspects of it had not changed, it looks  as  if\r\n\r\nthe scheme has gone down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to review these\r\n\r\nquantums regularly, and now is the time for change.   Changes\r\n\r\ncan  be  in two aspects.  One is the 1% which goes  into  the\r\n\r\nMedisave account under the MSO scheme, and the cap of  $7,000\r\n\r\nsalary  a  month, which is equivalent to $350  a  year.   The\r\n\r\nother  one is a subsidy for outpatient medical treatment  for\r\n\r\nan employee's family which is placed at a maximum of $350.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I ask the civil service and the Prime Minister to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  review, I also want to say that we  should  do\r\n\r\nrevisions  periodically.  It is very  difficult  to  get  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector to accept change when there are  no  changes.\r\n\r\nWe should not only have changes periodically.  We should also\r\n\r\nset  in  place the basis of those changes, what is it  linked\r\n\r\nto,  and  how it will go up.  In that way, nobody  will  feel\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  in  moving  to a co-payment  scheme  which  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to benefit everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, today, I have a\r\n\r\nproposition for the Prime Minister on making babies, speaking\r\n\r\non  behalf of Singaporean couples, of course.  The package  I\r\n\r\nam  asking  the Prime Minister to consider is  just  but  one\r\n\r\nsmall piece of the jigsaw puzzle that we must put together if\r\n\r\nwe  are to be serious about encouraging more Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nstart  families, to grow bigger families and  to  keep  those\r\n\r\nfamilies  strong  and  sound.   Government  is  the   largest\r\n\r\nemployer in Singapore.  If it will take the lead in doing  as\r\n\r\nmuch as it can to create a working environment that is family\r\n\r\nfriendly, this will go a long way, both in the direct  impact\r\n\r\non  the  tens of thousands of civil servants as  well  as  in\r\n\r\nsetting the example for other organisations and companies  to\r\n\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service already offers some very good benefits\r\n\r\nin   terms   of  sick  child  leave  for  mothers,  part-time\r\n\r\nemployment and no-pay leave for mothers after child birth for\r\n\r\nchild  minding, and on-site childcare centres in many of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries.   These are wonderful benefits  to  have,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest some enhancements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, sick child leave is currently only for children\r\n\r\nup to six years of age.  I believe this must have been chosen\r\n\r\nin  relation to the age that he starts going to school.   But\r\n\r\nthe  kiddie  going  to primary school is  still  not  old  or\r\n\r\nindependent  enough  to go to the doctor  by  himself  if  he\r\n\r\nshould fall ill.  I would therefore suggest raising the  cut-off  age  to,  say, 12 years, when the child is of  secondary\r\n\r\nschool level and more independent.  I do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  believe  that  parents will abuse  the  privilege.   The\r\n\r\nbenefit should also be made available to either parent.  I am\r\n\r\nnot  asking for more days per child, just that the five  days\r\n\r\nper  child  per  annum  may be taken by  either  one  of  the\r\n\r\nparents.  In the not too distant future, I think we may  have\r\n\r\nto  consider  similar leave for sick elderly members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily as well, as the population ages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while I know that a number of civil servants\r\n\r\nhave  used the part-time employment and no-pay leave  benefit\r\n\r\nto  take time off to look after young children, it is also  a\r\n\r\nfact  that  the ease or otherwise of organising  this  varies\r\n\r\nfrom department to department, and is often a function of how\r\n\r\nsupportive  individual supervisors  are.   We  all  know  how\r\n\r\nresponsive civil servants are to major campaigns if they  are\r\n\r\npushed  with  enough conviction from the  top.    So  if  the\r\n\r\nmessage  to be supportive of and, in fact,  to do their  best\r\n\r\nto  facilitate parents who wish to avail themselves of  these\r\n\r\nbenefits  can be driven as hard as, for example,  the  PS  21\r\n\r\neffort,  this  would be most helpful.  Again, availing  these\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  either  parent would send a  great  message  on\r\n\r\nbreaking down the rigidities of stereotyped roles.   It  does\r\n\r\nnot  matter  if  it  is years before many or,  in  fact,  any\r\n\r\nfathers  take  up the offer, but the important  thing  is  to\r\n\r\nstart making change to mindsets.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the issue of maternity leave for the third and\r\n\r\nlater  children. Our usual position on this  issue  has  been\r\n\r\nthat  the  generous  tax rebates given to mothers  for  their\r\n\r\nthird, fourth and more children, more than compensate for the\r\n\r\nloss of maternity leave.  But we know that this benefits only\r\n\r\nwomen who are in the higher income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when these tax incentives were put in place\r\n\r\nwe  were very clear that we were specifically targetting this\r\n\r\ngroup.   But  I  believe  that by  now,  we  are  looking  to\r\n\r\nencourage  a  much broader population of women,  couples,  to\r\n\r\nhave  more  children.  I really think it is time  for  us  to\r\n\r\nreconsider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on the subject of paternity leave.\r\n\r\nLet  me say upfront that I do not think that a man's decision\r\n\r\nto  have a child is influenced one iota by whether he  has  a\r\n\r\nfew  days of paternity leave or not. However, it is  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  overall culture and environment of whether we truly want\r\n\r\nto  celebrate the fathering of a child.  Especially, when  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side of the equation, how many man-days would  the\r\n\r\ncivil service lose by offering such a benefit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, one old request is revived - a five-day\r\n\r\nwork  week.  Having two days off in the week would  make  all\r\n\r\nthe  difference in the world to a harried couple.   It  would\r\n\r\nallow  time to get chores done, and it would leave time  left\r\n\r\nover  to  relax  with the family.  I am not asking  for  less\r\n\r\nhours  in  the  work  week, only that  the  hours  worked  be\r\n\r\narranged  in a five-day rotation. It is also possible  to  do\r\n\r\nthis and still have Government services available six days  a\r\n\r\nweek.   All  it  takes is a willingness to be flexible  about\r\n\r\nscheduling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be wonderful if the Prime Minister says yes\r\n\r\nto  these  small requests, but I suspect that the answer  may\r\n\r\nmore likely to be no.  And so, before he actually does, I  am\r\n\r\ngoing to ask that he does not say no outright, but will agree\r\n\r\nto consider putting these items, together with others that  I\r\n\r\nwill be proposing over the next week and a half, on a list to\r\n\r\nbe  put  before,  and  added  to by,  a  central  review  and\r\n\r\ncoordinating  body,  an Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nFamily,  to take a holistic approach in a national effort  to\r\n\r\ndraw  up a comprehensive blueprint to build more, strong  and\r\n\r\nsound Singaporean families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Mrs  Lim,  in  moving  the  debate   on   the\r\n\r\nexamination of the estimates for the Prime Minister's Office,\r\n\r\nfocuses  on the performance of civil servants.  I  would  now\r\n\r\nlike to focus a little bit on the Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have been asking this every year, but I am\r\n\r\nafraid I have not got any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  answers.   I see  the provision  for  political\r\n\r\nappointments  for  next year has gone up  by  something  like\r\n\r\n$3,159,500.  May I ask what is this increase for?  May  I  be\r\n\r\ntold where is this money going to?  Secondly, something which\r\n\r\nI  have  already raised is, do we really need seven Ministers\r\n\r\nin  the  Prime Minister's Office for the tasks of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and his colleagues?  We have five Ministers and  two\r\n\r\nMinisters  of State, besides the Parliamentary Secretary  and\r\n\r\ntwo  Political Secretaries.  I have asked time and time again\r\n\r\nabout  a greater clarification of the duties of these various\r\n\r\nMinisters, and I have never been given a proper answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that under the Constitution notification of the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  Ministers, the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister is that he is charged with the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  advising Ministers on any of the subjects.  When he  was\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and Mr Rajaratnam was the Senior Minister,\r\n\r\nI  asked  the  Prime Minister what exactly was Mr  Rajaratnam\r\n\r\ndoing, and his answer was, \"He advises me whenever I need his\r\n\r\nadvice.\"  I thought then he was paid an unduly heavy sum  for\r\n\r\nthat duty.  May we know what exactly is the duty performed by\r\n\r\nthe Senior Minister in the office?  The notification says  he\r\n\r\nis  charged  with  the responsibility.  Does  he  advise  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  when he is called upon for advice?  Does  he  give\r\n\r\ndirectives every day to the Ministries as to how they  should\r\n\r\nconduct their affairs and how they should run their Ministry?\r\n\r\nMay  I know whether the Prime Minister has any responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  advising  the  Ministers, or it is left  solely  to  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister?  I think we need more clarification  as  to\r\n\r\nwhy  it is necessary for the Prime Minister's Office to  have\r\n\r\nseven  Ministers.  What exactly are they doing and why is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to pay them what they are being paid at the moment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year we had a\r\n\r\nvery  lively  debate in this House during the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 Vision.  During the debate, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nintroduced the concept of the Singapore tribe, a unique group\r\n\r\nof  people making a nation. Sir, the key issue is whether we,\r\n\r\nas a country, are doing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenough  to build emotional bonds among Singaporeans.  Are  we\r\n\r\nserious  about  building  a  Singapore  Tribe?   The   recent\r\n\r\nSingapore  Press  Holdings' survey on race  relations  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant reminder that we still have some way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, legislation has been used as a key approach to\r\n\r\nensure  inter-racial ties are maintained, but  this  may  not\r\n\r\nlead  to greater emotional bonding. A strong Government  able\r\n\r\nto  keep peace by creating rules that require its citizens to\r\n\r\nlive with one another and the fear of breaking the rules  may\r\n\r\ngive the false impression that things are all right. They may\r\n\r\ninstead  lead to superficial bonds and we may have the  false\r\n\r\ncomfort that everything is all right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the mistrust and historical problems\r\n\r\nneed  to  be addressed urgently and the recent survey on race\r\n\r\nrelations revealed that while things have improved,  this  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  lingering problem among Singaporeans.  I feel  that\r\n\r\nnot  enough  has been done to build a Singapore  identity  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  the common overlapping areas of all the  races,  as\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Goh puts it in the S21 speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practices like the ethnic based self-help groups tell\r\n\r\nour  people  that we should only help our own kind  and  that\r\n\r\nonly  our  own  kind will help us.  This is a  very  divisive\r\n\r\napproach, in my opinion, while it may have other benefits  in\r\n\r\nall  of  us helping one another.  Sir, my generation did  not\r\n\r\ngrow  up in such an environment.  We treated different  races\r\n\r\nmore  as one than today's younger generation and this  is  my\r\n\r\nfear  that it might lead to greater alienation of the various\r\n\r\nraces if we continue this practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, practices in some schools to segregate\r\n\r\nchildren  into  different classes based on the mother  tongue\r\n\r\nthey  speak, for operational efficiency, are bad.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  are many cases where students group together and speak\r\n\r\ntheir  mother tongue at the expense of their friends  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand  the  language.   This  may  lead  to  racial\r\n\r\nenclaves  in  school.   In  fact, some  of  this  is  already\r\n\r\nhappening now and we need to address this issue urgently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really need to do more to develop an integrated\r\n\r\nsociety  and focus more on increasing our overlapping  common\r\n\r\ntraits  so  that  in the long term a unique  Singapore  Tribe\r\n\r\nmodel  of  diversity  and similarity can develop.   Emotional\r\n\r\nbonding  cannot  be  left  to  legislation  but  requires   a\r\n\r\n\"heartware\"  approach.  We need to ensure that the  Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision becomes a reality for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, one\r\n\r\npositive result of the recent Straits Times' survey  on  race\r\n\r\nrelations  said most Singaporeans feel that, compared  to  10\r\n\r\nyears ago, relations between different races in Singapore are\r\n\r\nbetter  now.  They do not foresee a racial riot happening  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   in   the  next  10  years.   This  is   extremely\r\n\r\nsignificant because the survey was carried out in  the  midst\r\n\r\nof racial problems in our neighbouring countries.  This shows\r\n\r\ngreat  progress we have made in ensuring racial  harmony  and\r\n\r\nthe freedom Singaporeans have in the system of law and order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the result that half of the respondents do not\r\n\r\nthink  that  friends of a different race would  protect  them\r\n\r\nshould  a race riot break out in Singapore, a friend of  mine\r\n\r\nremarked  that  it is almost like asking someone  whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  drink  water  from the tap should a  cholera  outbreak\r\n\r\nbreak  out in Singapore.  There are therefore reasons not  to\r\n\r\nbe  too pessimistic about it.  However, what is disturbing to\r\n\r\nme  personally is the revelation that Singaporeans  generally\r\n\r\nhave  about only five friends of a different race.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  far  too  small.  Either we really  have  very  few\r\n\r\nfriends or we are such unfriendly people.  As we look closely\r\n\r\nat   the  various  activities  where  different  races   come\r\n\r\ntogether,  a  large  number of them have meals  together  and\r\n\r\nfrequently speak to someone of a different race.  But when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  more personal activities, like shopping, going  to\r\n\r\nthe  movies, and sports, many tend to do so with only  people\r\n\r\nof the same race.  I find this worrying.  Clearly, we need to\r\n\r\ndo  more to forge greater inter-racial harmony and one way is\r\n\r\nreally,  we  have  no  other choice, to seize  all  available\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   greater   inter-racial   collaboration.\r\n\r\nBecause only by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndoing things together, especially things that typically  have\r\n\r\nnothing to do with race, will people succeed in breaking down\r\n\r\nracial  barriers.  Because shared activities build bonds  and\r\n\r\ntrust  among  groups and create a foundation on which  people\r\n\r\ncan   have   more   personal  and  deeper  understanding   of\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I have a few suggestions for\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Perhaps it is time for us to consider setting\r\n\r\nup a multi-cultural agency, a statutory board under the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office, to promote multi-culturalism.  This may be\r\n\r\na  lofty  idea, or a very vague idea at the moment,  but  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of this idea is so important that it  leaves  us\r\n\r\nwith no other choice but to try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that the Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  must  be developed to be the focal points  for  all\r\n\r\ninter-racial  activities within a municipal area.    However,\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this, we may have to review policies that  allow\r\n\r\nethnic  and  religious  based organisations  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  an  ever increasing array of services  that,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  may  potentially  retard  racial  integration.    What\r\n\r\ncultural values do we expect our young to have if they  spend\r\n\r\ntheir  entire pre-school years mixing around with  people  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own race and religion?  Perhaps, we now have to define\r\n\r\nthe  limits  on which ethnic based groups can organise  their\r\n\r\nactivities.   CDCs  can  provide better  incentives  to  draw\r\n\r\nsocial  and  ethnic  based  organisations  to  locate   their\r\n\r\nservices in CDCs and to carry out activities there.  As  most\r\n\r\nhave  problems securing funds, I think CDCs can offer  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I think sport games, festivals and celebrations\r\n\r\nare  powerful vehicles for social integration.  For  example,\r\n\r\nif  left  on  its  own, only Malays will play  sepak  takraw,\r\n\r\nChinese  will  play basketball and perhaps only Indians  play\r\n\r\nhockey.   I  think we should look at some of these activities\r\n\r\nand organise sports, perhaps purely for this purpose alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, we have become a society which is tolerant\r\n\r\nand respectful of other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nraces and cultures, but we must go beyond to become a society\r\n\r\nthat  can celebrate our diversity and differences.   We  have\r\n\r\nfestivals  and  celebrations, but have we really  taken  full\r\n\r\nadvantage  to  use  these festivals as  a  means  for  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  and racial understanding?  Christmas and  New  Year\r\n\r\nparties may become common celebrations in offices because  of\r\n\r\nthe  predominantly Chinese population in work places, but  it\r\n\r\nis   precisely  this  that,  unless  we  take  an  effort  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  and appreciate the special festivals of  minority\r\n\r\ngroups,  we  cannot  fully  become  a  multi-racial  society.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Sir,  in Singapore,  on  matters  like  this,\r\n\r\nsometimes  it takes Government, itself the biggest  employer,\r\n\r\nto  make a start and to be a catalyst of change.  So too with\r\n\r\nforeign  talents and immigrants.  We need to take this  extra\r\n\r\neffort  to  make  them feel recognised and  valued,  that  we\r\n\r\nrespect  their  culture and tradition despite  being  in  the\r\n\r\nminority, have a place in Singapore and, better still, can be\r\n\r\ncelebrated  by  all Singaporeans because precisely  we  value\r\n\r\ntheir  differences  and  the diversity  that  they  bring  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must keep the conversation going and have an\r\n\r\nopen and honest discussion which, I think, can lead to better\r\n\r\nexamination  of  attitudes, behaviour and  wisdom  that  will\r\n\r\nallow  us  to find new and useful strategies.  We should  not\r\n\r\nforget  that only recently, amidst growing job retrenchments,\r\n\r\nissues  of  race  and  discrimination in  job  advertisements\r\n\r\nsurface.   It  is  only because we have an  open  and  honest\r\n\r\ndiscussion here that many of the perceived sensitivities  are\r\n\r\nbetter understood.  And I hope this conversation can continue\r\n\r\neven  at  the highest level in this House so that we continue\r\n\r\nto  give  our people the hope and confidence that, come  what\r\n\r\nmay,  multi-culturalism is a value that all Singaporeans will\r\n\r\ncherish and protect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In the 80s, we used our financial capital\r\n\r\nto  grow, and in 1986 we faced the recession, and we came out\r\n\r\nof  it.   The  Economic Committee headed by BG  Lee  and  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  did  very well.  In the 90s, we were moving  towards\r\n\r\nKBE   and  when  we  faced  the  last  recession,  the  young\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  leaders  took us out of  it  pretty  quickly.\r\n\r\nSocially,  we have done well to some extent; meritocracy  and\r\n\r\nsocial harmony have been key pillars, but we have some way to\r\n\r\ngo.   We  have  set up CDCs and so on, but our social  habits\r\n\r\nstill cannot make us a developed nation yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy is opening up tremendous\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  the people of the world  -  the  young  and\r\n\r\nenterprising can move from rags to riches pretty  quickly  in\r\n\r\nwhat  people call at Internet speed or Internet year.  In  my\r\n\r\ndefinition, the effort is 100 days.  It is moving  very  fast\r\n\r\nand many people can become rich.  But having said that, there\r\n\r\nare  many  others who would be left behind in what is  called\r\n\r\ndigital divide and become digital outcast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the larger portion of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Many of us have spoken about  why  Government\r\n\r\nshould do a lot more on the economic front for businesses  in\r\n\r\nthis   Internet   economy.

But I think more of us need to speak here in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  about  the  number  of  constituents  that  we\r\n\r\nrepresent who would not make it from rags to riches, but  who\r\n\r\nmay become digital outcast in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the 45, 50, 60, and the 70-year\r\n\r\nolds  who,  to them, touching a computer gives them  a  fear,\r\n\r\napprehension, a certain psyche that even with the $25 million\r\n\r\nthat  MCIT  has started to put forward, which is a very  good\r\n\r\nfirst  step,  but I think a lot more needs to  be  done.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  leave this to a statutory board to just  provide  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  hope  that the 70-year  olds  will  pick  up\r\n\r\ncomputers.

He  is not the norm but an exception, a leader that  we\r\n\r\nhope many other older citizens will follow his fine example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to ensure that we give sufficient attention to\r\n\r\nthis  bigger  problem, which is not just purely economic  but\r\n\r\nmuch  more social and, to a larger extent, political, we need\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a  unit under perhaps the PMO  to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  And we have done this before.  Pollution control in\r\n\r\nthe  70s or 80s was under the PMO.  The SDU was under the PMO\r\n\r\nbefore.   All  these got relegated to the various  Ministries\r\n\r\nonce the strategies took off to an operational level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call for the setting up of this unit, a multi-agency unit, under the PMO, which could be driven by IDA and\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  People's  Association.  Ultimately,  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nMinisterial  committee  should be  set  up  to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem of digital divide because the larger portion  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation deserves attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, if you look at Singapore, about 20% will be\r\n\r\ncalled  relatively  poor.  Our fear is  that  this  20%  will\r\n\r\naccentuate  in  terms  of  percentage  and  number   as   our\r\n\r\npopulation  grows.  And I think it is timely that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself paid significant attention, because we  want\r\n\r\nto remain as one people, one nation, one Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nlet me take all the cuts in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua wanted to bring the civil service up to\r\n\r\ndate   in   terms  of  motivation,  remuneration,  and   even\r\n\r\norganisation.  I completely agree with her that  while  there\r\n\r\nare  differences between the public and the private  sectors,\r\n\r\nbecause one has more bottomline focus than the other, in fact\r\n\r\nthere are many similarities too.  Because even in the private\r\n\r\nsector,  you  are not just talking about the bottomline,  you\r\n\r\nare   also   talking  about  service  quality,   performance,\r\n\r\ninnovation.   While in the public sector,  we  are  not  just\r\n\r\ntalking  about  administering our long-term  goals,  although\r\n\r\nthese  are  important, but also about efficiency  and  saving\r\n\r\ncosts.   So  there is much which the public sector can  learn\r\n\r\nfrom the personnel practices of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate   sector,  the  way  they  reward,  train,  motivate,\r\n\r\norganise their people, which we should take on board and also\r\n\r\nuse in the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically in terms of remuneration, we have already\r\n\r\nstarted having performance bonuses for our more senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  We had announced last year that we wanted to  move\r\n\r\ntowards  a  scheme  where  all  civil  servants  would   have\r\n\r\nperformance bonus as one component of their salary, from  the\r\n\r\ntop  all  the  way down to the bottom.  We will progressively\r\n\r\nintroduce this over the next two or three years with the  NWC\r\n\r\nawards.  We will put aside some of the NWC awards to build up\r\n\r\na  significant component of a performance bonus, so that each\r\n\r\ncivil servant will feel that how he does will impact what  he\r\n\r\nearns.   It  does make a difference.  And at  the  very  top,\r\n\r\nwhere  presently the senior civil servants have a performance\r\n\r\nbonus, maximum of six months, we are reviewing this now,  and\r\n\r\nwe  should substantially increase that certainly to at  least\r\n\r\n12  months,  and  maybe more.  Because if  you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, for the senior persons, yes, they  are  paid\r\n\r\nmore.   But maybe only one-third of their earnings goes  into\r\n\r\nsalaries,  and  the  other two-thirds of their  earnings  are\r\n\r\nvariable,  depending on their own performance,  depending  on\r\n\r\ntheir   company's  performance,  depending  on  the   overall\r\n\r\nachievement of their section of the company, and so  on.   So\r\n\r\nwe should move, approximate private sector practice, and keep\r\n\r\ntrack.  As the private sector improves, so do we.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Simon Tay asked about communication and\r\n\r\nresponse  to the public and wanting to establish  it  in  our\r\n\r\nstaff appraisal system.  I think his question is not so  much\r\n\r\nabout  the  staff  appraisal system.  It is  whether  or  not\r\n\r\ncommunications  involving  the public  and  consultation  are\r\n\r\nreally  core  to the way the civil service operates  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment operates.  And I think the answer is yes.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a question of the second or third generation.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion of what is the best way in which to set policies, to\r\n\r\nestablish the direction, to bring people on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboard and to work together to improve Singapore, and to  move\r\n\r\nforward.   We  have  decided that  in  many  areas,  in  many\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the best way to do that is to be more open and\r\n\r\ninclusive, involving more people outside of the organisation,\r\n\r\ntalking,  sharing  information, taking on board  suggestions,\r\n\r\nviews  and  finally reaching a decision which is better  than\r\n\r\nwhat  an  individual department, or even an individual  civil\r\n\r\nservant or Minister, is able to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh said just now, the civil service\r\n\r\nreally does not completely know the way the private sector is\r\n\r\nthinking,  and  the private sector often also does  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  civil service constraints and considerations  are.\r\n\r\nSo the more we can get this interchange and flow, I think the\r\n\r\nmore  effective  it  will be.  It is not  just  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nestablishing specific mechanisms for doing this.  It is  also\r\n\r\na  matter  of setting the overall tone for the civil  service\r\n\r\nand  making  sure that when we launch something, particularly\r\n\r\nsomething major, this is always at the back of our minds, the\r\n\r\nway to proceed.  So when we assess a civil servant, we do not\r\n\r\ngive brownie points for the number of times he called in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to discuss things with them, or the number  of\r\n\r\ntimes  he  went  and gave an explanation, or  the  number  of\r\n\r\nletters he wrote to the press, or even the friendliness  with\r\n\r\nwhich he wrote the letters to the press, but, was he able  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  political sensitivity and  certain  openness  of\r\n\r\napproach?   And, finally, the bottomline is: was he  able  to\r\n\r\nget the job done and the mission accomplished?  If he can  do\r\n\r\nthat,  then  he is promoted and rewarded.  If  he  cannot  do\r\n\r\nthat, he can be the most affable person in the world, but  he\r\n\r\nis ineffective, he has to be moved out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes our idea of what is a reasonable way to\r\n\r\nconsult  and take views may not agree with the public's  idea\r\n\r\nof  how  much we should consult and take views, in particular\r\n\r\non  the  question of National Library and a few other  things\r\n\r\nrecently  in  the press.  But that is in the  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nprocess   that   different  parties   will   have   different\r\n\r\nperspectives.    Gradually,  I   think   a   more   realistic\r\n\r\nexpectation and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunderstanding  would  evolve of what  is  possible,  what  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and  what we can achieve from  this  consultation\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that the civil service did mishandle\r\n\r\nthe  issues which have recently been in dispute.  There  will\r\n\r\nalways  be  matters which will become hotter than others  and\r\n\r\nwhich  need  to be managed, and we have to do so in  a  calm,\r\n\r\nrational and understanding way, and go on, as I think Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow  Tan did in Parliament a few days ago explaining how,  as\r\n\r\nan  SJI boy, he also had been to the bakery and waited at the\r\n\r\nbus  stop.   So  there are many ways, but our  commitment  to\r\n\r\ninvolve  people and to make this a participatory  process  is\r\n\r\nquite clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On redesigning work in the public sector, Mr Yeo Guat\r\n\r\nKwang  asked what we are doing.  We agree with him that  this\r\n\r\nis  something  which  needs to be done  because  we  want  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  our  workers, our staff and we want  to  restructure\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  so that they have the opportunity for upgrading.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, we have already been doing job restructuring.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  last year in April, we restructured and streamlined\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of the Division IV schemes into broader  based\r\n\r\nservice   groups,   each  with  its   own   broad-based   job\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  which  help to enlarge  the  jobs  and  help\r\n\r\npeople to be placed in jobs, and to make progression if  they\r\n\r\nare  committed to upgrade themselves.  So we have done  some,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  not a static situation because as the population\r\n\r\nchanges, as job requirements change, we will have to continue\r\n\r\nto  restructure and, I am sure, we will do our best  to  keep\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh talked about the need for the civil\r\n\r\nservice to be open, flexible and transparent.  We fully agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.   We  have introduced all sorts of schemes  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.   But  this is a big organisation and it is a continual\r\n\r\neffort  to  make  sure that it stays open, it stays  vibrant,\r\n\r\nthat  it does not settle down, that there is a certain innate\r\n\r\nenergy, so that new ideas are always coming up and new people\r\n\r\nwith  fresh  approaches have the opportunity to come  through\r\n\r\nthe system, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  be  held  down  and stifled by people who  have  arrived\r\n\r\nearlier and who may have been active and energetic in earlier\r\n\r\nyears  but have decided, well, now we are in charge,  let  us\r\n\r\nstay in charge for a little while longer.  It is a continuing\r\n\r\neffort, but I think if we compare our civil service with  any\r\n\r\nother civil service in the world, we are not doing badly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On medical benefits, Mr Yeo and also Mr Thomas Thomas\r\n\r\nasked  whether we can review our co-payment and also  we  can\r\n\r\nfold  in the $350 outpatient subsidy to be paid into Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount  for the individuals if it is not spent.   First,  on\r\n\r\nthe question of revising the medical benefits.  There are two\r\n\r\ncomponents  to  this co-payment scheme: (1)  $350  outpatient\r\n\r\nsubsidy cap, and (2) 1% extra contribution to Medisave.   The\r\n\r\nextra  contribution to Medisave is 1% of salary.  So as  your\r\n\r\nsalary  goes  up, it will automatically go up  together  with\r\n\r\nyour  salary.   Because  we have not  seen  medical  expenses\r\n\r\nincrease  much  faster  than salary in  Singapore  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears, there is no need for us to reconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the $350 outpatient subsidy, I have asked for the\r\n\r\ndata  and  have been told that, in fact, most civil  servants\r\n\r\nhave  not  been using a lot of this.  In fact, three-quarters\r\n\r\nof the civil servants use only $100 or less of the $350 which\r\n\r\nthey  are entitled to.  On average, the expenditure per civil\r\n\r\nservant  was only $74 out of $350.  So there is no  immediate\r\n\r\nneed to revise the amount upwards.  That is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the question of philosophy. Our\r\n\r\napproach  in  the public service has been to pay  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible  a  clean wage.  In other words, instead  of  having\r\n\r\nhousing  benefits and significant medical benefits  or  child\r\n\r\nbenefits  or  transport benefits, we give you a clean  salary\r\n\r\nand  you decide how you want to allocate your resources.  And\r\n\r\nwe  make  sure that the overall salary, the whole package  is\r\n\r\ncompetitive  with other employers in Singapore  and  attracts\r\n\r\nthe  people  we want for the job.  If we have that  approach,\r\n\r\nthen to the maximum extent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossible,  we  should  cap medical  benefits  in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice rather than expand them, because really I can have  a\r\n\r\nchoice  when I expand them.  I can give you the extra  salary\r\n\r\nand  you  decide  whether you want to use it for  medical  or\r\n\r\nother  purposes, or I can just give you the medical  benefits\r\n\r\nand  you have no choice.  Our philosophy has been that it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  to give the civil servants a choice.  So I would  not\r\n\r\nsay  that we would never adjust this.  But I think that is  a\r\n\r\nconsideration when we decide whether we need to adjust this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for taking the unused part of the $350 and paying it\r\n\r\ninto  individual civil servant's Medisave, as I pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthe average civil servant is only now using $74 of this.   So\r\n\r\nif  I  take  it and put it into civil servants' Medisave,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  we  are  giving the civil servant another  $270-plus\r\n\r\nadditional  allowance of pay per year into the Medisave.   So\r\n\r\nit  is not something which we can lightly do because there is\r\n\r\na financial implication.  However, I do understand why Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nwants to do this.  It is because the private sector has  been\r\n\r\nslow  to  implement an alternative medical  benefits  scheme.\r\n\r\nUnions  have had difficulties persuading workers to  go  this\r\n\r\nway  and to take personal responsibility and to co-pay.   For\r\n\r\nthe private sector to have this sort of subsidy, perhaps with\r\n\r\na  cap, and then to have the amount paid into the Medisave if\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of the year it is not consumed, is a reasonable\r\n\r\nway  forward.   So  from that point of view,  it  is  perhaps\r\n\r\nuseful  for  the civil service to set the example.   We  will\r\n\r\nstudy  this to see if there is an opportunity for us to  move\r\n\r\nin  this  direction.  But never forget, we are talking  about\r\n\r\nreal money, $276 per person, or nearly $9 million per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about female civil servants and\r\n\r\nbenefits.  We will not say no.  We will consider the  matter.\r\n\r\nI would say, firstly, that to go from female officers to male\r\n\r\nand female officers is psychologically a big step, and it  is\r\n\r\na  signal  to the whole of the society that we have become  a\r\n\r\ndifferent kind of society.  We have been encouraging  parents\r\n\r\nto take their share of the burden of looking after kids.  But\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  not sure yet whether we should give them paternity leave\r\n\r\nto celebrate with the mother when the child is born.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the five-day week, we have sought to be flexible\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service to follow what the private  sector  is\r\n\r\ndoing, but not to set the pace for what the private sector is\r\n\r\ndoing.   Because for us to change ceremonially from a 5  1/2-day  week to 5-day week is suddenly to send a signal  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole  economy that we are working fewer days, whether it  is\r\n\r\nfewer  hours or not, and it will be a change of tone for  the\r\n\r\nsociety.   Some  people say there will be  no  slowdown.   In\r\n\r\nfact, we will work better.  We are not sure.  We would prefer\r\n\r\nnot  to  send such a signal.  But where we can exercise  some\r\n\r\nflexibility and allow civil servants some time off, alternate\r\n\r\nweekend,  or some time off even during the week if they  need\r\n\r\ntime  during the week, but maintaining 5 1/2 days as a system\r\n\r\nso that the organisations are all open on Saturday mornings - that  we have been progressively doing and, particularly,  in\r\n\r\nthe statutory boards and semi-Government agencies where it is\r\n\r\neasier to have flexibility.  We will gradually move.  We have\r\n\r\nnot   issued  any  instruction  because  once  we  issue   an\r\n\r\ninstruction,  everybody  will  straightaway  take   it   that\r\n\r\ntomorrow we are in the new world, which we are not.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  been practical and pragmatic because we need to  employ\r\n\r\npeople  too,  and particularly young people and women.   They\r\n\r\ntell  us  that working hours and the flexibility  with  which\r\n\r\nthey   can   adjust  their  working  hours  is  an  important\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked why we need so many Ministers in the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's Office.  He asked this question last  year.\r\n\r\nI gave him an answer.  I think the answer is the same.  There\r\n\r\nare  seven Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office.   It  is\r\n\r\nreally   because  the  Prime  Minister's  Office  encompasses\r\n\r\nseveral different things.  There is the Civil Service,  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  a  different Ministry, but is in the  PMO,  and  I\r\n\r\nhappen  to be looking after it.  There is the NTUC  which  is\r\n\r\nreally  a  separate outfit altogether and is paying  for  the\r\n\r\nsalaries of the people who are working there, namely, Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nBoon Heng, Mr Matthias Yao and Mr Zulkifli.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The lightning changes\r\n\r\nin  technology and the exponential growth in the new  economy\r\n\r\npresent  both  great  opportunities  and  at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nfrightening  prospects for us.  Government must grapple  with\r\n\r\nmany unknowns.  If you take too conservative an approach,  we\r\n\r\nwill miss out the opportunities.  If we move too fast, we may\r\n\r\nride  on  the wrong bandwagon.  Whatever directions we  take,\r\n\r\none  thing  is  certain,  and that  is,  we  have  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficulties in updating our legal framework to  help  us  to\r\n\r\nplug into the global network.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the paradigm shift is so dramatic, and boundaries\r\n\r\nbetween   countries   and   economies   virtually   disappear\r\n\r\novernight,  it  is pertinent to us whether  and  how  we  are\r\n\r\nkeeping our legal framework up to date.  For example, in  the\r\n\r\nfast  changing world of the Internet, are we still  grappling\r\n\r\nwith trade mark and copyright issues relating to domain names\r\n\r\nand  addresses  and such like?  How are we  coping  with  so-called  piracy in cyberspace in which well-known brand names,\r\n\r\nor otherwise, are registered on a first-come-first-served\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbasis  and then offered for sale?  We have read of well-known\r\n\r\npersonalities having their names registered by  such  pirates\r\n\r\nand  then  offered for sale to the rightful  owners.   I  was\r\n\r\nsearching  for  names for dot.com business  in  the  planning\r\n\r\nstage  and  I was amazed and surprised at the kind  of  names\r\n\r\nthat  have been registered on the Internet.  And I  am  quite\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the whole dictionary has been registered  for\r\n\r\ndomain  names.  And I found sites which do trading of  names.\r\n\r\nAn  interesting example I came across is stocks.com, which is\r\n\r\noffered  for  sale for US$7.5 million.  So  people  are  just\r\n\r\nregistering names that do not belong to them and just selling\r\n\r\non the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question that a legal framework which\r\n\r\nis  up  to date and able to cover the issues of the day  will\r\n\r\ngive  us  a  competitive edge in attracting  investments  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  done through our logistics and financial  system.\r\n\r\nI  am  asking the Minister if he will highlight to the  House\r\n\r\nsome  of  the legislation and measures which we are reviewing\r\n\r\nin  the light of these rapid changes, and our capability  and\r\n\r\nability to cope with the voluminous changes which are  taking\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another cut on conveyancing fees.\r\n\r\nPresently, property transactions involve a transfer of  title\r\n\r\nand  they  have  to  be transacted through  lawyers.   Hence,\r\n\r\nbuyers  and sellers of properties have no choice.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, they have to use the legal services, unlike selling of\r\n\r\ncars.   Since  consumers have no choice,  they  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nconveyancing  fees  on the transactions.  Presently,  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem,  there  is a statutory scale and this increases  with\r\n\r\nthe value of the property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are liberalising the fee structure in most\r\n\r\nother areas of businesses, from stock broking to architecture\r\n\r\nprofessional  fees, for example, it is timely to  review  why\r\n\r\nthere  should be a fixed scale for conveyancing fees.   I  am\r\n\r\nasking   the   Minister  if  he  will  move   to   liberalise\r\n\r\nconveyancing  fees  and  leave such  fees  to  be  negotiated\r\n\r\nbetween the lawyer and his clients.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the Trustees' Act which was\r\n\r\nmodelled   after   its  British  counterpart,   the   Trustee\r\n\r\nInvestments  Act, was put in place to provide guidelines  for\r\n\r\nthe  management of public money and money under trust.  Since\r\n\r\nthen, those placed with the responsibility for investing such\r\n\r\nmoney are required to comply with the various limits for  the\r\n\r\ndifferent asset classes, purportedly to minimise risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Act has served us well, we now need to\r\n\r\nexamine  its raison d'etre.  It is interesting to  note  that\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  will  be dispensing  with  the  Trustee\r\n\r\nInvestments  Act  this year, as it is outmoded  and  will  no\r\n\r\nlonger  serve  a  meaningful purpose.  The  widening  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestible   horizon,  both  in  terms  of  instruments   and\r\n\r\ngeographical diversity, has rendered the Act restrictive,  if\r\n\r\nnot  counter-productive,  to what  was  originally  intended.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  shift  in  focus from a  rule-based  system  to\r\n\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing a similar situation here, in the form\r\n\r\nof  an  increasing variety of instruments, beyond  pure  time\r\n\r\ndeposits  and primary equities.  Although modifications  have\r\n\r\nbeen made to accommodate some of these developments, the  Act\r\n\r\nis still restrictive from the perspective of trying to manage\r\n\r\nrisk through diversification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Trustees Act is still largely Singapore-centric, something which will check geographical\r\n\r\ndiversification.   The recent crisis has shown  that  a  bias\r\n\r\ntowards  either certain asset classes or certain economy,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case  Singapore,  does not make for  satisfactory  risk\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the ideal scenario is for investors to\r\n\r\ndiversify their portfolios to maximise risk-adjusted  returns\r\n\r\ninstead of clinging on to the Trustees Act for a false  sense\r\n\r\nof comfort and security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to explain whether the\r\n\r\nTrustees  Act  is still relevant, given the circumstances  so\r\n\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, it is the pillar of\r\n\r\nour Government that honesty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand integrity is maintained at all levels of Government.   To\r\n\r\nthis,  the  Government has set several systems of checks  and\r\n\r\nbalances.  It is also good financial policy and prudence that\r\n\r\nthere  is  transparency  in financial matters.   Transparency\r\n\r\ninvolves  an  open and visible manner of making decisions  so\r\n\r\nthat the public organisation that one serves can benefit from\r\n\r\nthe best deal that the organisation can get.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have perused many legislation that have been\r\n\r\npassed  by  this House in the past.  I am happy to note  that\r\n\r\nmany   of   these  legislation  contain  adequate  provisions\r\n\r\nrequiring  individual members of the responsible agencies  to\r\n\r\ndeclare their interest in any matter considered by them.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  members of the Boards of HDB, EDB  and  JTC,  among\r\n\r\nother Government organisations, are required to declare their\r\n\r\ninterest  and  not  participate  in  any  decision  that  may\r\n\r\nconflict with their personal or professional business.   This\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the symbols and cornerstones of our  transparent\r\n\r\nsystem of governance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those legislation that one finds the provision\r\n\r\nrequiring declaration of interest, it is usually found in the\r\n\r\nmain Act itself, or in the Schedule to the Act.  Perhaps, the\r\n\r\nagencies  that I have highlighted above deal with  big  money\r\n\r\nand hence the legislative safeguards to protect public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also noted that there are other legislation\r\n\r\nwhere there is no requirement for declaration of interest  in\r\n\r\nthe main Act, or in the Schedule to the Act,  for example, in\r\n\r\nthe  Administration of Muslim Law Act,  the Hindu  Endowments\r\n\r\nBoard  Act,  the  Nanyang Polytechnic  Act  and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Act, among others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising the concern as some of these bodies\r\n\r\nthat  are created by a statute of Parliament are not  audited\r\n\r\nby  the  Auditor-General.  They are in some cases audited  by\r\n\r\nprivate  auditors.   In the absence of clear  law  stating  a\r\n\r\nrequirement that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersons  serving  in these bodies declare their  personal  or\r\n\r\nprofessional interest, one can participate in a decision that\r\n\r\ninvolves  such interest and get away with it.   When  caught,\r\n\r\nsome may even argue that there is no such requirement in  law\r\n\r\nor that they were unaware of this requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of these organisations have large funds and,\r\n\r\nin  many cases, funds are raised from the public.  It will be\r\n\r\nprudent to place safeguards before a serious incident arises.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to urge the Minister to review  all  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation and see whether there are Acts which need  to  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened with the addition of the disclosure of  interest\r\n\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to compliment the Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General's Chambers for introducing such clauses\r\n\r\nin all new legislation that have come before this House.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next topic, Sir, which is the\r\n\r\nmanagement of State land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office is the custodian of State land. By\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  their  special position,  they  have  become  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  landlord in Singapore.  I understand that  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  releases  its  land to the market  according  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  sales programme and the needs of the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  buildings of the Land Office are managed  by  a  private\r\n\r\nreal  estate  firm.  This is good and prudent  management  of\r\n\r\nstate assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, we have to ensure that\r\n\r\nland  that is owned by the State is well-managed and used  to\r\n\r\nits  maximum.  Being a sportsman, I know that there are  many\r\n\r\nsportsmen  who find it difficult to book football  or  hockey\r\n\r\nfields, particularly at weekends.  It saddens me to see young\r\n\r\nboys  playing at void decks and even at linked buildings just\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have nowhere else to play football.   In  some\r\n\r\ninstances,  many  of  our youths end up playing  football  or\r\n\r\nsepak  takraw in basketball courts or in carparks.   In  some\r\n\r\nprivate estates, boys even play football on the roads.  There\r\n\r\nis  definitely a big shortage of land in Singapore for  open-air\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsports, particularly in the HDB heartland and in Singapore in\r\n\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall an incident in my division where there was a\r\n\r\nlarge  plot  of  land  waiting to be  developed  as  a  park.\r\n\r\nNoticing the absence of good football fields, I arranged  for\r\n\r\ntwo  football  goal-posts to be placed  on  the  field.  Soon\r\n\r\nthereafter,  I  noticed  that the field  became  a  hive  for\r\n\r\nfootball  activities in the evenings and on  weekends.   Then\r\n\r\nsuddenly,  one  day, the goal-posts were torn down  and  left\r\n\r\nthere.  On enquiry, I discovered that the land owner, who  is\r\n\r\na  statutory board, not the Land Office, had removed it as no\r\n\r\nwritten  permission  was  obtained  from  them.  Fortunately,\r\n\r\nsubsequently,   written  permission  was  obtained   and   my\r\n\r\nresidents are back to playing football on the same field  but\r\n\r\nwith  a  new  set  of  goal-posts.  I  am  highlighting  this\r\n\r\nincident to show that it requires an MP to get this field for\r\n\r\nhis residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many parcels of State land which are\r\n\r\nsitting idle and waiting to be sold later at Government sales\r\n\r\nprogramme. Some may not even be considered for sale for  many\r\n\r\nyears to come.  The public is afraid of using such land.   It\r\n\r\nis not unusual to see signboards being put up stating that it\r\n\r\nis  State  land  and  that there can be no  trespassing.   At\r\n\r\ntimes,  there  are even signs stating that no  games  can  be\r\n\r\nplayed on such land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Minister to see how we can\r\n\r\nmake  better use of public vacant land.  I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  consider ways to make them  available  for\r\n\r\npublic  use,  be they for sports or other social  activities.\r\n\r\nThe  Land  Office can be pro-active by putting up  signboards\r\n\r\nstating  that  games can be played or concerts  organised  on\r\n\r\nsuch land. The Land Office can also take the lead in ensuring\r\n\r\nthat idle land is well-used for public purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other landowners like Ministries, statutory\r\n\r\nboards and GLCs, they can also take the lead in ensuring that\r\n\r\ntheir  idle  land  can  be used for public  purposes  by  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Such   action  may  even  motivate  large   private\r\n\r\nlandowners  to  open  up their land for  public  use  pending\r\n\r\nfuture development.  Such action will certainly be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwelcomed by the public and help minimise the lost opportunity\r\n\r\ncost of not fully utilising such vacant land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the freehold\r\n\r\napartments  of  two groups of my constituents  were  acquired\r\n\r\ntowards  the end of 1998 for road widening purpose.   One  of\r\n\r\nthem was the Elling Court at the junction of Bartley Road and\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  Road, and the other was along Upper  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nRoad.   The  property  market was  in  a  slump  due  to  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  at  that  time.   The  owners  were   paid\r\n\r\ncompensation at market rate at that point of time as assessed\r\n\r\nby  the  Chief Assessor of the Land Office.  For  a  freehold\r\n\r\napartment,  they  were given statutory awards,  ranging  from\r\n\r\n$240,000  to $300,000 which was not even enough for  some  of\r\n\r\nthem to purchase an alternative 4-room resale HDB flat in the\r\n\r\nopen  market. Some appealed for direct purchase of HDB  flats\r\n\r\nfrom HDB but their appeals were turned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the property market rebounded and property\r\n\r\nprices  recovered much of their lost ground.   Some  affected\r\n\r\nowner occupiers were subsequently given ex-gratia payment  to\r\n\r\ntop  up  the  statutory awards to make the total compensation\r\n\r\nmarginally better. Those who had a second property  were  not\r\n\r\nqualified for ex-gratia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected owners compared their fate with those affected\r\n\r\nby  the  Selective  En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme.  They  felt\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  they were unfairly treated. Some  who  bought\r\n\r\ntheir  properties at the height of the market had seen  their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings diminished and have difficulties repaying  their\r\n\r\nbank loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government could have been more generous\r\n\r\nin  making  ex-gratia  payments for the  affected  residents,\r\n\r\nconsidering the fact that those citizens affected by SERS are\r\n\r\nso  well-treated, where they are not only given a  brand  new\r\n\r\nflat  of  equivalent size, but also a good sum of disturbance\r\n\r\nallowance.  In the case of private property owners,  some  of\r\n\r\nthem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  are  retirees are not even allowed to  purchase  a  flat\r\n\r\ndirect from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there could be a more equitable way of\r\n\r\ncompensation.  Currently, the compensation is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nassessed  market  value  of the properties  at  the  date  of\r\n\r\nacquisition or 1st January 1995, whichever is lower.  In this\r\n\r\nparticular  case, instead of taking the lowest point,  is  it\r\n\r\nmore  equitable to take the average from the year  1995  when\r\n\r\nthe  compensation  rate  was last  revised  to  the  time  of\r\n\r\nacquisition?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the Government is the\r\n\r\nsingle  largest  land owner in Singapore and  has  many  land\r\n\r\nparcels  reserved  for  future  developments.  Although   the\r\n\r\nMinistry has made efforts to allow temporary usage of  vacant\r\n\r\nreserve land, more can be done to maximise the use of  vacant\r\n\r\nreserve land for community and commercial purposes.   I  wish\r\n\r\nto seek the following clarifications from the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the percentage of vacant reserve land\r\n\r\nbeing let out on TOL over the last five years? Secondly,  can\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  consider allowing grassroots organisations  to\r\n\r\nbuild temporary communal facilities or use these vacant  land\r\n\r\nparcels  at  a  preferential  rate?  Thirdly,  what  are  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  by  the Ministry to maximise  the  temporary\r\n\r\nusage   of  vacant  reserve  land?  Fourthly,  what  is   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance policy and cost of maintaining the vacant reserve\r\n\r\nland?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nhighlight an aspect of legal aid in Singapore today and  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Law to look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Aid and Advice Act is essentially an Act which\r\n\r\nseeks  to  render aid to Singaporeans and permanent residents\r\n\r\nin  financial need.  Applicants for legal aid have to qualify\r\n\r\nunder  a  means  test which, in my opinion, is stringent  and\r\n\r\ndoes  not  truly reflect cost of living and salary scales  in\r\n\r\nthis present time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 8 of the Act, legal aid may be granted\r\n\r\nwhere the Director is satisfied that the criteria, as set out\r\n\r\nin the Second Schedule, are met.  The applicant must not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  a  disposable income of $7,000 per year and  disposable\r\n\r\ncapital  of  $7,000. \"Disposable income\" for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  includes that of the applicant's spouse.  Thus,  an\r\n\r\napplicant  must  not earn more than $583  a  month  and  this\r\n\r\nexcludes   the   spouse's  income.  Sir,  this   is   totally\r\n\r\nunrealistic, as even certain lowly jobs easily pay more  than\r\n\r\nthat.  It is too stringent a means test because a family with\r\n\r\ntwo  children and a combined income of, say, $1,000 will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to cope financially when even a simple case  in  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's court can easily cost $10,000 in terms of  legal\r\n\r\nfees.  In fact, the Director has an unfettered discretion  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  legal aid even if the applicant qualifies  under  the\r\n\r\nmeans  test. This is reflected in section 8(3) of  the  Legal\r\n\r\nAid and Advice Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14(3) enables the Court to direct the applicant\r\n\r\nto pay the costs of the Director, the solicitor and the other\r\n\r\nparty's  solicitor if the Court feels that the  aided  person\r\n\r\nhas  acted  improperly  in bringing or  defending  any  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings or in the conduct of them.  My view is that  this\r\n\r\nis  unfair and punitive. Before the Legal Aid Bureau takes on\r\n\r\na  case,  the  Director will assess the facts to see  whether\r\n\r\nsuch a case is worth defending or litigating in.  It does not\r\n\r\nappear equitable to punish the aided person who relies on the\r\n\r\nlegal  advice  and judgement of the Director  and  Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau's solicitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who are unable to afford lawyers\r\n\r\nand  who  are  not  qualified for legal  aid.  Sir,  this  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate and the situation can be redressed if  the  means\r\n\r\ntest  is  made less stringent.  In countries like the  United\r\n\r\nStates, people are not prejudiced because the legal mechanism\r\n\r\nworks  on  a  contingency-based system.  In other words,  the\r\n\r\nlawyers get a percentage of the \"winnings\" and expect nothing\r\n\r\nif  they  lose. We do not have such a system here  or  it  is\r\n\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Law will address this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our judiciary has been proclaimed as\r\n\r\none of the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njudicial systems in the world. People are by and large  happy\r\n\r\nthat the legal process is expeditious and fair.  However,  it\r\n\r\nhas  become  clear that increasingly, people are  complaining\r\n\r\nthat  legal  costs are rising in Singapore.  I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether this is due to the cost of our court fees or lawyers'\r\n\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a number of my residents during my meet-the-people sessions who have come to see me both on criminal and\r\n\r\ncivil  matters  affecting  them.   A  number  of  them   have\r\n\r\nhighlighted that they cannot afford to engage private lawyers\r\n\r\ndue  to  their fees.  I have referred some to the  Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau  and some others to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme  run\r\n\r\nby  the Law Society of Singapore.  The two bodies that I have\r\n\r\nhighlighted  have  done an excellent job in  providing  legal\r\n\r\nservices for free or for a nominal fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt of cases where some of these\r\n\r\nresidents  come outside the means test set by the  Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau  and,  as  such,  were  not  granted  legal  aid.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the present means test is set at $7,000  per\r\n\r\nannum.   In divorce cases, I am told that only the income  of\r\n\r\nthe individual who is coming for legal aid is looked at.   In\r\n\r\nany  other case, the income of the whole family is looked at,\r\n\r\nthat is, if it exceeds $7,000 per annum, they do not qualify.\r\n\r\nI  think that the amount that is laid down for the means test\r\n\r\nis  low  and  I  share  the  concern  expressed  by  my  hon.\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Dr Lily Neo, and I hope and urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  raising the means test level that has been  set  in\r\n\r\nthe  Act itself and see how that amount can be raised so that\r\n\r\nmore  Singapore residents, particularly those who  come  from\r\n\r\nthe lower income bracket, can be helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Law Society of Singapore has done an\r\n\r\nexcellent  community service in providing criminal legal  aid\r\n\r\nto  needy Singaporeans. The scheme has been in place for many\r\n\r\nyears, in fact, since 1985.  Unlike many other countries, our\r\n\r\nState  does  not provide criminal legal aid to  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe provision which was there in the Legal Aid and Advice Act\r\n\r\nto provide for criminal legal aid has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremoved.   The  number clearly shows that the Criminal  Legal\r\n\r\nAid  Scheme has benefited many Singaporeans. The scheme  that\r\n\r\nis  run  by  the Law Society has 403 volunteers and  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1985 to 1999, 5,752 applicants applied for legal  aid\r\n\r\nunder  the  Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and 1,318 were  granted\r\n\r\ncriminal  legal  aid.  Some  of  these  people  who  received\r\n\r\ncriminal  legal  aid  were acquitted.  Some  have  had  their\r\n\r\ncharges  withdrawn or reduced. This clearly  establishes  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of  providing  for criminal  legal  aid  to  needy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is fruitful to pursue the argument\r\n\r\nthat  the  State should provide and administer  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nLegal Aid Scheme.  What I would like to urge the Minister  is\r\n\r\nwhether  he  could consider granting an annual grant  to  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) run by the Law Society,  so\r\n\r\nas  to  enable  them  to expand their system  to  more  needy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I personally know that the Minister  has,  in\r\n\r\nhis  personal capacity, put in great efforts to  raise  funds\r\n\r\nfor  the Law Society's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and that  is\r\n\r\nsomething commendable. But it equally shows that the cause is\r\n\r\na  good cause.  I am not asking for a 100% grant for the CLAS\r\n\r\nscheme.   Perhaps, the Minister could consider  approving  an\r\n\r\nannual  grant to cover at least 50% of the cost of  the  CLAS\r\n\r\nscheme  so as to enable criminal legal aid to be extended  to\r\n\r\nmore needy Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, over the last five years, this House\r\n\r\nhas  passed a total of 191 Bills.  This works out to be about\r\n\r\n<br><br>40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills  per year.  In a fast-changing world,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice but to constantly update and introduce new legislation\r\n\r\nto  govern the country.  But we need to understand the impact\r\n\r\nof  the  speed of introducing this legislation on the general\r\n\r\npublic and the business community.  Although the conventional\r\n\r\nmethods   of  gazetting,  publication  of  the  Hansard   and\r\n\r\nnewspaper  reporting are utilised to disseminate amended  and\r\n\r\nnew legislation, the level of awareness and understanding  by\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngeneral public and business community may not be high.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I take\r\n\r\nmy two cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, we enter an age when we\r\n\r\nsee  high  global  integration based on  science,  trade  and\r\n\r\nindustry,  and  the  transformation  of  national  industrial\r\n\r\nsocieties  into  a transnational science-based  civilisation.\r\n\r\nMany  of  our  lawyers who are used to High Street  practice,\r\n\r\ndoing  things  like conveyancing and personal injury  claims,\r\n\r\nwill have to refocus not only to so-called city practice  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  international or regional practice.  A  failure  to\r\n\r\nupgrade one's knowledge or skills will lead to irrelevance in\r\n\r\nthe new setting.  The legal practitioner of yesteryear is  no\r\n\r\nlonger relevant today, nor will today's lawyer be relevant to\r\n\r\nthe practice of tomorrow if he or she does not make an effort\r\n\r\nto upgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New technologies generate new problems that require\r\n\r\nlegal  expertise  to resolve.  New regional  trading  regimes\r\n\r\nrequire adaptation to and familiarity with legal systems  and\r\n\r\nlaws that are not the same as ours.  There is also a need  to\r\n\r\nknow  foreign languages and cultures.  The liberalisation  of\r\n\r\nservices is also a push factor for our lawyers to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal education in Singapore can no longer be seen as a\r\n\r\ndiscrete   responsibility  of several  institutions   -   the\r\n\r\nFaculty of Law, Board of Legal Education, Law Society or  the\r\n\r\nAcademy  of  Law.   It must be seen as a holistic  enterprise\r\n\r\nwith  the  first  primary or formal stage  being  the  degree\r\n\r\nstage,  followed by a system of coordinated,  continuous  and\r\n\r\neven  compulsory legal education throughout the working  life\r\n\r\nof a lawyer.  Only in this way, can a lawyer of today prepare\r\n\r\nfor the practice of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we train the global lawyer? It is easy to\r\n\r\nstate  that  the lawyer of tomorrow must not  only  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  thinking  skills, he  must  also  be  vocationally\r\n\r\nrelevant  and professionally functional.  But the  vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  of  a lawyer is best done after he or she  has  had\r\n\r\nseveral years of practice.  It involves acquiring good street\r\n\r\nsense  and  business  acumen, as much  as  specialised  legal\r\n\r\nknowledge  in  foreign  tax laws or international  commercial\r\n\r\ncodes.   I  would therefore like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nhis   Ministry  would,  first,  support  a  review  of  legal\r\n\r\neducation  as  a whole and, second, to examine seriously  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  continuing  legal  education  in  the  profession,\r\n\r\nperhaps  as  a condition to practise.  Second,  even  as  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of  the transnational scientific civilisation  exert\r\n\r\nthemselves on lawyers, there is an even greater need for  our\r\n\r\nyoung  lawyers  to  value not just a career  that  they  will\r\n\r\npursue but also the community that they operate in.  In  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  one  of  the  best ways  to  impart  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  community and  its  problems  to  law\r\n\r\nstudents  is  through instituting a clinical legal  education\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a programme can achieve a number of objectives.\r\n\r\nFirst, it would provide law students with an appreciation  of\r\n\r\nreal  life  problems and an opportunity for them to  practise\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have  learnt  in law school.   Second,  it  would\r\n\r\nheighten  their  understanding of society.   And,  third,  it\r\n\r\nprovides  them  with a sense of realism.  Finally,  it  would\r\n\r\nhopefully  instill  in them a sense of civic  duty,  so  that\r\n\r\nbefore they begin to practise law, before they begin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  earn their millions, they would be conscious of the  need\r\n\r\nto provide legal services to all who come to seek their help,\r\n\r\nnot only to those who can afford to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask whether the Minister would\r\n\r\nsupport such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Minister of State Ho Peng Kee, and I will  answer\r\n\r\nthe  points raised by Members within the time allotted to us.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  hope  if  any points are cut off by  the  guillotine,\r\n\r\nMembers will file questions at subsequent sittings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Chng Hee Kok asked about our ability to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  legal  framework  in  order  to  keep  abreast  of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and changes in the business world.  First, as\r\n\r\nto  the procedure, let me say that we have established a  Law\r\n\r\nReform   Coordinating  Committee  chaired  by  the  Attorney-General, representatives from the Faculty of Law, Academy  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  Law  Society and representatives of various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.  The task of this Law Reform Coordinating Committee\r\n\r\nis precisely to ensure that our legal system and our laws are\r\n\r\nup  to  date, and whatever reforms are needed, they  will  be\r\n\r\nundertaken.   The  Committee itself will not  be  the  agency\r\n\r\ndoing the reforms but it is, in fact, the coordinating agency\r\n\r\nto ensure that what needs to be done will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Attorney-General's Chambers has set up\r\n\r\na  dedicated Law Reform and Revision Division this year.   It\r\n\r\nwill  fulfil  a long-felt need for a full time dedicated  law\r\n\r\nreform  outfit in Singapore.  The Attorney-General, in  fact,\r\n\r\nwill  be  sending  two  officers from  his  Chambers  to  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  Law  Reform Commission to pick  up  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprocedures and methods which are used in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for examples of how we have kept abreast. The\r\n\r\nMember  would know that we have in fact passed some important\r\n\r\nlegislation.  For example, the legislation amending the Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  Act had very much to do with fundamental  changes\r\n\r\nto  our legal system and legal framework so that it would  be\r\n\r\nable to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkeep  in  tune  with the challenges ahead of us, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  on  incorporation of companies  as  well  as\r\n\r\nallowing foreign law firms to form  joint ventures and formal\r\n\r\nalliances  with local firms.  These are very important  steps\r\n\r\ntaken recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would also note that we have made important\r\n\r\namendments  to  our  bankruptcy  legislation,  precisely   to\r\n\r\nsupport   the   Technopreneurship   21   initiative.    These\r\n\r\namendments  have  increased  the  threshold  for  bankruptcy,\r\n\r\nraised  the debt level for discharge by the Official Assignee\r\n\r\nand made it easier for bankrupts to do business and expedited\r\n\r\npayments to creditors.  I think this reform to the bankruptcy\r\n\r\nlegislation is a very good example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred to the challenges posed by cyberspace crimes\r\n\r\nand  challenges which they pose for copyrights  and  patents.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  we  have made progress because we  amended  the\r\n\r\nCopyright  Act  to  meet  these  challenges  posed   by   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of new technology and the increasing  popularity\r\n\r\nof electronic commerce.  We improved copyright protection and\r\n\r\nenforcement  of measures for copyright owners in  cyberspace,\r\n\r\nto  promote  the use of Internet by businesses, and  we  also\r\n\r\nprovided  greater  legal certainty for both copyright  owners\r\n\r\nand   users   of   copyright  works,  not  to   mention   the\r\n\r\nintermediaries such as network service providers.  We  had  a\r\n\r\nfull debate on this not long ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also restructured the Registry of Trade Marks\r\n\r\nand   Patents  into  the  Intellectual  Property  Office   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (IPOS).  This is important to maintain Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge,  and  IPOS will  move  away  from  just  a\r\n\r\nregulatory  body.  It will ensure a sound infrastructure  for\r\n\r\nthe    development   of   intellectual   property   and   the\r\n\r\nadministration of protection of intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have done a fair bit, but with the establishment\r\n\r\nof the Law Reform Coordinating Committee, I expect that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a more coordinated and focused approach to ensuring\r\n\r\nthat these needs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  challenges  posed  by fast-changing  local  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninternational environment will be met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about conveyancing fees and whether it is\r\n\r\ntimely  to review.  Members will recall that we last reviewed\r\n\r\nthe  conveyancing  scale  fees in 1995,  when  the  Committee\r\n\r\nchaired by Mr Justice Chao Hick Tin made his recommendations.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the Committee had considered whether to abolish\r\n\r\nscale  fees altogether, but had concluded that it was in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest to retain a mandatory fixed scale fees but we\r\n\r\nhad  changes  made to the scale fees.  I said that  we  would\r\n\r\nreview the matter in about 4-5 years' time.   My Ministry has\r\n\r\nnot  made  a decision yet on the precise changes to be  made,\r\n\r\nbut  the  Attorney-General and I agreed that it is timely  to\r\n\r\nreview this matter now, and we shall in due course set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee to look into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to which direction the review will take, I would\r\n\r\nprefer  to  let  the committee look into this  and  make  its\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  But Mr Chng Hee Kok knows that I  have  said\r\n\r\nseveral  times,  and  so has the Attorney-General,  that  the\r\n\r\nlegal   profession   should  prepare   themselves   for   the\r\n\r\neventuality that sooner or later the scale fees will have  to\r\n\r\nbe abolished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about the Trustees Act and the\r\n\r\nchanges  made  in  England and her  criticisms  on  what  she\r\n\r\nthought  were  outmoded approaches of the  Trustees  Act  and\r\n\r\nwhether we would review it.  Let me say that we have referred\r\n\r\nprecisely  these  issues to the Law Reform Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Academy   of  Law.   They   have   made   several\r\n\r\nrecommendations which we are studying with a view to amending\r\n\r\nthe  Act.  Although the changes have not been finalised,  let\r\n\r\nme  say  that,  broadly, the recommendations  do  contemplate\r\n\r\nallowing  a  trustee  to invest in any  form  of  investment,\r\n\r\nprovided   he   exercises  prudence  in   relation   to   the\r\n\r\ninvestments,  probable  income, the capital  safety  and  the\r\n\r\nsuitability  for  the  trust, which is commonly  known  as  a\r\n\r\nprudent man rule.  I think she referred to this.  They do not\r\n\r\nrecommend  a  complete abolition of the list  of  investments\r\n\r\ncurrently found\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the First Schedule.  It is proposed that this list should\r\n\r\nbe   retained  to  serve  as  a  guidance  to  the  trustees,\r\n\r\nparticularly  non-professional trustees of small  and  family\r\n\r\ntrusts who could benefit from such guidance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the need for diversification of investments and\r\n\r\nfor   the   adoption   of   an   investment   strategy,   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation is that this be considered as part and  parcel\r\n\r\nof  the  prudent man rule.  I will take her suggestions  into\r\n\r\naccount when we look at these recommendations with a view  to\r\n\r\namending the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran referred to the fact that some legislation\r\n\r\nhave  requirements  for declarations  of  interest  and  some\r\n\r\nlegislation do not.  We can look into this.  His point really\r\n\r\nis  that  there should be avoidance of conflict of  interest,\r\n\r\nwith   which  we  cannot  disagree.   Why  is  it  that  some\r\n\r\nlegislation do not contain these provisions?  I am not  sure.\r\n\r\nI  guess that those legislation generally are Acts of a  non-operational  statutory board such as institutions  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning  where they might have thought that  the  danger  of\r\n\r\nacting   in   conflict  of  interest  is   not   that   real.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I take his point into account and we  will  ask\r\n\r\nthe  parent Ministries to have a look at it.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  I  agree  with him that where the  legislation  is\r\n\r\nsilent, a member of a statutory board could profess ignorance\r\n\r\nand profit from a conflict of interest.  This is because even\r\n\r\nif  there is no specific provision in the Act, I believe  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  law  places fiduciary duty on members  of  statutory\r\n\r\nboards so that if they were to abuse their fiduciary position\r\n\r\nand  make secret profits, they will be obliged under the  law\r\n\r\nto cough out those profits.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Ravindran talk about the Legal Aid\r\n\r\nand  Advice  Act  and the stringency of the means  test.  The\r\n\r\nmeans  test  was last reviewed in 1995 and the threshold  was\r\n\r\nincreased.  We not only increased the income ceiling  but  we\r\n\r\nalso  allowed more deductions.  I am prepared to look  at  it\r\n\r\nagain.   But  let  me  say  that the  Members  ought  not  to\r\n\r\nmisunderstand the provisions in the Act.  The requirement for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisposable  income  of less than $7,000 does  not  mean  that\r\n\r\nlegal aid will never be provided to applicants who earn  more\r\n\r\nthan $583 a month because in computing the disposable income,\r\n\r\nvarious deductions are allowed, including deductions for CPF,\r\n\r\nrental,  personal deductions and deductions  for  dependants.\r\n\r\nAlso,  in practice, the income of a spouse is disregarded  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases, such as where the parties are separated and if\r\n\r\nit  is  reasonable  to do so to relieve hardship.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nunder  the  means test, a sole breadwinner with two  children\r\n\r\nwho  is earning $1,200 a month ought not to have problems  in\r\n\r\nqualifying for legal aid.  In fact, on the average, about 80%\r\n\r\nwho  applied for legal aid in 1996 and 1997 qualified for it.\r\n\r\nThere  was a dip in 1998 and 1999 when this figure dipped  to\r\n\r\nabout  65%, but we think that was because of the sudden large\r\n\r\nnumber  of applicants as a result of the hardship during  the\r\n\r\nslowdown in the economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked by Dr Lily Neo about discretion to\r\n\r\nrefuse  legal  aid.  Let me say first that  this  is  not  an\r\n\r\nunfettered discretion because under the Act the Director  can\r\n\r\nrefuse only if it is unreasonable to grant aid.  In practice,\r\n\r\nthe  Bureau  will take instructions from every applicant  who\r\n\r\nqualifies to determine if there are merits for granting legal\r\n\r\naid.   Decisions  are not arbitrary and  they  are  based  on\r\n\r\ncareful   evaluation   of   the  facts   and   circumstances.\r\n\r\nObviously,  even if a person qualifies, the Board would  have\r\n\r\nto  consider the merits of the case, for example, whether the\r\n\r\ncosts  involved in pursuing the case would be much more  than\r\n\r\nthe  amount claimed for.  If the amount claimed for is  $200,\r\n\r\nbut  the whole process will cost much more, that will be  one\r\n\r\nof the considerations that we take into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the seemingly unfair punitive\r\n\r\nprovision  in  ordering costs against  aided  persons.   Here\r\n\r\nagain,  there  may  be a misunderstanding.   This  is  not  a\r\n\r\nprovision applied often and frequently across the board. This\r\n\r\nis  to  take care of a very narrow situation where it may  be\r\n\r\nfound out later that the person who obtained legal advice  or\r\n\r\nlegal aid actually had acted improperly or even dishonestly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe  might have even told lies.  In that kind of situation, it\r\n\r\nis  not equitable that a person be seen to have got off scot-free.   So  this is the narrow situation where costs  may  be\r\n\r\nawarded against that person.  In fact, as far as I could find\r\n\r\nout from the Legal Aid Bureau, they can recall only about two\r\n\r\nor  so  instances when an aided person has been asked to  pay\r\n\r\ncost under this provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned contingency fee. I am not sure whether\r\n\r\nshe  was  seriously  proposing that the  Government  consider\r\n\r\ncontingency  fee  like the United States.   That  will  be  a\r\n\r\nfundamental change where it will change the nature of client-solicitor relationship.  Often it has been criticised that  a\r\n\r\nlawyer  may become personally and emotionally involved  in  a\r\n\r\ncase  where his fees are dependent on whether he succeeds  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about the Criminal Legal Aid System.\r\n\r\nI  think  I  do not have to repeat the reasons given  when  I\r\n\r\namended  the Legal Aid and Advice Act.  I then spelt out  the\r\n\r\nreasons  as  to  why Government will confine  itself  to  the\r\n\r\nprovision of civil legal aid. But I assured the House, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  assured  the  Law Society, that my Ministry  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with them to support their Criminal Legal Aid System.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, if you ask the President of the Law Society he will\r\n\r\nconfirm that the Ministry and myself have worked with them to\r\n\r\nraise funds to meet their requirements for the Criminal Legal\r\n\r\nAid  System, including a grant from the Academy  of  Law.   I\r\n\r\nmyself  have given them ideas and fund-raising projects  were\r\n\r\norganised  where  I  was involved, and I believe  that  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  situation has been met, and  I  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nsupport their activity in that regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin raised the question of public education\r\n\r\nfor legislation.  Basically, he asked two questions:  One  is\r\n\r\nmaking  legislation and policies of the legislation known  to\r\n\r\nthe  public.   His  point  is where  legislation  breaks  new\r\n\r\ngrounds,  important policies, people should be made aware  of\r\n\r\nthem.   I  think  we cannot dispute that.   It  goes  without\r\n\r\nsaying.  But I would say this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  to  be left to the respective Ministries which are  most\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  about the policies which they are  enunciating\r\n\r\nor  promulgating  through legislation in  this  House.   Most\r\n\r\nMinistries are aware of the need to do so.  If Dr Teo Ho  Pin\r\n\r\nfeels  that  the  publicity  or  public  education  from  any\r\n\r\nparticular  Ministry on any particular legislation  has  been\r\n\r\ninadequate  he could take up the cudgels with the  respective\r\n\r\nMinister.   But,  as a general principle, I support  what  he\r\n\r\nsays.  It is part of the process of preparing the public  and\r\n\r\nexplaining the rationale of legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point was whether we can use IT to\r\n\r\ndisseminate  legislation.  Indeed, we have been  doing  this.\r\n\r\nThe  Attorney-General's Chambers has  informed  me  that  the\r\n\r\nLawNet  Management Committee has agreed to allow free  access\r\n\r\nby members of the public to the LawNet statutes database from\r\n\r\nterminals  located in the National Library and  its  branches\r\n\r\nand  it  is working on the details with the National  Library\r\n\r\nBoard.   The  LawNet  statutes database  will  also  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  for  free  to  members  of  the  public   at   the\r\n\r\ninformation  kiosks  in  the Supreme  Court  when  these  are\r\n\r\nupgraded  to  be  Web  kiosks in  a  few  months'  time.   In\r\n\r\naddition, the Member should know that the Subordinate  Courts\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Law Society and the Ministry  of  Law  are\r\n\r\nworking on a website on the provision of legal information to\r\n\r\nthe  layman.  This website will act as a portal from which  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  public  can  be directed  to  the  different\r\n\r\nwebsites  containing legal information about Singapore,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Law Awareness page or the Law Society's website  and\r\n\r\nthe  information leaflets page of the Subordinate  Courts  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  information page on the  websites  of  various\r\n\r\ndepartments of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two minutes to deal with Prof. Chin's points.\r\n\r\nFirst, I agree completely with him on the need for the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  to  upgrade themselves to  stay  abreast  of  new\r\n\r\nchanges and techniques in law.  In fact, the President of the\r\n\r\nLaw  Society,  I  believe, in the Opening of the  Legal  Year\r\n\r\naddress,  said that there should be mandatory legal education\r\n\r\nand that the Law Society will proceed robustly in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npursuing  this.  It is a point which I would support  and  we\r\n\r\nwould be happy to work with him to ensure that that becomes a\r\n\r\nfeature of our legal profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot also disagree with his idea that our legal\r\n\r\neducation  is  such  that  potential graduates,  before  they\r\n\r\ngraduate as law students, should be exposed to the real world\r\n\r\naspect of their practice of law.  How do we do this?  I think\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Law  and  the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\nshould  discuss  with the Law Faculty.   One  aspect  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  attachment  to various law firms  and  institutions.\r\n\r\nSome  countries go beyond this and allow the law students  to\r\n\r\nengage  in clinical law practice under the supervision  of  a\r\n\r\npractitioner.   To  do  that is a little complicated  because\r\n\r\nthey have to make sure that it does not run foul of the Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  Act  and  it  raises  questions  of  professional\r\n\r\nliability  and responsibility.  Will the student,  before  he\r\n\r\ngraduates,  be  actually signing documents and giving  advice\r\n\r\nwhich  he acted on, or will it be the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nlawyer  under  whom  he works and under whom  he  supervises?\r\n\r\nThese  are  some  technical questions which  have  some  far-reaching implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have touched most of the points raised by\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  I will now ask my colleague, Prof. Ho,  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the remaining issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will deal with Mr Goh Choon Kang's amendment\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang suggests an alternative method of\r\n\r\ncalculating  land acquisition compensation.   First,  let  me\r\n\r\nstate,  at  the  outset,  that the Government  only  acquires\r\n\r\nprivate lands when absolutely necessary.  It is committed  to\r\n\r\npaying a reasonable compensation to landowners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition Act is amended from time to time to\r\n\r\nensure  that the compensation rates keep up with the  market,\r\n\r\nespecially when prices rise.  The current date is 1st January\r\n\r\n1995, which in fact is higher than the 1998 and 1999 property\r\n\r\nprices of most sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate individual owners' financial hardship,\r\n\r\nGovernment initiated an ex-gratia payment scheme in 1982, the\r\n\r\nscope  of which has been widened progressively over the  past\r\n\r\n18  years.  Let me illustrate how the scheme works under both\r\n\r\ngood and poor market conditions.  When a property is acquired\r\n\r\nat  a  time  when  property prices are  high,  the  statutory\r\n\r\ncompensation, though pegged at 1st January 1995  prices,  can\r\n\r\nbe  topped  up  to  current  market value  through  ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayments,  if owners meet eligibility criteria, such  as  the\r\n\r\nproperty being owner-occupied.  Indeed, we have widened  this\r\n\r\nto  even include owners who own more than one property.  When\r\n\r\na  property  is  acquired under poor market  conditions,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation,  though correspondingly lower, would  generally\r\n\r\nbe sufficient to cover the costs of an alternative comparable\r\n\r\nproperty,  as property prices will be depressed.  Even  then,\r\n\r\nin  such  a  situation, if the owners suffer  hardship  after\r\n\r\nreceiving  compensation, ex-gratia payments are  extended  to\r\n\r\nthem  on a case-by-case basis.  Indeed, many landowners, some\r\n\r\nof whom were Mr Goh's constituents, have benefitted from this\r\n\r\nex-gratia  scheme which was widened to include the situation,\r\n\r\nas  has  happened to his constituents, where the compensation\r\n\r\namount  was pegged at the actual market rate. So this  is  an\r\n\r\nextension of the original concept of ex-gratia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach of combining statutory compensation and ex-gratia payment has worked well in the overwhelming majority\r\n\r\nof  cases.  There is no compelling reason to change it to the\r\n\r\nscheme  proposed  by  Mr  Goh.  The Member's  proposal  which\r\n\r\ninvolves  averaging out property values over the  five  years\r\n\r\npreceding  the  acquisition, and paying that  amount  without\r\n\r\nregard  to the market value at the date of Gazette, does  not\r\n\r\ngive  certainty to the compensation quantum, and  indeed  may\r\n\r\nresult  in either windfall gains for some owners or financial\r\n\r\nhardship for others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because if the average value results in a\r\n\r\ncompensation that is lower than prevailing market values, the\r\n\r\naffected  landowners will be priced out in their purchase  of\r\n\r\nan alternative comparable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperty  in  the  open market.  On the other  hand,  if  the\r\n\r\naverage  value results in a compensation that is higher  than\r\n\r\nprevailing  market  values, affected  landowners  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nunwarranted windfall gains at the expense of the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, all things considered, the current approach,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a tested one, has worked well, and should  remain.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course,  Government will  continue  to  review  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  date  for compensation under the Land  Acquisition\r\n\r\nAct,  and  certainly give ex-gratia payments where applicable\r\n\r\nto hardship cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other two cuts are by Mr Ravindran and Dr Teo.\r\n\r\nLet  me  take their points.  First, let me assure the Members\r\n\r\nthat it has always been Land Office's policy and practice  to\r\n\r\noptimise  the  use  of  our  scarce  land  resource.   Hence,\r\n\r\nwhenever  and  wherever  State lands are  available,  and  if\r\n\r\nsupported by the Chief Planner, for interim uses, Land Office\r\n\r\nallocates  them  to  both private and  public  organisations,\r\n\r\nincluding  community  organisations,  for  their  use.    For\r\n\r\nexample, in 1998, Land Office allocated four sites to various\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  for  interim  uses\r\n\r\nsuch  as  street  soccer court, basketball and  sepak  takraw\r\n\r\ncourts and a hardcourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for measures taken to maximise the interim use of\r\n\r\nstate  land  and  maintaining them,  Land  Office  set  up  a\r\n\r\nPlanning  and Development Unit in 1998 to take stock  of  the\r\n\r\nstate  land available and systematically plan for the interim\r\n\r\nuses  with  the relevant authorities, if the state lands  are\r\n\r\nnot immediately required for development.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, we have reached \"guillotine\"\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $179,887,400 for Head S ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof  the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $451,117,300 for Head S ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head E -\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head E - Judicature.

At the moment, in Singapore,  for  all\r\n\r\npurposes,  there  is only a single right  of  appeal  from  a\r\n\r\nconviction  sustained  in the Subordinate  Court.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nsingle-tier  appeal.   And similarly, when  a  conviction  is\r\n\r\nsustained in the High Court, there is a single tier appeal to\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Criminal Appeal.  I have said that this is  not\r\n\r\nvery  satisfactory.  There have been instances in  the  past,\r\n\r\nand of course there was my case, where they have been refused\r\n\r\nright of appeal.  Somehow I was able to take it up in another\r\n\r\nrelated  appeal to the Privy Council where they said all  the\r\n\r\nconvictions were wrong.  But it is not to complain  about  my\r\n\r\nmatter that I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about the situation where an accused\r\n\r\nperson  has  been  acquitted  by  the  trial  court  in   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts and the Public Prosecutor appeals  against\r\n\r\nthat acquittal.  The High Court decides in its wisdom to  set\r\n\r\naside the acquittal and substitute a conviction of the man or\r\n\r\nwoman.  In that instance, unless the Appellate Court, hearing\r\n\r\nthe   appeal  by  the  Public  Prosecutor,  agrees  to  state\r\n\r\nquestions  of  law  to  the  Court of  Criminal  Appeal,  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate man or woman is left with no right of  appeal  at\r\n\r\nall.   He  is convicted after he has been acquitted, after  a\r\n\r\nfull trial on the merits by a Judge of the court and then  he\r\n\r\nis  convicted,  and  he is left with no  redress.   This  has\r\n\r\nhappened  at least in two cases or more that I can  remember,\r\n\r\nand  it is a most unsatisfactory system.  It denies the basic\r\n\r\nright  of an individual to have his conviction tested  by  an\r\n\r\nAppellate  Court.   I have said that in  a  number  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries, particularly the Commonwealth\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries, the prevailing norm is a two-tier appeal.  In  our\r\n\r\ncountry,  it is just one-tier, but there are these situations\r\n\r\nwhere  even  this one appeal is denied.  In other  countries,\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Prosecutor  has no right  of  appeal  where  the\r\n\r\nacquittal is on merit but in Singapore, the Public Prosecutor\r\n\r\ncan  appeal where the acquittal goes simply on the merits and\r\n\r\nnot on any question of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time we looked at this right of appeal. I\r\n\r\npersonally would like a review of the whole appellate  system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  even in the civil cases.  We  passed  a  Bill\r\n\r\nquite  recently  denying appeals in  civil  cases  where  the\r\n\r\namount  of  the claim is $50,000 or less, but providing  that\r\n\r\nthe  person who is aggrieved may apply to the Judge who heard\r\n\r\nthe  case to grant leave.  May I say from personal experience\r\n\r\nthat  it  is extremely difficult to get leave from the  Judge\r\n\r\nwho  has  heard the case on the merits and who  is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the  decision  is right.  It would  seem  to  be  going\r\n\r\nagainst the grain to later say, yes, I think the decision may\r\n\r\nbe wrong, I will give you leave to appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, do you want to allow time\r\n\r\nfor a reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So for a magistrate's appeal,\r\n\r\nif  the  High  Court  overturns an acquittal  on  appeal  and\r\n\r\nconvicts  the accused person, there is no reason to  let  him\r\n\r\nhave  another bite of the cherry before the Court of  Appeal,\r\n\r\nbecause  arguments  would already have been  fully  canvassed\r\n\r\nbefore  the Appeal Judge, which, in Singapore, is  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice  who hears all magistrates' appeals.  So we take  all\r\n\r\nappeals  seriously.  And because CJ hears all these  appeals,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  tone that is set - that appeals will  be  taken\r\n\r\nseriously,  with consistency in sentencing and  also  in  the\r\n\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the appeals process under section 60, Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nis  wont to raise this all the time.  Section 60 is a process\r\n\r\nwhereby  if the Public Prosecutor considers that there  is  a\r\n\r\npoint of law of public interest which he wants to clarify for\r\n\r\nfuture  guidance,  he  will ask  the  High  Court  to  set  a\r\n\r\nreference to the Court of Appeal to decide the point of  law.\r\n\r\nBut even if he wins the reference or the reference is decided\r\n\r\nin  his favour, the acquittal of the accused person will  not\r\n\r\nbe overturned.  So that is an important point.  Otherwise, he\r\n\r\nwill think that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The accused person is taking it up, not\r\n\r\nthe Public Prosecutor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If the accused person takes\r\n\r\nit  up,  then the law is quite clear what he has to  satisfy.\r\n\r\nHe  has to convince the Court that there is a point of law of\r\n\r\npublic  interest,  the resolution of which has  affected  the\r\n\r\noutcome of the appeal, and the High Court has to consider the\r\n\r\napplication.   Even though it is the court that  decided  the\r\n\r\ncase  - I think we must give it to our Judges - Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nwill  not be fair if he says that because a particular  Judge\r\n\r\ndecided  the case, he will not want that point to  go  up  on\r\n\r\nreference to the Court of Appeal, because he must justify it.\r\n\r\nIt is all in the records.

The law is quite clear.  The law is that  any\r\n\r\nstatement taken from any person, whether it be an accused  or\r\n\r\na  witness, by a police officer above the rank of Sergeant is\r\n\r\nadmissible  at the trial.  Of course, if the accused  or  the\r\n\r\nperson making the statement says that it was obtained against\r\n\r\nhis will, it was an involuntary statement, then the court has\r\n\r\nto  consider whether it should be admitted or not.   But  the\r\n\r\nlaw is that it is admissible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite what the law is, the AG's Chambers has\r\n\r\nconsistently denied lawyers acting for the accused the  right\r\n\r\nto  look  at  statements made by their clients during  police\r\n\r\ninvestigation, particularly statements under section  121  of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Procedure Code.  This is where the Police spend\r\n\r\nhours questioning the man and then taking his long statement,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  they call it.  The prosecution keeps that statement.   If\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to  use  it, then they make it available  to  the\r\n\r\naccused  just before the trial.  But if they do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nuse  it because that statement does not help them, but it may\r\n\r\nhelp  the  accused, they refuse to release it to the accused.\r\n\r\nThat  seems to me, without any doubt, to offend the  rule  of\r\n\r\nnatural  justice.  It denies to the accused evidence that  is\r\n\r\nin  his favour which he can use.  Of course, I shall be  told\r\n\r\nby  the Minister of State - I see he is going to reply - that\r\n\r\nyes,  we  do  release it, but it is only released  after  the\r\n\r\naccused  has given his evidence.  And they make no secret  of\r\n\r\nit.   They say they want it because they want to see  whether\r\n\r\nthey  can  trip  him up when he gives his  evidence,  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether he has said something differently in the statement to\r\n\r\nthe  police.   That seems to me to be taking a  very  unfair,\r\n\r\nunjust  advantage over an accused person, and that is  coming\r\n\r\nfrom the prosecution chambers in this country.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say to this House, which I have said to the court\r\n\r\nseveral times, that it is no duty, no part of the prosecution\r\n\r\nto  win  its cases.  This has been said over and over  again.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution owes to the accused to be fair and just.   It\r\n\r\nhas  the duty to see that the accused gets the fairest trial,\r\n\r\nnot  trying  to  obtain a conviction by means of  withholding\r\n\r\nstatements which might be able to assist him.  May I quote to\r\n\r\nthis  House  what a very learned prosecutor  in  England,  Mr\r\n\r\nChristmas  Humphreys, a devout Buddhist, said in one  of  his\r\n\r\npublic  lectures that one of the first things he did when  he\r\n\r\nwas  assigned a case to prosecute was to ring up the  defence\r\n\r\ncounsel,  counsel for the accused and say, \"Is there anything\r\n\r\nI  can do to assist you?  You want any information, you  want\r\n\r\nto  know  anything?\"   That  is  how  prosecution  should  be\r\n\r\nconducted.    Prosecution  should   not   be   conducted   by\r\n\r\nwithholding information and evidence that might be useful  to\r\n\r\nthe accused and then springing it on him.  That is simply not\r\n\r\nbeing  fair  to an accused person.  So I would ask  that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  be  told  that they  should  consider  this\r\n\r\npractice because the law is that it is admissible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked the courts over and over again to rule,\r\n\r\nbut  the courts have said, \"We cannot, because it is for  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers.  We wouldn't rule against that.\"\r\n\r\nThere  was an observation by Justice Rajendran some time  ago\r\n\r\nwhen  he  took the prosecution to task for not releasing  the\r\n\r\nstatement made by an accused when the defence asked  for  it.\r\n\r\nHis  words  were,  \"Do you realise that you  are  suppressing\r\n\r\nevidence?\"   So  that is the position.  May I  ask  that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers  be  asked  to  give  this  real\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  see  that they  do  not  try  and  obtain\r\n\r\nconvictions by any unfair means.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in his usual grain, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam wants to shift the balance more in favour  of  the\r\n\r\naccused.   That is his enduring theme all these years.   Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, let me say that, in Singapore, accused persons do  not\r\n\r\nhave a right to copies of statements made to the police apart\r\n\r\nfrom   the   first  information  report  and  the   cautioned\r\n\r\nstatements they themselves have made to the police.  That  is\r\n\r\na matter of practice which has been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite different from the question of\r\n\r\nadmissibility.  Admissibility goes to whether a statement can\r\n\r\nbe  admitted in court.  Here, we are talking about whether an\r\n\r\naccused  person is entitled to have a certain statement  that\r\n\r\nhe  has made.  So that is the first point.  Indeed, there  is\r\n\r\nno  provision  in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)  for  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  disclosure by the accused persons of documents  in\r\n\r\nthe possession of the prosecution.  There is clause 58(1)  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPC.   But  this is only where the accused  is  able  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the court that the document is necessary or desirable\r\n\r\nfor the conduct of his trial that he may be able to obtain  a\r\n\r\ncopy of the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also remind Mr Jeyaretnam that, in\r\n\r\nprosecuting  a  case, the Attorney-General's Chambers,  first\r\n\r\nand  foremost, seeks to protect the public interest, not just\r\n\r\nto  win cases.  There is a much wider stake that is at issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, let me remind him that every society must find its  own\r\n\r\nbalance  between  how  to protect this  public  interest  and\r\n\r\nensuring that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccused  has a fair trial.  And the system that  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is a system that is open for all to see, for all to\r\n\r\ncritique.   The  legal system and all the  processes  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  are  part  of the criminal justice  system  that  has\r\n\r\nreceived  high praise, not from Singaporeans alone, not  from\r\n\r\nPAP backbenchers, but from objective ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> From business enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Not true, because the latest\r\n\r\npoll  by  the  Subordinate Courts polled  not  just  business\r\n\r\npeople, but Singaporeans.  1,500 Singaporeans were polled and\r\n\r\nthey expressed full confidence in the fair administration  of\r\n\r\njustice.   Other  polls  were  also  conducted.   The   legal\r\n\r\nadministration in Singapore has also come for high mention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in some countries, the pendulum has swung too\r\n\r\nmuch  the  other  way.   We do not want  that  to  happen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For  example,  in  UK,  the  Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nInvestigating Act was enacted in 1996 in part to address  the\r\n\r\nimbalance that existed before then, ie, too much in favour of\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution.  Therefore, remedial steps were taken.   So\r\n\r\nlet us not go down that path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam knows that, in a criminal trial, in order\r\n\r\nto  succeed,  the  prosecution has to prove its  case  beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable  doubt.  And this is already a high burden,  which\r\n\r\nis  placed  on  the prosecution.  Like I said just  now,  any\r\n\r\ntrial  is  to uncover the truth, not to trip anyone  up.   So\r\n\r\neven if the prosecution does tender the long statement of the\r\n\r\naccused during trial, it is not to trip the accused up.   But\r\n\r\nit  is  to  uncover the truth, that is, the prosecution  must\r\n\r\nimpeach   the  witness'  credibility  because  he  has   said\r\n\r\nsomething  which  does not match with the  statement  he  has\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the police.  I think it is beholden on the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  who  seeks the truth and justice to  tender  that\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current practice on the furnishing of police\r\n\r\nstatements  to the accused person is already a balanced  one.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is evolving over time.  For example, I understand\r\n\r\nthe  pre-trial  conferences  (PTC)  have  introduced  greater\r\n\r\nopenness to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprocess.  So during the PTC, the court will generally attempt\r\n\r\nto  identify  the disputed issues for trial  and  this  would\r\n\r\ninclude  the  disclosure  of the accused  statements  if  the\r\n\r\nprosecution indicates that it intends ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I seek clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this will include the\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of  the accused's statements if  the  prosecution\r\n\r\nindicates  that he intends to rely on those statements.   But\r\n\r\nof  course,  the  PTC judge cannot compel the prosecution  to\r\n\r\ndisclose  statements in its possession unless the defence  is\r\n\r\nable  to show the legal right to it.  So that process in fact\r\n\r\nhelps also to balance the picture between the prosecution and\r\n\r\nthe accused person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the courts are also developing\r\n\r\njurisprudence  in this area.  I am sure Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a\r\n\r\npractitioner,  must  know the case of  Ronnie  Tay  v  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  where  the  Chief Justice said,  in  allowing  an\r\n\r\naccused  person's  appeal, that an  accused  person's  police\r\n\r\nstatement,  even  if not used in the trial,  should  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  the  defence once all defence  witnesses  have\r\n\r\nfinished giving evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a criminal trial, the prosecution will make\r\n\r\navailable  certain documents to the accused.  These  are  the\r\n\r\ncharge, the initial police report concerning the offence, the\r\n\r\naccused person's cautioned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstatement  under  section  122(6) and  indeed,  even  medical\r\n\r\nreports,  and such other reports which the prosecution  would\r\n\r\nbe  seeking  to adduce under section 369(2) of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code.   All this includes scientific  reports  and\r\n\r\nother  reports.  These documents will give the accused person\r\n\r\na  clear  idea of the case which the prosecution has  against\r\n\r\nhim.   I  think  this is an important point because,  justice\r\n\r\ndictates  that a person who has to answer a charge must  know\r\n\r\nwhat  he is charged for.  Hence, these facts which are stated\r\n\r\nin  these  various reports will enable him  and  the  defence\r\n\r\ncounsel,  like  Mr Jeyaretnam, to prepare the defence.   They\r\n\r\nare sufficient for the accused to prepare his defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other statements or documents made by the accused\r\n\r\nthat the prosecution intends to make use of during the trial,\r\n\r\ncopies of these will be served on the defence.  That again is\r\n\r\nfair  because I understand that it is usually served  at  the\r\n\r\npre-trial  conference stage.  These are documents  which  the\r\n\r\nprosecution intends to make use of during the trial.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  talking about situations where, as I said just  now,  in\r\n\r\nthe course of the trial, the prosecution adduces evidence  by\r\n\r\nproducing  the accused's long statement.  That  is  different\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is a situation where the prosecution  did  not\r\n\r\nintend to make use of the statement during the trial.  But in\r\n\r\nthe  course of the trial, because of what the accused  person\r\n\r\nsaid,  which shows him up, that he is not telling the  truth,\r\n\r\nthe   prosecution,   in  order  to  impeach   the   accused's\r\n\r\ncredibility,  will then furnish the statement  in  court  and\r\n\r\nadduce it in evidence.  By having these other documents which\r\n\r\nare given to him, the accused person knows what evidence will\r\n\r\nbe adduced against him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that if the prosecution does not\r\n\r\nintend to make use of the long statements, yes, these are not\r\n\r\nfurnished to the accused.  This is to avoid the risks that  a\r\n\r\nguilty  person would be given the means to tailor his defence\r\n\r\nto deceive the court and to do it in a way that is consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the  statements  he made to the police,  thus  avoiding\r\n\r\ndetection.  The point which is important to note is that  the\r\n\r\nwithholding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  a  long statement would not adversely affect an  innocent\r\n\r\naccused  person  who consistently tells the  truth  at  every\r\n\r\nstage  of  the process.  In other words, if you are innocent,\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing to fear because you are telling the  truth.\r\n\r\nWhen police is investigating you, you will tell your account,\r\n\r\nyou  will tell the truth.  So when you are preparing for  the\r\n\r\ntrial with the defence lawyer, you will tell the truth.   And\r\n\r\nat   trial,  whether  under  examination-in-chief  or  cross-examination,  you  will  tell the truth.   But  if  a  guilty\r\n\r\naccused has sight of his long statement, in preparing for his\r\n\r\ndefence,  I am not saying the defence counsel will  go  along\r\n\r\nwith  that, the accused may decide to tailor his defence,  or\r\n\r\ntailor his story for the defence counsel --\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Defend the truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If that is the truth, then he\r\n\r\ndoes not need to look at what he has written because that  is\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  The truth cannot vary.  The truth is the  truth.\r\n\r\nSo  the  law  evolves.  If there is no risk  of  the  accused\r\n\r\ntailoring  his  defence according to the  statements  he  has\r\n\r\npreviously  given  to the police, and this  is  the  case  of\r\n\r\nRonnie  Tay,  then  the  High Court says  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nobjection to disclosing the police statements to the accused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is this. The interest of justice is\r\n\r\nserved  by ensuring that the truth emerges during the  trial,\r\n\r\nnot  by  enabling  a  guilty person to escape  punishment  by\r\n\r\nlooking  at  his long statement and having the  time  in  the\r\n\r\ncomfort  of his office, or elsewhere, to think of  a  defence\r\n\r\nthat is consistent with the long statement so that he has  an\r\n\r\nadvantage. So long as an accused person, as I have said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  tells  the truth at every stage to the police,  to  the\r\n\r\ncourts,  he has no need to fear about not being able  to  see\r\n\r\nhis own police statements before he gives evidence.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, it is \"guillotine\" time.

Banks have appointed their\r\n\r\nNominating  Committees, but nothing much  else  seems  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.   I would also like to take this opportunity to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  what  are  the benefits of having  fewer,  though\r\n\r\nlarger  local banks.  I would like to know why the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  can  only  support  two  local  banks.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  on  people's mind is which two, and why  only  two.\r\n\r\nWhy  not  three, why not more?  Is there a target time-frame?\r\n\r\nIs  the pace of change going at a rate that the Government is\r\n\r\nsatisfied with?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I wish to pose is that if there are\r\n\r\neventually  to  be  only  two local  banks,  would  there  be\r\n\r\nadequate  service and attention given to the small  companies\r\n\r\nand  the  small individuals. Large banks tend to  favour  and\r\n\r\nservice  large customers. Who is there to service  the  local\r\n\r\ncustomers and the small man-in-the street?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to pose on the banking system\r\n\r\nis that, with the advent of e-banking that is, banking on the\r\n\r\nInternet,  how would Government regulate this sector?   Would\r\n\r\nthe usual rules of MAS be applicable for banks, some of which\r\n\r\nmay  not  even  be  necessarily regulated  by  our  Singapore\r\n\r\nauthorities operating through the Internet?  Can such banking\r\n\r\npractices  and transactions be adequately controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities? How can e-banks be regulated so as  to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe integrity of our banking system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next cut on mergers and\r\n\r\nacquisitions (M&As).  In his Budget speech, the Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned that previously, if an M&A involves the transfer of\r\n\r\nless  than 90% of a company's shares, or if the consideration\r\n\r\nis  made  in cash, the exercise would not qualify  for  stamp\r\n\r\nduty  relief  under section 15 of the Stamp Duties  Act.   To\r\n\r\nencourage more M&As, the Minister has decided that these  two\r\n\r\nconditions  be lifted and the qualifying limit for  the  main\r\n\r\nholding company be reduced to 75%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to laud the Minister for initiating this\r\n\r\nmove  to encourage more M&As in Singapore.  However, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  suggest that the qualifying limit  can  be  lowered\r\n\r\nfurther to, say, even as low as 51%.  Here, I wish to declare\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  a  Director of a company and I  am  making  such\r\n\r\nsuggestions for the general public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many local companies, especially SMEs,\r\n\r\nwhere it would be extremely beneficial to encourage more M&As\r\n\r\namongst  these local companies.  This will enable the smaller\r\n\r\nSMEs to merge and create more bulk.  In the process, they can\r\n\r\nachieve better economies of scale, streamline operations, and\r\n\r\nattain  cost  savings. As companies merge,  it  would  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly difficult for the main acquiror company to  hold\r\n\r\n75%  or  more  of  the combined entity.  There  is  also  the\r\n\r\ndeterrent  that  the owners of the shares or  assets  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany  being  acquired may be subject  to  heavy  taxes  on\r\n\r\nprofits deemed to be realised.  In some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  these  cases, there are no actual cash transactions,  but\r\n\r\njust an exchange of shares.  Therefore, paying the tax on the\r\n\r\ngain will become a great deterrent to the entire transaction,\r\n\r\nespecially when there is no cash involved but only just paper\r\n\r\ngain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, since there is a very beneficial effect to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  M&As of local companies,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the Finance Minister that the local tax  regime,\r\n\r\nie,  the  Stamp  Duties  Act and the  financial  regulations,\r\n\r\nshould be reviewed to ensure that there will be more M&As  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, recently, there was anecdotal\r\n\r\nevidence  of  excessive consumer spending arising  from  easy\r\n\r\ncredit,  which  led  to bankruptcy for those  who  could  not\r\n\r\ncurtail their credit card spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the credit card has long been around, and the\r\n\r\ndangers of easy access to credit known to issuing banks,  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  electronic finance has added yet more convenience\r\n\r\nto   securing   consumer  credit  on  two  fronts.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nelectronic  retailing  or  e-tailing  through  the   Internet\r\n\r\nprovides   even   more   choices  for   the   consumer,   and\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly,  more  temptation  for  excessive  spending.\r\n\r\nEvery  transaction  is  only  a mouse-click  away.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nInternet  banking is likely to lead to an increase in  demand\r\n\r\nfor  consumer  credit on-line.

A  sub-index  of sales by small companies was minus 52%, as compared\r\n\r\nwith the plus 35% reported by larger firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members of this House have brought up the\r\n\r\ndifficulties faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  I\r\n\r\nwill not labour on these points except to say that Government\r\n\r\ngrants and tax incentives would not be of much use unless the\r\n\r\nSMEs can increase their business revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs have been told time and again that with the\r\n\r\nInternet,  the  whole world is their global marketplace,  and\r\n\r\nthey  can sell their products to customers in every  part  of\r\n\r\nthe world.  But, in practice, how does\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none  actually achieve that?  It is always difficult  to  draw\r\n\r\ninterested customers to visit your website.  A search  engine\r\n\r\nmay  throw  up  tens of thousands of related  websites.   And\r\n\r\nafter that, there is the question of follow-up and delivery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase their marketing reach and business revenue,\r\n\r\nSMEs  would probably do well to form alliances, either  among\r\n\r\nthemselves or with larger firms.  At first glance, one  would\r\n\r\nassume  that  Government-linked companies (GLCs) are  obvious\r\n\r\nalliance partners for our SMEs.  But, when I mentioned GLC as\r\n\r\na  likely  partner to some of the private sector companies  I\r\n\r\ncame  across,  I was perturbed by their reaction.   More  and\r\n\r\nmore, I received the retort, \"The GLCs will swallow you  up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  this  was said not only by local companies but  by  some\r\n\r\nforeign companies as well.  This is not healthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have statistical evidence to prove whether this\r\n\r\nis  warranted  or  not.  It is based on what  private  sector\r\n\r\nbusinessmen tell me, and on one particular example.   One  of\r\n\r\nmy grassroots leaders narrated to me his personal experience.\r\n\r\nHe  came across a new product in Italy that was superior  and\r\n\r\nwould  prove  to  be an advantage in bidding  for  a  certain\r\n\r\nGovernment  tender.   Being  a  small-time  businessman,   he\r\n\r\napproached a GLC to jointly pursue this Italian contact.   He\r\n\r\nthought  he  could  trust the GLC without signing  a  binding\r\n\r\njoint  venture contract or non-circumvention agreement.   Was\r\n\r\nhe   wrong?   When  he  brought  the  Italian  principals  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, the GLC partner ferried them away, bought them  an\r\n\r\nexpensive  dinner  and proposed to deal directly.   With  the\r\n\r\nGLC's  immaculate  credentials, it is no  surprise  that  the\r\n\r\nItalian  company was convinced to deal with the GLC directly,\r\n\r\nand the small guy was excluded from the arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I raised this with some prominent people, the\r\n\r\nresponse  was  that  the business world  is  a  dirty  shark-infested one, especially in doing business with some  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.  Our GLCs could not be  expected  to\r\n\r\nadopt one set of cut-throat business practices for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  regional  deals and another set of more  accommodative\r\n\r\nand friendlier practices in dealing with Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot agree with this. We must encourage our\r\n\r\nGLCs  to  adopt  a sense of business decorum,  especially  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with our own that will lead to a win-win  situation.\r\n\r\nWe  should create a more helpful coexistence between GLCs and\r\n\r\nsmaller players.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another private sector complaint about GLCs is that they\r\n\r\nare  deep  in  pockets  but shallow on  ideas.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nperception that if you propose a good business idea to  GLCs,\r\n\r\nthey  will  take  it and exploit it on their own  with  their\r\n\r\nstrong financial resources.  This is not healthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs around the world lament the lack of quality\r\n\r\nmanagement and human resources.  People with good  ideas  are\r\n\r\nventuring  out to set up their own.   I will be surprised  if\r\n\r\nour  GLCs  do  not  suffer the same  brain  drain.   In  this\r\n\r\nscenario,  the small guy will have the brilliant  ideas,  the\r\n\r\nknow-how and the expertise, but may not have the resources to\r\n\r\nexecute those ideas.  Therefore, it is in the interest of the\r\n\r\nbig players to work with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a mistake for big corporations to think that once\r\n\r\nan   idea  has  been  proposed  and  a  prototype  has   been\r\n\r\nconstructed, that the inventor who initiated those  ideas  is\r\n\r\nno  longer needed.  That person has valuable insights and  an\r\n\r\nin-depth  understanding of his invention.   Big  corporations\r\n\r\nmust  nurture the development of ideas both internally within\r\n\r\ntheir  own  organisations,  and externally, and benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese ideas by continuing a healthy relationship with the one\r\n\r\nwho came up with the idea in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at stake is not confined to that particular\r\n\r\ntransaction  alone.   It  is wider than  that.   It  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  for  our GLCs to improve their  image  as  a  good\r\n\r\nbusiness partner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are some companies more sought after than others as\r\n\r\nalliance partners?  For example, why do technology start-ups\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseek to get Softbank to invest in them?  I believe management\r\n\r\nvision,  corporate  culture  and business  decorum  are  very\r\n\r\nimportant  attributes.  It will be very sad  if  people  shun\r\n\r\nGLCs as an alliance partner for the lack of these qualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have numerous plans for the 21st century - Singapore 21, T21, Manpower 21. Perhaps it is timely to come\r\n\r\nup  with  a GLC 21 to spell out the role and desired outcomes\r\n\r\nof our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our Government-linked companies were\r\n\r\nformed   in  the  1960s  and  1970s  to  spearhead   business\r\n\r\nundertakings in spheres where business investments were large\r\n\r\nor  where ordinary businessmen would not dare to venture  due\r\n\r\nto  many reasons, and also certain industries were set up for\r\n\r\nsecurity purposes.  But in the 1980s and 1990s, some of these\r\n\r\nGLCs  had decided that, in order to boost their profit level,\r\n\r\nthey  should go into businesses which are actually the domain\r\n\r\nof  the  small and medium size industries.  Some of our  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  gone  into  business  like  freight  forwarding,  small\r\n\r\nproperty  development,  even  when  it  is  not  their   core\r\n\r\nbusinesses, and even own croissant businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is something that we should avoid, and it is\r\n\r\nperhaps  timely, and I endorse the call made  by  my  learned\r\n\r\nfriend,  Mr  Ong  Kian  Min, that we should  re-examine  what\r\n\r\nexactly should be the role of our GLCs.  Perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\nhas to establish a committee to identify what is the new role\r\n\r\nof  GLCs  in  the 21st century.  I think they  should  become\r\n\r\ntrail-blazers in the new economy.  They should go on into new\r\n\r\nbusinesses and bring Singapore's economy into new areas where\r\n\r\nthey  become  leaders,  and also show example  to  the  other\r\n\r\ncompanies which are local as to where the opportunities  lie.\r\n\r\nThey should become global players, play among the whales, and\r\n\r\nnot play in our backyard ponds where smaller fish exist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I hope that the Minister will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  GLCs do not compete with local businesses  and  go\r\n\r\ndownstream.  There are many players locally and  try  not  to\r\n\r\ntake over their business but encourage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem  to venture abroad or venture into new businesses  where\r\n\r\nthere is no competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have spoken about\r\n\r\nour tax system during the Budget debate in the last few days.\r\n\r\nAs  I  mentioned in my speech on Monday, I feel that  we  can\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  differentiated tax system for different  economic\r\n\r\nactivities and go away from a \"one size fits all\" tax system.\r\n\r\nI  will talk a bit about this later on when I talk on tax for\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things about our tax\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  this  will  encourage  more  start-ups  and  to\r\n\r\naccelerate  the  regionalisation drive.  We should  therefore\r\n\r\nreview  some of our tax practices to create a more  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment for this to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, group offsetting of local and overseas\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries.   I  know that this has been  brought  up  many\r\n\r\ntimes.   I will not describe the details of how it should  be\r\n\r\ndone.   My  colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, also  talked  about\r\n\r\nthis during the debate earlier this week.  I suggest that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  worry too much about the tax leakage that may  occur\r\n\r\nbecause I believe that only a small proportion of individuals\r\n\r\nor  companies will have the intention to do so.  Most of  the\r\n\r\nother  companies will do it for the true and legal  purposes.\r\n\r\nThe resultant benefit for businesses will be tremendous.   So\r\n\r\nwe  should not punish the majority to avoid the bad practices\r\n\r\nof a small minority of companies that may go about doing this\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cross-year offsetting of losses should be allowed\r\n\r\nfor  companies  including start-ups.  This  will  lessen  the\r\n\r\nburden  on  investors and shareholders and  we  should  allow\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility on how this can happen.  I believe  many\r\n\r\nbusinesses  still  do  not  understand  and  do   not   fully\r\n\r\ncomprehend the current requirements that allow some amount of\r\n\r\noffsetting of cross-year losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that we introduce negative\r\n\r\ngearing for individuals.  For example, investment in property\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould be allowed to be negatively geared for individuals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I believe this is currently practised  in  a  few\r\n\r\ncountries, including Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also provide incentive for SMEs to merge by\r\n\r\nallowing the offsetting of losses and by removing restrictive\r\n\r\nlegislation   like   ownership  requirements   set   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I believe Mr Leong talked about this earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area that has also been talked about in\r\n\r\nthe last few days is the taxation of e-commerce transactions,\r\n\r\nas part of our overall tax system.  We need to clarify how we\r\n\r\nare  going to participate in this e-commerce arena.  We  need\r\n\r\nto put in place a tax system that is well integrated with the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  world  and, at the same time,  facilitate  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of this sector of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, while we worry about becoming a tax haven\r\n\r\nif  we lower corporate taxes to below 25%, can we avoid  this\r\n\r\nbeing labelled as a tax haven by highlighting the other  many\r\n\r\ntaxes  that we pay?  For example, we have GST, property  tax,\r\n\r\nfuel  tax, utilities tax, ERP, COE and so on.  And I am  sure\r\n\r\nif we add all these taxes, our total tax is greater than 25%.\r\n\r\nSo if we can highlight all these taxes, then we can lower our\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  to  below  25%, and we  can  avoid  labelling\r\n\r\nourselves as a tax haven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I hope that we will be prepared to put in\r\n\r\nplace   a   differentiated  tax  system  to   allow   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility and to encourage certain economic activities that\r\n\r\nwill be beneficial to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I agree with what Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh  has just proposed on the need to do a complete  review\r\n\r\nof  the  tax  system and, in particular, to look at  specific\r\n\r\ntarget  areas  that can be changed.  I have  spoken  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject  of  group  offsetting of  taxes  during  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.   In  response to this suggestion of  allowing  group\r\n\r\noffsetting  of  taxes  made by several of  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues here, the Finance Minister has given his views  in\r\n\r\nhis response at the end\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  yesterday's  Budget debate.  However,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  plug  at this issue which  I  feel  is  a  very\r\n\r\nworthwhile cause and, hopefully, in the process can crack the\r\n\r\nnut  with the Finance Minister.  Raising this issue here will\r\n\r\nalso give him a chance to explain to us in more detail, if he\r\n\r\ndoes not agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to repeat my suggestion, which is that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should have taken the line that  although  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want  to allow group offsetting  of  taxes  for  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  reasons, we should not look  at  it  on  blanket\r\n\r\nbasis, but more on a specific case by case basis.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI wish to repeat that for specific cases, such as for sectors\r\n\r\nwhere the Government wishes to promote more investments to be\r\n\r\nmade,  say, in the area of infotechnology and other high-tech\r\n\r\nareas, the Government could actually consider allowing losses\r\n\r\nof  such  new  ventures to be offset against the  profits  in\r\n\r\nother   parts  of  the  principal  business  of  a   company.\r\n\r\nCompanies  will  therefore be more ready  to  invest  in  new\r\n\r\nventures  and in high-tech areas.  In the process,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill gain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on taxation of e-commerce. Internet\r\n\r\ncompanies  operate  in a virtual world  where  there  are  no\r\n\r\nsovereign  boundaries.  Hence, these Internet companies  have\r\n\r\ncustomers  located anywhere in the world, and  the  companies\r\n\r\nthemselves  may  not  be registered or  based  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  their  operations and products may be  targeted  at\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  or  can  reach  customers  in  Singapore.    My\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  how  could the Singapore  Government,  or  any\r\n\r\ngovernment for that matter regulate and control these virtual\r\n\r\ncompanies on the Internet?  In particular, if these companies\r\n\r\nturn  out to be very profitable, how do we measure the amount\r\n\r\nof profits that they derive from doing business in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand therefore the Singapore Government can be eligible to tax\r\n\r\nsuch companies?\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, to promote more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nventuring  into  new  start-ups, especially  into  e-commerce\r\n\r\nstart-ups,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister whether he could  consider\r\n\r\nincentives  to  encourage  these  start-up  companies  to  be\r\n\r\nformed.   For example, in the early years of their formation,\r\n\r\ncan  the Government give them preferential tax status or more\r\n\r\nR&D  grants  so that they can quickly complete their  product\r\n\r\ndevelopment and commercialise their products?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, more could have been done to\r\n\r\nencourage  and accelerate our technopreneurship drive  during\r\n\r\nthis year's budget.  Nonetheless, I hope more will be done as\r\n\r\nwe progress to the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage entrepreneurs, they should be given more\r\n\r\nincentives to own a larger portion of the company  that  they\r\n\r\nstarted   up  without  having  to  worry  about   tax.    The\r\n\r\nentrepreneur who brings in $1 million worth of ideas  and  an\r\n\r\ninvestor who brings in similarly $1 million worth of money to\r\n\r\nthe   business  are  currently  in  our  tax  system  treated\r\n\r\ndifferently.  The investor will not pay for capital gains tax\r\n\r\nwhile  the entrepreneur who brought the idea but has a  share\r\n\r\nin  the company has to pay the full tax for the capital gains\r\n\r\nthat  he  may have got as a result of the gain in  the  share\r\n\r\nvalue.   I  would like to suggest that as part of the  review\r\n\r\nand  part  of the announcement that is going to come  in  May\r\n\r\nthis  year regarding employee stock options, we should review\r\n\r\nthe taxation of stock options into three categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category of stocks is typically for those new\r\n\r\nstart-up  companies  where  technopreneurs  are   given  free\r\n\r\nshares  in  lieu of their expertise and experience that  they\r\n\r\nbrought to the table.  Such entrepreneurs should not be taxed\r\n\r\nfor  these shares at all.  In the beginning, the value of the\r\n\r\nshares  cannot be clearly determined because if  the  company\r\n\r\ncollapses, then the shares are worth nothing at all.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe  technopreneur  is able to make it  a  success,  he  will\r\n\r\ngenerate  wealth  for  the company and for  the  country  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  more  jobs  would be created  and  he  would  have\r\n\r\ncontributed tremendously to the economy.  For these  benefits\r\n\r\nthat  they bring to the company and to the country,  the  tax\r\n\r\nthe Government charges on him,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  tax loss as a result of the implementation of no-tax  on\r\n\r\nthe  employee options on these shares, would be all worth  it\r\n\r\nfor the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of shares is the stock options given\r\n\r\nto founder-employees.  If these are given to the employees in\r\n\r\nthe  first six months of a new start-up, then I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthese  too  should be tax exempt or minimally taxed  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  reasons I gave earlier.  These are quite different from\r\n\r\nthe free shares that are given at the start of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of stock options is given by\r\n\r\nsuccessful  or  listed  companies and these  can  be  treated\r\n\r\ndifferently from start-ups, but I still feel that they should\r\n\r\nbe  treated  differently from income tax as  they  are  being\r\n\r\ntreated currently.  The reason for this is that  in the  case\r\n\r\nof  income, there is a certainty of income for the  employee,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the  case  of a given stock option,  there  is  some\r\n\r\nelement  of uncertainty because if the stock value  does  not\r\n\r\nappreciate,  then the employee does not gain very  much  from\r\n\r\nit.   For  this  difference, I believe  they  should  not  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the normal tax system.  This is one example of how\r\n\r\na differentiated tax system can work in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest that we should\r\n\r\nencourage  angel  investors  by allowing  them  to  write-off\r\n\r\nlosses from their income tax when companies they invested  in\r\n\r\nfail.   I believe that the current practice allows for write-offs  of losses when shares are sold at a lower price.   This\r\n\r\nis  not  attractive enough because when a company  collapses,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no opportunity to sell the shares.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nshares are then worth nothing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to suggest that entrepreneurs be\r\n\r\nallowed  to carry forward the losses in their investments  in\r\n\r\ntheir future income tax computations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and these are for companies that are required\r\n\r\nto raise capital for capital intensive type of companies,   I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest that pre-production expenses should  be\r\n\r\ntax  deductible because a lot of preparation  is  needed  for\r\n\r\nsuch high-tech\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies before they can go into production. For the capital\r\n\r\nintensive  companies,  you  cannot  wait  for  the  time   of\r\n\r\nproduction to collect the money from your investors.  All  of\r\n\r\nthe  equity is raised very much earlier so that you are ready\r\n\r\nto  invest once you are ready to run production. The  current\r\n\r\npractice  discourages  the early raising  of  equity  capital\r\n\r\nbecause  the  interest earned for the capital that  you  have\r\n\r\nraised and has not been expanded on, the capital that is kept\r\n\r\nin  the  bank, is taxed even if a company were to  have  made\r\n\r\nhuge losses in the whole process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like to suggest that we grant pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus  type incentives for individuals and local  start-ups.\r\n\r\nJust  as  we  value  foreign investment capital  by  granting\r\n\r\ncompanies  pioneer  status in the past, we  should  similarly\r\n\r\nvalue  the  intellectual capital brought by these people  and\r\n\r\nthe local companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am encouraged that the Minister has said that he\r\n\r\nwould  be  looking out for suggestions on how we can  further\r\n\r\nimprove  the  system.

The recent\r\n\r\nconcession  to allow tax deferral for up to five years,  upon\r\n\r\nassumption of the stock options, is indeed laudable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus instead on the tax treatment\r\n\r\nfor companies issuing such options.  Increasingly, especially\r\n\r\nwith  hi-tech  start-ups, ESOPs will figure significantly  as\r\n\r\npart  of  staff  compensation.  Actual cash components  would\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly   reduce  in  proportion.

Currently, this involves giving up  a\r\n\r\nsource of income.

At present, widows  with\r\n\r\nyoung dependent children enjoy the relief but they lose  this\r\n\r\nright  if  their  children are grown up.   If  their  married\r\n\r\nsisters  continue  to  enjoy this  privilege  with  grown  up\r\n\r\nchildren, they wonder why they are treated differently.  Like\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworking  married  sisters, they  have  a  home.   Like  their\r\n\r\nmarried  sisters, they have to work outside  their  homes  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  this  relief.   If the relief  is  meant  to  be  pro-marriage,  they have also fulfilled this role.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nnegated  by  the death of their husbands.  If the requirement\r\n\r\nis  that the claimant should work by choice, as married women\r\n\r\nare  deemed to do so, as they have their husbands to maintain\r\n\r\nthem, and the relief is to entice them back to the workforce,\r\n\r\nthen  it  follows  that  a married woman  who  works  out  of\r\n\r\nnecessity   should be disqualified and widows  who  have  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to  maintain themselves without having  to  work,  but\r\n\r\nchose  to  work, should qualify.  Surely, this  cannot  be  a\r\n\r\ncondition.  Although  children  have  been  advanced  as  the\r\n\r\nrationale  for  this relief, this does not  appear  to  be  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  condition. According to the notes  that  accompany\r\n\r\nthe  income tax return form, as long as the woman is  married\r\n\r\nto her husband and opts to be taxed separately, she can claim\r\n\r\nthe  relief  whether she has children or  not.   However,  if\r\n\r\nhaving a husband is a necessary condition to enjoy the relief\r\n\r\nwithout dependent children, then I suppose a widow will  just\r\n\r\nhave to find and marry a new husband to enjoy it. This, I  am\r\n\r\nsure, is not one of the  purposes of the relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, if the relief is intended to be pro-marriage, and to encourage our womenfolk to be economically\r\n\r\nactive,  then  I  urge the Minister to give to  both  married\r\n\r\nwomen  and  widows  equal access to  the  foreign  maid  levy\r\n\r\nrelief.   A  widow who depends on one income  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nfamily has as much, if not, more need for the relief.  If the\r\n\r\nMinister does not think that widows should enjoy the  relief,\r\n\r\nI wonder if the Minister could in his reply afterwards, or at\r\n\r\nsome future opportunity, enlighten the House as to the number\r\n\r\nof  widows not allowed access to the relief and the potential\r\n\r\nloss  of relief to the Government if these widows were  given\r\n\r\nthe relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I am trying to cut short my\r\n\r\nspeeches, as you have requested us earlier.  Sir, the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  currently allows any individual  to  claim  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall personal relief as his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  tax  relief  when  he  attends  certain  professional\r\n\r\ncourses.  This relief is to allow an individual to deduct  up\r\n\r\nto   $2,500  of  course  fees  for  courses  leading   to   a\r\n\r\nprofessional   or   academic  qualification   or   vocational\r\n\r\nqualification relating to a person's existing trade, business\r\n\r\nor  employment.  I would like to propose that this relief  be\r\n\r\nincreased  perhaps to $5,000.  The reason  is  that  nowadays\r\n\r\ncourse fees are very high.  Professional or vocational course\r\n\r\nfees  can  cost  $10,000 or more.  Hence, to  encourage  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  improve themselves,  a  higher  course  fee\r\n\r\nrelief  will  encourage  them  to  enroll  into  more   self-improvement education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would also like to propose that these\r\n\r\ncourse  fees be extended to not just professional or academic\r\n\r\nqualifications  or  for  other  self-improvement  educational\r\n\r\ncourses.   Such self-improvement courses will not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  related  to a person's trade or vocation.   For  example,\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  many people who want to attend a  new  skills\r\n\r\ncourse  or new vocation course so as to get a new  job  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  trade.   Also, there may be  people  who  want  to\r\n\r\nattend  IT   or computer training courses but they themselves\r\n\r\nare not necessarily IT professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed relaxation of course fee relief benefit\r\n\r\nwould  be  useful  to ensure that more and more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nattend retraining or self-training programmes of all kinds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as I have proposed in my speech during the\r\n\r\nBudget debate, I would like to propose that a grant be  given\r\n\r\nto  local  grassroots organisations, such  as  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees (CCCs), so that they can also conduct\r\n\r\nmore self-improvement or IT training courses at the community\r\n\r\nclubs at subsidised rates.  This will be beneficial to a pool\r\n\r\nof  lower income or senior citizens who wish to be trained or\r\n\r\nwho want to receive more self-education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to propose, as I have said in\r\n\r\nmy  Budget speech, that a grant or income tax relief be given\r\n\r\nto   individuals  to  purchase  PCs.   This  proposal   would\r\n\r\nencourage   more  and  more  Singaporeans   to   embrace   IT\r\n\r\ntechnology.  As\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  result,  this  will  speedily  create  an  environment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore where an increasingly large percentage of our adult\r\n\r\npopulation  would understand and appreciate the  fast  moving\r\n\r\nInternet and e-commerce society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my second cut, I would like to join my colleagues in\r\n\r\nspeaking on the employee stock option scheme.  Here, like  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  more  enhanced\r\n\r\nbenefits  for employee stock option schemes.  Many companies,\r\n\r\nespecially new start-up companies,  do not have the funds  to\r\n\r\nemploy  and  attract key employees who are important  to  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Therefore, they use ESOPs as a main carrot.  So I\r\n\r\nwould propose that the Government consider allowing such ESOP\r\n\r\nschemes   to  be given to high-tech companies to be  declared\r\n\r\ntax  free,  say,  in the first five years when they  exercise\r\n\r\nsuch  options. Currently, when they exercise such options  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  five years they are deemed liable to  pay  income\r\n\r\ntax.   For such companies, perhaps to attract them and  as  a\r\n\r\nform  of  encouragement, maybe it will be useful to  consider\r\n\r\ntax free status for the first five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I move this\r\n\r\namendment  to highlight some of the problems associated  with\r\n\r\nestate  duties.  Many Singaporeans have built  up  assets  in\r\n\r\nterms of housing, CPF savings and fixed deposits, stocks  and\r\n\r\nshares, unit trusts, etc.  Many will die with some assets for\r\n\r\nthe  family, and some will have to pay estate duties.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot  asking for the removal of estate duties.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nestate  duties imposed are not onerous.  But the  process  of\r\n\r\nthe  IRAS' assessements is lengthy and causes hardship to the\r\n\r\ndeceased  family.   At  my meet-the-people-sessions,  I  have\r\n\r\ncomplaints   relating  to  this.   All  assets   are   frozen\r\n\r\nimmediately  at  the  time  of  death,  especially  when  the\r\n\r\ndeceased  is  the  main  sole breadwinner,  and  this  causes\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardship.  Adding to the distress, the family  has\r\n\r\nto  pay  up  in  advance an estimated amount of  tax  and  an\r\n\r\ninterest charge is imposed if the amount is unpaid, all  this\r\n\r\nat a time when they have no access to the estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nObtaining valuations of assets to submit to IRAS is difficult\r\n\r\nand  lengthy.  Much work has to be done to obtain  valuations\r\n\r\non  properties, cars, unit trusts, contents of  safe  deposit\r\n\r\nboxes,  etc.   IRAS also requires information on transactions\r\n\r\nin  bank accounts for the past several years, I think  up  to\r\n\r\nfive  years.  It is not possible and impractical  for  family\r\n\r\nmembers  to trace transaction details of the deceased  unless\r\n\r\nhe  had  kept  an  impeccable record.  The  frustrations  are\r\n\r\nimmense, especially if the family members are not well versed\r\n\r\nin managing financial matters.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets are frozen until IRAS is satisfied with the\r\n\r\nassessment  and  this can take a long time.  Nowadays,  stock\r\n\r\nmarkets  are  volatile and to a certain extent  the  property\r\n\r\ncycle.  Perhaps IRAS can consider allowing assets to be  sold\r\n\r\nfirst   and  held  in  a  trust  account.   This   will   let\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries take advantage of any upturn in prices  or  get\r\n\r\nout of a falling market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual for estate assessment to take one to\r\n\r\ntwo  years  to settle.  Beneficiaries should not be penalised\r\n\r\nunnecessarily because of the lengthy process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement  Scheme (SRS) will be implemented  by  next  year.\r\n\r\nThe  Finance  Minister  has indicated  that  views  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector would be sought on the implementation aspects.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  the Government to carry out extensive  public\r\n\r\nconsultation  among the people sector, especially  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  so  that the SRS, when implemented, will  gain  wide\r\n\r\nsupport from the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that workers of all ages are encouraged\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to  it.   Thus,  before  implementation,  the\r\n\r\nconcern and misconception, if any, among the workers must  be\r\n\r\naddressed.  To save for old age from young, is in  line  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  21's recommendations that each of us  should  take\r\n\r\nindividual  responsibility.  Thus, the concept of the  scheme\r\n\r\nneeds to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexplained clearly to the ordinary Singaporeans.  It should be\r\n\r\nan easy to join, easy to quit scheme so that ordinary workers\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  confidence in it.  One  of  the  worries  is\r\n\r\nwhether the scheme is designed in such a way that it is  very\r\n\r\neasy to go in but very cumbersome to come out, as the Hokkein\r\n\r\nsays, \"a jip, buay tzu\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SRS, Singaporeans will be contributing to private\r\n\r\nfunds.   It  is  a  fact  that  in  terms  of  packaging  and\r\n\r\nmarketing,  the  private  sector is more  creative  than  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector.  However, in terms of confidence, as  far  as\r\n\r\nmoney is concerned, Singaporeans trust the public sector, the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  more than the private sector.  Thus,  sufficient\r\n\r\nsafeguards  against  any  form  of  default  to  protect  the\r\n\r\npeople's  hard earned savings must be in place.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can bear in mind this point when formulating  the\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Labour Force Survey 1999, the\r\n\r\neconomically active female accounts for 50.1% of  the  female\r\n\r\npopulation.    These  include  those  who  are   working   or\r\n\r\nunemployed  but  looking for a job.  And those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nworking  and  not  looking for a job accounts  for  49.9%  or\r\n\r\n463,000.   So  many  of  this  group  of  women  are  married\r\n\r\nhousewives, the homemakers.  Thus, I hope the Government will\r\n\r\nencourage husbands to contribute for their wives who are  not\r\n\r\nworking,  but  looking after the home.  As  homemakers,  they\r\n\r\nhave  no  CPF savings or little savings.  It is thus  logical\r\n\r\nthat  husbands should be encouraged to contribute to SRS  for\r\n\r\nthe  wife.  In this respect, a fixed sum of money contributed\r\n\r\nby  the husband for this purpose can be tax-free or it should\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  lower  tax  rate.   This  is  to  acknowledge   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  the homemakers who have  in  no  small  way\r\n\r\nhelped  their  husbands.  It is also to  solve  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture  problems of married women who have been  playing  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  homemakers but are divorced, widowed and  have  not\r\n\r\nenough savings for their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are encouraging workers to save from young,\r\n\r\nit   is   also  proposed  that  the  scheme  be  renamed   as\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Saving  Scheme (SSS)  rather  than  retirement\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Yesterday, Mr Kenneth Chen talked\r\n\r\nabout  allowing new start-ups, especially dot.com  companies,\r\n\r\nto list on our stock exchanges, and he felt that there was  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  the  Government to point out  the  risks  of  high\r\n\r\ntech/IT   industries  before  Singaporeans  invest  in   such\r\n\r\ncompanies.  He also highlighted how the public will blame the\r\n\r\nGovernment in case they make losses when such companies fail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to tighten the entry requirements\r\n\r\nfor such companies to be listed nor for the Government to  go\r\n\r\nto the public with a warning each time a new company lists on\r\n\r\nthe  stock  exchange.   I do believe, however,  that  we  can\r\n\r\nachieve  the  dual  objectives  of  allowing  easier  capital\r\n\r\nraising  by entrepreneurs and start-up companies and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  the  public will have an automatic  signal  that\r\n\r\ninvestments in such start-ups could be risky, but could  also\r\n\r\nyield very high returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current practice of allowing such company to\r\n\r\nlist  on  the main board and on Sesdaq is a good first  step,\r\n\r\nbut the issues are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we still have a number of stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements that are still not easy to meet for many  viable\r\n\r\ncompanies, because we are allowing companies of all types  to\r\n\r\nlist on the two boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this has created confusion among investors,\r\n\r\nespecially among retail investors in Singapore, who  are  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether  such companies are the high risk/return  type,\r\n\r\nbecause  listed on these stock exchanges are both traditional\r\n\r\nindustries  measured by traditional measures as well  as  the\r\n\r\nhigh  risk  start-ups which may yield higher  returns  should\r\n\r\nthey be successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that we need to implement a new board\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  for  emerging  technologies  and  for   young\r\n\r\ncompanies who may have good potential but do carry  a  higher\r\n\r\nrisk  which allow easier capital raising and at the same time\r\n\r\nallow  investors to make a conscious decision that  they  are\r\n\r\ninvesting in risky businesses.  This will resolve the dilemma\r\n\r\nthat we are facing as a result of the current\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractice.  So whenever a company is listed on this new  risky\r\n\r\nexchange, the investors will know that the potential  returns\r\n\r\ncould  be  high, at the same time they will make  losses  and\r\n\r\nthey cannot blame the Government for not pointing things  out\r\n\r\nto them very early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a global board, having a different set of\r\n\r\nentry  criteria.   I hope that it could be Internet  tradable\r\n\r\nand trading in world currencies, 24 hours around the day,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can have participation in capital raising from around\r\n\r\nthe world.

I have  touched  on\r\n\r\nthis  briefly  in my adjournment motion at the last  sitting.\r\n\r\nIf I run the risk of incurring your ire for repeating myself,\r\n\r\nI   believe   I   am   in   good  company   this   afternoon.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, where possible, most companies would  want  to\r\n\r\nbe listed on the main board.  It is a sign of recognition,  a\r\n\r\nsign  of success.  Of course, there are also tangible results\r\n\r\nsuch  as  better market recognition, getting a P/E ratio  and\r\n\r\nmany  companies are indeed, therefore, reluctant to be listed\r\n\r\non  the secondary board.  However, with the advent of the new\r\n\r\neconomy, the situation is different today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the stock exchange in US - the New York\r\n\r\nStock Exchange and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNasdaq.   While the New York Stock Exchange has been dropping\r\n\r\nacross the board, in the recent days Nasdaq has been breaking\r\n\r\nnew  record, heading for higher grounds, despite the repeated\r\n\r\nhint  of interest rate hike proposed by the Federal Reserves.\r\n\r\nThis  reflects the enthusiasm of the investors for  companies\r\n\r\nin  the  new  economy, because they are looking for  multiple\r\n\r\ntime increase in capital gains.  The decline in the Dow Jones\r\n\r\nand  the increase in Nasdaq indexes simply reflect the  trend\r\n\r\nthat many fund managers have been transferring funds from the\r\n\r\nold  economy to the new economy.  In fact, today,  Nasdaq  is\r\n\r\nthe market where a company preferring to be listed would like\r\n\r\nto be, that is, to ride the wave of the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I think the link between listing on the\r\n\r\nmain  board  and the ability to raise money has been  broken.\r\n\r\nYet,  I  think it is still useful to maintain the segregation\r\n\r\nof   the   established  companies  and  emerging   companies.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would like the Minister to reconsider  how  we\r\n\r\nallow companies to be listed on our two exchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\nlast  year's Budget debate, I raised the question of CLOB  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.   I pointed out that the Government  should  not\r\n\r\nshirk  its responsibility.  I also wanted to know what action\r\n\r\nthe   self-claimed  capable,  farsighted  and  efficient  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  take  to  protect  the  interest  of  CLOB\r\n\r\ninvestors.  Unfortunately, a year has passed, yet all we have\r\n\r\nare only two schemes recommended by SGX and KLSE. In my view,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  selling out the  interest  of  the  CLOB\r\n\r\ninvestors through these two schemes in an attempt to  resolve\r\n\r\nthis knotty problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme by Effective Capital proposes to\r\n\r\ncommence the slow release of shares from July this year.  But\r\n\r\nit  would take as long as 13 months for all the shares to  be\r\n\r\nreleased.   On top of that, the investors will have to pay an\r\n\r\nadministrative fee equivalent to 1.5% of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclosing  prices of the shares as at the 15th of  this  month.\r\n\r\nTo  me, this kind of administrative fee is no different  from\r\n\r\nthe    \"protection  money\" demanded by  the  gangsters.   The\r\n\r\nagreement  between SGX and SCANS of KLSE on  share  migration\r\n\r\ncannot  be  enforced.  Migration of shares  has  to  be  done\r\n\r\nthrough   a   private  company,  and  then   they   slap   an\r\n\r\nadministrative fee on the investors.  This is indeed daylight\r\n\r\nrobbery!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are areas of concern in this scheme. First, how\r\n\r\ndo  SGX  and  KLSE  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  Effective\r\n\r\nCapital?  What happens, if after taking over the CLOB  shares\r\n\r\nand  collecting the so-called administrative fee, the company\r\n\r\ncollapses  and  goes  out of business within  13  months  and\r\n\r\nbefore  the  shares are fully released?  Who is going  to  be\r\n\r\nliable?    Can  SGX  and  KLSE provide  a  guarantee  to  the\r\n\r\ninvestors  against the risk?  Secondly, apart from  the  1.5%\r\n\r\nprotection  money,  can  the investors  be  assured  of  real\r\n\r\nprotection?   Will  the  KLSE  suddenly  introduce  some  new\r\n\r\nregulations and seek to collect some more money under certain\r\n\r\npretext?   Thirdly,  how are shares to be released,  on  what\r\n\r\ncriteria and what principle?   What amount of shares will  be\r\n\r\nreleased each time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with the second scheme. For this,\r\n\r\nyou  would have to wait until January 2003 for the shares  to\r\n\r\nbe  released,  and it will take a period of nine  months.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is a big joke.  The CLOB market was  closed  for\r\n\r\ntrading  in 1998.  It would mean a long five years since  the\r\n\r\nclosure.   Yet, the SGX finds it fit to accept this  kind  of\r\n\r\nscheme. Furthermore, how would SGX and KLSE ensure that there\r\n\r\nwould be no more change of mind?  As the Chinese saying goes,\r\n\r\n\"yechang  mengduo\", (a long night is fraught with nightmares)\r\n\r\nmeaning, \"a long delay means many hitches\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether these schemes are the only\r\n\r\nthings  the Government could do for the CLOB investors.   Are\r\n\r\nthey  the  best and most favourable schemes?  When  answering\r\n\r\nquestions  on the CLOB issues, the Government has  reiterated\r\n\r\nthat the CLOB investors have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir legal rights, and the Government can take the matter up\r\n\r\nto the WTO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd January 1999, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong said in Parliament, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Government has taken advice on possible\r\n\r\nproceedings  at  the  World  Trade  Organisation  forum  from\r\n\r\nleading  legal  counsel that specialises in WTO  issues.  The\r\n\r\ncounsel  has  advised that the `CLOB' issue is  within  WTO's\r\n\r\njurisdiction  and  Singapore has valid  grounds  for  seeking\r\n\r\nredress at WTO on the matter.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But right now we have not seen Government taking any\r\n\r\neffective  action to protect the interests of CLOB investors.\r\n\r\nThen, SGX suddenly agreed to this proposed scheme.   What  on\r\n\r\nearth is the Government doing?  You say one thing, and you do\r\n\r\nanother  thing.  Perhaps the Government rather \"kow-tow\"   to\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian side and sacrifice the interest  of  the  CLOB\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should not forget that in 1989 when the\r\n\r\nCLOB  market  was  set  up, it was  to  offset  the  pressure\r\n\r\nresulting  from  the  separation of  the  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian stock exchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th November 1989, the Minister for Finance, in\r\n\r\nanswering  questions  on the separation  of  stock  exchanges\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaysia, pointed out, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the moment, there are 182 Malaysian companies out of\r\n\r\nthe 329 companies listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.  In\r\n\r\nthe  short  term, the immediate impact of the  de-listing  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian  stocks from the SES is likely to be a  decline  in\r\n\r\nthe turnover of the SES.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Plans are being finalised to trade Hong Kong, Thai and\r\n\r\nAustralian stocks in the over-the-counter (OTC) market to the\r\n\r\nSES electronic trading or CLOB system.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our investors jumped into the crocodile pit and the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Stock Exchange of Singapore earned a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncommissions  and the financial service sector grew  steadily.\r\n\r\nBoth the Exchange and the Government benefited.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Malaysia has crushed the crocodile pit into an abyss\r\n\r\nand  the  Government just sits on the fence  and  allows  the\r\n\r\ncapital  of the investors to fall into a bottomless  pit.  It\r\n\r\neven acquiesces in these two schemes which are definitely not\r\n\r\nin the interest of the investors.  My conclusion here is that\r\n\r\nthe PAP Government really has no conscience.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> At the recent sitting of\r\n\r\nParliament,  my  colleague,  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen,  moved   an\r\n\r\nadjournment motion wherein he was concerned that  the  bubble\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  Internet fever may result in  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ninvestors  getting  seriously  hurt  if  the  market   should\r\n\r\nnosedive  with a serious correction.  Our DPM Lee replied  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  not all dot.com companies would be  successful.\r\n\r\nIn the market which is run by a regulatory philosophy that is\r\n\r\nbased  on  disclosure rather than merit, what is  obvious  is\r\n\r\nthat the responsibility for the choice of share purchase must\r\n\r\nsurely rest with the investor.  Our DPM advised that when one\r\n\r\ninvests in the market, one has to do it prudently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what concerns me is the extent to which the public\r\n\r\nhas  been so overwhelmed by the excitement over investing  in\r\n\r\ndot.com companies that they have almost thrown caution to the\r\n\r\nwind.   Right now, in Hong Kong, the dot.com fever has  moved\r\n\r\nto  frenzy.  Following the successful launch of Tom.com, Hong\r\n\r\nKongers  are  now caught on by the Internet fever.   At  this\r\n\r\nmoment, investors in Hong Kong are hoping to be able to  make\r\n\r\na punt on IT shares in the hope that, when allotted, they can\r\n\r\nsell  these shares for a handsome gain.  Never mind if  these\r\n\r\ninvestors have not read the prospectus.  Never mind if  there\r\n\r\nare  enough disclosures of risk factors to scare any  prudent\r\n\r\ninvestors away from the offer.  As long as there is money  to\r\n\r\nbe  made,  the  investors would be there no matter  what  the\r\n\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth is that there are concerns over the\r\n\r\npresent  euphoria in the Internet stocks.  Many will  concede\r\n\r\nthat the Internet stocks today are over-valued.  One\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmagazine reported that nearly three quarters of the Internet-related  initial public offerings in America  since  mid-1995\r\n\r\nnow  trade below the issued price.  We know that the cardinal\r\n\r\nprinciple  in any investment is caveat emptor.  However,  the\r\n\r\nquestion   which  we  must  ask  ourselves  is  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  duty  is  merely  to  provide  a  broad  market\r\n\r\nframework  and  to leave investors to make their  own  better\r\n\r\njudgement.   At  the  moment, the regulatory  philosophy  has\r\n\r\nshifted  from a merit-based regime to one that  is  based  on\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  In other words, in its present approach, so long\r\n\r\nas  the  company meets the listing requirements, chances  are\r\n\r\nthat the company's application to be admitted to the official\r\n\r\nlist will be approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the disclosure-based regulatory\r\n\r\nregime  is  more appropriate for markets where the  investing\r\n\r\npublic  is  sophisticated.  The same, however, may not  apply\r\n\r\nwhere  the  investors are not as savvy.  If  this  is  so,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  there is a greater duty on the  Government  to\r\n\r\nplay  a  greater role in helping to protect the  interest  of\r\n\r\ninvestors.    The  balance  between  a  merit-based   and   a\r\n\r\ndisclosure-based regulatory regime lies closer to the  former\r\n\r\nthan  the  latter.   At  the end of the day,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  just  rely on the fact that the investors  have  been\r\n\r\nwarned.  If the market crashed in a catastrophic manner, some\r\n\r\namount  of backlash will follow.  I mean, just look at  CLOB.\r\n\r\nAs  Mr Low has said earlier, there are many who still believe\r\n\r\nthe  Government is responsible for the problems of having the\r\n\r\nCLOB shares today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is this feeling that there is a certain amount\r\n\r\nof residual responsibility that the people will expect of the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the matter.  Therefore, I beg to differ from my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh.   In  some  ways,  I   would\r\n\r\ntherefore urge the Minister to examine the present policy  to\r\n\r\nsee  if greater protection can be afforded to members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the wide ranging financial\r\n\r\nsector reforms will pave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  way  for Singapore to play a bigger role as a  financial\r\n\r\nservices hub, at least for the Asian time zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the existing offering of primarily equity-linked instruments for both capital raising and investment,\r\n\r\nthe Monetary Authority of Singapore should seriously consider\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up  of an exchange for bonds,  particularly  an\r\n\r\nelectronic  trading  platform.  This would  facilitate  bond-trading for both institutions and retail investors alike, the\r\n\r\nlatter of whom have typically been forced to hold bonds  till\r\n\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complemented by the current equity capabilities of the\r\n\r\nmerged  Singapore Exchange, setting up a bond exchange should\r\n\r\nhopefully attract more infrastructural or telecommunications-related  issues  to  Singapore.  Hitherto,  bonds  have  been\r\n\r\ntraded  on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis in most countries.\r\n\r\nHowever, technology has facilitated electronic trading  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent.  The US market is replete with examples,  such\r\n\r\nas   BrokerTec,  which  aims  to  disintermediate   interbank\r\n\r\nbrokers,  and  Bloomberg Bond Trader which is developed  with\r\n\r\nmajor US banks to focus on  government securities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding some inherent problems with creating\r\n\r\nsufficient  liquidity,  especially  at  the  initial   stage,\r\n\r\nelectronic trading promises ultimately lower issuance  costs.\r\n\r\nAn  added  bonus  would  be the opportunity  to  realise  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  the  untapped  retail  segment  not  just   in\r\n\r\nSingapore but within the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the MAS to explore the\r\n\r\npossibility  and  feasibility of the SGX  taking  on  a  more\r\n\r\nactive  role  in  the debt market, beyond just  listing  bond\r\n\r\nissues.   There  are  synergies to be reaped,  especially  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  marketing  more variety  to  the  same  groups  of\r\n\r\nfinancial investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to the next cut on statutory boards - tapping the open market for funds. As part of our efforts at\r\n\r\nestablishing  a  meaningful  and  vibrant  debt   market   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   statutory  boards,  such  as  the  Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation and the Housing and Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  had begun to issue bonds, each to the tune of  several\r\n\r\nhundred million Singapore dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues not only help to create sufficient critical\r\n\r\nmass  by  complementing  the regular issuance  of  Government\r\n\r\npapers,  but also allow some benchmarking and corporate  debt\r\n\r\nrating  exercises to take place.  This exercise interestingly\r\n\r\nraises  the  question of whether selling bonds  on  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket  has indirectly pushed funding costs higher for  these\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, thereby leading to an inflation of cost  of\r\n\r\nservices  to be provided by them.  For example, the  HDB  may\r\n\r\npay  close  to  5% on the open market for its  longer  tenure\r\n\r\nbonds whereas it typically borrows from the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  via the MAS, at a rate which is pegged to fixed deposit\r\n\r\nrates.  The disparity could be quite marked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point and question here is, aside from the intricate\r\n\r\nrelationships  between  pools  of  funds  at  the   different\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies, will tapping the open market  for  funds\r\n\r\nchange  certain  aspects of public finance?  Will  this  have\r\n\r\nimplications, for example, for the way housing subsidies  are\r\n\r\nand  should  be structured, including the need  to  link  the\r\n\r\ninterest rates of CPF to HDB?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my last cut on investor public education.\r\n\r\nSir, earlier on the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation  Workgroup  on Financial Security  was  trying  to\r\n\r\nascertain the degree of investor awareness and sophistication\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus was that public education was crucial for\r\n\r\nseveral  reasons:   Firstly, as part  of  personal  financial\r\n\r\nplanning,  not  just  for old age but also  throughout  one's\r\n\r\nlife,  to  meet  changing  needs  such  as  family  and  home\r\n\r\nestablishment in earlier years to retirement provisioning  in\r\n\r\nlater years.  Secondly, to enable Singaporeans to partake  of\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  variety of investible instruments,  such  as\r\n\r\ndirect  stock market investments, unit trusts or the slightly\r\n\r\nmore  esoteric derivatives, such as index futures.   Thirdly,\r\n\r\nto enable Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  assume  greater  control  and responsibility  over  their\r\n\r\nindividual  financial  well-being  by  having  the  requisite\r\n\r\nawareness of the different risks involved and skills to  make\r\n\r\nprudent  investment decisions.  Hopefully, this will minimise\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  financial 'lemons' through a  discipline  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding the underlying businesses.  In this regard, the\r\n\r\ncurrent dot.com fever is slightly worrying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  philosophy  with  regard  to  investor   public\r\n\r\neducation.   Whilst it is quite clearly in the  interests  of\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions to educate potential customers as part\r\n\r\nof  marketing their products, would the MAS drive or  play  a\r\n\r\ncoordinating  role  in the public education  process?   Also,\r\n\r\nwould the MAS help ensure that related agencies, such as  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund  Board and the  Singapore  Exchange,\r\n\r\nembark on a wider scale the raising of such awareness?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister on the need for his Ministry and  related\r\n\r\nbodies,  such  as  the  SGX, to devise new  rules,  laws  and\r\n\r\nregulations to regulate Internet companies which are able and\r\n\r\neffective  to control and police the virtual Internet  world.\r\n\r\nThese  Internet companies could well be promoting vice,  such\r\n\r\nas  pornography,  gambling, or other unsavoury  products  and\r\n\r\nservices  on  the  Net.  Moreover, they will  have  a  strong\r\n\r\nimpact on the minds of our younger population, especially the\r\n\r\nstudents who have easy access to the Internet, thanks to  the\r\n\r\nvery effective IT education they receive in the schools.  Our\r\n\r\nyoung  children from ages between 8 and 9 years old, are  now\r\n\r\nquite  Net-savvy.  I would like to ask the Minister what  can\r\n\r\nthe  Government do to control Internet companies and the type\r\n\r\nof products and services they offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Finance Minister announced\r\n\r\nlast  year that the Government intends to pursue company  law\r\n\r\nreform  and this is in line with the efforts to make us  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  Towards this end, several committees have  been\r\n\r\nset up to look into various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissues  covering  various  areas,  such  as  the  legislative\r\n\r\nframework, corporate governance and accounting practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's initiative in this\r\n\r\nregard  as a reform to our Companies Act is timely.   I  have\r\n\r\nraised  the issue of the reform before several times in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  While we do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of\r\n\r\nthe  various  committees, of which I am a member  of  one,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the Government and  the  Minister,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to  consider company law  reform  in  its  wider\r\n\r\ncontext.   In  particular, I hope the Ministry will  consider\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the  role of company legislation.   Should\r\n\r\ncompany  law  be  designed  merely to  enhance  shareholders'\r\n\r\nvalue,  or should it be seen as a stakeholder in our  society\r\n\r\nand,  together  with  it, carry certain responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nobligations towards its employees, members of the public,  or\r\n\r\neven  the  environment.  If we accept that the company  is  a\r\n\r\nstakeholder in our society, then consequential considerations\r\n\r\nfollow.   For instance, there could be obligations placed  on\r\n\r\nthe  directors  to consider the interest of the  environment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,   if   it  is  decided  that   companies   have\r\n\r\nobligations towards its employees, then provisions  could  be\r\n\r\nmade to have employees represented on the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reform allows us the opportunity to look at\r\n\r\nsuch issues comprehensively and I certainly do hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will make full use of this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I refer to the Auditor-General's Report, pages 58 to 60, on the irregular and non-compliance with the procurement procedures by the Board of\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS).  Sir, due to time\r\n\r\nconstraint,  I  will  only highlight two  interesting  cases.\r\n\r\nCase  one.   BCCS engaged an employee of one of the tenderers\r\n\r\nas  consultant to review tender specifications and the tender\r\n\r\nwas  subsequently awarded to the consultant  employer.   When\r\n\r\nAudit   questioned  the  practice,  BCCS  replied  that   the\r\n\r\nconsultant's who is the employee of the tenderer, acted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofessionally and declared that he kept his consultancy role\r\n\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case two. A senior officer of the BCCS approached one\r\n\r\nsupplier  and offered himself as a partner to a BCCS  project\r\n\r\nfor  a  fee and he also subsequently advised the supplier  to\r\n\r\nlower  his fees for the project to a level that is acceptable\r\n\r\nto BCCS.  When BCCS was questioned by Audit, the best part of\r\n\r\nhis response to Audit was that and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It knew of no rule that prohibits an in-house expert\r\n\r\nfrom partnering an external party.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance what\r\n\r\nis  his views on the above replies to Audit by BCCS.  Does he\r\n\r\nagree with the stand taken by BCCS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want to continue with your last\r\n\r\ntopic, Mr Low?\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, it is important that the\r\n\r\nBudget  Book should show at least a clear guide of where  the\r\n\r\nmonies  are  going.   I see that the head of  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nSocial   Transfer  and  Subvention  has  no  clear   details.\r\n\r\nAlthough  some Ministries, such as the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nand  Ministry  of Health did explain them, other  Ministries,\r\n\r\nsuch as the Ministry of Finance itself did not.  I wonder why\r\n\r\nis  it not possible to provide the details of transfers  like\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure  by  projects  on  every  Ministry's\r\n\r\nexpenditure, or provide an annex, like capital grant in Annex\r\n\r\nF, to show the expenditure or where the money goes to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, many cuts have been made.

I\r\n\r\nlast  updated Parliament on this issue in January  this  year\r\n\r\nand I have briefed Parliament on the legal obligations of the\r\n\r\nparties  involved  and provided Members with  copies  of  the\r\n\r\nagreement between the CDP and SCANS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also informed Parliament then that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  Dr Hu had written to his Malaysian counterpart,  Tun\r\n\r\nDaim Zainuddin on 13th January 2000. Tun Daim replied on 17th\r\n\r\nJanuary  2000, and after a further exchange of  letters,  the\r\n\r\nKLSE  met SGX to discuss a mutually acceptable resolution  to\r\n\r\nthe CLOB issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ensuing negotiations were fruitful and resulted in\r\n\r\nthe  SGX-KLSE agreement on 25th February 2000. The  agreement\r\n\r\nis legally binding and provides two schemes for the migration\r\n\r\nand  staggered  release  of CLOB securities  into  individual\r\n\r\ninvestors' securities accounts.  The two exchanges  undertake\r\n\r\nto  implement the migration of CLOB securities for trading on\r\n\r\nthe KLSE under these schemes, fully and unconditionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX and KLSE have jointly presented the two schemes of\r\n\r\ntheir  agreement  as  a comprehensive solution  to  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nissue.  This is a major and timely development after the  17-month  impasse  in  September 1998,  during  which  some  1.5\r\n\r\nbillion  CLOB shares owned by more than 172,000 investors  of\r\n\r\ndifferent nationalities were frozen at the Malaysian  Central\r\n\r\nDepository (MCD).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In negotiating the agreement, the SGX insisted that it\r\n\r\nmet  SGX's  and  also  CLOB  investors'  key  concerns.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, both alternatives have to be legally  binding  on\r\n\r\nthe  relevant Malaysian authorities, which should acknowledge\r\n\r\ntheir  legal  obligations to carry  out  any  agreement.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  solution  had to  be  comprehensive,  with  a\r\n\r\nreasonable alternative for CLOB investors who did not wish to\r\n\r\naccept the private sector offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two key points - firstly, it has to be legally\r\n\r\nbinding.  secondly, it has to be comprehensive  -  which  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  authorities had consistently refused to agree  to,\r\n\r\nare  now  embodied in the SGX-KLSE agreement.  The  agreement\r\n\r\nalso  confirms that the two migration schemes allow  KLSE  to\r\n\r\nmeet  its duty to maintain an orderly market for the  trading\r\n\r\nof securities in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme, Scheme A, is an amended proposal by\r\n\r\nEffective Capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSdn  Bhd (ECSD), which is the only private sector offer  that\r\n\r\nhas won KLSE's approval and endorsement.  KLSE has made clear\r\n\r\nthat  ECSB's proposal was the only private sector scheme that\r\n\r\nhad complied with all of KLSE's and MCD's rules to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors who opt for this scheme will pay ECSB a 1.5%\r\n\r\ntransfer fee based on the closing prices in the KLSE on  15th\r\n\r\nFebruary this year. There will be a three-month set-up period\r\n\r\n(for  the opening of individual securities accounts with MCD)\r\n\r\ncommencing  from  31st  March 2000, followed  by  a  13-month\r\n\r\nstaggered release of the CLOB securities for trading  on  the\r\n\r\nKLSE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheme B, the second scheme, is effected by a\r\n\r\nsupplemental agreement between CDP and SCANS. Investors  will\r\n\r\nhave  their securities migrated into individual accounts  and\r\n\r\nreleased  for trading on the KLSE after 33 months  from  31st\r\n\r\nMarch 2000, ie, the migration will begin on 1st January 2003.\r\n\r\nThe  release will be staggered over 9 months from 1st January\r\n\r\n2003 to 1st October 2003.  A 1% administrative fee is payable\r\n\r\nto  SCANS. In this case, the fee will be based on the average\r\n\r\nof  securities prices on the KLSE over the last five  trading\r\n\r\ndays of October 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After SGX and KLSE had signed their agreement, the\r\n\r\nfollowing day, on 26th February, Dr Richard Hu wrote again to\r\n\r\nTun Daim Zainuddin.  Tun Daim replied on 2nd March 2000 and I\r\n\r\nam circulating copies of this exchange of letters to Members.\r\n\r\n[Copies of letters circulated to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see from Dr Hu's letter, Dr Hu informed\r\n\r\nTun  Daim in paragraph 3 that \"the Singapore Government fully\r\n\r\nsupports the KLSE-SGX agreement, which meets SGX's desire for\r\n\r\na comprehensive, legally binding solution,  and KLSE's aim of\r\n\r\nensuring  an  orderly market.  The Singapore  Government  had\r\n\r\nundertaken  to  ensure that SGX will abide by  the  agreement\r\n\r\nreached.    I   would  deeply  appreciate  Your  Excellency's\r\n\r\nconfirmation,  by  reply to this letter, that  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment likewise supports the agreement reached by the two\r\n\r\nexchanges, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas undertaken to ensure that KLSE will abide by it\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Daim replied, and in his reply, he reiterated the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   Government's  stand.   I  read  from  his   third\r\n\r\nparagraph,  \"I have mentioned in my letter to Your Excellency\r\n\r\ndated  14th  February  2000 that  it  is  the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Malaysia that CLOB is a wholly private  sector\r\n\r\nissue.  As Your Excellency is aware, KLSE is a private sector\r\n\r\norganisation  owned  by its members.  The agreements  reached\r\n\r\nbetween KLSE and SGS confirmed this stand.\"  But he went  on,\r\n\r\n\"As  this is a comprehensive solution and the agreements  are\r\n\r\nlegally  binding, I am confident KLSE will  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nobligations  under the agreements are fully  discharged.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   Malaysia  looks  forward  to   the   smooth\r\n\r\nimplementation of this comprehensive settlement.\"   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the KLSE-SGX agreement has the full support  of  both\r\n\r\nthe Singapore and the Malaysian Governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some CLOB investors have written to the local press\r\n\r\nexpressing  disappointment with the solution reached  and  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  has  expressed some of their views just now.  They  feel\r\n\r\nthat  SGX  and  CDP should have insisted on  CLOB  investors'\r\n\r\nstrict legal rights and taken a firm stand with the Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities,  particularly as Singapore was  on  sound  legal\r\n\r\nground.   A  few went further to suggest that by agreeing  to\r\n\r\nthe  resolution, SGX has conceded that CLOB International was\r\n\r\nillegal  and  had  merely been \"talking tough\"  in  the  past\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX has not conceded any such thing. CLOB International\r\n\r\nwas never illegal, and SGX's confidence in its legal position\r\n\r\nwas based on informed legal advice. The Singapore authorities\r\n\r\nhad  also  taken  legal advice from leading  experts  on  WTO\r\n\r\nmatters.   Our position was strong, both under Malaysian  law\r\n\r\nand at the WTO.  But legal action would have involved further\r\n\r\ndelay, probably as long as several years, particularly in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  our  action  in  Malaysian courts.   Meanwhile  the\r\n\r\nprospect of delay and uncertainty would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  caused many CLOB investors to feel compelled to  accept\r\n\r\nprivate sector offers which were less favourable and  had  no\r\n\r\nlegal  assurance  of  being carried out  by  the  KLSE.  This\r\n\r\nincluded,   in   particular,  Effective   Capital's   earlier\r\n\r\nstaggered  release proposal, which would have  involved  a  4\r\n\r\nplus 18 months delay, starting in February this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there were clear and unambiguous legal\r\n\r\nrights  involving  more than 172,000 investors  of  different\r\n\r\nnationalities,  and that we were prepared  to  enforce  these\r\n\r\nrights  as a last resort, were clearly significant in helping\r\n\r\nSGX  to  reach  a comprehensive and legally binding  solution\r\n\r\nwith the KLSE to serve the needs of CLOB investors.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  did not eventually have to go to Court or go to the  WTO,\r\n\r\nthe  legal position was important in establishing that we had\r\n\r\na  case and that therefore we were able to deal with KLSE and\r\n\r\nreach this agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In getting KLSE to finally negotiate and enter into a\r\n\r\nlegally binding agreement spelling out specific terms of  the\r\n\r\nstaggered release of CLOB securities, SGX was acting  in  the\r\n\r\nbest  interests  of  investors.  The  terms  of  the  schemes\r\n\r\npresented  to CLOB investors are significantly improved  from\r\n\r\nthose  previously  offered.  Each  CLOB  investor  is  in   a\r\n\r\ndifferent  situation and has different interests,  especially\r\n\r\nwith  regard to how long he is able to wait before being able\r\n\r\nto  trade  his shares.  No resolution, whether through  legal\r\n\r\naction  or  negotiation, could have  met  the  needs  of  all\r\n\r\ninvestors equally. But the final negotiated settlement  is  a\r\n\r\npragmatic one in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industries Investors Association of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (SIAS)  has,  throughout  this  episode,  provided\r\n\r\nindependent   representation  of  a  substantial   group   of\r\n\r\ninvestors.  It made clear its members' preferences, and  took\r\n\r\na  resolute stand against earlier private sector offers  that\r\n\r\nwere to the disadvantage of investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIAS has on 26th February 2000 stated its view that the\r\n\r\ntwo  schemes  address the needs of most  CLOB  investors.  It\r\n\r\nnoted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  its  concerns had been addressed with the reduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  ECSB proposal's staggered release period from 18  to  13\r\n\r\nmonths,  and  with  KLSE's  legal undertaking  to  fully  and\r\n\r\nunconditionally  implement the migration.  SIAS  has  further\r\n\r\nexplained  on 6th March that although it was not involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations, it was providing in-principle  support  to\r\n\r\nthe  two exchanges' agreement because Scheme A had come  very\r\n\r\nclose to what SIAS itself had proposed to the KLSE, namely, a\r\n\r\n12-month staggered release and a 1% migration fee and what we\r\n\r\nhave  negotiated  is a 3 plus 13 months release  and  1  1/2%\r\n\r\nmigration  fee.   SIAS noted that \"many investors  have  been\r\n\r\nanxious  for  an early settlement and been pressing  CDP  and\r\n\r\nSIAS for it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By holding firm on its stance over the last year, SIAS\r\n\r\nhas   demonstrated   its   effectiveness,   and   contributed\r\n\r\nsignificantly  to the eventual solution to  settle  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nissue  fairly  in keeping with the interest of  all  parties.\r\n\r\nThis is a positive example of civil society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is conceivable that some investors may decide not to\r\n\r\naccept  either option. They are entitled to do so,  as  under\r\n\r\nlaw,  neither SGX nor CDP can waive the rights of  beneficial\r\n\r\nowners to decide for themselves whether to accept any offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement commits KLSE, SCANS and their related\r\n\r\ncompanies to implement fully the two alternative schemes.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  the implementation proceeds as agreed, neither  SGX\r\n\r\nnor CDP will have cause to take legal action against KLSE  or\r\n\r\nits group of companies.  However, should there be any failure\r\n\r\non  the part of KLSE or its related corporations to implement\r\n\r\neither of the two schemes, SGX and CDP will naturally have to\r\n\r\ntake  action  to  enforce  the  migration  and  release,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary, through legal means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual investors who still wish to commence legal\r\n\r\nproceedings on their own behalf are entitled to do  so.  They\r\n\r\nshould seek professional advice and decide according to their\r\n\r\nindividual circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that SGX and the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhave done their part to help to resolve this problem and have\r\n\r\nnot  left  investors in a black hole.  SGX and CDP negotiated\r\n\r\nthe  agreement to the best of their ability. It believes that\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  is  in the interests of the  majority  of  CLOB\r\n\r\nshareholders.   Investors  must  assess  the  situation   for\r\n\r\nthemselves to determine the best course of action, and decide\r\n\r\nif they wish to opt for either scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some investors have written to request that SGX go\r\n\r\nfurther  and pay the 1 1/2% and 1% fees under the two schemes\r\n\r\non behalf of CLOB investors.  SGX is not able to do so. It is\r\n\r\nbeyond the scope of SGX's legal duties to defray the costs to\r\n\r\ninvestors  of  the  migration and  staggered  release  plans.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, for SGX to do so would raise a serious issue  of\r\n\r\nmoral hazard, because fundamentally the risk of investing  in\r\n\r\nsecurities on CLOB or other markets provided by SGX,  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  borne by investors themselves, and not by the exchange or\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  We have provided the facility,  it  is  for\r\n\r\ninvestors to decide.  This is true of CLOB. This is  true  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  shares or any other shares which you  may  buy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or out of Singapore.  The person who buys  has  to\r\n\r\ntake  the responsibility for it.  Nobody can be sure that  it\r\n\r\nwould prosper.  Nobody can be sure that something will not go\r\n\r\nwrong.  If something goes wrong in Singapore which is against\r\n\r\nthe law, or against the rules or monkey business, we will put\r\n\r\nit  right.  When it is overseas shares, nobody can  give  any\r\n\r\nguarantee.  These  are  sovereign  risks  because   sovereign\r\n\r\ngovernments are entitled to do anything they like under their\r\n\r\nown laws.  If they have not followed their own laws, then, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it is possible for us to seek legal remedy in  their\r\n\r\ncourts,  and  this  is what we could have  done  had  we  not\r\n\r\nreached  a  reasonable  solution  to  the  CLOB  issue.  But,\r\n\r\nfortunately, it has not been necessary, and we have been able\r\n\r\nto arrive at a negotiated settlement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken a constructive approach in trying to\r\n\r\nresolve the issue.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  consistently  maintained that an expeditious  and  just\r\n\r\nresolution  to  the  matter  is  in  the  interest  of   both\r\n\r\ncountries,  as  well  as in the interest of  CLOB  investors.\r\n\r\nAfter  almost  one  and a half years,   legally  binding  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  solution,  that  has  the  support   of   both\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysian governments, is in place to  resolve\r\n\r\nthe CLOB issue once and for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsure that the KLSE will not change its mind again?

So investors have  to\r\n\r\nassess   and   decide.    If   a  problem   arises   in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation, as I have explained, we will have to  act  in\r\n\r\norder to enforce a migration and transfer, and that will have\r\n\r\nto  include legal rights.  But I think we will wait and  see.\r\n\r\nIt  is  premature for us to say that this will not be carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, may I ask a quick clarification?\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether  he\r\n\r\nfeels that this 1 1/2% charge by Effective Capital is fair and\r\n\r\nreasonable?   And  after getting the  fee  upfront,  if  they\r\n\r\nrenege  on  the whole agreement and they do not  release  the\r\n\r\nshares, what will happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not for me to\r\n\r\ndecide whether 1 1/2% is enough or not.  That there should  be\r\n\r\nsome fee for a transfer is not surprising, because there  are\r\n\r\nsome  expenses  incurred.   As  far  as  the  investors   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is only the fee which matters and not  to  whom\r\n\r\nthe  fee  is  paid.   In this case, the arrangement  is  with\r\n\r\nEffective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCapital.   We  accepted  it  as  so,  because  that  is   the\r\n\r\npreference of the Malaysian side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if, after having paid the fee, the shares are not\r\n\r\ntransferred?   The fee is being paid into Standard  Chartered\r\n\r\nBank  and held by a stakeholder, which means that it  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  transferred  to  ECSB  until  the  shares  are\r\n\r\ntransferred  and  released.

The Malaysian Finance Minister responded\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  confident that KLSE will ensure the obligation.\r\n\r\nAlso,  in  his  letter, he mentioned that KLSE is  a  private\r\n\r\nsector  organisation.

Let me  give  Members  a  simple\r\n\r\nexplanation.  Why is it that eventually we have not taken the\r\n\r\nmatter to the WTO?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLegally   speaking,   whether  it   is   Malaysian   law   or\r\n\r\ninternational  law,  our position is very  strong.   We  have\r\n\r\nengaged  Queen's Counsel.  We have also consulted the experts\r\n\r\non  WTO  issues, and they advised us that it is a very clear-cut  case  in our favour.  However, if we were to take  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings, there will be some difficulties, because the law\r\n\r\ncannot settle matters overnight.  It will take some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go to the WTO, it may take more than a year.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the WTO is not an international court.   It  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  trade organisation.  The WTO can rule that  this  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  WTO's  rules  or against  something  which  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  has  already subscribed to.  But  the  WTO  cannot\r\n\r\nforce the Malaysian government to transfer the shares to  the\r\n\r\naccounts of the individuals.  So the WTO can only give us the\r\n\r\nright to retaliate against them, but not more than that.  But\r\n\r\nif we are successful, then, of course, legally or morally, we\r\n\r\nare  on the right side.  But then if we go to court, it  will\r\n\r\ntake 2-3 years.  And after the trial, it may go on appeal and\r\n\r\nit  would  take a very long time.  The Member was saying,  \"A\r\n\r\nlong   night  is  fraught  with  nightmares.\"   So,  to   the\r\n\r\nshareholders in Singapore, they will be very worried on  what\r\n\r\nthe consequences may be.  Now,  there is this company that is\r\n\r\nprepared to step in, show you a short cut and says, \"I'll buy\r\n\r\nover the shares.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your losses may not be just 1.5%. Look at it this way.\r\n\r\nIf we can avoid going to court and we can try and resolve the\r\n\r\nmatter  directly  with  the  other  side,  it  is  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation.   We  are  able  to settle  this  matter  because,\r\n\r\nlegally,  we are in a very strong position.  That is  why  we\r\n\r\ncould  do it.  But if the legal position is not strong,  then\r\n\r\ndo  you  think  friendly negotiations  will  lead  us  to  an\r\n\r\namicable settlement?  I do not think so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier talked about sovereign risk.  He said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government would  be more unequivocal about telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore that whenever they  invest  in  foreign\r\n\r\nassets,  they must take on the sovereign risk of the  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries in which these assets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  based.  And whether they invest in Malaysian  shares  in\r\n\r\nCLOB or in Kuala Lumpur, the shares are nothing but pieces of\r\n\r\npaper,  representing  assets  that  are  basically  based  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  or at least controlled in Malaysia, because  these\r\n\r\nare shares of Malaysian companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, perhaps the Government should also be\r\n\r\nvery clear that it is going on to a disclosure-based type  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  regulations  for the people,  rather  than  merit\r\n\r\nbased,  because  whenever  the Government  tries  to  be  too\r\n\r\npaternalistic  about  this, it is  always  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestors saying that if they make money, it is through their\r\n\r\nown  diligence and smartness.  And whenever they lose  money,\r\n\r\nit  is  the  Government's  fault, and  I  do  not  think  any\r\n\r\ngovernment can be in that position.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I can understand the reasoning behind\r\n\r\nthe settlement.

The\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of going to court sometimes is to  say  to  the\r\n\r\nother  side that you have done wrong.

Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh  has also expressed similar  views.   I  have\r\n\r\nalready   discussed  some  of  these  points  in  my   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement, in which I said that there will be relief  on  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of assets between associated companies at  the  75%\r\n\r\nlevel.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngranted this in recognition that there are legitimate  merger\r\n\r\nand  acquisition transactions and therefore we need  to  make\r\n\r\nthis concession.  However, moving it down from 75% to 51%  is\r\n\r\ngoing  a bit too far at this stage, but that we will take  it\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOF policies are motivated by different considerations.\r\n\r\nWhilst  it  is generally true that we would like our  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies  to bulk up and become large in order  to  compete,\r\n\r\nthere  are other commercial reasons why companies merge.   So\r\n\r\nwe cannot go overboard and make too many concessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all mergers and acquisitions, trading stock can be\r\n\r\ntransferred  at  cost,  as long as it  becomes  part  of  the\r\n\r\ntrading  stock  of the transferee company.   The  transferred\r\n\r\ncompany is not required to transfer the trading stock at  the\r\n\r\nopen  market  price.  For other assets, any  gains  from  the\r\n\r\ntransfer of such assets are usually regarded as capital gains\r\n\r\nand are thus not taxable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has criticised the role of GLCs and made\r\n\r\nsome  rather  startling comments about GLCs  being  generally\r\n\r\npredatory,  have  deep pockets but  shallow  ideas.   I  have\r\n\r\nheard  something to this effect, but not quite in such  stark\r\n\r\nterms.  Perhaps he could give me more details so that  I  can\r\n\r\nfollow  them up.  Because if it were true, it would be   most\r\n\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran is also concerned that many GLCs have in\r\n\r\nthe   past  gone  into  downstream  non-core  businesses   in\r\n\r\ncompetition with our SMEs.   This, unfortunately, was true in\r\n\r\nthe  past.   But  Temasek Holdings has now  come  down  quite\r\n\r\nstrongly   against  GLCs  which  strayed  from   their   core\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and I think, in future, GLCs will be  scrutinised\r\n\r\ncarefully to ensure that they do not venture into areas where\r\n\r\ntheir  presence  is  not necessary and their  competition  is\r\n\r\nunhelpful.   Basically, we would like our GLCs,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  larger ones, to seek their fortunes overseas  where  the\r\n\r\nmarkets are much larger, and they are better placed to do so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause of their assets and their capacity to expand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of group relief was raised by both Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh and Mr Leong Horn Kee.  This is  a  very  old\r\n\r\nsubject which has been raised many times.  Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nalso  made  many recommendations for the reform  of  our  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  which I will take into consideration.   But  at  this\r\n\r\npoint of time, I have to say that I am still not in favour of\r\n\r\ngeneral group relief, although in specific instances, we have\r\n\r\nallowed   it,  particularly  when  we  recognise   that   the\r\n\r\napplicants  have  legitimate reasons for doing  so.   Members\r\n\r\nwill  be  interested to know that group relief is not allowed\r\n\r\nin  many countries in the region.  Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea\r\n\r\nand Taiwan do not allow it.  It is only allowed in UK and US.\r\n\r\nIn countries where it is allowed, very tough regulations have\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  to ensure that tax leakage  does  not  take\r\n\r\nplace.  So I am not sure that group relief is something which\r\n\r\nwe want to introduce at this point of time.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  e-commerce on our tax structure.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed a very serious problem which is not just of concern to\r\n\r\nus  but to many countries in the world, including the US, UK,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Canada  and  the European  Union.   It  is  being\r\n\r\nstudied by all tax authorities because the possibility of tax\r\n\r\nleakage  is huge and no one, unfortunately, knows the answer.\r\n\r\nFor  the  time  being, the volume of cross-border  e-commerce\r\n\r\narea  is not very large. Where e-commerce takes place  within\r\n\r\nthe confines of a country, then tax is not a problem.  It  is\r\n\r\nwhen  transactions  take place across borders  that  problems\r\n\r\narise.  I  can  assure  Members that MOF  is  monitoring  the\r\n\r\nsituation  very carefully.  As far as Singapore is concerned,\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that tax leakage through e-commerce is  not  yet\r\n\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that we allow angel\r\n\r\ninvestors to write off losses incurred when their investments\r\n\r\nfail  against their personal income tax.  Mr Singh's  concern\r\n\r\nis already addressed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  the  Technopreneur Investment Initiative (TII),  which\r\n\r\nwas  introduced in September 1999.  The TII aims to alleviate\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced by high-tech style companies  in  raising\r\n\r\nfunds  at  the  start-up stage. Under the  TII,  an  eligible\r\n\r\ninvestor,  which  can be either a company or  an  individual,\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy tax deduction for any loss arising from the  sale\r\n\r\nof  qualified  shares  held in approved  start-ups  within  a\r\n\r\nqualifying  disposal period, or from the liquidation  of  the\r\n\r\nstart-up.   The  investor  can  offset  the  losses  incurred\r\n\r\nagainst  his taxable income in the current year of loss.   In\r\n\r\nthe  event  the  investor's income at  current  year  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to absorb the total loss, the unabsorbed loss  can\r\n\r\nbe  carried forward indefinitely to offset his taxable income\r\n\r\nin future years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current tax system draws a distinction between\r\n\r\npayments which are capital in nature against those which  are\r\n\r\nrevenue.    Expenses   incurred   in   start-up   phase   are\r\n\r\nunfortunately  considered to be capital  in  nature  and  are\r\n\r\ntherefore not allowable for tax claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee stock options (ESOPs) were raised by Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh  and Mr Leong Horn Kee. They  have  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we should be much more generous in allowing tax  relief\r\n\r\nfor  ESOPs.   I have indicated in my earlier speech  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  examining this issue in detail and an  announcement\r\n\r\nwill  be  made  by  end  May  this  year.   We  welcome   any\r\n\r\nsuggestions   put  forward  and  all  will  be   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration very seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro-family and procreation tax incentives were raised by\r\n\r\nDr  Jennifer  Lee  and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  Mrs  Lim  suggested\r\n\r\nallowing  procreation  tax  incentives  to  be  extended   to\r\n\r\nhusbands  of  women  who  choose  to  stop  work  temporarily\r\n\r\nfollowing  child  birth. She has also  suggested  that  child\r\n\r\nrelief  be increased and Dr Jennifer Lee has supported  these\r\n\r\nproposals.  I should point out that there are already several\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs  and  rebates to encourage  family  support  and\r\n\r\nfamily formation.  Tax relief serves as a form of recognition\r\n\r\nand  is  not  intended to fully compensate for the taxpayer's\r\n\r\nexpenses incurred.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Old  leaders\r\n\r\nlike Suharto have been swept away.  Old icons are gone.   Old\r\n\r\nparadigms are no longer valid or relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a new millennium. A new year. The\r\n\r\nstrategic  parameters have changed.  At the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nsituation has somewhat stabilised, after the election of  Gus\r\n\r\nDur  as  the President of Indonesia.  The sense of crisis  is\r\n\r\nnot so pronounced, though not all issues have been resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then can we make of this new scenario? Where are\r\n\r\nthe  new  fault lines?  How has the balance of power shifted?\r\n\r\nWhat are the interests and agendas of the big powers like the\r\n\r\nUnited States, China and Japan?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the questions and issues I wish to\r\n\r\npose to the Minister.  What is the Minister's reading of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent strategic situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chinese words for crisis wei chi show, where\r\n\r\nthere  are  dangers, there are also ample  opportunities.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  Singapore has done  well  and  is  in  a  much\r\n\r\nstronger position after the crisis.  By comparison, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas   emerged  stronger  economically,  remained  politically\r\n\r\ncohesive and has the resources to continue to upgrade our own\r\n\r\ndefence capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, though small, is like the mouse deer: nimble,\r\n\r\nagile and strong, able to deal with any tricky situation, and\r\n\r\nable to fight back too, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Dr Habibie liked to call Singapore the \"tiny\r\n\r\nred  dot\".  I think he is mistaken.  It is the mighty  beacon\r\n\r\nof  light,  shining across the seas for all to see.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  vigilant.  Today's friends  may  be  tomorrow's\r\n\r\nenemies.  Nations have no permanent friends or enemies,  only\r\n\r\npermanent interests.  And, if I may add, interests may change\r\n\r\nover  time.   May  I therefore ask the Minister  what  useful\r\n\r\nroles  can  Singapore, as a small country,  play  to  promote\r\n\r\npeace,  stability and economic development in our own  region\r\n\r\nwhile at the same time remain vigilant and watchful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, it might be useful for me to respond to his question on\r\n\r\nthe  strategic  situation before Members  speak  on  specific\r\n\r\ncountry-related topics.  As to his request for my reading  on\r\n\r\nthe  strategic situation, I would like to start off by saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  backdrop  for  our assessment  of  the   strategic\r\n\r\nsituation is the state of the triangular relationship between\r\n\r\nUnited States, China and Japan.  As I have said in this House\r\n\r\nbefore,  this  relationship  is  critical  for  the  external\r\n\r\nenvironment   in   South   East  Asia.    Fortunately,   this\r\n\r\nrelationship  is stable for now, but there are  stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains  which  could  pose  a  challenge  to  security   and\r\n\r\nstability in the Asia-Pacific and it may be useful for me  to\r\n\r\nbriefly  touch  on  the various aspects  of  this  triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take United States and China relations, which is\r\n\r\nthe key aspect of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntriangle,  I  would say that last year, as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nrough  patch  which US-China relationship went through,  this\r\n\r\nwas  a  worrisome  aspect, particularly as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nbombing  of  the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as well  as  the\r\n\r\nfailure  to  conclude the United States-China  WTO  agreement\r\n\r\nwhen  Premier Zhu Rongji visited the United States in May  of\r\n\r\n1999.    However,  with  the  conclusion  of   the   US-China\r\n\r\nnegotiations on the WTO more recently, I think we can say the\r\n\r\nrelations  are  generally back on track  but  there  are  two\r\n\r\nissues  which  potentially can seriously affect the  US-China\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Taiwan issue and, second, the granting of\r\n\r\nPermanent  Normal  Trade Relations (PNTR) for  China  by  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.  The Taiwan issue is the most sensitive  issue\r\n\r\nwhich  could derail US-China relations.  The stakes are high.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  must  remember  that this is  a  year  of  political\r\n\r\ntransitions  - with the Presidential elections in  Taiwan  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in the United States and, therefore, it is important\r\n\r\nfor  all parties - China, Taiwan and the United States  -  to\r\n\r\nmake  even  greater effort to keep temperatures low,  and  to\r\n\r\nkeep relations on an even keel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore hope that all parties will avoid words and\r\n\r\ndeeds  that  could  potentially lead to an explosive  outcome\r\n\r\nwhich  will  not  be in the interest of all  of  us,  not  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan's  interest, not in China's interest, not in America's\r\n\r\ninterest or the region's interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the Clinton Administration is aware of\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  granting PNTR to China.   It  is  making\r\n\r\ntremendous efforts to get Congressional approval for PNTR for\r\n\r\nChina.   We  hope  that the Administration  will  succeed  in\r\n\r\npersuading  Congress  because  the  conclusion  of  the   WTO\r\n\r\nagreement with China was a very important milestone.  China's\r\n\r\ndecision  to  join  WTO  is  significant.   It  represents  a\r\n\r\npolitical and strategic decision to integrate itself into the\r\n\r\nglobalised  world economy. It also demonstrated a  high-level\r\n\r\ncommitment   to  continue  necessary  but  painful   domestic\r\n\r\nreforms.  By concluding the agreement, the US has shown  that\r\n\r\nit understands the importance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof integrating China into the world economy, and the benefits\r\n\r\nto US business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next aspect of the triangle of course is the US-Japan relationship which, I would say, remains strong. The\r\n\r\nUS-Japan alliance still serves the interests of both parties.\r\n\r\nHowever,  its  future orientation will  be  affected  by  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  mood  in  Japan  as well as  regional  geopolitical\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We believe that Japan has a key role to play in\r\n\r\nthe  region  because  of its economic  strength.   Japan  was\r\n\r\nactive  in  helping  countries in Asia during  the  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Over the longer term, Japan can play a greater  role\r\n\r\nin  the  region,  within the context  of  a  strong  US-Japan\r\n\r\nsecurity alliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third side of the triangle, the Japan-China\r\n\r\nrelations, they are also an important part.  There are  signs\r\n\r\nthat  they are trying to move their relations forward.   They\r\n\r\nmade  significant  progress during  Prime  Minister  Obuchi's\r\n\r\nvisit  to  China in 1999.  Both countries wish to  set  their\r\n\r\nrelations on the path of joint cooperation which is good  for\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought we should also mention an interesting\r\n\r\ndevelopment that there are  signs of warming ties  among  the\r\n\r\nNortheast  Asian  powers - China, Japan and the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nKorea.  The leaders of these three countries, in fact, had  a\r\n\r\nhistoric  meeting  at the fringes of the  ASEAN+3  Summit  in\r\n\r\nManila  in  November last year, and this was followed  up  by\r\n\r\nother meetings.  For example, their Environment Ministers met\r\n\r\ntwice  in  Seoul  and  Beijing  to  discuss  cooperation   in\r\n\r\nenvironmental  protection.   I  think  this  is  a   positive\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  if the drawing together of the Northeast  Asian\r\n\r\npowers results in rapprochement, the reduction of tensions in\r\n\r\nAsia,  and the reinforcement of the US-China-Japan triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengthening of this triangular relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  United  States, China and Japan  will  help  to\r\n\r\nensure  a peaceful and stable balance of power in the region.\r\n\r\nThe US' role is the key to the regional balance. As you know,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  continued to reiterate the  importance  of  a\r\n\r\ncontinued  US presence in the region.  It is the  pre-eminent\r\n\r\npower in the region,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  in the world, and only it can ensure that the triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship remains stable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, in our view, has historically played an\r\n\r\nimportant  role in Asia.  It was so in the years after  World\r\n\r\nWar  II.  After the Cold War, the role remains important.   A\r\n\r\nstable strategic environment in Asia is a pre-requisite for a\r\n\r\nprosperous  Asia but which is buttressed by open markets  and\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having given this backdrop of the strategic situation,\r\n\r\nlet  me also say that there are potential flash points  which\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  manage very carefully.  I have  mentioned  this\r\n\r\npreviously,  but  to  update Members,  first,  there  is  the\r\n\r\npotential  flash  point of the South China  Sea.   The  South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea remains a potential flash point because there  are\r\n\r\nso many claimant states of various islands, atolls and reefs,\r\n\r\nand we saw during the past year some incidents involving some\r\n\r\nof  the  claimant  states, not only between  Philippines  and\r\n\r\nChina,  but  also between ASEAN claimant states, namely,  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.  I do not think  there  is\r\n\r\nany  immediate danger of outbreak of hostilities.  But  there\r\n\r\nis  always  a concern that accidents can happen,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant therefore that claimant states continue to act with\r\n\r\nrestraint  to  settle  their differences  peacefully  without\r\n\r\nresort  to  use  of  force and, more  importantly,  from  the\r\n\r\nviewpoint   of  non-claimant  states  like  us,  to   respect\r\n\r\ninternational laws concerning navigational routes and freedom\r\n\r\nof passage.  The ASEAN Regional Forum, I might add, is trying\r\n\r\nto work out a code of conduct for the South China Sea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another flash point is South Asia. Relations between\r\n\r\nIndia and Pakistan took a downward turn in the past year over\r\n\r\nthe  Kargil conflict in May 1999, Pakistan's Chief  Executive\r\n\r\nMusharraf's  assumption of power in  November  1999  and  the\r\n\r\nhijack of the Indian Airline's plane in December.  Since both\r\n\r\ncountries have nuclear weapons, events in the region  clearly\r\n\r\ncould  have reverberations for the rest of Asia, if  not  the\r\n\r\nworld, at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Korean Peninsula also is a potential flash point and\r\n\r\nremains unpredictable.  Any tension can quickly escalate  and\r\n\r\ncan  affect  the rest of Asia, as was evident  by  the  naval\r\n\r\nskirmishes  in the Yellow Sea last year between  North  Korea\r\n\r\nand Japan, and between North Korea and South Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, efforts to improve the situation have\r\n\r\ncontinued.   Most  notably, US-North  Korea  dialogues  which\r\n\r\nstarted  in  September 1999 have been yielding some  positive\r\n\r\nresults, such as the de facto freeze in North Korea's missile\r\n\r\ntesting programme and the plans for North Korean Vice-Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister to make the first high level visit from North  Korea\r\n\r\nto  the  United  States.  South Korea  on  its  part  remains\r\n\r\ncommitted to President Kim's 1998 Sunshine policy.  Japan  is\r\n\r\nalso looking to normalise relations with North Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another flash point, of course, is the cross-strait\r\n\r\ntensions.   This  is  another area  of uncertainty.   Beijing\r\n\r\nhas, in the recently released White Paper on Taiwan, formally\r\n\r\nmade  it  known that it will resort to the use  of  force  if\r\n\r\nTaipei  delays negotiations on reunification.  The  situation\r\n\r\nis  likely to be aggravated by election politics in  the  US.\r\n\r\nHowever,  since  the  release of the  White  Paper,  Beijing,\r\n\r\nTaipei and Washington appear to have exercised restraint  and\r\n\r\nnot  escalated tensions further.  The role and approach taken\r\n\r\nby  the  United States towards both Beijing and  Taipei  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be crucial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to sum up the strategic situation, I think we\r\n\r\ncan say that there are signs that Asia is recovering from the\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  The triangular relationship among  US  and\r\n\r\nChina  remains  relatively stable but there continues  to  be\r\n\r\nseveral  potential flash points which we need  to  watch  and\r\n\r\nmanage carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Dr Ong Chit Chung's question on the role of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  this  regard, I would  say,  first,  that  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  a  small  country, to  be  able  to  develop  and\r\n\r\nprogress  in  the  future, as we have done  in  the  past,  a\r\n\r\nbenign, favourable, stable external environment in the region\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncritical.   Therefore, we have an interest  in  ensuring  the\r\n\r\nengagement  of  all  the key players in  as  many  forums  as\r\n\r\npossible.   Thus,  Singapore's role  should  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  in  ASEAN  plus three forums as  well  as  in  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum (ARF) to try to engage these critical  players\r\n\r\n(United  States,  Japan and Korea) as  well  as  others  like\r\n\r\nRussia,  Australia, New Zealand which are dialogue  partners,\r\n\r\nto  sit  together  at the table and discuss  common  security\r\n\r\nissues.   I  notice that there is a cut further down  on  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Regional Forum, and we can discuss further on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the ability of Singapore to be\r\n\r\nalert  to changing trends, shifting currents, new alignments,\r\n\r\nso  that we will not be caught by surprise - a point made  by\r\n\r\nDr  Ong  Chit  Chung himself.  This is absolutely  important.\r\n\r\nInternational events, alliances and trends are never  static.\r\n\r\nThey  keep changing.  Singapore must be alert.  We must  note\r\n\r\nchanging trends, be able to adjust way ahead of time.  If  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  that, then I think we will be more prepared for  new\r\n\r\nsituations.  And as I have described, the strategic situation\r\n\r\nthis  year is quite different from what I described  in  last\r\n\r\nyear's Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, with your permission, could I\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister before we proceed to the\r\n\r\nnext cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the Minister for his very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  answer.  But mainly about the  United  States'\r\n\r\nrole, many are worried that the US may not be so committed to\r\n\r\nthe  region or may not put all their attention and resources,\r\n\r\ndistracted  by domestic matters or by Euro or Mexico,  or  so\r\n\r\nmany  other places that they can engage itself in.  Recently,\r\n\r\nthere was this Williamsburg Conference in Singapore last week\r\n\r\nwhen  the Foreign Minister and DPM also participated  in  the\r\n\r\nConference.  Is there any conclusion from this Conference and\r\n\r\nwhat would be Singapore's stand on this particular issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The Williamsburg Conference discussed\r\n\r\nmany things, including the continued engagement, presence and\r\n\r\nrole of the United States in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsia.  I was asked for my views on this matter.  DPM gave  an\r\n\r\nimportant  keynote address exhorting the United  States  that\r\n\r\nthey should continue to play a key role in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just sum up the gist of the views we and I\r\n\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in my discussions with other Ministers in the\r\n\r\nregion  as  well  as  analysts, I  think  there  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nexpectation  and  consensus  that  the  United  States   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  remain engaged in the region.  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nanyone  seriously doubts that.  The question  really  is  the\r\n\r\nnature of the United States' future role in Asia, whether  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  based  on consultation, working together  with  the\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the region and partnership, or as  some  doubt\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time, whether it will be unilateral imposition\r\n\r\nof  views.   If  it is going to be on a partnership,  working\r\n\r\ntogether  with the countries, then the question is:  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  the basis and foundation of that  partnership?\r\n\r\nDuring the Cold War when the United States was engaged in the\r\n\r\nregion, there was a clear basis for that partnership.   There\r\n\r\nwere  clearly shared strategic interests due to the Cold  War\r\n\r\nwith  the Soviet Union.  But post-Cold War, it is very  clear\r\n\r\nas  to what the other shared interests are.  Singapore's view\r\n\r\nand  the views of many other countries in the region are that\r\n\r\nthere  are  fundamental interests for the  United  States  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to be involved here, both economic interests as well\r\n\r\nas  leadership  and globalisation, as well as  political  and\r\n\r\nsecurity issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the United States and the Clinton\r\n\r\nadministration understand the importance of their  engagement\r\n\r\nin Asia.  The question is whether the American public and the\r\n\r\nCongress have the same interest and the same view.  So  there\r\n\r\nis  a  real  challenge, I think, for the US  policymakers  to\r\n\r\nbuild a domestic consensus to support US' strategic interests\r\n\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me about the future of United States'\r\n\r\nmilitary  presence  in the region which  we  and  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries  feel is critical for the maintenance of  stability\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe region, it is difficult to gaze into the crystal ball.  I\r\n\r\nthink they will continue to be here for some time.  What  are\r\n\r\nthe kinds of factors that might have impact on this?  Looking\r\n\r\nat  long  term, I guess we can point to three  factors.   One\r\n\r\nwould  be the domestic mood in the United States.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  there will be a push for isolationism.   But  if\r\n\r\nthere is a mood for retrenchment or cut-back, then that could\r\n\r\naffect the extent to which United States' military troops can\r\n\r\nbe  abroad in various parts of the world.  The second  factor\r\n\r\ncould be, if tensions are eased on the Korean peninsula in  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  way, remote though that may seem to  be  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  then this could have an impact on the United States'\r\n\r\npresence  in  Japan, and that in turn can affect  the  United\r\n\r\nStates'  involvement in the region.  Thirdly, of  course,  is\r\n\r\nthe US-Japan Alliance which is critical.  The alliance, as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, is a strong one, but over time, some have wondered\r\n\r\nwhether  development in both US and Japan  could  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nquestioning  of  this alliance.  Would a  new  generation  of\r\n\r\nleaders  in  Japan look at things in a different way?   These\r\n\r\nare very long-term considerations.  But taking matters as  of\r\n\r\nnow,  I  think  the consensus and expectation of  the  United\r\n\r\nStates'  presence  will  continue  in  the  region  and  most\r\n\r\ncountries  in the region clearly consider the United  States'\r\n\r\npresence in the past has been a critical factor for stability\r\n\r\nand security in the region, and it will continue to be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Thank you, Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia is our closest neighbour in a geographical\r\n\r\nsense.   However,  we  may  not necessarily  be  the  closest\r\n\r\nemotionally   or  politically.   It  has  been  a   love-hate\r\n\r\nrelationship  over  a  period  of  years.   In  the  web   of\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we must therefore expect ups and downs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the general elections behind them, we hope that the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  leaders would be better able to focus on improving\r\n\r\nbilateral ties.  There is some light at the end of the tunnel\r\n\r\non  the CLOB issue.  We have just heard this in this Chamber,\r\n\r\nthough  some  doubt it.  But no solution is yet in  sight  on\r\n\r\nwater, the Malaysian Railway land, airspace and Pedra Branca.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations between Singapore and Malaysia appear to be on\r\n\r\nthe  mend.  We can hope for the best, but we must always  not\r\n\r\nbe taken by surprise by any downturn at any time.  We have to\r\n\r\nlive  with  it.  I hope that Singapore will not again  become\r\n\r\nthe  scapegoat  or  whipping  boy  in  the  forthcoming  UMNO\r\n\r\nAssembly and party elections round the corner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask, in this context, the Minister on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  approach and strategy on how  to  handle  these\r\n\r\nthorny issues in Singapore-Malaysia relationship, and on  how\r\n\r\nproblems of a bilateral kind could be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> \"So near, yet so\r\n\r\nfar.\"   This  saying  perhaps sums up the  Singapore-Malaysia\r\n\r\nrelationship.    Singapore  and  Malaysia   are   next   door\r\n\r\nneighbours.   In  fact,  we  are like  Siamese  twins  linked\r\n\r\ntogether physically by a causeway and a bridge.  Yet, our two\r\n\r\ncountries'  relationship in recent times  has  been  drifting\r\n\r\nfurther  and  further  apart.   I  sincerely  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between Singapore and Malaysia shall  not  drift\r\n\r\neven further apart.  We have drifted apart far enough.  It is\r\n\r\ntime for the two nations to sincerely seek ways and means  to\r\n\r\ncome   closer  together  for  the  mutual  benefit  of   both\r\n\r\ncountries.   Politicians on both sides of the  Causeway  must\r\n\r\ncome  out openly and declare that they want the two countries\r\n\r\nto  cooperate and be friends.  The leaders of both  countries\r\n\r\nhave  talked enough.  It is time for both sides generally  to\r\n\r\nshow  that they want to cooperate and be friends.  For  this,\r\n\r\nboth countries must commit themselves on something concrete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, at one of the Budget debates, suggested that an\r\n\r\neconomic union be established between Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe  Sun,  a newspaper published in Petaling Jaya,  Selangor,\r\n\r\npicked  up  my  suggestion and ran two articles.   The  Sun's\r\n\r\nreport showed that, while university lecturers, academics and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in  Malaysia favoured the idea  of  an  economic\r\n\r\nunion, the Malaysian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoliticians were strongly against the idea.  I do not know if\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  politicians  may  have  wrongly  mistaken  an\r\n\r\neconomic union for a political union.  An economic union does\r\n\r\nnot  involve the independent sovereignty of each state.  Each\r\n\r\nstate   maintains  its  sovereignty.   The   economic   union\r\n\r\nenvisages a lowering or doing away with tariffs.  There shall\r\n\r\nbe  a free movement of goods, services and people within  the\r\n\r\nterritories  of  the  union.   In  this  way,  more  economic\r\n\r\nactivities  shall be generated with more economic growth  for\r\n\r\nboth countries.  Both sides shall benefit economically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an economic union, at this point of time, is too big\r\n\r\na  step  for  the  Malaysian leaders to take,  then  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that the formation of an economic union be put  aside\r\n\r\nfor the time being and both sides agree on something smaller.\r\n\r\nI  would suggest that the Singapore and Malaysian governments\r\n\r\nembark   on  a  joint  project,  something  like  the  Suzhou\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Park in China.  I would suggest that the  project\r\n\r\nbe sited in Johor because of its close proximity to Singapore\r\n\r\nand  its  availability  of land.  Both  sides,  I  hope,  are\r\n\r\nagreeable  in principle and the details can surely be  worked\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea which Singapore can cooperate with Malaysia\r\n\r\nis to extend the MRT line all the way from Woodlands to Senai\r\n\r\nin  Johor, where the Senai Airport is situated.  The  linking\r\n\r\nof the Singapore MRT to Johor would certainly boost movements\r\n\r\nof  people  from  both  sides  of  the  Causeway.   Increased\r\n\r\ncommunication means more business activities.  More  business\r\n\r\nactivities  mean more trade which can be beneficial  to  both\r\n\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above suggestions must never, for a moment, be given\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  impression that Singapore intends to exploit  the\r\n\r\nresources  of Malaysia to enrich itself.  Genuine cooperation\r\n\r\ncannot be for one-sided gain.  It must be for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\nI  hope  both the Malaysian and Singaporean leaders  are  big\r\n\r\nhearted   and  go  for  something  big  to  build  a  genuine\r\n\r\ncooperation  and friendship between the two  countries.   The\r\n\r\npresent outstanding issues like the water agreements and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCLOB  issue shall then look insignificant.  They may not even\r\n\r\nsurface  as issues when real cooperation has been established\r\n\r\nbetween the two countries.  I believe that Singapore must use\r\n\r\nas much of its resources as possible to help Malaysia improve\r\n\r\nits  economy and standard of living.  As long as there  is  a\r\n\r\nwide  disparity  of  standards  of  living  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries, it is difficult for the two neighbours to live  in\r\n\r\nharmony.   Therefore, it is to the interest of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsee  that the Malaysian economy improves as fast as  that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, since last year,\r\n\r\nvarious  leading  indicators  reported  by  Malaysia  clearly\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  our  neighbour was  on  the  way  to  robust\r\n\r\neconomic recovery.  This heartening news was boosted  by  the\r\n\r\nlatest   impressive  growth  figure  of  5.4%  which  further\r\n\r\nconfirmed that the Malaysian economy did well in 1999 and the\r\n\r\npositive trend is expected to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such good news certainly puts all of us in an\r\n\r\noptimistic  mood, including Mr Chiam.  But will  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbe  overly  optimistic  to  look forward  to  improvement  in\r\n\r\nbilateral relations with our neighbour now that the Malaysian\r\n\r\neconomy is looking bouyant?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of years, we have been at the\r\n\r\nreceiving  end  of  too  many  incredulous  accusations   and\r\n\r\nallegations thrown at us from across the Causeway.   We  were\r\n\r\nblamed  for  Malaysia's economic woes,  blamed  for  economic\r\n\r\nsabotage,  blamed  for the CIQ issue,  blamed  for  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nissue,  blamed  for giving too much publicity  to  the  Anwar\r\n\r\ncase.   The  list simply goes on and on.  In fact,  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas become such a regular bogeyman in the Malaysian political\r\n\r\nlandscape  that  I  am  not surprised  if  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nactually come to expect Singapore bashing to be in the nature\r\n\r\nof bilateral relationships between the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would very much like to take a more optimistic\r\n\r\napproach  in Singapore-Malaysia relations.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nthink, as the Malaysian economy improves, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneighbour  would  see  benefit  in  establishing  a   win-win\r\n\r\nrelationship with us, based on mutual cooperation and  mutual\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore greatly disappointed to find my optimism\r\n\r\nmisplaced.  The recent spate of strongly worded letters  from\r\n\r\nMr  Malik  Tahir of Malaysia was a rude shock  and  a  timely\r\n\r\nreminder that some Malaysians still view Singapore with  deep\r\n\r\nacrimony.  Worse, Mr Malik's letters give the impression that\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia   relations  are   perceived   by   Malay-Malaysians  in  racial terms.  His use of emotive  words  and\r\n\r\nphrases like khianat (treason), high animosity, high level of\r\n\r\nhatred  by  many Malay-Malaysians towards Singapore  and  his\r\n\r\npointed  emphasis that Singapore would always  be  a  younger\r\n\r\nbrother  to Malaysia and his undisguised threat that Malaysia\r\n\r\nshould  terminate the water agreement and any other  contract\r\n\r\nthat are good for Singapore, certainly make it difficult  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  respond in any other  way  to  his  letters\r\n\r\nexcept in annoyance and anger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was and am still disturbed by Mr Malik Tahir's\r\n\r\nletter.   Because of the depth of the emotions  expressed,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  help  but  wonder if Mr Malik's letter  typifies  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   feelings  of  Malay-Malaysians  towards  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs might be  able  to\r\n\r\ngive  this  House his Ministry's assessment of this question.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Malik Tahir's letter did typify the general feelings of\r\n\r\nMalay-Malaysians towards Singapore, surely,  this  must  have\r\n\r\nimplications on the way Singapore deals with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like the Minister to keep this\r\n\r\nHouse  current  on  the  present state of  Singapore-Malaysia\r\n\r\nrelations,   particularly  with   respect   to   the   latest\r\n\r\ndevelopment  on the CIQ issue and also on the Singapore-Johor\r\n\r\nbridge   that   the  Malaysians  propose  to  construct.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  from  press reports that the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nbeen  briefed  by the Malaysians during his recent  visit  to\r\n\r\nJohor.   Perhaps, the Minister could give us some details  on\r\n\r\nthe proposed Johor-Singapore bridge as well as to give us  an\r\n\r\nidea\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether Singapore can expect any improvement in the bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations with Malaysia in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, like my colleague before me, I am\r\n\r\nequally  disturbed by Mr Malik Tahir's letter to the Business\r\n\r\nTimes  recently and his commentary on the state of  relations\r\n\r\nwith Malaysia.  In his letter, Mr Tahir sought to explain why\r\n\r\nthere  is,  according to him, a high level  of  hatred  among\r\n\r\nMalay-Malaysians towards Singapore.  I find  the  explanation\r\n\r\ngiven  by  Mr  Tahir somewhat amusing, if not  bizarre.   His\r\n\r\nexplanations,  simply  stated, are  based  on  perception  of\r\n\r\nwrongdoing  on  the  part of Singapore and its  relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of these reasons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he said we published pictures of Anwar in our\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  this seemed like an unfriendly  act,  as  if\r\n\r\nthese  pictures were not published in their local newspapers.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  Mr Tahir said that we sabotaged Malaysian  economy\r\n\r\nby  short-selling, as if he did not realise that this  is  an\r\n\r\nendemic  problem with many stock exchanges around the  world.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  he  said that our failure to control high  interest\r\n\r\nrates  resulted in a flight of capital from the country.   Mr\r\n\r\nTahir  does  not seem to know that our MAS does  not  control\r\n\r\ninterest rates here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tahir's tone in his letter is somewhat for the\r\n\r\nbelligerent.  He made at least two references to war  in  his\r\n\r\nletter.   There  was  also  a cavalier  attitude  about  this\r\n\r\nmessage, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore has chosen through this route of subtle\r\n\r\nannoyance of Malay Malaysians (regardless of whether it is in\r\n\r\nresponse  to Malaysia's initial acts) and we Malay  Malaysian\r\n\r\npanglimas accept the challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  a  subsequent  letter,  Mr Tahir  actually  thought  that\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysian  relations  should  be  premised  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of abang-adik relationship, that is,  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nthe  abang  and  Singapore  is the adik.   This  relationship\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  Singapore must always play the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nhumble  supplicant seeking approval for its conduct from  the\r\n\r\nelder brother at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our repeated explanations, I am saddened\r\n\r\nthat  we  still  have  people like Mr Tahir  expressing  such\r\n\r\nperverse   views   about  our  intentions.    Such   opinions\r\n\r\nunfortunately  arise  at  least  from  a  lack  of   balanced\r\n\r\ninformation  going  to the masses.  I certainly  hope  indeed\r\n\r\nthat the perception and attitude of Mr Tahir is not shared by\r\n\r\nhis  fellow Malaysians.   Mr Tahir must recognise and  accept\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is an independent sovereign country.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  beholden to anyone, neither do we have to be servile  to\r\n\r\nanyone  in  our dealings.  If that is the expectation  of  Mr\r\n\r\nTahir, I am sad to say he will be disappointed indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, is whether the Ministry of Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs is doing more to put clearly across to the Malaysians\r\n\r\nso that we will be better understood.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, Singapore-Malaysia\r\n\r\nrelations  have been described as close neighbours living  in\r\n\r\nsemi-detached houses.  What one neighbour does may affect the\r\n\r\nother.   There  seems to be some truth there judging  by  the\r\n\r\noccasional bickerings and disputes between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a fact of life that even in a close-knit relationship\r\n\r\nthere  would be differences as long as both parties agree  to\r\n\r\nadvance   areas  of  mutual  benefits  and  interests   while\r\n\r\npromoting  individual national interests.  We can  still  see\r\n\r\nprogress in our bilateral relations.  But one thing  must  be\r\n\r\nstressed, that is, our bilateral relations must be  based  on\r\n\r\nmutual  respect  and equality, not one of \"big  brother-small\r\n\r\nbrother\" relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the indignation of our two colleagues, Mr\r\n\r\nCharles Chong and Mr Sin Boon Ann, over the letters and views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  Mr  Malik  Tahir,  a  Malay-Malaysian  in  our\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  I do not think that is the kind of statement  we\r\n\r\nwould like to see from our neighbours and definitely, we look\r\n\r\nforward to a more stable, respectful relationship between our\r\n\r\ntwo  countries.  And what we would like to see least  is  the\r\n\r\nsouring  of  relationship of the ordinary people of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Singapore.  We have seen some progress in our  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations  with  Malaysia with the  settlement  of  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the\r\n\r\noutstanding issues between Singapore and Malaysia  which  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Prime Ministers have agreed to settle as a package.  How\r\n\r\nmuch  progress  have  we  made  in  settling  the  issues  of\r\n\r\ncontinued   water  supply  for  Singapore,  the  CIQ,   joint\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the Tanjong Pagar Railway  Station  and  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Railway Land, claims over Pedra Branca, withdrawal of\r\n\r\nCPF  savings  of  West  Malaysian workers  and  the  use  and\r\n\r\nmanagement of air space?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to think\r\n\r\nand  hope  that  Mr  Malik Tahir does not represent  a  large\r\n\r\nmajority  of  Malaysians.  Neither am I as optimistic  as  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam about our state of bilateral relations with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past one year, relations between Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   in   my  view,  have  been  both  difficult   and\r\n\r\nproblematic.   I think it will continue to be  difficult  and\r\n\r\nunpredictable.   Yet,  when I look at the  Budget  Statement,\r\n\r\nunder  the  operating expenditure budget, while  it  is  made\r\n\r\nspecifically  clear  that  there  will  be  higher  operating\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  international  organisations  and  foreign\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance programme, there is no mention  of  any\r\n\r\nspecific programme or funding, especially on one of our  most\r\n\r\nproblematic areas, relations with our immediate neighbour.  I\r\n\r\nam  asking  for special attention to be given to this  matter\r\n\r\nbecause I think more can and should be done to develop a more\r\n\r\nsustainable people-to-people relationship. While relations at\r\n\r\nthe   political   level  are  important,  it   is   at   best\r\n\r\nunpredictable  as it will be determined largely  by  domestic\r\n\r\nagenda.  Singapore can and has become a convenient  political\r\n\r\nscapegoat.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have a common history with Malaysia, it does\r\n\r\nnot mean that we will continue to see things the same way  or\r\n\r\nfrom  a  similar  perspective as we become more  and  more  a\r\n\r\nproduct  of  our  own distinctly different environment,  that\r\n\r\neven  the  same family with members in Malaysia and Singapore\r\n\r\nwill find that they differ in outlook, attitude, social\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   political  values.   In  my  view,  the  inability   to\r\n\r\nappreciate these differences has been and will continue to be\r\n\r\na   source  of  difficult  problems  between  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think people-to-people relationship can be\r\n\r\nbetter  enhanced.  I suppose we have no other choice  because\r\n\r\none  thing  we  cannot change is our geography.   I  am  also\r\n\r\nrequesting for more and generous funding to institutions like\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  International Foundation  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute  of International Affairs and other civic societies\r\n\r\nso  as  to  allow them to develop programmes that would  help\r\n\r\nbilateral  relations.  New technologies allow civil societies\r\n\r\nto  be better connected and the growth of civil societies  in\r\n\r\nour neighbouring countries makes this a potentially effective\r\n\r\nvehicle to develop better relations between our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, sometimes you need money to make\r\n\r\nfriends,  especially in this instance.  For example,  members\r\n\r\nof  civil  society  can  tell you  how  embarrassing  it  can\r\n\r\nsometimes  be  when  they are unable to reciprocate  visiting\r\n\r\ngroups  from neighbouring countries with the same  generosity\r\n\r\nand  hospitality.   Ironically, for civil  societies,  it  is\r\n\r\nusually easier to obtain funds from foreign institutions than\r\n\r\nfrom  local  donors.  Besides, there are other  uncomfortable\r\n\r\nimplications  for civil societies to obtain foreign  funding.\r\n\r\nWith  more  money, civil societies can help enhance cultural,\r\n\r\neducational  and sports exchange because it is  only  through\r\n\r\npeople  that  we  are  able  to  let  others  have  a  better\r\n\r\nperception  of  us.   Because what  others  think  of  us  is\r\n\r\nimportant, although ultimately, it is who we really are  that\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, a lot of the perceptions of who we are\r\n\r\ndepend  on  what our neighbours hear from their  leaders  and\r\n\r\nwhat  they read in the media.  Very often, this is less  than\r\n\r\ncomplimentary.   For  example,  when  we  meet,  say,  for  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  meeting, for someone who does not have the  benefit\r\n\r\nof   a  personal  relationship,  he  is  more  likely  to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  the  political stance  adopted  by  political\r\n\r\nleaders.  People are going to look for signs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsignals and gestures as an indication of their attention  and\r\n\r\ncommitment to this issue and I therefore urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nallocate  the  required resources through civil societies  to\r\n\r\nenable  a larger group of Singaporeans to be effectively  and\r\n\r\nactively  involved  in  this  process  of  developing  better\r\n\r\nrelations with our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore's relations with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  have improved significantly after  Dr  Habibe  was\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  President Abdul Wahid. We want  to  be  a  good\r\n\r\nneighbour  of  Indonesia, another close  neighbour.  We  wish\r\n\r\nIndonesia  all  the  best,  and  hope  Indonesia,  under  the\r\n\r\nleadership of President Abdul Wahid will have a new beginning\r\n\r\nin the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent crisis, Singapore has willingly given\r\n\r\nsupport  and economic assistance to Indonesia. May I ask  how\r\n\r\nand  to  what extent has the economic package of  loans  been\r\n\r\nutilised?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Indonesian situation has changed radically.\r\n\r\nPresident Abdul Wahid is asserting his leadership vigorously,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  military  is in retreat politically.   There  are\r\n\r\nreligious  riots  and local independence  movements  in  many\r\n\r\nparts  of  Indonesia.  One wonders who would ultimately  call\r\n\r\nthe shots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some analysts have speculated that Indonesia might break\r\n\r\nup,  with  various regions competing for power, for  example,\r\n\r\nAceh  and  Irian  Jaya. I hope not.  We  want  a  stable  and\r\n\r\nprosperous Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for his assessment of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  situation and its impact on  bilateral  relations\r\n\r\nand, furthermore, very recently, very close to our shores, we\r\n\r\nhave  demonstrations and riots in Bintan and  Batam.   Can  I\r\n\r\nknow  how  that  would affect our investments in  the  nearby\r\n\r\nislands?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there is no problem in the\r\n\r\nIndonesia-Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelationship.  It was just going on fine until we read in the\r\n\r\npapers  that  trouble  has erupted  in  Bintan  Island  where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have investments there.  Apparently, the problem\r\n\r\nwas the compensation paid to the villagers for their land was\r\n\r\nnot enough. The villagers want more compensation. They rioted\r\n\r\nand  staged sit-ins and threatened that if their demands were\r\n\r\nnot met, some drastic action shall be taken by them.  Student\r\n\r\nleaders  from  Jakarta took up their cause  and  helped  them\r\n\r\norganise  the sit-ins and their demands for compensation  for\r\n\r\ntheir land.  That incident highlights the serious problem  of\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  Bintan  and  the other  islands  in  the  Riau\r\n\r\nArchipelago.   The  incident alone  highlights  the  seething\r\n\r\nproblems  in Bintan and the other Riau islands. When people's\r\n\r\nstomachs  are  empty, there shall always be problems.  Future\r\n\r\nwould-be  investors may not want to put their money in  those\r\n\r\nislands if the situation in those islands does not improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the situation in the Riau islands\r\n\r\nshall  not  improve since the central Government  has  enough\r\n\r\nproblems  in  its  hands.  We have  read  of  the  break-away\r\n\r\nproblems  in  Aceh and other parts of Indonesia.  Indonesians\r\n\r\nappear  to  have  been  angry at the  Timorese  for  claiming\r\n\r\nindependence  for  themselves.  But at  heart,  they  may  be\r\n\r\nhappier  for not having to continue to subsidise that country\r\n\r\nanymore.   It  is  a  great strain on  their  already  scarce\r\n\r\nfinancial resources to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such are the circumstances in Indonesia, the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  may be amicable to a suggestion by Singapore  to\r\n\r\nlease  to  Singapore  one  of the  Riau  islands  nearest  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  know  this  is a very  sensitive  issue.   If\r\n\r\nwrongly  handled,  it  could  cause  a  lot  of  problems  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's dealings with Indonesia.  Singapore must make  it\r\n\r\nclear  to  Indonesia that it does not want to annex the  Riau\r\n\r\nislands  or  any  of  the nearby islands to  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nsuggestion is purely a business suggestion which can  benefit\r\n\r\nboth parties.  The suggestion is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) One of the main islands, either Bintan or Batam be\r\n\r\nleased to Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor,  say, 99 years or longer at a price to be negotiated  or\r\n\r\nbased   on  a  valuation  by  a  firm  of  land  valuers   of\r\n\r\ninternational repute;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon leasing the island to Singapore, Singapore\r\n\r\nshall have the full charge and control over it which includes\r\n\r\nall security matters; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Indonesian citizens shall be allowed to travel\r\n\r\nfreely  in  and out of the island so that they shall  not  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of working there or start business in that  island,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  right  by Singapore to  stop  criminals  or\r\n\r\ntrouble-makers and bad elements from entering the island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if such an arrangement can be made, the economic\r\n\r\nbenefits  accruing to that island and the ripple  effects  to\r\n\r\nthe  neighbours shall be tremendous.  Singapore  is  a  small\r\n\r\nisland  and  needs  more land for its population  growth  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is  cash-strapped. The leasing of  one  island  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  beneficial to both countries  and  it  can  be\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a win-win situation. The Indonesians  must  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  move  as  Singapore wanting to colonise  the  Riau\r\n\r\nArchipelago, or to win concessions from them.  But  it  is  a\r\n\r\npurely  business view between two countries and  they  should\r\n\r\ntake it in that light.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, let me touch on the recent\r\n\r\nsituation   in   Bintan  in  respect  of  Singapore-Indonesia\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent riots in Bintan is a setback for Indonesia in\r\n\r\nits bid to attract more foreign investors into the country to\r\n\r\nplay  its part in economic recovery.  It is unfortunate  that\r\n\r\nforeign parties with investment in that island got caught  up\r\n\r\nin what appears to be a domestic issue, that is, the people's\r\n\r\nunhappiness with the compensation given by a local party  for\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of their land. Some quarters have pointed  to  the\r\n\r\nshady  outside  hands being involved as part of  the  overall\r\n\r\nplan  to  destabilise President Abdurrahman  Wahid's  regime.\r\n\r\nThe truth may, however, never be known.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riots raised serious concerns over the ability of\r\n\r\nthe Government to provide safety and security for the foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors. The Indonesian Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  asked us for assistance in procuring foreign investments\r\n\r\nfor  the country.  Unfortunately, the recent riots in  Bintan\r\n\r\nhave failed to inspire much confidence in investors.  If  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to promote Singaporeans'  investment  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia in general, and in Riau in particular, there  is  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding duty, I believe, on the part of our  Government\r\n\r\nto  seek  more solid assurance from the Indonesian Government\r\n\r\nthat  law  and safety to both life and property will  not  be\r\n\r\nplaced at risk through riots and mayhem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that our policy has always been one of\r\n\r\nnon-interference with the way others govern and manage  their\r\n\r\ninternal  problems.   However, in this  instance,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere is some expectation from foreign investors on the  part\r\n\r\nof the Indonesian Government to do more to protect investors.\r\n\r\nUnlike Mr Chiam, and I do not think the solution is to  lease\r\n\r\nthe island from the Indonesian Government because, apart from\r\n\r\nleasing  the  island,  you have to deal  with  the  long-term\r\n\r\nproblem  of people inhabiting the island for long periods  of\r\n\r\ntime.  And what to do when the island finally reverts to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment  has  given  our Government  better  assurance  of\r\n\r\nprotection of life and property and, if so, what details have\r\n\r\nbeen decided upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, in the case of\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia  relations,  I  asked  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs for time, money and effort to  assist  civil\r\n\r\nsociety to bridge people-to-people relationship.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  Indonesia, the situation is such that I can only ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  more time, more money and more help  to  civil\r\n\r\nsociety to do exactly the same.  I think civil society has  a\r\n\r\nlarge  capacity, will and enthusiasm to help.   But  I  think\r\n\r\nmoney in the pocket will really help.  We have seen how civil\r\n\r\nsociety  groups,  like  UNIFEM, that  is  a  group  of  local\r\n\r\ndoctors,  have helped, on their own initiative  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchronic needs of medicine and food in places like Bintan.  So\r\n\r\nI  can  only  repeat  my call for the Minister  to  give  his\r\n\r\nspecial attention to civil society groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> It is widely believed that the\r\n\r\npolitical   situation  in  Indonesia,  one  of  our   closest\r\n\r\nneighbours, has improved since the Presidential election  was\r\n\r\nheld  at  the  end of 1999. The fear of a military  coup  has\r\n\r\nsubsided  the  racial and religious strife in  the  different\r\n\r\nareas  in Indonesia has reduced somewhat and the economy  has\r\n\r\nshown  signs of recovery.  But Singaporeans have  reasons  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  concerned about the  political  development\r\n\r\nthere as political and economic instability in Indonesia will\r\n\r\nhave  implications on the stability and economic  development\r\n\r\nof our region, and indeed Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that similar questions have been asked before but\r\n\r\nconsidering  the importance of the issue to Singapore,  would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  give  his  assessment  of  the  political  and\r\n\r\nsecurity situation in Indonesia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move to the situation in Batam and Bintan, where\r\n\r\nmuch of the investments from Singapore is located.  With  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial Singaporean investments in Bintan and  Batam,  it\r\n\r\nwas  with  concern  that  I read the  press  reports  on  the\r\n\r\nthreatening  situation in Bintan just a little  more  than  a\r\n\r\nmonth ago, and I listened to questions raised and answered on\r\n\r\nthe  issue  in our last Parliamentary debate in February.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with the Minister for Trade and Industry that much  of\r\n\r\nthe  solution  to what happened in Bintan and,  I  would  add\r\n\r\nBatam  too, depends on the Indonesian government.   I  am  in\r\n\r\nadmiration of the strength of President Abdurrahman Wahid  in\r\n\r\nfacing the herculean task of forging a new path for Indonesia\r\n\r\nin  the  aftermath of not only the economic crisis, but  also\r\n\r\nthe  adjustment to a new political era.  I have no doubt that\r\n\r\nhe would prevail given time and the support of his people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that, even when the President succeeds to\r\n\r\nstabilise  this  situation, we will face the  situation  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  changes  that occur in the political  landscape  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia may impact, in varying degrees, on the two  islands\r\n\r\nand  on Singapore investors there.  In seeking protection for\r\n\r\nour investors, perhaps, we could look at ways whereby\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government could assist in some way to limit the  impact\r\n\r\nof   political  ripples  in  Indonesia  on  investments  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the two governments work out an arrangement that\r\n\r\ncould  help our investors operate in a condition of sustained\r\n\r\npeace  and  stability where investments are  given  an  added\r\n\r\nprotection? This arrangement, I believe, should benefit  both\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia, and the workers on the two  islands.\r\n\r\nNeedless  to say, for Singaporeans, there is added protection\r\n\r\nand an assurance that these problems will not recur.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, before I proceed, can I seek\r\n\r\nyour permission to seek some clarification from Mr Chiam  who\r\n\r\nhas  made two very interesting proposals today?

May I ask whether  he  proposes  to\r\n\r\nlease  the  island  first or to have an economic  union  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  first?  And does he realise that it is so difficult\r\n\r\njust  to operate an industrial park, whether it is in Bintan,\r\n\r\nBatam  or Suzhou?  How then does he propose to lease a  whole\r\n\r\nisland  from  an  independent  and  sovereign  country   like\r\n\r\nIndonesia  which has tremendous pride in its own country  and\r\n\r\nsovereignty?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, when he spoke about an economic union with\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  he  seems  to blame Singapore  for  having  a  gap\r\n\r\nbetween   Singapore's  standard  of  living  and   Malaysia's\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living.  Are we to be blamed if the  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nstandard  of living is lower than that of Singapore?   Is  he\r\n\r\nproposing that we Singaporeans lower our standard of  living,\r\n\r\nso  that  we are on the same common denominator as Malaysia's\r\n\r\nstandard  of living so that there will not be any problem  of\r\n\r\nany kind?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, do you wish to reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am thinking of the long-term\r\n\r\neffects  of  our relations with our neighbours.

As  regards\r\n\r\nour  present  relationship with Malaysia, we have  found   no\r\n\r\nsolution  at all to any of the outstanding issues.   Not  one\r\n\r\nissue has been resolved.  Why is that so?  It would appear to\r\n\r\nbe  more politically motivated than really wanting to  settle\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and  be good neighbours.  I think  that  is  our\r\n\r\nproblem.   We must find ways and means of having a  long-term\r\n\r\nstable  and good relationship with our neighbours.

ASEAN's credibility had been dented as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of its failure to respond to the economic turmoil  in\r\n\r\n1997-1998 and was an issue our own Prime Minister and Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  Minister had publicly alluded to at ASEAN  meetings.\r\n\r\nIt  is essential and urgent that all 10 ASEAN members address\r\n\r\nthe problem head on to restore confidence in the organisation\r\n\r\nand  the  region.

Sir,  each  ASEAN  country  also\r\n\r\nresponded  to  their crisis with different  solutions.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  it  appeared as if ASEAN, as a  regional  body,\r\n\r\neither  did  not or could not react fast enough  to  aid  its\r\n\r\nmember nations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sense that each country acted independently\r\n\r\nand  all  thoughts for regionalism were put in cold  storage,\r\n\r\nonly to be taken out at a more convenient time.  In contrast,\r\n\r\njust  prior to the crisis, ASEAN regionalism appeared at  its\r\n\r\nstrongest  and  this was coupled with ASEAN's expansion  from\r\n\r\nsix  to  nine,  and then 10 members.  Despite  the  different\r\n\r\neconomic levels of development of the new members from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  original six, it seems that ASEAN  was  strong\r\n\r\nenough to adapt to these circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these recent events in mind, ASEAN states are\r\n\r\npoised for steady growth.  What lessons have ASEAN drawn from\r\n\r\nthe economic crisis and what are the prospects of ASEAN as  a\r\n\r\nregional  body in the 21st century.  In addition,  Sir,  what\r\n\r\nwere   the   highlights  of  achievements  of  ASEAN   during\r\n\r\nSingapore's  tenure as ASEAN Standing Committee  Chairman  in\r\n\r\n1999?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to Myanmar, with its admission into\r\n\r\nASEAN,  despite  strong objections from the  US  and  Europe,\r\n\r\nASEAN  states  went  ahead with the  policy  of  constructive\r\n\r\nengagements  believing  that  an  international  solution  of\r\n\r\nMyanmar  would  have  the opposite effect  on  any  hope  for\r\n\r\npolitical  change  in the country.  In the last  three  years\r\n\r\nsince   Myanmar  joined  ASEAN,  has  ASEAN  been   able   to\r\n\r\nsuccessfully engage Myanmar?  What are the changes that  have\r\n\r\ntaken place in Myanmar that are in line with the objective of\r\n\r\nASEAN in admitting Myanmar into ASEAN?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)\r\n\r\nis  an  important  security  architecture  for  multi-lateral\r\n\r\nsecurity   cooperation   and  dialogue.    ARF   has   firmly\r\n\r\nestablished   the   mechanism  for  security   dialogue   and\r\n\r\nconfidence-building measures within the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARF also plays a pivotal role in relation with the\r\n\r\nexternal  powers,  like the United States, China  and  Japan.\r\n\r\nIndeed, some of these external powers use the ARF sessions to\r\n\r\nmeet each other and to float ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Desmond Ball of the Australian National University\r\n\r\nwrote recently that the ARF has emerged as the centrepiece of\r\n\r\nsecurity  architecture in the region.  So far, so good.   But\r\n\r\nARF  should  move  beyond security dialogue  and  confidence-building  measures  to the next stage of conflict  prevention\r\n\r\nand  preventive  diplomacy, whereby  incipient  problems  are\r\n\r\nnipped in the bud.  May I ask if the Minister would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactively  encourage  ARF to take on new  directions  and  new\r\n\r\nroles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the ARF has evolved as an informal,\r\n\r\nconsultative  and  consensus  building  forum.   Its  biggest\r\n\r\ncontribution has been enhancing  confidence among its members\r\n\r\nand its dialogue partners.  The ARF has also played a pivotal\r\n\r\nrole  in  keeping the large powers engaged in a  consultative\r\n\r\nmood.   I  was  happy to hear from the Minister earlier  that\r\n\r\npartners  who would not on their own accord meet and  discuss\r\n\r\nproblems have met during the meetings at the ARF.  So what  I\r\n\r\nwould  want to ask the Minister is: can the ARF progress  and\r\n\r\ntake  on  the  role  of  preventive  diplomacy  and  conflict\r\n\r\nresolution?    Could the Minister also give us an  update  on\r\n\r\nthe ARF held last year and the future direction of the ARF?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to focus on the progress in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the ASEAN Regional Forum  (ARF) and the  practice\r\n\r\nof   preventive  diplomacy,  suggestions  which  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already said how important it is for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to have a peaceful region.  When there  was  peace\r\n\r\nthere were long uninterrupted years of rapid growth.  In  the\r\n\r\ncrisis,   there  was  greater  instability  and  uncertainty.\r\n\r\nEconomics and security go together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small state, there are limits to what we can do on\r\n\r\nour own.  Multilateralism is therefore very important, and so\r\n\r\nis  the  ARF.  It complements but does not replace  bilateral\r\n\r\nsecurity  arrangements.  Nor is the ARF a  military  alliance\r\n\r\nlike  NATO  in  Europe.   It  uses  discussion  and  dialogue\r\n\r\ninstead. The aim is to deepen understanding  and ties between\r\n\r\nthe  nations, and to reinforce the habit of settling disputes\r\n\r\npeaceably,  and of managing disputes so they do  not  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place erupt into violence.  Others have already  asked\r\n\r\nabout the ARF last year.  I hope the Minister will share  his\r\n\r\nthoughts.   I  want to propose something to the Minister  and\r\n\r\nconsider  the  practice  of  preventive  diplomacy  and   how\r\n\r\nSingapore can play its role in pushing this forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive diplomacy is a set of diplomatic measures\r\n\r\nthat,  without  the use of force, seeks to prevent  conflicts\r\n\r\nfrom   turning   violent,  or  incidents  of  violence   from\r\n\r\nescalating  further.   The practices of preventive  diplomacy\r\n\r\ninclude  early detection and warning of rising  conflict  and\r\n\r\ntensions, the use of fact-finding missions and the  offer  of\r\n\r\ngood offices and mediation by third parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Minister will agree these are\r\n\r\nlaudable  aims.   If  the ARF can take  up  the  practice  of\r\n\r\npreventive diplomacy, it would be a great step forward  to  a\r\n\r\nnew  stage  in  this  young  institution.   It  would  be  an\r\n\r\nimportant  step forward generally in our favour, as  a  small\r\n\r\nstate in a world of much bigger states.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister, therefore, to commit our\r\n\r\ncountry  to making progress on this issue.  We should support\r\n\r\npreventive diplomacy in principle, and more can and should be\r\n\r\ndone.   We  should  support  the  development  of  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy  by  helping  initiate the necessary  institutions.\r\n\r\nThere  are two of these that deserve early attention.  First,\r\n\r\nwould  be  an  effort  to build systems and  programmes  that\r\n\r\nexamine  the roots of conflict and look out into  the  future\r\n\r\nfor flash points, like a satellite looking out over the earth\r\n\r\nbelow.   Second, is a system of consulting fellow ARF members\r\n\r\nin  between  annual meeting, as and when danger  signs  rise.\r\n\r\nTogether, early warning and consultation would help  us  look\r\n\r\nforward  ahead  and try to gain consensus  on  what  can  and\r\n\r\nshould be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, Sir, will take considerable effort and some\r\n\r\nfunding.  But they are, I believe, worth doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I hope the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  should  set an example.  It  should  show  a\r\n\r\nwillingness to undertake the practice of preventive diplomacy\r\n\r\nwhen  appropriate.   We cannot in this regard  stand  by  the\r\n\r\nsidelines when problems arise.  We should show commitment  to\r\n\r\nhelping  within  the constraints of our human  resources  and\r\n\r\nnumbers.  Our commitment should be exemplary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may recall that in 1998, on a previous\r\n\r\noccasion  in  this House, I debated on the issue of  Cambodia\r\n\r\nwith  him.   I  called  on  the Minister  to  send  a  larger\r\n\r\ncontingent  to  observe and help ensure  the  safe  and  fair\r\n\r\nconduct  of the Cambodian elections. Singapore met  with  the\r\n\r\nminimum  number  suggested  by  the  UN.   But  the  Minister\r\n\r\ndeclined my suggestion to do more in that case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, I was glad to observe our support, much\r\n\r\nmore  fulsome  support, for our multilateral  force  in  East\r\n\r\nTimor.   I  would encourage the Minister to do more. Together\r\n\r\nwith  our  ASEAN  partners, though we are  mainly  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium sized states, we can take positive and proactive steps\r\n\r\nto prevent the outbreak of violence and to police the peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a great power, Sir. There are things that we\r\n\r\ncan  do in concert with others.  Indeed, in many cases, small\r\n\r\nand  medium  sized states are able to do better in prevention\r\n\r\nbecause,  by  our nature, when such smaller states  offer  to\r\n\r\nmediate  or undertake fact-finding missions, we are  hard  to\r\n\r\naccuse of having ulterior motives or to try to exercise undue\r\n\r\npressures on other states.  Preventive diplomacy, as such, is\r\n\r\nsuitable for the small and the neutral, and we should take up\r\n\r\nthis role where we can in the ARF, be willing to prepare  and\r\n\r\nprovide   support for institutions and practices and do  what\r\n\r\nwe can for our region, and therefore ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, ASEAN-EU relations have gone\r\n\r\nthrough  a rough patch.  ASEAN wishes to be close friends  of\r\n\r\nthe  Europeans.   However, meetings are  always  held  up  or\r\n\r\nbogged  down by the Europeans' stand on Myanmar.  Very often,\r\n\r\ndouble standards are applied.  ASEAN, on the other hand,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  consistent  and  operated on the  basis  of  unity  and\r\n\r\nconsensus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether he could persuade the\r\n\r\nEuropeans to come to our point of view.  The message is  that\r\n\r\nmultilateral  relations should not be held  hostage  by  some\r\n\r\nbureaucratic or misguided conception, and we should let  long\r\n\r\nterm interests prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, as mentioned by Dr Ong, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  ASEAN-EU relations have been complicated  by\r\n\r\nMyanmar's membership in ASEAN since 1997. The EU has objected\r\n\r\nto Myanmar's presence in any ASEAN delegation in its dealings\r\n\r\nwith the EU.  Could the Minister brief the House on the state\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN-EU relations and tell us when and where  would  the\r\n\r\nnext ASEAN-EU meeting take place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister foresee further complications in the\r\n\r\nrelations  as  a result of Austria's Freedom  Party  being  a\r\n\r\ncoalition  member  of the Austrian Government,  and   Austria\r\n\r\nbeing  an  EU  member,  would  ASEAN  member  countries  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  granting  visas to an  EU  delegation  comprising\r\n\r\nmembers of Austria's Freedom Party?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran is not speaking. Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, in talking about the United Nations,\r\n\r\nit  is  well  known that we are attempting to secure  a  non-Permanent  seat  in  the  Security  Council  for   the   year\r\n\r\n2000/2001.   In previous sittings, the Minister has  reported\r\n\r\nand  updated  us on the progress in achieving  the  necessary\r\n\r\npolitical support for the achievement of this voted seat.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  first time if we succeed that we  are  on  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council is, of course, a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  body   in the United Nations.  At  this  point,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like the Minister to go beyond politically forecasting\r\n\r\nwhether we will or will not get the seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw the Minister out on what it is that\r\n\r\nSingapore can contribute, if and when it becomes a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Security Council.  I ask this particularly  because  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  the Security Council relates chiefly  to  the\r\n\r\nability  of  the states to contribute towards the maintenance\r\n\r\nof  international peace and security, as the  name  \"Security\r\n\r\nCouncil\"  implies.  In this context, does a small state  like\r\n\r\nSingapore have a role to play?  I myself think we can do  so.\r\n\r\nWe   have   a   role  in  peace-keeping,  we   have   standby\r\n\r\narrangements.   I would like the Minister to spend some  time\r\n\r\ntelling us how it is that a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmall  state  like  Singapore can play in such  an  important\r\n\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to the role of the Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  making  law. Decisions of the  Security  Council\r\n\r\nunder  Chapter  7  of the UN Charter can be  binding  on  all\r\n\r\nnations.   Sir, in the thaw after the Cold War, the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  has actually produced many more resolutions than  in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  These resolutions have been criticised often  for\r\n\r\nbeing partial, selective and sometimes not thought out enough\r\n\r\nand  given enough resources to be actually effective  on  the\r\n\r\nground.   Will Singapore take on these resolutions?  Will  we\r\n\r\ntake  the principle, the moral stand, or will we tend  to  go\r\n\r\nalong with the bigger powers, because they are after all  the\r\n\r\nbigger powers with the veto?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I join Mr Simon Tay in\r\n\r\ndiscussing  Singapore's bid for a seat  on  the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  for the year 2001.  Can the Minister assure us  that\r\n\r\nwe have a good chance of clinching the seat?\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that a seat on the UN Security Council\r\n\r\nwill  give  us  important mileage, better access  to  various\r\n\r\ncountries, and more importantly, insights on how the Security\r\n\r\nCouncil functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience will stand us in good stead when there\r\n\r\nis a crisis in the region or when we run into some problem or\r\n\r\nthe other.  And also I would like to ask the Minister, if  he\r\n\r\ncould  take  this  opportunity to give training  for  younger\r\n\r\nForeign  Service  Officers to be involved  in  this,  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular when we have a seat in the UN Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin is not here. Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the need to\r\n\r\nreview   Singapore's  policy  in  providing   technical   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment assistance to other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us are aware that as Singapore's income has\r\n\r\nincreased, so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave   calls   to  increase  our  donations  to  multilateral\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions  and  development   agencies.    Our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  generally not done  so.   We  have  taken  a\r\n\r\ndifferent approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of money, Singapore has in recent years\r\n\r\nincreased  our efforts to make greater contributions  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   through  training  and  capacity  building.    In\r\n\r\nparticular,  our  programme to provide technical  cooperation\r\n\r\nand  assistance to other countries has grown.   I  understand\r\n\r\nsome 1,200 foreigners or so have come to Singapore under this\r\n\r\nscheme of late.  This scheme should continue and grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, urge the Ministry to consider other and\r\n\r\nadditional   ways  of  providing  technical  and  development\r\n\r\nassistance.  There are several reasons for this.  Let me just\r\n\r\ntouch on two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that our training programmes are very\r\n\r\nlabour  intensive.  Quite typically, we attach these trainees\r\n\r\nto  a  Government  department, such as the HDB  or  the  port\r\n\r\nauthorities,  in  order for them to  observe.   This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  an  important approach.  It is  practical  but  very\r\n\r\nlabour  intensive.  The effort made is considerable  and  can\r\n\r\nsometimes  distract  the operations of these  very  important\r\n\r\nagencies.  As such, there are limits on how many we can train\r\n\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason we should do things differently is\r\n\r\nthat our present policy is open to misunderstanding.  This is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  training  tends to happen  here  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThus, the funds that we do provide are largely spent here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for lodging, and for other costs.  This is open  to\r\n\r\ncriticism  by others as \"tied aid\", that is to  say,  we  are\r\n\r\nhelping  our  own economy when we help others.  This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not our intention, I believe.  It is the  nature  of\r\n\r\ntraining, but it can be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons for us to consider new and\r\n\r\nadditional  ways  of providing assistance.   In  making  this\r\n\r\ncall,  I  am,  of  course, mindful of  the  interdependencies\r\n\r\nbetween our country and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nothers,   as  certainly  it  was  featured  in  the   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's   Budget   Statement.   From   the   crisis,   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans understand that when Indonesia or others in  the\r\n\r\nregion do poorly, we will also be affected.  We can also  see\r\n\r\nthat positive steps are taken forward, such as the ASEAN Free\r\n\r\nTrade  Area (AFTA) and ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) agreement,\r\n\r\nand    we   should   also   benefit.    When   we   recognise\r\n\r\ninterdependencies, we would stand to gain more by doing  more\r\n\r\nto help others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean we should throw money at these problems,\r\n\r\nSir.   The  world has come a long way in rethinking  the  way\r\n\r\nricher  countries help.  But we should not think in terms  of\r\n\r\nbandage  or charity.  We should do more so that we  serve  as\r\n\r\ntrue  partners to our neighbours.  There is much for our good\r\n\r\nin  the longer term, as for theirs.  In this partnership,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to ask our partners to see the need to help themselves,\r\n\r\neven as we do what we can to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeting assistance to specific areas is important.\r\n\r\nTrade  and  investment  too are important.   Private  capital\r\n\r\nflows  today  are much larger than government  to  government\r\n\r\nassistance.   So  we  should  encourage  the  right  economic\r\n\r\npolicies and put them in place.  But in the shorter  term,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister will see that some of these countries will\r\n\r\nlose revenues when they try to put the right policy in place.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is resistance to these policies which  will\r\n\r\nbenefit them in the longer run.  So Singapore should do  what\r\n\r\nwe  can  to  encourage and enable our neighbours to undertake\r\n\r\nthe right policy reforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many innovations that other countries are\r\n\r\nreviewing.   Sweden,  for  example, has  only  recently  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  this  process,  to develop new  policies  for  their\r\n\r\nassistance  overseas.  Our own country has  been  encouraging\r\n\r\nassistance to the less developed countries, both in ASEAN  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in  the WTO.  Sir, a bit like NMP Dr  Jennifer  Lee\r\n\r\nearlier,  I am not asking the Minister to say yes  or  no  at\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint  in time.  What I am asking is for a study and that  we\r\n\r\nre-look  at this policy.  This is particularly so because  it\r\n\r\nhas been about a decade since we stepped up our programme for\r\n\r\ntechnical  cooperation and establish  a  directorate  in  his\r\n\r\nMinistry for this purpose.  Much has changed in the world  in\r\n\r\nthe  last 10 years.  Among these are new initiatives such  as\r\n\r\nAFTA  and AIA, as well as the enlargement of ASEAN itself  to\r\n\r\ninclude newer and much less developed members.  Singapore too\r\n\r\nhas  taken on a new profile, a higher profile in the  UN  and\r\n\r\nthe WTO.  I hope for these reasons the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nundertaking a fuller review of our existing policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the final item of debate on the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs' budget will bring some cheer  to\r\n\r\nour  Foreign Service staff and officers.  It is not really  a\r\n\r\nbudget cut as such, but really a boost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Foreign Service Officers constitute the core of\r\n\r\nour  diplomatic representation overseas.  There are now  many\r\n\r\nalternative  careers for bright, young graduates coming  into\r\n\r\nthe  market.  The Foreign Service's terms and conditions must\r\n\r\ntherefore be attractive enough to enable the Foreign Ministry\r\n\r\nto  recruit  and retain the best graduates to  serve  in  its\r\n\r\nranks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also make it easier for our diplomats to educate\r\n\r\ntheir children when they are posted overseas.  Upon return to\r\n\r\nSingapore, they should not be disadvantaged in finding places\r\n\r\nfor  their  children in Singapore schools.  Also particularly\r\n\r\nimportant, the children must be prepared for second languages\r\n\r\nas they have to come back to Singapore eventually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Foreign Service Officers should also be given\r\n\r\nextensive training in foreign languages, so that they can  be\r\n\r\neffective when they are posted overseas.  I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  what  are the schemes or incentives  for  such\r\n\r\nforeign language training in Singapore for our staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  my  Minister, allow me to answer the questions raised  on\r\n\r\nSingapore-Philippines relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Philippines relations today are excellent and\r\n\r\nwarm.   Bilateral interaction, exchanges, visits and economic\r\n\r\ncooperation have intensified to surpass the pre-Contemplacion\r\n\r\nlevel.   Political  relations have also  improved.   This  is\r\n\r\nmanifested  in the good rapport and high comfort  level  that\r\n\r\nexist  between key leaders of the two countries.  PM Goh  has\r\n\r\nbeen  to the Philippines three times in the last four  years,\r\n\r\nmost  recently to attend the third ASEAN Informal Summit last\r\n\r\nNovember,  and  President  Estrada  paid  a  state  visit  to\r\n\r\nSingapore in October 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Minister has a good working relationship with\r\n\r\nPhilippines Foreign Secretary Mr Domingo Siazon who came here\r\n\r\non  an official visit in late January/February.  Last but not\r\n\r\nleast,  a  major milestone was the decision of both countries\r\n\r\nto  launch a Philippine-Singapore Action Plan (PSAP)  to  put\r\n\r\nthe bilateral relationship on a more solid footing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine-Singapore Action Plan, if I may elaborate\r\n\r\non  that, having strong and broad-based linkages, will reduce\r\n\r\nthe  susceptibility of relationship as a whole being  wrought\r\n\r\nby  any  single  bilateral issue.  The idea of  the  PSAP  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  comprehensive framework of bilateral  cooperation\r\n\r\nunder  which  we could work together to diversify,  intensify\r\n\r\nand institutionalise bilateral linkages arose during PM Goh's\r\n\r\nofficial  visit  to the Philippines in June 1997.   The  PSAP\r\n\r\nproposal  was elaborated upon and formally endorsed  on  14th\r\n\r\nDecember  1998 at the sideline of the sixth ASEAN  Summit  in\r\n\r\nHanoi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSAP covers cooperation in the areas of trade and\r\n\r\ninvestment,   information  technology,  education,   culture,\r\n\r\ndefence and people-to-people exchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMuch  has  been achieved in bilateral cooperation  under  the\r\n\r\nPSAP.  For example, the Singapore TDB mounted seven trade and\r\n\r\ninvestment  promotion  missions  to  the  Philippines   while\r\n\r\nSingapore  also hosted several visits by business delegations\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Philippines  Economic Zone Authority  and  various\r\n\r\nFilipino chambers of  commerce and business clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Memorandum of Understanding on IT Cooperation was also\r\n\r\nsigned  in  July 1999 during the visit of Minister for  Trade\r\n\r\nand   Industry  BG  George  Yeo  to  the  Philippines.    New\r\n\r\nmechanisms have been set up between agencies from both sides,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  between  MTI  and  the  Philippine  Board   of\r\n\r\nInvestments,  or between the NCB (which is now  renamed  IDA)\r\n\r\nand the Philippine's Department of Science and Technology, to\r\n\r\nbetter  consider  and  coordinate  bilateral  cooperation  in\r\n\r\ntargeted areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance educational exchanges, Singapore's Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education has made a visit to the Philippines last August\r\n\r\nto  explore  new  initiatives, and MOE has  also  awarded  20\r\n\r\nSecondary Three scholarships under the PSAP.  As part of  the\r\n\r\npeople-to-people exchanges to improve understanding  of  each\r\n\r\nother's  way  of life, there has been exchange of  visits  by\r\n\r\nsenior  pathologists from both countries, while a  number  of\r\n\r\njournalists from the Philippines have also visited  Singapore\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, both countries are also working on a\r\n\r\nproposal, which President Estrada had raised during his state\r\n\r\nvisit  to Singapore, to set up a centre in Singapore to cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  recreational  and  vocational  training  needs   of\r\n\r\nFilipino   workers   in  Singapore.   Singapore   has   since\r\n\r\nidentified a site that could be used to set up such a centre,\r\n\r\nand we are now discussing with the Philippines authorities on\r\n\r\nthe steps it may take to operationalise the use of the site.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are about two or three minutes\r\n\r\nleft.
