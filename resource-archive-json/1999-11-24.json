Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, can I have your permission to answer the three Questions\r\n\r\ntogether,  including the Question addressed to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development who has asked me to answer  on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf as they are all related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, the Member's Questions reflect\r\n\r\nhis  concern  about  recent press reports on  en-bloc  sales.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  reports of several en-bloc sale proposals  are\r\n\r\nactually not surprising.  The Government first announced  its\r\n\r\nintention to review the need for unanimous consent for strata\r\n\r\ndevelopments   in  November  1997.   There  was  considerable\r\n\r\ninterest  in en-bloc sales because of the upward revision  in\r\n\r\nthe plot ratios.  This meant that the land can be redeveloped\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  intensive use, thus increasing the land  value.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  need to move away from the 100%  or  unanimous\r\n\r\nconsent  requirement to facilitate the redevelopment of  land\r\n\r\nto maximise its use and economic potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will recall that we took time and care in\r\n\r\ncrafting  the  legislation.  The Bill went through  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  and was passed at the Third Reading in this  House\r\n\r\non  4th May 1999.  It was brought into force recently on 11th\r\n\r\nOctober 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this 2-year period, those who were keen on\r\n\r\nselling   en-bloc  sales  were  waiting  to  see  the   final\r\n\r\nprovisions of the law before proceeding.  Therefore, what  we\r\n\r\nare  really seeing now are those proposals which had been put\r\n\r\non  hold  during  the last 2 years, pending  passage  of  the\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that while some of the en-bloc sale\r\n\r\nproposals have been transacted, other proposals are still  on\r\n\r\ntender  and  are  still awaiting a response  from  interested\r\n\r\nparties.  The Government does not prescribe the sale.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  choice of the owners.  Whether an en-bloc sale  proceeds\r\n\r\nwill depend on whether there is a convergence of interests of\r\n\r\nthe owners as well as the buyers where there is a price which\r\n\r\nthe owners are happy to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific questions posed by the Member, firstly,\r\n\r\nas  to  his question about correcting the unhealthy trend  of\r\n\r\ngreed  associated with en-bloc sales, obviously,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of opinion, depending on how one looks at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the majority owners, they are simply realising the\r\n\r\nworth  of  their  assets because of the change  in  the  plot\r\n\r\nratio.   The  higher  plot ratio gives  them  the  choice  of\r\n\r\nselling  the whole land with a higher premium for each  owner\r\n\r\nthan if they were to sell their units individually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendment on en-bloc sales by majority\r\n\r\nconsent,  a  small minority, even only one, could  block  the\r\n\r\nsale.    This   often   led  to  strained   and   acrimonious\r\n\r\nrelationships.  For example, in the case of Kim Lin Mansions,\r\n\r\nwhich  representors  in  the  Select  Committee  spoke  about\r\n\r\nunhappiness   amongst  the  owners  over  the  blocked   sale\r\n\r\nculminated in a court\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase.   With the announcement of the proposed amendments, the\r\n\r\ncourt case was withdrawn, thus avoiding a long, expensive and\r\n\r\nbitter court proceeding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member asked about threats against owners\r\n\r\nwho  do  not  wish  to give consent.  If an  owner  has  been\r\n\r\nthreatened into giving his consent, such consent would not be\r\n\r\nvalid  in law.  If the Strata Titles Board is satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthe  consent was not given voluntarily, then the Board  would\r\n\r\ntake  this  into account in determining whether the  required\r\n\r\nlevel  of consent has been attained.  Furthermore, those  who\r\n\r\nare  threatened could also lodge a police report  or  make  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  before  a Magistrate for the issue  of  a  private\r\n\r\nsummons for criminal intimidation under the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to his question on the action taken against\r\n\r\nowners who have neglected maintenance of their buildings, the\r\n\r\nBuilding and Construction Authority will take action  against\r\n\r\nManagement  Corporations and owners who neglect  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  buildings  or fail to comply with any  notice  of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Building Control to engage  a  professional\r\n\r\nengineer  to  inspect their buildings for structural  safety,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether the owners are anticipating an  en-bloc\r\n\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

These\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Unlawful alteration of vehicles and trailers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Keeping or using unregistered vehicles;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Failure by a resident of Singapore to inform the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  his  possession or use of a foreign-registered\r\n\r\nvehicle;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Failure by a registered owner to produce proof of\r\n\r\nscrap   or  export  within  1  month  upon  cancellation   of\r\n\r\nregistration of a vehicle by the Registrar;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Making false statements, forging licences, furnishing\r\n\r\nfalse particulars; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. Using another vehicle mark, plate or documents,\r\n\r\nforging  a mark, plate or document or using them, and driving\r\n\r\nor permitting an off-peak car to be driven with a tampered or\r\n\r\naltered supplementary licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quanta of maximum fines for the 6 offences were set\r\n\r\nmany  years ago . The fines need to be raised in view of  the\r\n\r\nrelative  severity of these offences and the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of cases has been rising over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite some statistics, the number of cases for keeping\r\n\r\nor  using an unregistered vehicle has risen from 69 cases  in\r\n\r\n1995,  to an average of 76 cases each year from 1996 to 1998.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  same  period,  there  was  almost  a  three-fold\r\n\r\nincrease in the total number of incidents involving Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens,  work  permit or employment pass holders  illegally\r\n\r\nusing Malaysian-registered vehicles in Singapore. The average\r\n\r\nnumber of cases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  motorists  failing to produce proof of  scrap  or  export\r\n\r\ndocuments upon cancellation of registration has risen  to  11\r\n\r\ncases  per  year from zero cases in 1995. For cases involving\r\n\r\nthe  unlawful alteration of vehicles and trailers, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  rise  from zero cases in 1995 to 9  cases  in  1998.\r\n\r\nThere  were  also  53  cases  in 1998  involving  forgery  of\r\n\r\nlicences  and  the  driving of off-peak  cars  without  valid\r\n\r\nsupplementary  licences - approximately a 140%  jump  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of cases handled from 1995 to 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to increase the maximum fines\r\n\r\nfor  these offences are thus necessary to check the trend  of\r\n\r\nmore  persons committing these offences, and will serve as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent to potential offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, had on 26th April 1999, announced its\r\n\r\nintention to implement a package of tougher measures  against\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  motorists  against  whom  there  are  in  force\r\n\r\nwarrants  of  arrest in connection with traffic  and  parking\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September 1999, there were 39,197 outstanding\r\n\r\nwarrants  for parking offences. Together with other  traffic-related  warrants,  a  total  of 54,604  warrants  are  still\r\n\r\noutstanding.  These statistics show that a  large  number  of\r\n\r\nwarrants  of  arrest have been issued because many  motorists\r\n\r\nwho  have committed parking or traffic offences simply ignore\r\n\r\nthe  notices requiring them to appear in court in  connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  offences. Ignoring a notice to appear in court  to\r\n\r\nanswer a charge, even when the offence is a relatively  minor\r\n\r\noffence such as a parking infringement, is a grave matter  as\r\n\r\nit  shows  a  blatant disregard for the law.  The  Government\r\n\r\ntakes  a stern view of motorists who do not comply with  such\r\n\r\nnotices. Tougher measures will therefore be imposed to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  effective enforcement against motorists  who\r\n\r\ncommit traffic or parking offences and thereafter ignore  the\r\n\r\nnotices requiring them to appear in court in connection  with\r\n\r\nthe offences committed by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures include not allowing a motorist against\r\n\r\nwhom  there is an outstanding warrant of arrest to renew  his\r\n\r\nroad  tax until he has been arrested pursuant to the  warrant\r\n\r\nor  he  has  surrendered himself, and his  case  conclusively\r\n\r\ndealt  with by the court.  It also includes giving powers  to\r\n\r\nthe  Police,  LTA,  Urban Redevelopment Authority  (URA)  and\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board (HDB) officers to immobilise or\r\n\r\nseize and detain any vehicle which is registered in the  name\r\n\r\nof  a  person  against whom there is in force  a  warrant  of\r\n\r\narrest relating to a traffic or parking offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists who settle their traffic or parking fines\r\n\r\npromptly will not be affected by these measures.  Our  record\r\n\r\nshows  that about 95% of motorists settle their cases by  the\r\n\r\nfinal  reminder.  However, warrants of arrest will be  issued\r\n\r\nagainst those who choose to ignore repeated reminders to  pay\r\n\r\ntheir  fines as well as the notices requiring them to  attend\r\n\r\ncourt  to answer the charges against them.  And if they still\r\n\r\ndo  not take action to surrender themselves when warrants  of\r\n\r\narrest  have  been issued against them, they  will  face  the\r\n\r\ntougher measures which we intend to implement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Road Traffic Act also needs to be amended to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the introduction of the automated  Vehicle  Entry\r\n\r\nPermit (VEP) and Toll Collection System, which is targeted to\r\n\r\nbe  implemented early next year.  The automated  system  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  more convenient for Checkpoint users to  pay  their\r\n\r\ntoll  charges and VEP fees, as well as help to speed  up  the\r\n\r\nflow of traffic through the checkpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists will no longer need to purchase toll coupons\r\n\r\nin advance before going to the checkpoints.  All they need to\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  insert  a  CashCard or dedicated  smartcard  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  cash  value into a card-reader installed  at  the\r\n\r\nimmigration  booths.   The  card reader  will  electronically\r\n\r\ndeduct  the  toll  charges  from the  CashCard  or  dedicated\r\n\r\nsmartcard.   Motorists driving Singapore-registered  vehicles\r\n\r\ncan use the CashCard, which they currently use for paying ERP\r\n\r\ncharges, to also pay for tolls at the Checkpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists driving foreign registered vehicles will be\r\n\r\nrequired  to purchase a dedicated smartcard at the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCheckpoints before entering Singapore.  The smartcard, called\r\n\r\nthe Autopass Card, will record the vehicle number, date, time\r\n\r\nand  point  of entry of the vehicle.  When a motorist  leaves\r\n\r\nSingapore, the VEP fees and toll charges will be computed and\r\n\r\ndeducted  automatically when the Autopass  Card  is  inserted\r\n\r\nwith  sufficient cash value into a card-reader.  The Autopass\r\n\r\nCard may be used for subsequent trips to Singapore.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  when the foreign motorist returns the next  time,  he\r\n\r\nwill  not have to purchase a new card if he has with him  the\r\n\r\nold card.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The automated system will cut down the transaction time\r\n\r\ncurrently  taken  for  the issue and sale  of  Vehicle  Entry\r\n\r\nPermits  at the Checkpoints. While in Singapore, the motorist\r\n\r\nmay  use  the Autopass as an ordinary CashCard and enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of cashless transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increasing fines for certain offences under the RTA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill which increase the maximum\r\n\r\nfines  for  the  six  offences I  mentioned  earlier  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 3 raises the maximum fine for the offence of\r\n\r\nunlawfully altering a vehicle or trailer  -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) from $1,000 for a first conviction to $2,000; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) from $2,000 for a second or subsequent conviction to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 4 raises the maximum fine for the offence of\r\n\r\nkeeping  or  using an unregistered vehicle.  The increase  in\r\n\r\nfines is the same as in clause 3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 5 raises the maximum fine for failure by a\r\n\r\nresident  of  Singapore  to  inform  the  Registrar  of   his\r\n\r\npossession or use of foreign-registered vehicle.  Again,  the\r\n\r\nincrease in fines is the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clause 8 raises the maximum fine for failure by a\r\n\r\nregistered owner to produce proof of scrap or export within 1\r\n\r\nmonth  upon cancellation of registration of a vehicle by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar.  The increase in fines is the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Clause 10 raises the maximum fines for the offences\r\n\r\nunder  section  129  from $2,000 to $5,000.   These  offences\r\n\r\ninclude making false statements, forging licences, furnishing\r\n\r\nfalse particulars, and driving or permitting an off-peak  car\r\n\r\nto  be  driven  with  a  tampered  or  altered  supplementary\r\n\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tougher  measures against motorists with outstanding  warrant of arrest</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a motorist against whom there is in force a\r\n\r\nwarrant  of  arrest relating to an offence under the  Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces  Act or the Road Traffic Act is allowed to  renew  his\r\n\r\nvehicle  tax licence once he surrenders himself to  a  Police\r\n\r\nStation  or  the  Warrant Enforcement Unit, and  is  formally\r\n\r\narrested.   However, the motorist may thereafter  jump  bail,\r\n\r\nnot  pay his fines or fail to attend court.  Clause 6 of  the\r\n\r\nBill empowers the Registrar to deny a motorist the renewal of\r\n\r\nhis vehicle licence until his case is conclusively dealt with\r\n\r\nby the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill empowers a police officer or an\r\n\r\nemployee of LTA to immobilise or seize and detain any vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich  is registered in the name of a person against  whom  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  of arrest is in force in connection with any traffic\r\n\r\nor parking offence committed by him.  The powers conferred on\r\n\r\nan employee of LTA may be exercised in respect of any vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich is being used or parked on a public road or in a public\r\n\r\ncar park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers conferred on a police officer may be\r\n\r\nexercised in respect of a vehicle that is found at any place,\r\n\r\nincluding private premises.  Police would tow or immobilise a\r\n\r\nvehicle  found  on  private premises if, upon  going  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  premises to arrest the offender, they cannot  locate\r\n\r\nthe offender but find his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicle on the private premises instead.  The vehicle will be\r\n\r\nreleased  when  the offender has surrendered himself  or  the\r\n\r\nwarrant of arrest has been cancelled by a court.  The  powers\r\n\r\nconferred  on  a police officer may also be exercised  by  an\r\n\r\nauxiliary police officer who is authorised in writing by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police to exercise such powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Automated VEP and toll collection system</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to facilitate the implementation of the automated\r\n\r\nVEP  and  toll collection system, clause 7 of the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nallow the Minister to make subsidiary legislation for various\r\n\r\naspects of operations, including the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) provide for the Vehicle Entry Permit to be stored in\r\n\r\nan  electronic  form  on such stored value  card,  device  or\r\n\r\nappurtenance as may be issued;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) provide for the levy of a fee for the issue of such\r\n\r\nstored value card, device or appurtenance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) prescribe the manner in which any fee or tax is to\r\n\r\nbe  levied and collected, including the use of electronic  or\r\n\r\ncomputerised or other facilities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) prohibit the entry into or exit from Singapore of\r\n\r\nany foreign vehicle if any fee or tax payable is in arrears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 also empowers the court to order a person who\r\n\r\nhas   been  convicted  under  those  rules  to  pay  up   the\r\n\r\noutstanding  arrears  of VEP fees and any  tax  that  may  be\r\n\r\nlevied under those rules.  This new provision is in line with\r\n\r\nexisting provisions in the Road Traffic Act, which allows the\r\n\r\ncourt  to order convicted motorists to pay up any outstanding\r\n\r\narrears of ERP charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of enhanced penalties to the\r\n\r\nvarious  offences as listed under the Road Traffic  Act  will\r\n\r\nsend  a  strong  signal  to  deter  would-be  offenders  from\r\n\r\ncommitting  these  offences  and  curb  the  rise   of   such\r\n\r\nincidents.  Furthermore, the proposed amendments to deny\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorists  with  outstanding warrants of arrests  renewal  of\r\n\r\nroad  taxes, and the empowerment of various agencies  to  tow\r\n\r\naway  vehicles  when the registered owners  have  outstanding\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrests in force against them, will show that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is serious in taking action against motorists  who\r\n\r\nblatantly  disregard notices to attend court that are  served\r\n\r\non  them  in  connection  with traffic  or  parking  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted   by   them.   With  the  proposed  amendments   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the implementation of an automated VEP  and  toll\r\n\r\ncollection system, motorists will enjoy smoother traffic flow\r\n\r\nat  the  Checkpoints, as well as greater convenience  in  the\r\n\r\npayment of tolls and VEP fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.

Whatever\r\n\r\nreasons  many  of  these errant drivers may give,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  they go and see their MPs, they should be aware of  the\r\n\r\ndanger  and the inconvenience they are causing to  other  law\r\n\r\nabiding  citizens.   However,  I  am  quite  puzzled  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State's figure just now, when he mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  54,000 of such outstanding warrants  of  arrests.\r\n\r\nThis figure implies that there are such number of people, who\r\n\r\nhave  committed traffic offences walking around and violating\r\n\r\nthe  orders  of the court to attend to such cases,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase  I  am  wondering  whether these measures  that  we  are\r\n\r\nproposing  in this amendment Bill will actually  address  the\r\n\r\nissue.  If we have 54,000 people with outstanding warrants of\r\n\r\narrests,  certainly, I think it is a very  serious  situation\r\n\r\nfor the Home Affairs Ministry to look into.  But there again,\r\n\r\nfor  such cases, will these measures address the issue?   Why\r\n\r\nis it so difficult to arrest these 54,000 people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are special issues and nature of the\r\n\r\noffences involved.  Therefore, maybe the solution to  address\r\n\r\nthe  issue of such warrants of arrest may have to be  refined\r\n\r\nand dealt with at further length.  If we just look at seizing\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles of the offenders at such places including their\r\n\r\nhomes,  then my question is: why is it so difficult  to  find\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles of these offenders in their homes and not  able\r\n\r\nto  arrest  the person but rather to take away  the  car?   I\r\n\r\nthink there may be a need to really look at whether these are\r\n\r\nappropriate measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The errant drivers of vehicles who have committed\r\n\r\noffences  need not necessarily be the owners of the vehicles.\r\n\r\nSo, in a case like that, there again you have this problem of\r\n\r\ntrying  to  adjudicate  who  is really  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\noffences, and whether the punishment that is meted out on the\r\n\r\nowner of a car is really fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask is on the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis automated vehicle entry permit and smartcard for drivers\r\n\r\nof  foreign  vehicles.   I  am not  clear  exactly  what  the\r\n\r\nimplications  are,  but I would like  to  ask  how  will  the\r\n\r\nforeign drivers, with this smartcard that is issued to  them,\r\n\r\ntop  it  up with cash in Singapore?  Is it through the  ATMs?\r\n\r\nDo  they have necessary accounts for this?  And how will  the\r\n\r\nauthority at the Checkpoint verify and pinpoint the smartcard\r\n\r\nto  a  car or a driver?  I suppose from the explanation given\r\n\r\nby the Minister of State, the identification is really from a\r\n\r\ncard  to  a car.  Then again, the issue is really not  errant\r\n\r\ncars  but  only errant drivers.  How then do we pinpoint  the\r\n\r\nfault?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An errant foreign driver, for example, committing an\r\n\r\noffence  can conveniently leave the payment of the  fines  or\r\n\r\ntolls  to  another driver who drives out to the gate  at  the\r\n\r\nexit point.  What happens if there are offences where demerit\r\n\r\npoints may be accumulated?  Who then is responsible?  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Minister can clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI rise to speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a couple of clarifications and\r\n\r\nconcerns  that  I have regarding these amendments.   The  new\r\n\r\nsection 95A confers wide powers to police officers, auxiliary\r\n\r\npolice officers and employees of LTA to immobilise, seize  or\r\n\r\ndetain  any  vehicle  of a registered  person  subject  to  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  of  arrest.  This power can be exercised  against  a\r\n\r\nvehicle found parked anywhere, even on private premises.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case of such premises, only police officers can exercise\r\n\r\nthe  power and then only if he cannot effect an arrest  after\r\n\r\nmaking a reasonable attempt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister tells us that the default rate for\r\n\r\nsummonses  in  road traffic cases is high and that  provision\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  made in legislation to control the  problem.   I\r\n\r\nagree  that when the default rate is high, measures may  have\r\n\r\nto  be taken to improve the situation.  But I think this  new\r\n\r\nprovision  may unsettle many.  The immobilisation or  removal\r\n\r\nof  cars  can  be done even though they are properly  parked.\r\n\r\n54,000  immbobilised vehicles in Singapore in car  parks  can\r\n\r\ngive  rise to a totally new dimension of what Singapore means\r\n\r\nby  a \"fine\" city.  It also could be done in the person's own\r\n\r\ndriveway and garage.  Is such a far-reaching power necessary?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One need not have to have a vivid imagination to picture\r\n\r\nwhat will happen when a car is immobilised, for example, in a\r\n\r\nHDB  car park or in one's own driveway.  Neighbours would  be\r\n\r\nquick to notice that something is wrong. The stock answer may\r\n\r\nbe  that if someone is under a warrant of arrest and he  does\r\n\r\nnot  surrender he must face the consequences, such as  social\r\n\r\nembarrassment.    But  should all subject  to  such  warrants\r\n\r\ndeserve  the  same treatment?  I certainly hope that  such  a\r\n\r\npower be used only in extreme situations and not as the first\r\n\r\nrecourse in a situation where a person against whom a warrant\r\n\r\nhas been issued cannot be found.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of those who disobey the law frequently, I\r\n\r\nhave  no doubt that the use of this law would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhere a person is intentionally avoiding arrest,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  can  understand  the need for  stern  action.   But  not\r\n\r\ninfrequently,  there  are  occasions  when,   due   to   some\r\n\r\ncircumstance,  such  as  a change of address  or  failure  to\r\n\r\neffect proper delivery of the notice of summons, a warrant of\r\n\r\narrest may be issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House, I am sure, have come across cases\r\n\r\nwhere the person against whom the warrant is served does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the terms of the warrant at all.  The  notice  is\r\n\r\nusually worded in legalese, that is to say, in English  legal\r\n\r\nlanguage,  which  is,  to a layman and sometimes  even  to  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  quite incomprehensible even if he knew English.   In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases,  perhaps the Minister can clarify whether  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  an  opportunity given to defaulters to  answer  the\r\n\r\nwarrants before such overt actions are taken against him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to know whether there was any\r\n\r\nconsideration given to a more graduated enforcement  of  such\r\n\r\nsanctions.    What  I  mean  is  whether  the  Ministry   has\r\n\r\nconsidered  the  need to distinguish between those  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  habitually ignoring warrants of arrests and  those  who\r\n\r\nare subjected to the process for the first time.  Is there  a\r\n\r\npossibility  that  the  legislation  could  be  improved   by\r\n\r\nspecifying  that these sanctions should only be applied,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  to  cases where there is habitual disobedience  to\r\n\r\nnotices of summons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proper treatment of offenders in a just society\r\n\r\nrequires   the  principle that the punishment  must  fit  the\r\n\r\ncrime.   It  also follows that in bringing the  offenders  to\r\n\r\njustice,  we are not seen to take what may be viewed  by  the\r\n\r\npublic as excessive means, especially when the perception  of\r\n\r\nthe  public, as the Minister conceded just now, may  be  that\r\n\r\ntraffic offences, other than the moving offences, may not  be\r\n\r\nregarded as serious offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving next to the provision concerning the giving of\r\n\r\nnotice  to  a  person about the immobilising  or  removal  or\r\n\r\ndetention of vehicle, it is interesting to note the  contrast\r\n\r\nbetween the means of giving notice through this Bill and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParking  Places  (Amendment) Bill  that  will  be  considered\r\n\r\nlater.   In the Parking Places (Amendment) Bill, the  persons\r\n\r\naffected  may be informed through four means: delivering  the\r\n\r\nnotice  or document to him, another adult member or  employee\r\n\r\nof his family, leaving it at his last known business address,\r\n\r\nsending  him a registered letter to his business  address  or\r\n\r\nany  address furnished by him, and if any of the above cannot\r\n\r\nbe done, through notification in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Bill, in the case where a vehicle has\r\n\r\nbeen detained, the service of notice is only through the post\r\n\r\nsent to him at his usual or last known place of residence  or\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore.  It is difficult to see why the notice\r\n\r\nrequirements  in  the  Road Traffic Act,  which  covers  more\r\n\r\nserious  offences, should be less than those in  the  Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces  Act.  If anything, there should be a higher  standard\r\n\r\nof notification, as more serious offences are involved.  This\r\n\r\nrequires  further  thought  given  the  consequences  of  the\r\n\r\nseizure.   It  is  provided, for example,  that  after  three\r\n\r\nmonths  if  the  person had not been arrested or  surrendered\r\n\r\nhimself, the vehicle may be disposed of by auction or in such\r\n\r\nmanner  as the Deputy Commissioner of Police or the authority\r\n\r\nthinks  fit.  This may deprive the person affected of one  of\r\n\r\nhis  most substantial assets besides his flat.  I should like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister to clarify whether the difference in the\r\n\r\nnotice procedure is intended and why the notice procedure  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  elaborate  as  that stated  in  the  Parking  Places\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few points that I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nclarify, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern arises out\r\n\r\nof  clause 6 and clause 9 of this Bill.  But clause 6  really\r\n\r\nalarms  me.   I see that by clause 6, a person who  has  been\r\n\r\narrested  pursuant  to  a warrant may be  refused  a  vehicle\r\n\r\nlicence renewal, as the Minister puts it, even if he has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  tried  and  his guilt determined by  the  court.   This\r\n\r\nreverses  the presumption which perhaps, to some  extent,  is\r\n\r\nbeing eroded in Singapore today.  It reverses the presumption\r\n\r\nthat any person who is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccused  of any offence is innocent of the offence  until  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  proved  to  have  committed  the  offence  to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of a court.  But here we have a  proposal  that\r\n\r\neven  before the court tries the offender and pronounces  him\r\n\r\nguilty  of the offence, he should be punished by not allowing\r\n\r\nhim to renew his licence.  That, I find very alarming and, as\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  it  tends to reverse  the  presumption.    It\r\n\r\nassumes that this man or woman is guilty of the offence which\r\n\r\nhe or she stands charged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also undesirable for the reason that it may act as\r\n\r\na  compulsion  for the person to plead guilty to  an  offence\r\n\r\ncharged   simply  to  get  the  vehicle's  licence   renewed.\r\n\r\nCompelling  someone to plead guilty is, as I have said,  very\r\n\r\nundesirable and I think it may even be an offence  under  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  if  the  police try to compel  anyone  to  plead\r\n\r\nguilty.   So  I  do  urge  the  Ministry  to  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nprovision in clause 6 and see whether it should be made law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important principle of law, and I hope that it\r\n\r\nis  accepted by the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs, that the presumption of innocence should not in  any\r\n\r\nway be dented in Singapore.   On the other hand, it should be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  So I have very grave reservations of clause  6\r\n\r\nof  the Bill.  I think it should be taken out completely.  If\r\n\r\nthe  man has been arrested and a date has been fixed for  his\r\n\r\ntrial,  which I take will be the case, he will  be  on  bail,\r\n\r\ncompelling  his  attendance for the  trial,  then  no  action\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken until the decision of the court  is  known.\r\n\r\nThat would be the civilised way of proceeding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is clause 9 which seeks to insert a new\r\n\r\nsection 95A.  Prof. Chin has raised a number of questions  on\r\n\r\nthis and I would endorse my support of what he said, and  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  may result in penalising members of the family  who\r\n\r\nmay  be using the car, where the person who is registered may\r\n\r\nnot  be  available.  He may be out of the country for all  we\r\n\r\nknow.  But the members of the family may be using the car and\r\n\r\nthey  may need the car.  Is it the intention to penalise  the\r\n\r\nfamily who is using the car to put compulsion on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson  who has absconded or is evading arrest?  That  again,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say, is an undesirable principle.  It smacks  of  the\r\n\r\ncollective  punishment theory which was applied  in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nduring  the  years of Emergency and was strongly  criticised,\r\n\r\nnot  only  in  Malaysia but outside Malaysia,  for  punishing\r\n\r\nmembers  of  a village or community because of the wrongdoing\r\n\r\nof one or two members of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the power to release the vehicle is given to\r\n\r\nthe  Magistrate or the Deputy Commissioner of Police  or  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar.   But it would appear to me that the  Magistrate's\r\n\r\nhand   is  tied  in  that  the  clause  goes  on  to  provide\r\n\r\nspecifically that he may refuse to release the vehicle unless\r\n\r\nthe man surrenders himself to a police officer.  There again,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  form of compulsion that is being used and  in  the\r\n\r\nresult punishing somebody else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the question of the 54,000 warrants of\r\n\r\narrest.   Has  the Ministry of Communications and Information\r\n\r\nTechnology inquired from the Ministry of Home Affairs or  the\r\n\r\npolice  officers  how  diligent are the Police  in  executing\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest?  What would be the position if the police\r\n\r\nofficers,  through  shortage  of  manpower  or  for  whatever\r\n\r\nreason, suddenly forget about the warrant of arrest, which is\r\n\r\nlying  on  the  shelf somewhere, and they have not  made  any\r\n\r\nattempt  to execute it?  Are you going to require,  first  of\r\n\r\nall,  the  Police  or whoever is authorised  to  execute  the\r\n\r\nwarrant  to  say what attempts have been made,  and  in  what\r\n\r\nmanner, to execute the warrant of arrest?  If not, the  owner\r\n\r\nor  driver  is being punished for something that  the  Police\r\n\r\nhave not done.  That again is totally unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore ask the Ministry to reconsider this\r\n\r\nBill again, particularly the two clauses (clauses 6 and 9) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, may I\r\n\r\nraise  two  concerns for the Minister of  State.   The  first\r\n\r\nrelates to the new penal powers under the Act, and the second\r\n\r\nrelates to the automated system for Causeway traffic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns the penal powers under clause 9.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  as we know, are very attached to  their  cars.\r\n\r\nNo  matter how much we raise the prices, etc, they want them,\r\n\r\nand the car prices therefore have raised themselves.  And  we\r\n\r\nshould  be very concerned about powers that use the  cars  as\r\n\r\npressure points to solicit the payment of fines.  Let me turn\r\n\r\nmy attention particularly to the new section 95A, subsections\r\n\r\n(9)  and  (10).  As I read them, these clauses would actually\r\n\r\nallow  the  Police to detain and then auction a  vehicle  for\r\n\r\nfailure to pay fines.  A further understanding is that  these\r\n\r\npowers  would be invoked once there is a warrant  of  arrest.\r\n\r\nThe  threshold for this warrant of arrest may be as low as  a\r\n\r\nsingle parking offence.  And as the Minister of State himself\r\n\r\nhas mentioned, there are currently 54,000 warrants of arrest.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  lot of cars to auction.  This is a very  serious\r\n\r\npower  to  punish and it can be, I would argue,  onerous  and\r\n\r\nunjust.   This is primarily because under the new subsections\r\n\r\n95A(9)  and  (10),  the notice of auction is  merely  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette.  The Gazette, of course, is a formal official way of\r\n\r\ngiving  notice  of things, but it is not read very  commonly.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the fact of an auction may not be well known,\r\n\r\nand  this might lead to a paucity of people who would bid for\r\n\r\nthe  car, and this might drop the value below what is a  fair\r\n\r\nand  market rate.  This is certainly the experience in  other\r\n\r\ncountries, and in other forms of execution of court processes\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, of course, that these matters must be\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously.  People who do not pay their  fines  should\r\n\r\nnot  get away scot-free.  But I would argue that there  needs\r\n\r\nto  be a balance between the legitimate interest of the State\r\n\r\nand  the sanctions we wish to enforce.  There needs to  be  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  the  quantum  of  the  fines,  just   still\r\n\r\nrelatively small though, they keep going up all the time, and\r\n\r\nthe  values  of the cars which are one of the largest  assets\r\n\r\nany Singaporean can claim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next concern on the same issue is on the effect of\r\n\r\nthird parties.  Here I do not mean the families so much,  but\r\n\r\npeople with a legitimate commercial interest in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  car.   Because car prices are so high, most  of  us  owe\r\n\r\ntonnes  of  money  to the bank or the hire purchase  company.\r\n\r\nThey  take the car as a security for their repayment.  May  I\r\n\r\nask  the Ministry whether these rights would be preserved  if\r\n\r\nthere  was an auction?  And if there is a shortfall,  because\r\n\r\nthe  auction price is low, and the company is short of  money\r\n\r\nto recoup its loan, what happens then?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to reconsider the provisions of\r\n\r\npenalties,  first,  to have a higher threshold  before  these\r\n\r\ndetentions  and auctions are exercised.  Let us use  it  only\r\n\r\nfor  those who are really recalcitrant.  Secondly, to reserve\r\n\r\na  price for the vehicle.  This need not be done by amendment\r\n\r\nbut  can be done by practice in the auction.  So at least  it\r\n\r\nensures  that  a fair market value, par values and  years  of\r\n\r\ndepreciation, etc, are taken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second concern. This is for the\r\n\r\nautomated  system for cars that come across the Causeway.   I\r\n\r\nwould  just like to ask the Minister of State whether in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term at least, there are ways to ensure that the shift\r\n\r\nto the new system would not add to the Causeway jams and will\r\n\r\nnot  affect  the  ease at which our Malaysian neighbours  can\r\n\r\nvisit  us  and our tourism.  I mention this because obviously\r\n\r\nwe  do  not like the same thing when we go to visit Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWhen  there are new notices and new forms to fill, and we  do\r\n\r\nnot  get  them, we feel very inconvenienced, and I would  not\r\n\r\nlike the same to happen to our Malaysian neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto thank Members for their support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me clarify that the authorities have\r\n\r\nbeen  taking  action against offenders, and let me  give  you\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  measures  that  have  been  taken.   MND,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, in 1994 introduced a set of measures to reduce  the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of outstanding warrants of arrest  for  parking\r\n\r\noffences  at URA/HDB car parks, for example, by clamping  the\r\n\r\nvehicles of motorists with outstanding warrants of arrest for\r\n\r\nURA/HDB offences, if they were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound contravening parking regulations at the car parks.  The\r\n\r\nPolice  also  carries out regular operations  to  locate  and\r\n\r\narrest  these offenders with outstanding warrants  of  arrest\r\n\r\nfor  traffic  and  parking related  offences.   Further,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  has  put in place stringent mechanisms at immigration\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  to detect and arrest these motorists.   So  this\r\n\r\nalso  answers Mr Jeyaretnam's point about whether the  Police\r\n\r\nhas been diligent in their enforcement actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with all these measures, the problem did not go\r\n\r\naway.   In  April  this  year, the Government  announced  its\r\n\r\nintention  to introduce tougher measures.  In fact,  in  July\r\n\r\nthis  year, URA and HDB introduced a new measure which  would\r\n\r\ndeny  such  motorists  the renewal of  their  season  parking\r\n\r\ntickets  if  they purchase these season parking  tickets  for\r\n\r\nparking in public car parks.  All these measures are actually\r\n\r\npart  of  a comprehensive set of measures that we are putting\r\n\r\nin  place  now to tackle the problem.  So what we are  seeing\r\n\r\nhere  today is the rest of the measures that will be  put  in\r\n\r\nplace.   And  why are we taking this comprehensive  approach?\r\n\r\nLet  me  say  that  under the current system,  motorists  are\r\n\r\nalready given ample opportunities to settle their fines.  Let\r\n\r\nme  describe the procedure for settling a parking composition\r\n\r\nfine.   Let  us say an original notice was issued on  day  X.\r\n\r\nFirst  reminder will be sent half a month from day X;  second\r\n\r\nreminder  will  be  sent  by registered  post  one-and-a-half\r\n\r\nmonths  from day X; final reminder will be sent three  months\r\n\r\nfrom  day  X;  court summons will be sent by registered  post\r\n\r\nfour  months from day X; and warrant of arrest will be issued\r\n\r\nsix months from day X.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there really is little or no reason\r\n\r\nwhy  errant  motorists  do  not take  action  after  so  many\r\n\r\nreminders.  It is not justifiable to claim unfamiliarity with\r\n\r\nthe  system  after  so  many reminders.   We  know,  as  MPs,\r\n\r\nresidents  come to us with summonses and ask us  to  help  to\r\n\r\neither  appeal for waiver or reduction of fines.   They  know\r\n\r\nthat they are in the wrong and yet some of them simply ignore\r\n\r\nthese  reminders.   So what is needed is a strong  signal  to\r\n\r\nmotorists that they must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprompt  in  taking responsibility for committing traffic  and\r\n\r\nparking  offences  by  settling their  fines.   If  they  are\r\n\r\nresponsive, it would save them from the inconvenience of  the\r\n\r\nmore  stringent measures which we are putting in  place  now.\r\n\r\nAnd  it would also save the time and resources of the various\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies  in  issuing  summons,  reminders   and\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned that immobilising a vehicle can\r\n\r\nbe  unsettling  to  the  public and he  asks  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The aim of these stringent measures is  precisely\r\n\r\nto  make  owners  realise the importance  of  settling  their\r\n\r\noffences quickly to avoid facing such a situation.  Motorists\r\n\r\nshould  realise that they cannot blatantly disregard  notices\r\n\r\nto attend court that are served on them.  So the issue really\r\n\r\nis the blatant disregard for the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me address the other points raised by Members.\r\n\r\nFirst,  Mr  Chay  asked why is it that you  cannot  arrest  a\r\n\r\nperson  at  his  home,  and why do  you  need  to  resort  to\r\n\r\ndetaining  or  seizing the vehicle.  As  I  said,  there  are\r\n\r\nlimitations  to the resources that we have, and  the  numbers\r\n\r\nare  just increasing too large.  So there is a need for  more\r\n\r\neffective  measures.  Mr Chay is questioning  whether  it  is\r\n\r\neffective.   But,  obviously, the rest of the  Members  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  very  severe.  So we think  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\neffective.   And when we talk about seizing the  vehicle,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that you need to seize it only in the  homes.\r\n\r\nFor  LTA, the area of jurisdiction will be the roads and  the\r\n\r\npublic  parking places.  For the Police, because  Police  has\r\n\r\njurisdiction  also in private premises, therefore,  they  can\r\n\r\narrest  the  person,  and they can seize  or  immobilise  the\r\n\r\nvehicle   in   the   homes  and  other  areas   under   their\r\n\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also raised a point on how do we differentiate\r\n\r\nthe  driver  from  the owner.  Let me say  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncurrent procedure.  The current procedure is that whenever  a\r\n\r\nperson  commits  an  offence, usually the vehicle  number  is\r\n\r\nrecorded,  and  the  authority will write to  the  registered\r\n\r\nowner and ask whether the offender\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the  registered  owner or somebody else.   So  if  it  is\r\n\r\nsomebody  else, then by law he has to furnish the information\r\n\r\nand  the  Authority  will go after the offender.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  will not be a problem because if the registered  owner\r\n\r\nis not the offender, his vehicle will not be targeted.  So it\r\n\r\nis as simple as that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the VEP. VEP violations will\r\n\r\nnot result in demerit points.  So the question of whether  it\r\n\r\nis  the driver or owner will not arise.  What LTA will do  is\r\n\r\nthat  it will recover any fines or unpaid fees from cars upon\r\n\r\nexiting  the Checkpoints.  So it is very much like a  parking\r\n\r\nsystem.   For the foreign motorists, we will not be  able  to\r\n\r\ntell  who the registered owner is.  So what we will do is  we\r\n\r\nwill go after the person who drives the car because he has to\r\n\r\nleave the country at some point in time, and that is where we\r\n\r\nwill  go  after  him.  But of course if  he  just  drives  in\r\n\r\nSingapore without going out of the country, we have a  system\r\n\r\nto  track that because the vehicle entry permit is only given\r\n\r\nfor  two weeks.  After two weeks, if he does not go and renew\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle entry permit, we will go after the vehicle which\r\n\r\nmay be somewhere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin Tet Yung brought up the difference in\r\n\r\ndelivering  notices between the two Acts.  Let me inform  him\r\n\r\nthat in the amendment, this is in new section 95A(7) where it\r\n\r\nmentions  about the means of delivery.  But this is  not  the\r\n\r\nonly means of delivery because if you refer to section 131 of\r\n\r\nthe  RTA  Act,  it  also mentions about the  other  means  of\r\n\r\ndelivery.   So  if  you  compare  the  two  Acts,  the   only\r\n\r\ndifference  is that, in the PPA, the additional means  is  by\r\n\r\nway  of  publication in the Gazette plus also the serving  of\r\n\r\nnotices  to  an employee of family.  So he is  right  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that it is slightly more elaborate for PPA.   But  the\r\n\r\nother  means are all there.  Therefore, we believe that  both\r\n\r\nnotice  serving procedures provided in both Acts are adequate\r\n\r\nto enable the effective discharge of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to Mr Jeyaretnam's point. He is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about clause 6 and also the immobilising,  seizure\r\n\r\nand detention of vehicles in clause 9.  He thinks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this  is against presumption of innocence.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  so.   The authorities are given powers in  discharging\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities to do certain things.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nif  LTA suspects that a car on the road is not safe, LTA  has\r\n\r\nthe  power  to detain the car.  So these are the powers  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  asking  Parliament  to  provide  to  the\r\n\r\nrelevant authorities to ensure that they can carry out  their\r\n\r\nfunctions  properly.  I do not think that  we  are  presuming\r\n\r\nthat  the  person is guilty before the court  trial.   So  my\r\n\r\npoint  is that the whole objective of this amendment is  that\r\n\r\nwe should not allow people to disregard the law and that they\r\n\r\nshould show respect for the law.  It is actually contempt  of\r\n\r\ncourt if they just ignore the court orders and the warrant of\r\n\r\narrest.   So  what we are doing here is to put  in  place  an\r\n\r\neffective  means whereby the various agencies can effectively\r\n\r\ncarry out their functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if Members are concerned about whether family\r\n\r\nmembers would be using the cars, and so on, let me say  again\r\n\r\nthat  the  idea  of  the Bill is to ensure  that  the  person\r\n\r\nsettles the warrant of arrest speedily.  Because all  he  has\r\n\r\nto  do is to surrender himself to the police and he would  be\r\n\r\ngiven bail and the Authority will release the vehicle.  So it\r\n\r\nis  not  as if we are going to detain the vehicle for a  long\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.   All he has to do is to  simply  surrender\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also expressed the concern whether the\r\n\r\nAuthority  would  be  trigger-happy.  Let  me  say  that  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  will  first  employ other means  and  seizing  the\r\n\r\nvehicle will in a sense be the last resort.  We would not  be\r\n\r\ngoing out and start clamping vehicles, as some of the Members\r\n\r\nhave  feared.  Because of the limitation of resources,  there\r\n\r\nis   good   reason  for  the  authorities  to  target   those\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  offenders first, as Prof. Chin  has  mentioned,\r\n\r\nand  thereafter,  extend it to the rest if they  continue  to\r\n\r\nignore the warrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay raised a valid point about the notice of\r\n\r\nauction in the Gazette and whether people will know about the\r\n\r\nauction.   Gazetting is to provide the legal  cover  for  the\r\n\r\nauction.  But I do agree with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim  that we can actually do other things like publishing  it\r\n\r\nin  the papers, and so on, to make sure that more people will\r\n\r\nknow about the auction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about credit companies or hire\r\n\r\npurchase  companies.  Legally, these vehicles rightly  belong\r\n\r\nto them.  Therefore, they can actually approach the Authority\r\n\r\nand  if they can prove that the vehicles belong to them,  the\r\n\r\nvehicles would be returned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Tay mentioned about the Causeway jam. In my\r\n\r\nspeech  earlier,  I mentioned that the system  will  actually\r\n\r\nhelp to reduce the jam.  At the moment, when foreign vehicles\r\n\r\ncome  into Singapore, they have to pay for the entry permits.\r\n\r\nWhereas  in the new system, they just put the card  into  the\r\n\r\ncard   reader.   This  process  is  in  parallel   with   the\r\n\r\nimmigration process.  If they do not have a card, of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have to purchase it.  But, as I said, it is  only\r\n\r\nonce  off  and it would not be worse than before.  Presently,\r\n\r\nthey have to purchase a permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By way of clarification and without\r\n\r\nbeing  disrespectful to the Minister  of  State.   I   wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  he  really understood what I was  saying  about  the\r\n\r\npresumption of innocence.  I do not get that impression  that\r\n\r\nhe  understood it.  This clause would suggest that the person\r\n\r\nhas  been  arrested pursuant to the warrant of arrest  issued\r\n\r\nagainst  him.  If he is arrested, he is brought to court  and\r\n\r\nperhaps punished for not turning up and then released on bail\r\n\r\nto face trial for the offence for which he was arrested.  The\r\n\r\npresumption of innocence is that that man or woman  in  front\r\n\r\nof  the  court  is  innocent of the charge  until  the  court\r\n\r\npronounces  that he or she is guilty.  Therefore,  no  action\r\n\r\nshould  be taken by any Ministry pre-empting the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  court and seeking to punish indirectly either the person\r\n\r\nor  any other member of the family or other persons.  That is\r\n\r\nexactly  what  I  was  trying to convey. The  presumption  of\r\n\r\ninnocence  before  the trial and no one should  pre-empt  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nexplained  that  by  immobilising his  vehicle,  we  are  not\r\n\r\npresuming  that he is guilty.  In many of our law enforcement\r\n\r\nactions,  we  inconvenience  individuals.   The  police  have\r\n\r\npowers, for instance, if they feel that you have committed an\r\n\r\noffence, to detain you for certain hours and then they charge\r\n\r\nyou  in  court.   So  are you saying that  by  detaining  the\r\n\r\noffenders in the remand prison, it is presumed that they  are\r\n\r\nguilty?  Obviously, not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I answer that? They are in the\r\n\r\nremand prison because they cannot post the bail that has been\r\n\r\noffered  to  them.  That is the only reason they are  in  the\r\n\r\nremand  prison, or because certain offences are not bailable.\r\n\r\nIt  is something quite different from the subject that we are\r\n\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The police can do so if they\r\n\r\nhave  reason to believe that they want to perhaps do  certain\r\n\r\nother  investigations, and so on.  The powers  are  given  to\r\n\r\nthem to do that and there is no presumption of guilt here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask three points of\r\n\r\nclarification briefly.  The first was that in the Minister of\r\n\r\nState's  reply,  he  suggested there was a  division  between\r\n\r\nregistered  owners  and  drivers.  I understand  the  general\r\n\r\nposition.  May I ask the Minister of State whether this  will\r\n\r\nalso  apply  for  parking offences.  In  other  words,  if  a\r\n\r\nvehicle  XYZ is parked in a certain spot but the offender  is\r\n\r\nnot the owner, does it mean that that car will not be seized,\r\n\r\ndetained and auctioned under the powers so long as the driver\r\n\r\nis different from the registered owner?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification I wanted to make was that I am\r\n\r\ngratified by the assurances about the auction.  But  does  it\r\n\r\nmean that the Ministry and the Authority are taking on a duty\r\n\r\nto  have an open and fair auction?  I mention this because in\r\n\r\ncertain US cases, from all these advertisements you can buy a\r\n\r\nPorsche for $50.  It may not be true.  But what they mean  is\r\n\r\nthat  these  auctions are so badly attended  that  the  price\r\n\r\ndrops dramatically.  Is there a duty on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Authority to ensure a fair market price if there  is  an\r\n\r\nauction?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point of clarification is simply on my point\r\n\r\nabout  the  Causeway  problems.  I do take  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState's  assurance that they will improve things in the  long\r\n\r\nterm.   My  point  was  simply  more  about  the  short  term\r\n\r\nimplementation.  Will we ensure and, I think  we  always  do,\r\n\r\ngive sufficient notice to the other side?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I also clarify\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister:  of these 54,000 warrants of arrest,  how\r\n\r\nmany  of  such  errant  drivers  are  actually  owning  their\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Just two points of\r\n\r\nclarification.   First, the Minister mentioned  very  limited\r\n\r\nresources  in  relation to the execution  of  warrants.   How\r\n\r\nlimited  are they vis-a-vis the 54,000 outstanding  warrants?\r\n\r\nAnd the second point is that he mentioned that there are some\r\n\r\nwho  are  more  recalcitrant than  others  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest. Does he have the breakdown of how many of\r\n\r\nthese  persons  who are subjected to warrants of  arrest  are\r\n\r\nfirst-timers,  and  how  many  are  really  those   who   are\r\n\r\nhabitually disobeying the summonses?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The short answer to Mr Chay and\r\n\r\nProf. Chin is that I do not have these figures with me on how\r\n\r\nmany  are  recalcitrants, how many are first-time  offenders,\r\n\r\nand  how many are owners of vehicles.  I also do not have the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   persons  that  the  Police  deploy   for   such\r\n\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked a few questions. On the Causeway\r\n\r\njam,  the purpose of the exercise is really to speed  up  the\r\n\r\nclearance, not just for the long-term but even for the short-term.   And  as  I  mentioned, if you  were  to  compare  the\r\n\r\nautomated  procedure  with  the current  procedure,  you  can\r\n\r\nexpect  improvements because we are doing through  electronic\r\n\r\nmeans.  As I said, the smartcard will be used and reading  of\r\n\r\nthe smartcard is in parallel with the immigration clearance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fair market value for the cars, the Government\r\n\r\nhas a duty to ensure that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles are auctioned off because the Government cannot\r\n\r\nkeep  the vehicles forever. So that is why we are asking  for\r\n\r\nthe power from this House  to allow the Government to dispose\r\n\r\nof  the vehicles.  And when you dispose of the vehicles, what\r\n\r\nis  a  fair market value?  How do you actually determine that\r\n\r\nit  is a fair market value?  As far as the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  concerned, we have to ensure that  reasonable\r\n\r\nmeans  are  employed to publicise the auction but there  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  people who say, \"I do not know about the auction.\"\r\n\r\nBecause  of  that,  can  you say it  is  not  a  fair  value?\r\n\r\nPublication in the Gazette is one means and it also fulfils a\r\n\r\nlegal  requirement.  The other thing that we  can  do,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, is to publish in newspapers and ensure that more people\r\n\r\nwill get to know about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, owners versus drivers. I am not so clear about\r\n\r\nthis  point.  If it is a parking offence, I believe  that  we\r\n\r\nwill probably go after the car owner.  Otherwise, I foresee a\r\n\r\nloophole here.  In other words, a person who has committed an\r\n\r\noffence can say that it is somebody else who does not  own  a\r\n\r\ncar.  I believe, subject to confirmation, this is the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr John Chen Seow Phun].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARKING PLACES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>1.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications and Information\r\n\r\nTechnology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  beg\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this Bill is to amend the Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces Act (PPA) for the following purposes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) to transfer to the Land Transport Authority (LTA)\r\n\r\nthe power to provide suitable public car parks for vehicles;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) to extend protection from liability for Assistant\r\n\r\nand Deputy Superintendents of Car Parks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) to add a general provision to cater for the future\r\n\r\nimplementation of an Electronic Parking System; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) to empower the Superintendent to immobilise or\r\n\r\nremove  any vehicle which is parked in a public car park  and\r\n\r\nwhich  is  owned  by a motorist  against  whom  there  is  an\r\n\r\noutstanding warrant of arrest in connection with a traffic or\r\n\r\nparking offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the\r\n\r\nParking Places (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, clause 2 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts\r\n\r\nsection  4  for  the  purpose of transferring  the  power  to\r\n\r\nprovide  public car parks for vehicles from the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nLTA.    Currently,   the  Ministry  of   Communications   and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology  approves and  gazettes  the  Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces Order which designates new HDB and URA car parks,  and\r\n\r\nprescribes  the  parking  charges for  them.  Generally,  new\r\n\r\nParking  Places  Orders are processed  and  gazetted  once  a\r\n\r\nmonth. To streamline the procedures and processes, the  power\r\n\r\nto  provide  public  car parks will be transferred  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister to the LTA. Public car parks will be designated by a\r\n\r\nparking  sign  planted on site, in lieu of a  Parking  Places\r\n\r\nOrder.  The  prescribed parking charges will be displayed  on\r\n\r\nthe  parking  sign.  The certified car  park  plans  will  be\r\n\r\navailable for public inspection. The power to approve parking\r\n\r\ncharges will remain with the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to confer on the Superintendent\r\n\r\nprotection  from liability for the loss of or any  damage  to\r\n\r\nany vehicle parked in any parking place, or for any injury or\r\n\r\ndeath  suffered by any person in any parking place. With  the\r\n\r\namendment,  the Assistant and Deputy Superintendents  of  Car\r\n\r\nParks,  who are HDB and URA staff, will enjoy the same  level\r\n\r\nof  protection in discharging their duties as staff from  the\r\n\r\nLand Transport Authority. Currently, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParking  Places Act only protects the LTA and the  Government\r\n\r\nfrom such liabilities in the parking places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 seeks to cater for the future implementation of\r\n\r\nelectronic parking systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 empowers the Superintendent to immobilise, or\r\n\r\nremove and detain any vehicle which is parked in a public car\r\n\r\npark,  and which is owned by a person against whom a  warrant\r\n\r\nof  arrest is in force for a traffic or parking offence.  The\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  will  release the vehicle  only  when  he  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the owner of the vehicle has been arrested, or\r\n\r\nhas  surrendered himself to a police officer, or the  warrant\r\n\r\nof arrest in force against him has been cancelled by a court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of the term \"warrant of arrest\" in clause\r\n\r\n8(d) covers any Warrant of Arrest issued by a court against a\r\n\r\nperson in connection with an offence committed by this person\r\n\r\nunder  the Road Traffic Act, the Parking Places Act, and  the\r\n\r\nrules  made  under  these Acts. This is to  ensure  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement   against  motorists  against  whom   outstanding\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest are in force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted earlier in my speech on the Road Traffic\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill, the large number of outstanding warrants of\r\n\r\narrest  is  a  matter of serious concern  as  it  shows  that\r\n\r\nenforcement  against  motorists who have  refused  to  settle\r\n\r\ntheir  offences has not been effective. Tougher measures  are\r\n\r\nnecessary to send a signal that there must be respect for the\r\n\r\nlaw,  and  that  motorists  who  commit  traffic  or  parking\r\n\r\noffences  must be responsible enough to either  compound  the\r\n\r\noffences  when given the opportunity to do so, or  to  attend\r\n\r\ncourt in relation to the offence when required to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 enables the Superintendent to serve on a person\r\n\r\nany  summons,  notice, order or document required  under  the\r\n\r\nParking  Places  Act  or  its rules, by  publication  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette, if the Superintendent is unable to ascertain the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson's  usual  or  last  known place  of  residence,  after\r\n\r\nreasonable diligence is exercised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the proposed amendments to the Parking\r\n\r\nPlaces  Act will enable URA and HDB to take tougher  measures\r\n\r\nagainst  motorists  against  whom  outstanding  warrants   of\r\n\r\narrests  are  in  force, by immobilizing  or  removing  their\r\n\r\nvehicles  at parking places. Taken together with the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Road  Traffic  Act,  enforcement  action\r\n\r\nagainst  such motorists will be tightened. This  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  proper respect for the  law,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nmassive  backlog  that the courts are currently  experiencing\r\n\r\nwill be cleared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will also streamline the\r\n\r\noperations involved in designating HDB and URA car parks, and\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the  work  of  the  Superintendent  in   issuing\r\n\r\nsummonses  and notices to offenders. Car park Superintendents\r\n\r\nwill  also be granted protection in the course of discharging\r\n\r\ntheir duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support  of the Bill.  I only  have  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill confers the Land Transport Authority to provide\r\n\r\nfor  parking spaces in Singapore. Clause 2, proposing the new\r\n\r\nsection 4 subsection (2), states that the Authority is  under\r\n\r\na  duty  to  ensure  that in the provision  of  such  parking\r\n\r\nspaces, it should not unreasonably prevent access to premises\r\n\r\nor  use  of the roads by others. The provision of such spaces\r\n\r\nshould also not be a nuisance to any person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether the difference\r\n\r\nin language between the repealed section and the new proposed\r\n\r\nsection  is intended.  In the repealed section, the provision\r\n\r\nof  parking spaces should not be a \"nuisance\".  It is  proper\r\n\r\nto  interpret  this  word  most likely  to  refer  to  public\r\n\r\nnuisance,  that is, the Authority can provide parking  places\r\n\r\nunless such provisions become a public nuisance.  Of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  as it stood, the word is ambiguous enough to include\r\n\r\nprivate nuisance but this is by no means well-established  in\r\n\r\ncase law.  The new provision states \"nuisance to any person\".\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether  this  is intended  to  allow  any  person\r\n\r\nadversely  affected  to complain and  possibly  to  bring  an\r\n\r\naction  against the Authority to remove parking  places  that\r\n\r\ncause a nuisance to him or others like him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can clarify what is intended in\r\n\r\nthis  change in the language of the section.  In other words,\r\n\r\nis  it  intended  that a private person can bring  a  private\r\n\r\nnuisance   action   against  the   authority?   This   would,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly,  I am sure, complicate the general provision  of\r\n\r\ncar  parks  in Singapore. For example, HDB residents  staying\r\n\r\nnext  to  car  parks  may  complain  about  the  nuisance  of\r\n\r\nlistening to squeaking brakes and squealing tyres as vehicles\r\n\r\nmake  their way through these car parks.  Can they now  apply\r\n\r\nfor  an injunction to stop the use of the car park until  the\r\n\r\nAuthority has installed a surface that would not be so noisy?\r\n\r\nIt  would be good if the Minister of State could clarify this\r\n\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes a provision that refers to the\r\n\r\nsituation  dealt  with  in the earlier  Bill  that  was  just\r\n\r\npassed, namely, where a person  is under a warrant of arrest,\r\n\r\nhis  vehicle  may  now  be seized by a  Superintendent.   The\r\n\r\ninclusion of such a provision in the Parking Places  Act,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  means that even in the case of illegal parking,  the\r\n\r\nperson  against whom a warrant of arrest is issued  can  have\r\n\r\nhis  vehicle  immobilised, seized and even  sold.   Again,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to draw attention to the fact that there is  some\r\n\r\nunease that no distinction is made in the Bill between  those\r\n\r\nwho  habitually ignore summonses and those who may  be  going\r\n\r\nthrough the process for the first time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legislation that we are considering today, in\r\n\r\nmy  view,  does not really deal with the root causes  of  why\r\n\r\nthere  is  so  much illegal parking, especially  in  the  new\r\n\r\nhousing estates.  The provision of multi-storey car parks  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  open car parks in the new housing  estates  means\r\n\r\nthat even medium height goods\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles   have  difficulty  finding  parking  space   at   a\r\n\r\nreasonable distance from their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more acute problem relates to heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\nVery  often, heavy vehicle  parks are some distance away from\r\n\r\nthe  main housing areas.  That is understandable because  the\r\n\r\nnoise  from  these  vehicles early  in  the  morning  may  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as a nuisance.  However, it is also true that  many\r\n\r\nof  these  vehicle  owners were compelled to  park  illegally\r\n\r\nbecause of the lack of public transport that would take  them\r\n\r\nto  their vehicles very early in the morning.  I hope that as\r\n\r\nthe Authority is now in charge of the provision of car parks,\r\n\r\nit  will work together with HDB, URA and the public transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  to rationalise the provision of parking places  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Provision  of suitable  parking  places  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  important.  Making sure that the owners of  vehicles\r\n\r\ncan get to them in time is equally important, if not more.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the Minister of State can address these  problems\r\n\r\nbefore  using  the  criminal law that can have  such  adverse\r\n\r\neffects not just on the drivers or the owners of vehicles but\r\n\r\nalso on the families concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill but implore the Ministry and the\r\n\r\nLand  Transport  Authority to take  the  necessary  steps  to\r\n\r\nperform   their  statutory  duties  of  providing  good   and\r\n\r\nconvenient parking places in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to support the  Bill,  but  wish  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  two  clarifications for the  Minister,  especially\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  new  section 4  where  the  Land  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  is  now  given powers to provide suitable  parking\r\n\r\nplaces for vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, with the introduction of new enforcement\r\n\r\nmeasures  in the central business district (CBD),  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  feedback  about  the problems faced,  specifically,  by\r\n\r\ncourier   companies  and  those  who  provide  such  despatch\r\n\r\nservices,   and there are two points here which I would  like\r\n\r\nto raise.  One is with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregard to operation and the other the perception of fair play\r\n\r\nand equity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important to recognise that in any major\r\n\r\ncity like Singapore, it is important to have the services  of\r\n\r\nvery  efficient courier service providers to move  documents,\r\n\r\nparts  and  samples  from place to place within  the  central\r\n\r\nbusiness district.  This is a crucial and very essential part\r\n\r\nof our infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current legislation requiring couriers to park their\r\n\r\nvehicles   only  at  designated  lots  is,  at   best,   very\r\n\r\ninconvenient.  They could park at the basement,  leave  their\r\n\r\nvehicles and part of their products behind, and move to a few\r\n\r\nfloors upstairs, pay their parking charges and all that.   It\r\n\r\nis  going to be very inconvenient.  It certainly has affected\r\n\r\nthe productivity of a lot of these courier companies.  If you\r\n\r\ncan understand  that as very important and essential, then  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister to consider whether he  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  scheme whereby certain public parking  lots  can  be\r\n\r\nprovided in front of buildings as such essential services can\r\n\r\nbe  provided  to  facilitate these people to go  about  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  work.   We  could charge a flat fee to  allow  certain\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  provide such services  to  participate  in  a\r\n\r\nprogramme, because they are parking their vehicles all around\r\n\r\nthe central business district the whole day. I think we could\r\n\r\ndo more things to refine and facilitate such services, and  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister of State would consider this carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will find issues of competition. Singapore\r\n\r\nPost,  CISCO  and  somehow  people like  Telecom  do  provide\r\n\r\nservices   which  sometimes  can  be  considered  in   direct\r\n\r\ncompetition with private courier companies.  But here,  there\r\n\r\nis   a  problem  because  sometimes  people  feel  that   the\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies are more lenient when they see  a  CISCO\r\n\r\nvan  in  certain  parking places compared  to  other  courier\r\n\r\ncompanies,  for example.  And I think this is very  unhealthy\r\n\r\nbecause  if quite clearly they do only critical and essential\r\n\r\njobs, that is fine.  But what is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  is that these companies  do  more  and  more\r\n\r\ncommercial  businesses,  in  direct  competition  with  other\r\n\r\ncommercial companies.  I think the level of enforcement,  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of fair play of these people who are authorised to  do\r\n\r\nthat  and  how  they  carry out the  job  between  CISCO  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-related companies vis-a-vis private companies must\r\n\r\nbe taken with care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister of State can assure this House\r\n\r\nthat  in  discharging such responsibilities, proper  care  is\r\n\r\ntaken  that  some  of these companies are  not  unnecessarily\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged or targeted in the course of doing their  work.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister can clarify these two points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer\r\n\r\nthe  specific  questions, I would just like  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\npoint  I  made earlier in response to Mr Simon Tay's question\r\n\r\nabout  parking offences.  He asked what would happen  if  the\r\n\r\nowner  was not the person who committed the offence.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the law does allow the registered owner  to  clarify\r\n\r\nupfront that he is not the one who committed the offence.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, if he makes a false declaration, then the law will go\r\n\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me address Prof. Chin's point about the\r\n\r\nnuisance  issue.  We have consulted the Attorney-General  and\r\n\r\nhis  view is that the word \"nuisance\" in the original section\r\n\r\n42  of the Parking Places Act is unqualified.  So it is  wide\r\n\r\nenough  to cover both public and private nuisances.  The  new\r\n\r\nsection 42 refers to causing a nuisance to any person.  Words\r\n\r\nin  the singular include the plural, under section 21 of  the\r\n\r\nInterpretation  Act.   This means that  the  amended  wording\r\n\r\nshould be read to refer to nuisances caused to any person  or\r\n\r\npersons.  Therefore, we do not think that the amended wording\r\n\r\nwould  create any different consequences compared to  before.\r\n\r\nBut I thank Prof. Chin for expressing this concern.  If there\r\n\r\nis any problem that we face later on, we can always come back\r\n\r\nto Parliament and tighten the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he also asked whether trivial offences like\r\n\r\nillegal parking would necessitate such measures.  Again,  let\r\n\r\nme say\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill  does  not  only target  at  illegal  parking\r\n\r\noffences.   In  fact, it covers all Road Traffic  Act-related\r\n\r\noffences plus Parking Places Act offences.  And so long as  a\r\n\r\nperson  against  whom  there  is an  outstanding  warrant  of\r\n\r\narrest,   the  Superintendent  of  Car  Parks  can   actually\r\n\r\nimmobilise   his   vehicle  in  his  area  of   jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must look at the amendment in that regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking provision is a separate issue. At the moment,\r\n\r\nthere is no shortage of parking places island wide.  In fact,\r\n\r\nin  the  new towns, HDB and URA have car park planning norms,\r\n\r\nand  there  is  generally no shortage.  But,  of  course,  he\r\n\r\nmentioned about the problem of heavy vehicles.  Again, nation\r\n\r\nwide,  there is no shortage of heavy vehicle parking  places.\r\n\r\nYes, heavy vehicle owners want to park right in the centre of\r\n\r\nthe  town, but there are land constraints to cater  for  that\r\n\r\nkind of demand.  We have interim heavy vehicle parks near the\r\n\r\nestates,  but this is a separate issue and the Government  is\r\n\r\nin  the process of looking into how to tackle this problem in\r\n\r\nthe long term.  Having said that, this does not give them the\r\n\r\nright  to park illegally and, therefore, any illegal  parking\r\n\r\nwill be dealt with according to the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli talked about the despatch services in the\r\n\r\nCBD and asked whether public parking lots can be created.  He\r\n\r\nis  aware  that  there are bays, lanes  or  car  parks  where\r\n\r\ndespatch  service vehicles can be parked and, where possible,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be car parks provided along the roads.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to bear in mind that the CBD traffic is very heavy  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  if we were to allow indiscriminate parking  or  to\r\n\r\nset up car parks along some of the roads, then the impact  to\r\n\r\nthe traffic can be very adverse.  So, much as we like to help\r\n\r\nthem, there are the other greater objectives, in other words,\r\n\r\nto keep traffic free flowing and ensure that there will be no\r\n\r\ndanger  to other road-users.  I would urge that the  despatch\r\n\r\nservices abide by the law and park legally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his comment on Singapore Post and CISCO having an\r\n\r\nadvantage over the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  courier  companies, this is something that  I  am  not\r\n\r\naware of.  If he has any specific example, he can bring it to\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of the enforcement agency.  I think  the  law\r\n\r\ntreats everybody equally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Dr John Chen Seow Phun].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NURSES AND MIDWIVES BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to provide for the registration and\r\n\r\nenrolment  of  nurses, the registration of midwives  and  for\r\n\r\nmatters  connected therewith, and to repeal  the  Nurses  and\r\n\r\nMidwives  Act  (Chapter 209 of the 1985 Revised Edition).  It\r\n\r\nwill  enhance  the  regulatory role of the Singapore  Nursing\r\n\r\nBoard to allow it to discharge its functions more effectively\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure higher professional standards of conduct  and\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been major changes in the last 25 years in\r\n\r\nthe training of nurses, the practice of nursing and the types\r\n\r\nof nursing services in Singapore. To maintain a high standard\r\n\r\nof nursing, there is a need to update the Nurses and Midwives\r\n\r\nAct. Let me briefly describe some of the major changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, nurse training in Singapore was hospital-based under an apprenticeship scheme. The Singapore Nursing\r\n\r\nBoard's role then was to set the training curriculum  and  to\r\n\r\nconduct  the examinations. Today, the training of nurses  and\r\n\r\nmidwives  is  part of the mainstream educational system  with\r\n\r\nregistered  nurses  and  midwives  trained  in  the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nPolytechnic. The enrolled nurses will soon be trained in  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education. The Nursing Board's role will therefore\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  changed  accordingly  to  ensure  that  nursing\r\n\r\nstandards  are maintained and that nurses have the skills  to\r\n\r\nmeet the changing healthcare needs in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the role of nurses has evolved in tandem\r\n\r\nwith  the  advances in medical science and  technology.  Many\r\n\r\nnurses  today  are highly skilled, with more than  a  quarter\r\n\r\npossessing   advanced  qualifications  in  various   clinical\r\n\r\nspecialties.  As  at  December 1998, 42  nurses  are  already\r\n\r\ndesignated as \"nurse specialists\" in their hospitals.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to guide the development of advanced nursing\r\n\r\npractice  and  to ensure the proper use of the  title  \"nurse\r\n\r\nspecialist\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the gradual increase in the number of nurses in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it is still not sufficient to meet the  needs  of\r\n\r\nour  expanding healthcare service. To protect public  safety,\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  needed to prevent persons making  use  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  to indulge in unqualified nursing practice  or  to\r\n\r\nemploy  unqualified persons as nurses. My  Ministry  aims  to\r\n\r\nprevent such occurrences by empowering the regulatory role of\r\n\r\nthe Nursing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provisions in the Nurses and Midwives Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the major new provisions that are\r\n\r\nbeing introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Constitution of the Nursing Board</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Nursing Board consists of 17 members, of\r\n\r\nwhom  six are ex-officio members and another 11 are appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Health. The size of the Board is  about\r\n\r\nright.   However, to widen the representation and  to  change\r\n\r\nsome  of the titles and terms that have become obsolete  with\r\n\r\ntime,  clause  3 establishes a Nursing Board with  three  ex-officio  members  and  14 appointed members.  The  ex-officio\r\n\r\nmembers  are  the  Director of Medical  Services,  the  Chief\r\n\r\nNursing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficer  and  the  Director-General  of  Education   or   his\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  Of  the 14 appointed  members,  11  must  be\r\n\r\nnurses and the remaining three need not be nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 12 allow the Minister to appoint the\r\n\r\nChairman  and the Registrar of the Board.  Clause 4  provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  removal of an appointed member from office  if  the\r\n\r\nmember,  for example, is found guilty of infamous conduct  or\r\n\r\nis  absent  without leave from three consecutive meetings  of\r\n\r\nthe   Board  or  its  committees.  This  is  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Medical Registration Act  (MRA)  and  the\r\n\r\nLegal Profession Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Functions of the Nursing Board</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the functions of the Nursing Board.\r\n\r\nIn   devolving   the  training  of  nurses   to   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions, the existing functions of the Nursing Board  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  and  provide for the training and  examination  of\r\n\r\nstudent nurses are no longer relevant. Hence, these functions\r\n\r\nare deleted. Additional functions are included in clause 8 to\r\n\r\nenhance the role of the Nursing Board in:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) accreditation of formal nursing courses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulation of training and continuing education for\r\n\r\nnurses and midwives; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) regulation of the scope of nursing practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure that nurses continue to receive\r\n\r\nappropriate   training,   keep  abreast   of   advances   and\r\n\r\ndevelopments, and provide safe and competent nursing care  to\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Registration of nurses and midwives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to matters concerning\r\n\r\nregistration. Currently, a nurse who has stopped working  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  10 years is required to successfully  complete  a\r\n\r\nretraining  and  competency assessment programme  before  the\r\n\r\nnurse\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould be registered or enrolled to practise again. This is to\r\n\r\nensure  that the nurses and midwives are updated in practice.\r\n\r\nClause  15 allows the Nursing Board to provisionally register\r\n\r\nor enrol such nurses to undergo the retraining and competency\r\n\r\nassessment programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new provision in the Bill is the issuance of\r\n\r\nPractising  Certificates. This is to enable  nurses  to  show\r\n\r\nproof   of  current  registration,  including  the  type   of\r\n\r\nconditions  imposed on registration whenever  required.  With\r\n\r\nthe   issuance  of  practising  certificates,  the   existing\r\n\r\nprovisions for removal of name if the nurse fails to pay  the\r\n\r\nannual fee or has ceased practice will be deleted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for a person who is refused\r\n\r\nregistration by the Board to appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Register of Nurse Specialists</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of medical science, there is a\r\n\r\ncorresponding  move   towards  specialisation   in   clinical\r\n\r\nnursing  practice. It is necessary to monitor the development\r\n\r\nof    advanced   nursing   practice   and   accredit   \"nurse\r\n\r\nspecialists\". Part 5 provides for the formation  of  a  nurse\r\n\r\nspecialist  register  and the issuance  of  nurse  specialist\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cancellation of registration or enrolment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act allows the Nursing Board to cancel the\r\n\r\nregistration  or enrolment of nurses who, for  example,  have\r\n\r\nbeen found guilty of professional misconduct or are deceased.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, the Bill provides clauses to allow the  Nursing\r\n\r\nBoard  to cancel the registration or enrolment of nurses  who\r\n\r\nfailed  to  comply  with the conditions as  stated  in  their\r\n\r\nregistration   or  who  failed  to  renew  their   practising\r\n\r\ncertificates for a continuous period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains provisions for the Nursing Board\r\n\r\nto restrict the practice of a nurse whose fitness to practise\r\n\r\nis impaired due to health problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appeal</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act only allows for a nurse who is\r\n\r\naggrieved  by  the  Board's decision to  de-register  her  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the High Court. Clause 21 will allow for a  person\r\n\r\nwho is aggrieved by the Board's decision to impose any of the\r\n\r\nprescribed disciplinary penalties to appeal to the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restoration of name</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 provides for a nurse whose registration or\r\n\r\nenrolment  has been cancelled by the Nursing Board,  to  only\r\n\r\napply for restoration of name onto the register or roll after\r\n\r\na minimum period of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disciplinary procedures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Board is required to consider complaint\r\n\r\nletters   and   decide  whether  they   should   be   further\r\n\r\ninvestigated.  This  is  cumbersome  as  it  slows  down  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation  of complaints. The Bill will provide  for  the\r\n\r\nformation of Complaints Committees that will investigate into\r\n\r\ncomplaints and report the findings and recommendations to the\r\n\r\nBoard instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had mentioned earlier about preventing persons from\r\n\r\nindulging  in  unqualified practices and  the  employment  of\r\n\r\nunqualified  persons as nurses. In order to maintain  nursing\r\n\r\nstandards  and  to protect public interest, such  unqualified\r\n\r\npractices  will  be considered as offences. However,  as  the\r\n\r\nintent is not to penalise innocent acts, exceptions are  made\r\n\r\nfor  persons such as doctors, other healthcare professionals,\r\n\r\npersons  rendering emergency help or home carers  who  render\r\n\r\nnursing care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present penalty for each offence under the Act is a\r\n\r\nfine  not  exceeding $1,000, except for failure to  surrender\r\n\r\nthe  registration certificate, where the fine is  a  sum  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $500. The Bill increases the present penalties from\r\n\r\n$500 to  $1,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential and other minor amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes consequential changes as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  amendments  I  have earlier described,  other  minor\r\n\r\namendments  to delete obsolete terminology and to update  the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the nursing profession has undergone\r\n\r\nsignificant  changes over the years. The role of  nurses  has\r\n\r\ngrown in scope and complexity with the advancement of medical\r\n\r\nscience  and  technology. As the standards of any  profession\r\n\r\nare  dependent  upon  the quality of its  practitioners,  the\r\n\r\nprofession  must ensure that nurses are properly trained  and\r\n\r\nhighly competent, and that their professional development  is\r\n\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to achieve these objectives by\r\n\r\nempowering  the  Nursing  Board to safeguard  both  the  high\r\n\r\nstandards  of  nursing  practice and  the  interests  of  our\r\n\r\npatients and the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has actively sought the views and support of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Nursing   Board,   the   Singapore   Nurses\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and  the senior nurses from all  hospitals  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions  during the preparation of the Bill.  They  have\r\n\r\nmade some suggestions on the operational procedures which  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  take  into consideration when  preparing  the\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nstand to support the Nurses and Midwives Bill.  This new Bill\r\n\r\nis  much  more comprehensive in comparison to the old revised\r\n\r\nNurses  and  Midwives Act of 1985.  This new Bill  will  more\r\n\r\naptly  address the new and changing trends in many  areas  of\r\n\r\nthe  nursing field.  Sir, I would like, however, to  raise  a\r\n\r\nfew of my concerns in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the establishment of the Singapore\r\n\r\nNursing  Board  as a body corporate and constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(2)(a), (b) and (c) spells out the members of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Nursing Board.  Sir, I feel that here we should\r\n\r\ninclude  as  a  member the President of the Singapore  Nurses\r\n\r\nAssociation.    It   is   more  appropriate   to   have   the\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the voices of the nursing profession to  be\r\n\r\nin  the  Board.    This will give weightage to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNursing  Associations, to recognise them and  to  acknowledge\r\n\r\ntheir contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(2)(d) specifies that 14 members are to be\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister.  Under this action, I have  three\r\n\r\npoints to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I feel that we should have a provision for the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  from the Chief Nursing Officer,  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  health  care institutions and the  Singapore  Nurses\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Nurses Registration Board in New South Wales has\r\n\r\n13  members,  most  of  whom are nurses  but  three  are  lay\r\n\r\npersons,  out  of  which  one is a lawyer  nominated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister   and   two  are  nominated  by  the   Minister   as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  consumers. Sir, the  benefit  of  having\r\n\r\npeople  outside  the profession is that  it  allows  a  wider\r\n\r\nspectrum  of  views, perspectives and objectivity.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  good  idea  and  should  be  considered  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is no specification on the number of members\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public  and private sectors.   In  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the members are from the public sector.  As there\r\n\r\nare  about 30% of nurses or about 3,827 nurses in the private\r\n\r\nsector, it would be reasonable that this clause caters for at\r\n\r\nleast four members from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6(1) provides for the appointment of the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Board and it states that the Minister shall  appoint\r\n\r\none  of  the  members as the Chairman of the  Board.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  the Minister should appoint a registered  nurse  as\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Board.  In the past, this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not  been the case with the Singapore Nursing Board,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Directors  of Medical Services have been  the  Chairmen.\r\n\r\nThe  appointment  of a registered nurse as  Chairman  in  the\r\n\r\nNursing  Board  is adopted in countries like  Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand,  England and America.  This is logical and would  be\r\n\r\nin line with practice in the other professional bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 deals with the general provisions for\r\n\r\nregistration and enrolment.  Clause 17(5)(b) states that  the\r\n\r\nBoard   may  refuse  registration  or  enrolment  where   the\r\n\r\napplicant  is,  in  its opinion, not of good  reputation  and\r\n\r\ncharacter.   This  subclause  is  too  brief  and   open   to\r\n\r\nsubjective  opinions, as there is no relevant  yardstick.   A\r\n\r\ntest of relevancy should be applied, as for instance, \"not of\r\n\r\ngood  reputation and character which renders him unfit to  be\r\n\r\npractising as a nurse or midwife.\"  Sir, in this area we  may\r\n\r\nfind  some  useful provisions from the equivalent  Australian\r\n\r\nNurses Act 1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Australian Act defines \"professional\r\n\r\nmisconduct\"  and \"unsatisfactory professional misconduct\"  as\r\n\r\nbeing  two  instances where there can be a cancellation.  For\r\n\r\nthe purposes of the Act, professional misconduct, in relation\r\n\r\nto  an  accredited  nurse, means unsatisfactory  professional\r\n\r\nmisconduct  of a sufficiently serious nature to  justify  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  the  nurse's name from the  Register.   For  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  the  Act,  unsatisfactory professional  conduct\r\n\r\nincludes any of the following:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) any conduct that demonstrates a lack of adequate\r\n\r\nknowledge, experience, skill, judgement or care by the  nurse\r\n\r\nin the practice of nursing;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the nurse contravening (whether by act or\r\n\r\nomission) a provision of this Act or the regulations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the nurse's failure to comply with an order or\r\n\r\ncondition of registration;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) any other improper or unethical conduct relating\r\n\r\nto the practice of nursing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the aforementioned grounds are all\r\n\r\nrelevant and the words\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"conduct   relevant   to  the  practice   of   nursing\"   are\r\n\r\nsignificant.   This  qualification,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   is\r\n\r\nstrikingly absent from our aforesaid Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 17(6)(a), the Board needs to consider the\r\n\r\nreasons  why the registration or enrolment in another country\r\n\r\nhas  been  cancelled or suspended.  This may be due  to  mere\r\n\r\ntechnicalities as, for example, when the applicant had failed\r\n\r\nto  pay the prescribed fee on time or when the applicant  was\r\n\r\nno  longer practising in that country.  The provision in  its\r\n\r\ncurrent form does not impose such an obligation on the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 17(7), the Board should not only inform an\r\n\r\napplicant by written notice of such refusal pursuant  to  the\r\n\r\nsection, it should also furnish its reasons for the applicant\r\n\r\nto lodge a meaningful appeal to the Minister.  Sir, the rules\r\n\r\nof  natural  justice  also suggest that  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nprocedure whereby an applicant can appear before the Board to\r\n\r\nsubmit  his case, prior to the final avenue of appeal to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.    Since  this  affects  livelihood,  it   is   not\r\n\r\nunreasonable that an applicant be given more than a chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 deals with conviction final and conclusive.\r\n\r\nUnder  this clause, it appears to mean that anyone  convicted\r\n\r\nof  a  criminal offence cannot be registered or enrolled,  or\r\n\r\nwhose   registration   or  enrolment  will   necessarily   be\r\n\r\ncancelled.  There is no definition in this Bill of  \"criminal\r\n\r\noffence\".   Taken broadly, it simply applies to all  offences\r\n\r\n(and  this  extends  beyond the Penal  Code)  which  lead  to\r\n\r\nconviction.   Sir, the offence, which a person  is  convicted\r\n\r\nof,  may not be relevant in determining whether he or she  is\r\n\r\nfit to be a nurse or midwife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 concerns application for re-registration or re-enrolment. In clause 23(3), the restriction on re-application seems harsh, as three years is a considerably\r\n\r\nlong period since this concerns a person's livelihood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 and 29 deal with the appointment of\r\n\r\nunqualified persons to practise nursing or midwifery and with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  nurse's  agents.   Here, under clause  28(5)(b),  clause\r\n\r\n29(3)(b)  and  clause  29(4)(b), the  words  \"due  diligence\"\r\n\r\nconnote  a  higher level of care than \"reasonable diligence\".\r\n\r\nSir, is it then sufficient if the nurse or midwife produces a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  a  current practising certificate and a prospective\r\n\r\nemployer  accepts  this?  This would be deemed  a  reasonable\r\n\r\neffort  on  the  part  of  the employer,  but  to  show  \"due\r\n\r\ndiligence\"  would  infer that he should investigate  further,\r\n\r\nlike   seeking  confirmation  from  the  Board  as   to   its\r\n\r\nauthenticity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 is about nurse specialists, etc. Clause\r\n\r\n32(2)(a)  (b)  and  (c)  deal  with  registration  of   nurse\r\n\r\nspecialists  and the issue of nurse specialist  certificates.\r\n\r\nHere, there is a vague definition on the type of specialist's\r\n\r\nqualifications.  I am of the opinion, Sir, that there  should\r\n\r\nbe specifications like holding a Masters degree or equivalent\r\n\r\nqualification,  in  a specialised branch of  nursing,  and  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  five  years  of experience  in  that  branch  of\r\n\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 32(4)(e) and (4)(f), there should be a\r\n\r\nstatutory recourse, same as in clauses 17, 18 and  19  as  in\r\n\r\nthe case of nurses and midwives, instead of leaving these  to\r\n\r\nthe discretion of the Board to make regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 provides for the appointment of a legal\r\n\r\nassessor  and  a  medical assessor.  Here, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the  role  of the legal assessor is broadly  defined,\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing mentioned about the role  of  the  medical\r\n\r\nassessor.    There  is  also  no  mention  made   about   the\r\n\r\nrequirements of a medical assessor as in the case of a  legal\r\n\r\nassessor  who  needs to be an advocate and  solicitor  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  10 years' standing.  In order for a legal assessor  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  meaningful  contribution, his  role  should  not  be\r\n\r\nrestricted to questions of law.  Indeed, there is very little\r\n\r\nquestion  of law involved in determining the requirements  of\r\n\r\nthe  approval,  cancellation and suspension process,  and  it\r\n\r\ndeals  a  lot with the facts and arguments of facts to  which\r\n\r\ncontributions from a suitable legal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessor  with an appropriate background will undoubtedly  be\r\n\r\nimmense.   For instance, questions of whether the conduct  or\r\n\r\nnegligence of an applicant or a nurse or midwife would render\r\n\r\nhim unfit to be registered or enrolled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Nurses and Midwives Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\ninitiative  to  introduce  new  provisions  relating  to  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the  Singapore Nursing  Board,  practising\r\n\r\ncertificates and the registration of nurse specialists  is  a\r\n\r\ntimely  move.  As we adopt a \"step-down\" strategy  of  health\r\n\r\ncare  delivery from hospitals to the community, the need  for\r\n\r\nclear   regulations  for  managing  good  practices   becomes\r\n\r\ncritical.  We need community nursing skills that focus beyond\r\n\r\nthe  epidemiological factors of illness and address the  many\r\n\r\nlife aspects of the persons who are ill.  We also need nurses\r\n\r\nspecialists for patients with special needs like  cancer  and\r\n\r\nmental  illnesses.  In the light of this expanding scope  and\r\n\r\nexpectations of the nursing role due to changing  demographic\r\n\r\ntrends  and  the  diversity  of  demands  arising  from  more\r\n\r\neducated  patients,  I  am  in full  support  of  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,   I   would  urge  the  Board   to   immediately\r\n\r\nconceptualise a Nursing 21 national action plan to articulate\r\n\r\nthe  visions,  goals and guidelines of nursing  for  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium.   To me, nurses form a significant resource  that\r\n\r\nwe must develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, is silent on a number of issues which\r\n\r\nI  feel  could  minimise the effectiveness of  the  Board  in\r\n\r\nservicing  the needs of the community.  Allow me to highlight\r\n\r\na few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On membership of the Board, in Part II, clause 3, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  also to echo Dr Neo's call for the President  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Nurses Association (SNA) to  be  a  committee\r\n\r\nmember.   The  Association  is  the  only  professional  body\r\n\r\nconsisting  of 3,000 nurses who could clearly articulate  the\r\n\r\ninterests  and  concerns  of  the  profession  as   well   as\r\n\r\nchallenges faced by patients.  It is also the most legitimate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicle  to process policy and professional matters  relating\r\n\r\nto  medical management.  The lack of such a provision for the\r\n\r\nPresident  to  be  present and to present the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  body is, in my regard, a lost  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthe governing Board in getting the relevant feedback from the\r\n\r\npractitioners in the field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the percentage of representation of nurses from\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector on the Board?  Should it  be  consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the 30% of nurses in private sector currently,  meaning\r\n\r\nappointing  at least three members out of 14 members  in  the\r\n\r\ncommittee?  What about the 21% of foreign nurses in our total\r\n\r\ncorps   of   15,000  nurses?   Should  their   interests   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  in this Board by a nominated Permanent  Resident\r\n\r\nnurse?   If  their  inclusion is not deemed  necessary  at  a\r\n\r\nformal  level, I hope the committees formed subsequently,  as\r\n\r\nindicated  in clause 10, will have representations  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from meeting the condition of fair representation,\r\n\r\nby  adopting  a more inclusive membership policy,  the  Board\r\n\r\nhelps  to  draw  together the professional  groups  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  and  public  sectors to a  common  understanding  in\r\n\r\nmatters  relating  to salary, competence, service  standards,\r\n\r\namong   others,  in  order  to  regulate  nursing  practices,\r\n\r\nbenchmark  service standards and avoid excessive  disparities\r\n\r\nand inequities between nursing groups.  Ultimately, it is  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the public that we uphold the  dignity  and\r\n\r\nmorale of the nursing community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister, to again emphasise and stress Dr\r\n\r\nNeo's point earlier, see the appropriateness of appointing  a\r\n\r\nhighly  qualified  registered nurse as the  Chairman,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast assuming the position of a Co-Chair?  The argument  for\r\n\r\nthis  is  plain  enough that he or she being in  the  nursing\r\n\r\nprofession for years, will have the competence to assess  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the sector.  Part II, clause 6(1) is silent on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  whereas previously, the Director of Medical Services\r\n\r\nalways  assumed  the  position of  the  President.   I  noted\r\n\r\nyesterday   that   in  the  Info-communications   Development\r\n\r\nAuthority\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Singapore Bill, a provision was made in clause 31 that the\r\n\r\nMinister may appoint a Deputy Chairman.  Can such a provision\r\n\r\nbe  also included in this Bill, if the idea of a Co-Chair  is\r\n\r\nnot acceptable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mechanism of appointment, can the Minister\r\n\r\nclarify  what  are  the criteria for selection  and  will  he\r\n\r\naccept nominations from the SNA, for example?  I mean, can  a\r\n\r\nmechanism  be  set  up whereby professionals  nominate  their\r\n\r\ncandidates for Board governance to ensure that at  least  one\r\n\r\nor  two are admitted to articulate nursing needs in different\r\n\r\nmedical  settings?  Could the Bill be specific in delineating\r\n\r\nthe  number of formal representations from different  nursing\r\n\r\nsectors among the 14 committee members?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the definition of \"nurse\" and \"nurses\r\n\r\nspecialists\".   In  Part  IV,  clause  26,  the  Act  defines\r\n\r\n\"qualified nurse\" as a registered or enrolled nurse who holds\r\n\r\na  valid  practising certificate authorising him to  practise\r\n\r\nnursing.   From  what  I  observe,  the  word  \"nursing\"   is\r\n\r\nsometimes  nebulously broad, referring to someone who  has  a\r\n\r\ncertified  and  approved  degree  usually  dressed  in  white\r\n\r\nuniform, in contrast to another who is para-professional  who\r\n\r\nexecutes  the nursing functions without having  a  degree  or\r\n\r\nbeing  in  white uniform.  The nurses in private clinics  are\r\n\r\none  such example, as I was told.  It is hence expedient, and\r\n\r\nI  fully  support the Ministry for its timely  initiative  in\r\n\r\nstreamlining the definition in order to avoid abuses and mis-application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of our aging demographic trends and the\r\n\r\nlow  number of nurses in training facing a high challenge  in\r\n\r\nattrition  rate  over the years, the nursing profession  will\r\n\r\nneed a wider network of support from non-certified assistants\r\n\r\nto  deliver  home nursing services.  Especially in  community\r\n\r\nnursing,  the definition of who is and who is not  a  \"nurse\"\r\n\r\ncan  sometimes  be  inexact.  During the Budget  debate  this\r\n\r\nMarch,  I  called for the development of a network  of  para-professionals  under  the  supervision  of  certified  senior\r\n\r\nnurses  through  the Singapore Nurses Association.   My  call\r\n\r\narises from the practical concern of an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing need for taking care of the old.  Although we  can\r\n\r\ncount  on  home carers, who would primarily be daughters  and\r\n\r\ndaughters-in-law,  this  may not be a  sustainable  solution.\r\n\r\nOne  reason is that women want to work outside the home,  and\r\n\r\nthe second reason is that they are not trained in the task of\r\n\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of nursing services older persons need fall\r\n\r\ninto a continuum from one end demanding very specialised care\r\n\r\nfrom  \"nurses specialists\" to those at the middle  level  who\r\n\r\nsimply  need routine health care assistants to attend to  bed\r\n\r\nsores,  for  example, and those on the other, who  only  want\r\n\r\n\"nursing aides\" to carry out basic physiotherapy routines  to\r\n\r\nupkeep their body capabilities.  When no accidents and  death\r\n\r\noccur,  the  difficult task of \"naming\" escapes us.   When  a\r\n\r\ndisaster  does  occur, how is the person who  does  not  call\r\n\r\nhimself  or  herself a nurse but carries  out  nursing  tasks\r\n\r\nwhich  result  in maiming or killing the patient,  judged  or\r\n\r\nsentenced?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a broadening in the scope of nursing aides at both\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  hospital  care, it may  be  useful  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Nursing  Board  establishes   guidelines   on   a\r\n\r\nregistration and accreditation scheme to identify,  recognise\r\n\r\nand  regulate  a broad range of nursing roles and  practices.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Bill include a section on Advisory Guidelines  on\r\n\r\nregistration of health care assistants other than  \"qualified\r\n\r\nnurses\"?   Do  we  need to sort out these terms  like  \"para-nurses\",  \"home  nursing assistants\", \"nursing  aides\"?   The\r\n\r\nother  common  term is health care worker or  assistant.   In\r\n\r\nview  of  these  concerns which I gathered from  the  nursing\r\n\r\ncommunity, I urge the Minister to review once again  Part  IV\r\n\r\non \"Offences\", specially clauses 26 to 28.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of accreditation as spelt out in clause\r\n\r\n14,  can  the  Minister  clarify  if  correspondence  courses\r\n\r\nobtained  by already certified nurses from an allegedly  good\r\n\r\nuniversity  which  our Government also sends  nurses  to  are\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Ministry?  I heard from the Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNurses  Association that the recognition was not given.   Can\r\n\r\nwe  review and broaden the system of accreditation to include\r\n\r\na  larger number of approved institutions abroad and at home,\r\n\r\nand   accept   modes   of   learning   from   long   distance\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  course  to part-time  basis?   The  community\r\n\r\nalready facing limited nursing power could thus benefit  from\r\n\r\ncontinuing nursing support at the same time being managed  by\r\n\r\nhigher level competence learnt in the process.  In the spirit\r\n\r\nof pursuit towards a knowledge-based economy and in promoting\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning, I urge the Board in future  deliberations\r\n\r\non   accreditation  to  cast  a  wider  net  to  capture  the\r\n\r\nmotivations  and  skills  of  many  individuals  who  due  to\r\n\r\npersonal  and  unique  circumstances  learn  and  upgrade  in\r\n\r\ndiverse ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point. In a recent address at a press\r\n\r\nconference reported in the papers on 19th November,  Minister\r\n\r\nLim  Hng  Kiang said that he would like to see family doctors\r\n\r\nadopt  a lifelong training attitude and upgrade their  skills\r\n\r\nby  continuing medical education through a Masters  or  post-graduate  diploma  course.  I am totally in  support  of  his\r\n\r\nvisionary  call.   I  urge  the Minister  to  also  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  continuing education within a specified  number  of\r\n\r\nhours  to  be mandatory in the nursing and midwife profession\r\n\r\nin  order to uphold quality delivery services by attuning the\r\n\r\npractitioners to fast changing information and technology  in\r\n\r\nthe  medical  and  nursing sciences.  Due to  the  increasing\r\n\r\ndiversity   of   nursing  work,  the   development   of   new\r\n\r\nsophisticated   concepts  of  care,   and   the   nature   of\r\n\r\nprofessional   practice   which  increasingly   demands   the\r\n\r\nacceptance of responsibility and accountability, the role  of\r\n\r\nnurses  and midwives has expanded considerably.  In response,\r\n\r\nthe pressure for higher qualifications will be inevitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend that such a mandatory training provision be\r\n\r\nmade  under clause 44 to prescribe a certain number of  hours\r\n\r\nper  year  for  mandatory training.   This  initiative  would\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  new  confidence within the  nurses  and  midwives\r\n\r\ncommunity.   I  would  also urge policy  consideration  being\r\n\r\ngiven by the Board\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  matters relating to remuneration and recognition packages\r\n\r\nattached to training depth and specialisation to ensure  work\r\n\r\nand pay equity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this piece of legislation will extend, not limit\r\n\r\nthe  practice  of nurses; that it serves as  a  platform  for\r\n\r\npolicy  formulations that enable nurses in  fulfilling  their\r\n\r\npotential  in  policy  making  and  decision  making  at  all\r\n\r\nhealthcare levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  both  Dr  Lily  Neo and Mdm Claire  Chiang  for  their\r\n\r\nsupport  and their very comprehensive comments on  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nLet me take their comments on the various clauses in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on clause 3 on the composition of the Singapore\r\n\r\nNursing  Board.  There are two approaches that we can  go  by\r\n\r\ndefining  the composition.  One is a general approach  as  we\r\n\r\nhave done, and the other is to define in specifics who should\r\n\r\nor  who should not be a member of the Board.  We have decided\r\n\r\nto  go for a general approach.  But I can assure Members that\r\n\r\nin nominating or appointing the members of the Board, we will\r\n\r\nconsider  a  wide representation of views.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the Singapore Nurses Association  may  not  be\r\n\r\ndefined   as  a  member  of  the  Board  in  the  Bill,   but\r\n\r\ntraditionally  that  person has been  appointed  as  a  Board\r\n\r\nmember.  So it is a question of whether you want to define it\r\n\r\nor  leave  it  in the appointment process to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere is this wide representation of views and the people who\r\n\r\nare appointed come from both the public sector as well as the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  and  from the different fields  of  nursing,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are nursing midwives or psychiatric nurses,  so\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  broad enough to make sure that  the  Board  can\r\n\r\ndischarge  its  duties effectively, ie, to set the  standards\r\n\r\nand to regulate the registration and enrolment of nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar comment on the Chairman of the Board. I agree\r\n\r\nthat  there  are some pros and cons in defining  whether  the\r\n\r\nChairman should be a registered nurse and that is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy we have made\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit broader.  Previously, the Director of Medical Services has\r\n\r\ntraditionally  been  the Chairman of  the  Singapore  Nursing\r\n\r\nBoard.   Personally, I do see great advantages in having  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Medical Services as Chairman of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNursing Board as opposed to insisting that the Chairman  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  registered nurse.  But in this Bill, we have broadened\r\n\r\nthe  scope  and  therefore it is entirely possible  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture  Chairman can be a registered nurse or he can continue\r\n\r\nto  be  the Director of Medical Services or indeed any  other\r\n\r\nperson who can lead the Board effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also clarify that the function of the Board is\r\n\r\nessentially  to  regulate the registration and  enrolment  of\r\n\r\nnurses.    So  we  are  not  setting  up  the  Board   as   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  to  look  out for the  salaries,  conditions,\r\n\r\npractices,  etc.  So we want to appoint people who  have  the\r\n\r\nqualifications to regulate the registration and enrolment and\r\n\r\nthe  practice of nursing.  Therefore, although we  want  fair\r\n\r\nrepresentation,  this  is not a trade union  committee  which\r\n\r\nmust have representatives from every group to make sure their\r\n\r\ninterests are taken care of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next deal with clause 17 where Dr Lily Neo\r\n\r\ncommented about the definition of what is good reputation  or\r\n\r\ngood  conduct.  This provision is a fairly standard provision\r\n\r\nin  all  the  professional  Acts, whether  it  is  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession,  engineers, etc.  There  is  always  this  clause\r\n\r\nwhich  says persons must be of good reputation and character.\r\n\r\nI  think we do have a fairly good understanding of what  that\r\n\r\nmeans.  In the case of the nursing profession, in fact,  this\r\n\r\nis  outlined  in the Code of Ethics and Professional  Conduct\r\n\r\nwhich is issued by the Singapore Nursing Board in March  this\r\n\r\nyear.   And the definition which Dr Lily Neo pointed  out  is\r\n\r\nvery much included in this code.  So I think basically we are\r\n\r\ntalking about the same thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Dr Lily Neo also asked whether in not\r\n\r\nregistering a nurse because of overseas regulatory practices,\r\n\r\nwould  we  make  an  effort to find out  the  reason  why  an\r\n\r\nequivalent overseas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulatory  body did not register the same  nurse.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis is the current practice.  If the Singapore Nursing Board\r\n\r\ndecides  not  to register somebody because that somebody  did\r\n\r\nnot  receive  registration overseas, we would  find  out  the\r\n\r\nreasons.   In not registering the nurse, we would  also  give\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  to  the applicant why her registration  is  not\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to outline all these in specific\r\n\r\ndetails  in  the Bill.  The Bill is intended to set  out  the\r\n\r\ngeneral provisions and the details would be in the subsidiary\r\n\r\nregulations.  Members can be assured that the best  practices\r\n\r\nwill be maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 deals with the term that the conviction is\r\n\r\nfinal and conclusive.  Let me clarify that this is to be seen\r\n\r\nin  conjunction with clause 19.  We have this clause 22 which\r\n\r\nsays that any conviction for a criminal offence is final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive.  If somebody is convicted by the courts, we  will\r\n\r\ntake  that  as a starting point and treat that as  final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive.  But then the Board itself, when deciding whether\r\n\r\nthe   application  is  to  be  registered,  will  take   this\r\n\r\nconviction  and  consider whether the  nurse  is  fit  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered as a nurse.  So the criminal offence is just taken\r\n\r\nto be final and conclusive and then starting from that point,\r\n\r\nwe  will assess whether that offence has any relevance to the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  the nurse.  The final criterion  really  is\r\n\r\nwhether the nurse is fit to be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 is regarding the three-year de-registration\r\n\r\nperiod.  This is to make a distinction between suspension and\r\n\r\nde-registration.  The Bill provides for a range of penalties.\r\n\r\nIf  the offences are not so severe, then of course the  Board\r\n\r\ncan  impose a period of suspension and the maximum period  of\r\n\r\nsuspension is two years.  And therefore anything more  severe\r\n\r\nthan  that  which requires de-registration must obviously  be\r\n\r\nabove  two  years.  So the minimum period for de-registration\r\n\r\nis stipulated as three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also questioned whether the term \"due\r\n\r\ndiligence\" requires a higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel of care than reasonable diligence.  My understanding is\r\n\r\nthat  both  have  similar connotations  and,  that  is,  that\r\n\r\nsomebody  must take proper and due care in making  sure  that\r\n\r\nwhoever  is practising as a nurse or who purports to practise\r\n\r\nas a nurse is duly qualified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the whole issue of nursing\r\n\r\nspecialist.   I agree with both Members' comments  that  with\r\n\r\nadvances in medical technology, there will be a greater  role\r\n\r\nfor  nursing specialist within our system.  The provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  provides for the setting up of a nurse  specialist\r\n\r\nregister.  We intend that the details of that register to  be\r\n\r\nset out in subsidiary regulations and not put in the main Act\r\n\r\nitself.  Because it is still in its early stages.  We have to\r\n\r\ndecide  how  we want to set out the criteria for  determining\r\n\r\nthe different categories of nursing specialists, whether they\r\n\r\nrequire Masters degree or years of practice or different post-graduate qualifications.  All this will be stipulated in  the\r\n\r\nsubsidiary regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area which is critical and very important is\r\n\r\nthe  whole idea of registration and how to prevent people who\r\n\r\ndo not have the qualifications from practising as nurses.   I\r\n\r\nagree with Mdm Claire Chiang that, with an ageing population,\r\n\r\nwe  need a wider range of health care and nursing care people\r\n\r\nto  look after the different levels of care.  What this  Bill\r\n\r\nintends to do is only to set out the criteria for registering\r\n\r\nand  enrolling nurses.  So this Bill does not cover the other\r\n\r\nareas  of health care personnel, such as care givers,  health\r\n\r\ncare  assistants, etc.  The Bill is strictly defined to cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  registration of nurses.  In the  Bill  itself,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of who constitutes or who will qualify as a  nurse\r\n\r\nis  clearly spelt out.  For the other para-professionals  who\r\n\r\nare  involved in caring for the elderly, we will have to deal\r\n\r\nwith that separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the topic of continuing education and\r\n\r\nupgrading,  I  agree with the sentiments that  nurses  should\r\n\r\nkeep up with what is going on in their profession. It is  our\r\n\r\nintention  to  make the avenues for continuing education  and\r\n\r\nupgrading as accessible and easily available as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible,  so as to encourage all our nurses to  continue  to\r\n\r\nupgrade. We will assess whether this needs to be mandatory in\r\n\r\ndue  course, in the same way as the Singapore Medical Council\r\n\r\nis  putting  in  place  a  mechanism for  continuing  medical\r\n\r\neducation.  We  will do the same for the Nursing  Board,  and\r\n\r\nwhether to make it mandatory, we will cross the bridge in due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final comment on correspondence courses. Although I\r\n\r\nam  in favour of everybody upgrading, in the field of nursing\r\n\r\nwhere  really a lot of the skills are hands-on, I would  have\r\n\r\nsome  reservations  in  liberally accrediting  correspondence\r\n\r\ncourses.   I  think  correspondence courses  make  sense  for\r\n\r\nnurses  who  want  to upgrade themselves  in  terms  of  care\r\n\r\nmanagement  and nursing administration.  But for purposes  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a  clinical specialist, I would have some reservations\r\n\r\non  correspondence  courses.  But we will  review  the  whole\r\n\r\nscheme  of  where and how our nurses ought to be trained  and\r\n\r\nputting  the  details of the accreditation to the Specialists\r\n\r\nRegister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nvision  that  best  practices  will  be  maintained  in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  provisions of  this  Bill.

The Bill does provide\r\n\r\nfor three members of the Board to be non-nurses and it is our\r\n\r\nintention  that  that three persons will  represent  the  lay\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to inform the\r\n\r\nMinister   that   the  President  of  the  Singapore   Nurses\r\n\r\nAssociation has not been admitted to the Board for  the  last\r\n\r\nfive  years and therefore, I would like him to look into this\r\n\r\nmatter.   The second point is whether he will please  comment\r\n\r\non  the request for a Deputy Chair being a certified nurse if\r\n\r\nhe  thinks the Director of Medical Services should assume the\r\n\r\nposition of Chairman.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> If I may just add\r\n\r\nmy  voice  to Dr Neo's and Ms Chiang's in the matter  of  the\r\n\r\nChairperson for the Nursing Board. We have talked a lot about\r\n\r\npromoting  nursing as a career and engendering pride  in  the\r\n\r\nprofession  and  if, in fact, the Ministry would  consider  a\r\n\r\nregistered nurse as Chair of the Board, it would  be  such  a\r\n\r\nclear and much appreciated indication of the Ministry's faith\r\n\r\nand  confidence in the leadership capabilities of the nursing\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not want to belabour the point.\r\n\r\nBasically, the main criteria for appointment to the Singapore\r\n\r\nNursing  Board  must  be  the qualifications  of  the  person\r\n\r\nhimself rather than who he or she represents.  But as I said,\r\n\r\nin making sure that the composition of the Board represents a\r\n\r\nwide  section of the nursing profession, we will, of  course,\r\n\r\ndraw  members  from  the  public  and  private  sectors,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Nursing Association, different  types  of  nursing\r\n\r\nprofession,  etc, and we will send the right signals  to  the\r\n\r\nnursing profession that the Board would represent and be  the\r\n\r\nappropriate Board which is competent enough to regulate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specifics, the President of the Singapore Nursing\r\n\r\nAssociation was a member from 1993-1996. She is not a  member\r\n\r\nin   this   current   Board,  but  we   will   consider   the\r\n\r\nqualifications of the President on its own merits. For Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman, that is another flexibility which the Minister has.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Minister  thinks  that  there  is  a  need  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment   of   a   Deputy  Chairman   to   increase   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  the  Board, I am  sure  that  the  present\r\n\r\nMinister   and   future  Ministers  will   take   that   into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

May I remind the\r\n\r\nMembers that the subject is not about any abstract value.  It\r\n\r\nmay be intangible, but is more valuable than any tangibles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of law is what sets a civilised society apart\r\n\r\nfrom other societies that do not observe the rule of law.  So\r\n\r\nit  is not an abstract airy-fairy rule that is propounded  or\r\n\r\nshouted  out by left wing liberals, but it is something  that\r\n\r\nis so fundamental in any society that believes itself to be a\r\n\r\ncivilised society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have to make a strong case on the first\r\n\r\nstatement  that  the House recognises the importance  of  the\r\n\r\nrule  of  law,  because we have had, many a  time,  Ministers\r\n\r\ndeclaring how Singapore scrupulously obeys the rule  of  law.\r\n\r\nSo   there   is  an  admission  that  Singapore  scrupulously\r\n\r\nrecognises the rule of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government often talks about having the fundamentals\r\n\r\ncorrect,  and  they pride themselves that  in  Singapore  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals are correct and laid down.  May I say  that  the\r\n\r\nrule  of  law is the first basic fundamental for any society.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the only guarantee of the subject's freedom.  Without\r\n\r\nthe  rule of law, the subject lives in a state of uncertainty\r\n\r\nand in a state of bewilderment and consequently of fear.  But\r\n\r\nwhere the rule of law obtains in all its fullest extent,  the\r\n\r\ncitizen can live happily, breathe freely, knowing that he  is\r\n\r\nruled only by the law and  not by anything else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this rule, citizens are ruled by the law and the\r\n\r\nlaw alone.  We have had, only this afternoon, the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  saying that it was important to send a strong  message\r\n\r\nto  those who blatantly and flagrantly disregard the law.  My\r\n\r\nparty says\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namen to that.  The question is: is the Government exempt from\r\n\r\nthis  scrupulous observance of the Rule of Law?  And that  is\r\n\r\nwhat the House has to decide this afternoon.  I have no doubt\r\n\r\nwhat the outcome of this motion will be.  But what this House\r\n\r\nhas   to  ponder  is  whether  the  Government  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ndisregards the law, or is it only its citizens who refuse  to\r\n\r\nattend  and  answer  court summonses?  We  have  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  in Singapore it is a  society  that  lives\r\n\r\nunder  the rule of law or whether it is a society that  lives\r\n\r\nunder a government that acts by decree rather than under law.\r\n\r\nIt is a question that we have got to face and answer.  Is the\r\n\r\nsociety  in Singapore a civilised society  living  under  the\r\n\r\nrule of law?  Or is it a society more akin to a society ruled\r\n\r\nby a Mafia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know these are strong words but the question has to be\r\n\r\nasked  and answered.  If the rule of law does not obtain  and\r\n\r\ncitizens cannot live in the certainty that all their  actions\r\n\r\nwill  be judged only by the law and by nothing else, and they\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  punished by the law and not by any  arbitrary\r\n\r\npower  on  the part of the Minister, it is no better  than  a\r\n\r\ndictatorship, where a dictator rules by decree.  May I  quote\r\n\r\nto  this House what one of the finest writers from Africa and\r\n\r\na Nobel Laureate, Mr Wole Soyinka, from Nigeria, wrote in his\r\n\r\nbook  The Open Sore of a Continent.  And these are his words,\r\n\r\n\"Under  a  dictatorship, a nation ceases to exist.  All  that\r\n\r\nremains  is  a fiefdom, a planet of slaves.\"  How true  those\r\n\r\nwords are.  If it is a dictatorship, ruled by decree, then it\r\n\r\nis no longer a nation but a fiefdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also inform the Members that the proposition of\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  law  that  it is an absolute  fundamental  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  before citizens can live in peace and  freedom  is\r\n\r\nnot  something new.  It is not a novel concept.  Its  origins\r\n\r\ncan  perhaps  be  traced back to the 13th  century  when  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Barons met at Runnymede to curtail and  to  restrict\r\n\r\nthe  powers  of  the Monarch.  Before that, the  Monarch  was\r\n\r\nruling  at  will,  doing what he wished and  restricting  the\r\n\r\nliberties of his subjects.  And so the Barons gathered to put\r\n\r\nan end to this rule by the Monarch without any law\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand they passed a number of declarations.  These declarations\r\n\r\nwere  later accepted by the Monarch, Henry III, I think,  and\r\n\r\ncame to be known as the Magna Carta, the great Charter.   And\r\n\r\nclause  39 is revealing.  One can see the origins of all  our\r\n\r\nrecent  declarations in this clause, and if I may read clause\r\n\r\n39:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disused or\r\n\r\noutlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed nor will  we  send\r\n\r\nupon him except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the\r\n\r\nlaw of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  are  laying down, telling the Monarch that no free  man\r\n\r\nshall  be  taken, exiled, his liberty destroyed  in  any  way\r\n\r\nexcept  by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law  of\r\n\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 says, \"To no one will we sell, deny or delay\r\n\r\nright or justice.\"  As I have said, they were embodied in the\r\n\r\nGreat  Charter issued back in the time of Henry  III  at  the\r\n\r\nrequest of the Barons and became a foundation for the society\r\n\r\nin  England.  One of the reasons why despite the Government's\r\n\r\nassertion,  often repeated, that in Singapore the  Government\r\n\r\nobserves the rule of law scrupulously and it is seen  in  its\r\n\r\nfullest  extent, and the critics saying something  quite  the\r\n\r\nopposite,  that  there is no rule of law in Singapore  today,\r\n\r\nmay  be  due  to  a  misconception as to what  is  meant  and\r\n\r\nunderstood  by the Rule of Law.  Therefore, it  is  important\r\n\r\nthat  we try and understand what we mean when we say  of  the\r\n\r\nRule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the mentor of the leaders of this Government,\r\n\r\nConfucius himself, recognised the importance of giving things\r\n\r\ntheir correct names.  He was asked by a disciple, \"What  will\r\n\r\nbe your first task if you are given the charge of a country?\"\r\n\r\nHis  answer was, \"Rectify the names.\"  When he was  asked  to\r\n\r\nexplain, he was reported to have said, \"If the names are  not\r\n\r\ncorrect,  if  they do not match realities,  language  has  no\r\n\r\nobject.   If  language is without an object,  action  becomes\r\n\r\nimpossible.   Therefore, all human affairs disintegrate,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  management becomes impossible.  Hence, the very  first\r\n\r\ntask of a true statesman is to rectify the names.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the need to try and name things properly is\r\n\r\nrecognised by Confucius\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself.   Perhaps I should try and say something about  what\r\n\r\nis  understood by the Rule of Law.  This term,  the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  came into prominence when Prof. A. V. Dicey, a Vinerian\r\n\r\nProfessor of English law, propounded it.  He saw the Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw  to  consist  of  two  main parts.   \"One,  the  absolute\r\n\r\nsupremacy  or predominance of regular law as opposed  to  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  arbitrary power and excludes the existence  of\r\n\r\narbitrariness,  of prerogative or even of wide  discretionary\r\n\r\nauthority on the part of the Government.  Subjects are  ruled\r\n\r\nby  the  law and by the law alone.  A subject can be punished\r\n\r\nfor  a  breach  of law but they can be punished  for  nothing\r\n\r\nelse.\"   He  continues: \"In this sense, rule of law contrasts\r\n\r\nwith  every  system of Government based on  the  exercise  by\r\n\r\npersons  in  authority  of  wide arbitrary  or  discretionary\r\n\r\npowers of constraint.\"  That is the first meaning of the Rule\r\n\r\nof Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The second sense of this\r\n\r\nmeaning of the Rule of Law is that every subject, whatever be\r\n\r\nhis rank\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and\r\n\r\namenable  to  the  jurisdiction of  the  ordinary  tribunals.\r\n\r\nEvery  official, from the Prime Minister down to a  constable\r\n\r\nor a collector of taxes, is under the same responsibility for\r\n\r\nevery  act  done  without legal justification  as  any  other\r\n\r\ncitizen.  He adds a third sense, which is that, Rule  of  Law\r\n\r\nis part of the common law and has been propounded by judicial\r\n\r\ndecisions  rather  than by any written constitution.   He  is\r\n\r\nspeaking of course of England of the United Kingdom.  But  he\r\n\r\ncontinues to say that in developing countries, this  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  incorporated into their written constitutions.   So  it\r\n\r\nhas in our Singapore Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said once before that when we decided to break\r\n\r\naway  from  the  British rule, we nevertheless  decided,  all\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  gathering  together  and  deciding  as  a\r\n\r\npeople,  that  we  will  opt  for the  Westminster  style  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  and for the institutions that were applicable  in\r\n\r\nEngland  and, of course, as they were applicable in Singapore\r\n\r\nat  that  time.   The  common  law  had  been  imported  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  19th  century  and  the  institutions  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   followed  exactly  the  Westminster   style   of\r\n\r\nGovernment.  So we decided that we would have not  any  other\r\n\r\nsystem.  This was a deliberate conscious choice of the people\r\n\r\nmade  through  their political parties before the  delegation\r\n\r\nwent  to  London.   And as I have said,  the  present  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister was, of course, a member of that delegation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have a Constitution. These principles of the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law are to be found in our Constitution.  They  are\r\n\r\nthere.    They   are  no  longer  dependent   upon   judicial\r\n\r\ninterpretations and declarations of the Rule of Law.  It  has\r\n\r\nbecome part of the Constitution.  The Constitution, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  is  an act of the people.  It is the people's charter.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the charter by which the people have bound themselves\r\n\r\nto  live  together as a society.  So we find these principles\r\n\r\nof  the  Rule of Law in our Constitution and they are  to  be\r\n\r\nfound  -  I am not going to read them for want of time  -  in\r\n\r\nArticles 9 and 12 of the Constitution.  There are also  other\r\n\r\nArticles.  They are all to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound  in  Part  II,  I think, which enacts  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nliberties  of  the people.  But the most important  ones  are\r\n\r\nArticles 9 and 12.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One also has to understand what is meant by the term\r\n\r\n\"law\" in the phrase \"Rule of Law\".  In a case that went up to\r\n\r\nthe  Privy  Council, in the case of Ong Ah Chuan  versus  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor, concerning the question whether a certain\r\n\r\nprovision in an Act (I think it was the Misuse of Drugs  Act)\r\n\r\nwas  contrary to the provisions of the Constitution,  it  was\r\n\r\nargued  for the Government of Singapore that the Act was  not\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the Constitution because it had been  passed  by\r\n\r\nParliament following the procedure set for the passing of law\r\n\r\nby  the  Constitution.  So it had been regularly  passed  and\r\n\r\ntherefore that was law, and that was all that we had to  look\r\n\r\nat.  The Privy Council had no hesitation in rejecting that  - to  confine  law just to written law passed by Parliament  or\r\n\r\nthe  legislature.  Lord Diplock, delivering the  judgment  of\r\n\r\nthe Privy Council said this:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In a Constitution founded on the Westminster model and\r\n\r\nparticularly  in that part of it that purports to  assure  to\r\n\r\nall   individual   citizens  the   continued   enjoyment   of\r\n\r\nfundamental  liberties or right, references to  law  in  such\r\n\r\ncontext  as  'in accordance with law', 'equality  before  the\r\n\r\nlaw',  'protection  of  the law' and  their  like,  in  their\r\n\r\nLordship's  view, refer to a system of law which incorporates\r\n\r\nthose  fundamental rules of natural justice that  had  formed\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel of the common law of England  that  was  in\r\n\r\noperation   in   Singapore  at  the   commencement   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   It would have been taken for granted  by  the\r\n\r\nmakers  of  the  Constitution that the law to which  citizens\r\n\r\ncould   have  recourse  for  the  protection  of  fundamental\r\n\r\nliberties  assured  to them by the Constitution  would  be  a\r\n\r\nsystem of law that did not flout those fundamental rules.  If\r\n\r\nit were otherwise, it would be misuse of language to speak of\r\n\r\nlaw  as something which affords protection for the individual\r\n\r\nin  the  enjoyment  of  its  fundamental  liberties  and  the\r\n\r\npurported  entrenchment by Article 5  of  Articles  9(1)  and\r\n\r\n12(1) will be little better than a mockery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So law is not just the Acts passed by Parliament but the\r\n\r\nfundamental rules of natural justice that have been  accepted\r\n\r\nand  become part and parcel of the common law and  which,  as\r\n\r\nthey  say,  and  which I have been saying,  was  the  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in operation before that.  I was talking about  the\r\n\r\nmisconception.  And it comes to my mind that sometime in  the\r\n\r\n1980s when I was in this House, there was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  debate on the Internal Security Act.  I said then that the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the  Act providing for detention  of  persons\r\n\r\nunder an order of the Minister was a blatant negation of  the\r\n\r\nRule  of Law.  I said there was no question about it, because\r\n\r\nit  blatantly  disregarded the fundamental rules  of  natural\r\n\r\njustice.   The then Minister for Home Affairs, Mr  Chua  Sian\r\n\r\nChin,  in  replying asked: \"Is the Member trying to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Internal  Security Act is not law?  It  was  not  passed\r\n\r\nproperly?\"  There you have the misconception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an Act of Parliament can violate the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\nIt  can  violate  the  Constitution  and  that  is  specially\r\n\r\nprovided by the Constitution which says that any Act which is\r\n\r\ninconsistent or contrary to the Articles of this Constitution\r\n\r\nshall to that extent be void.  And further by Article 162, it\r\n\r\nenjoins  the Government and the courts to modify,  alter  and\r\n\r\ninterpret  Articles  in  any law so as  to  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nArticles  in the Constitution, if that law seems to  conflict\r\n\r\nwith  anything in the Constitution.  So it is  no  answer  to\r\n\r\nsay, \"Oh, we have the law, and that is it.\"  The question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  that  law  itself  violates  the  Rule  of  Law   as\r\n\r\nunderstood through the centuries.  That is the main question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough to try to define what we are\r\n\r\ntalking about when we say the Rule of Law is supreme and what\r\n\r\nis  meant by the Rule of Law.  I must now proceed without any\r\n\r\nfurther delay  -  I see time is running on  -  to list what I\r\n\r\nsee  to be the instances or examples of the violation of this\r\n\r\nfundamental principle of the Rule of Law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after I have listed them, I shall\r\n\r\nproceed  to  set  out what I think the Government  should  do\r\n\r\nimmediately, and then return back to this list of  violations\r\n\r\nto try and explain how they violate the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first on my list of the examples of violation of the\r\n\r\nRule of Law is, of course, as has been asserted by us many  a\r\n\r\ntime,  the  arrest  and  detention of persons  without  trial\r\n\r\npurely  on the arbitrary power invested by Parliament albeit,\r\n\r\non the Minister.  A person in Singapore can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetained without trial under the Internal Security Act, under\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and  also  under\r\n\r\nthe  Misuse of Drugs Act, although some justification may  be\r\n\r\nfound for the detention under the Misuse of Drugs Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the arrest by police officers and other\r\n\r\nlaw enforcement officers without informing the subject of the\r\n\r\ncharge.   It  is absolutely important under the Rule  of  Law\r\n\r\nthat  a  person's liberty should not be deprived.  He  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  deprived  of his liberty, or in any  way  restrained\r\n\r\nunless  he is first told of the law under which that  can  be\r\n\r\ndone, and why it should be done.  Also incidental to this  is\r\n\r\nthe  searches - search of a person's house carried out by the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  other law enforcement agencies.  There  again  a\r\n\r\ncitizen is entitled to insist that any search of his house be\r\n\r\nstrictly in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the denial of the right to counsel - denial\r\n\r\nof  the  right of arrested persons to counsel and  to  visits\r\n\r\nfrom families for a period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is the denial of bail by the courts even\r\n\r\nwithout adequate reasons.  I am referring to the often  heard\r\n\r\nrequest from police officers prosecuting to ask for a  remand\r\n\r\nin  Police  custody  when the accused is  first  produced  in\r\n\r\ncourt.   As  I  said  once before, usually  that  request  is\r\n\r\ngranted  without  any  inquiry, and I shall  explain  why  it\r\n\r\nviolates the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the one which we the Opposition have often raised\r\n\r\n-   it  is  the  fifth one  -  the denial of the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech  and  assembly.  That violates the Rule of  Law.   And\r\n\r\nwhen I say about freedom of speech and assembly, of course, I\r\n\r\nam also referring to the freedom of the newspapers to publish\r\n\r\n-   the freedom of the press.  That is part and parcel of the\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, denial of reasons for executive decisions and\r\n\r\nshutting out appeals to the courts.  As I shall say,  now  in\r\n\r\nalmost every Act, one finds this denial of reasons for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecisions and not allowing any recourse to the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, the restrictions on the right to travel in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the impounding of passports without an  order  of\r\n\r\ncourt.  When I come to illustrate, I shall, of course,  refer\r\n\r\nto  the  case of Mdm Teo Siew Har whose passport was detained\r\n\r\nfor several months for no reason at all under the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the eighth on the list - the power given\r\n\r\nto  the Housing and Development Board to throw out lessees or\r\n\r\ntenants  without having to take them to court.  That  is,  if\r\n\r\never  there was one, a clear violation of the person's rights\r\n\r\nand  the  Rule of Law.  Then we also have the suspension  and\r\n\r\ncancellation of people's licences by executive officials, and\r\n\r\nI  have  in  mind, of course, the licences of  taxi  drivers,\r\n\r\nwithout a proper judicial inquiry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have in Singapore an abundance of power exercised\r\n\r\nby  the executive through its officials which offend the Rule\r\n\r\nof  Law.   That  is the first limb  -  that no one  shall  be\r\n\r\narrested,  deprived of anything, except under the law.   Now,\r\n\r\nif  I  may  come to the second limb  -  the equality  of  all\r\n\r\npersons  under  the law, and as Prof. Dicey  says,  from  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister down to the constable they are equal under the\r\n\r\nlaw.   No one is more equal than another under the law.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  is  not  more equal  than  a  postman  or  a\r\n\r\ncollector  of  rubbish.  And under this, I  have  about  four\r\n\r\nheads,  and  that is, the blatant violations during  election\r\n\r\ntime  by  Government and Ministers to secure the  victory  of\r\n\r\ntheir  party,  the  ruling party, including  intimidation  of\r\n\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have clearly the law not evenly applied as\r\n\r\nbetween  one  party and another.  Then we have the  case  not\r\n\r\nvery  long ago where it was seen that the law was not  evenly\r\n\r\napplied.   The  purchase of apartments  in  Nassim  Road  and\r\n\r\nScotts 28 by Ministers and public officials.  I shall explain\r\n\r\nwhy  I  say  that also seems to imply  that some persons  are\r\n\r\nmore  equal  than others.  Of course, I shall  explain  that.\r\n\r\nBut  let  me assure the House, in case an attempt is made  to\r\n\r\nassert that I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggesting corruption, I am not.  All I am saying is the  law\r\n\r\nshould be evenly applied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the disparate treatment of Opposition\r\n\r\npolitical parties in their applications for licences to  hold\r\n\r\ntheir activities or conduct their programmes.  I will explain\r\n\r\nthat if I have the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, we have the just recently concluded\r\n\r\ninstance of the President's election.  I shall explain why it\r\n\r\nis  a  violation of the Rule of Law and violates particularly\r\n\r\nArticle 12 of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on and say what I think should be done as\r\n\r\na  priority by this Government.  And we said this before,  we\r\n\r\nare  approaching  the end of the century, we are  approaching\r\n\r\nthe  end of the millennium and we keep talking about the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   These steps have to be done immediately before  we\r\n\r\ngo  too  far  into the 21st century.  And I am commending  to\r\n\r\nthis  Government  that they immediately  take  the  following\r\n\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to repeal the provisions in the Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct   providing  for  detention  without  trial.   They   are\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no longer necessary for our society in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey are an open sore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, repeal the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)\r\n\r\nAct.   That also is not necessary in our society today.  Both\r\n\r\nthese Acts may be convenient to the Government.  But that  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  criterion, that is not the test.  The test  is  the\r\n\r\npeople's liberties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to preserve the people's liberties. I\r\n\r\ndo  not ask the Government to repeal the Misuse of Drugs Act.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think they should have another look at the Misuse  of\r\n\r\nDrugs  Act  and see whether it contains sufficient safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst unfairly depriving a person of his liberty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\namending the law relating to public meetings and processions.\r\n\r\nThis  comes  under  the  freedom of  speech  and  freedom  of\r\n\r\nassembly  so  as  to give full weight to the Article  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, repeal the provisions in the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Act  which empowers the Board  to  evict  people\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to  take  them to court.   The  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  acts  as  the  accuser,  the  Judge,  the\r\n\r\nexecutioner.   It is unheard of.  But in Singapore,  we  have\r\n\r\nhad this for some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, I am seriously suggesting to this Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  police  force  should be taken  out  of  political\r\n\r\ncontrol.   It  should  no longer come under  the  control  or\r\n\r\ndirection  of  the  political masters.  And  likewise,  I  am\r\n\r\nproposing  that the CPIB be also removed from the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  political masters.  I shall, if I have the time,  expand\r\n\r\non all this a bit more.  But it may not be possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of examples I have given of the violations in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is, by no means, exhaustive.  I could  add  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore.   But I have tried to pick out what I thought were  the\r\n\r\nvery major serious violations of the Rule of Law.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  other  violations and, equally, my recommendations  are\r\n\r\nonly  just  the beginning, ie, recommendations of  the  steps\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government must take immediately to establish  the\r\n\r\nRule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may move on and as quickly as possible try and\r\n\r\nexplain  why the Internal Security Act violates the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw.  Under the Act, as I have said, it is just the Minister,\r\n\r\nand  there is no way of checking the Minister's decision, who\r\n\r\ndecides  to make an order detaining a subject, depriving  him\r\n\r\nof  his  liberty, completely contrary to the rule of  natural\r\n\r\njustice and the fundamental principle that all men are  free.\r\n\r\nThe  Constitution itself provides for a situation  when  this\r\n\r\nright  may  be  restrained and, that is in Part  XII  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, that is when there is an emergency, when  there\r\n\r\nis  a  determined group of people resorting to unlawful means\r\n\r\nto   bring   down  the  Government  and  the  society.    The\r\n\r\nConstitution says in that situation, you have to pass an  Act\r\n\r\nof  Parliament and then you can restrain their liberties  and\r\n\r\nrestrict them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any other conditions? And that was the case\r\n\r\nwhen the British passed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency  Regulations.  Under the colonial  government,\r\n\r\nEmergency   Regulations  were  a  purely  temporary   affair,\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  deal  with  what they thought  and  saw  as  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  threat  to  the  country  from  people  who   were\r\n\r\ndetermined to break down the Government and create trouble in\r\n\r\nthe  society.   So they brought in the Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nand  they  were purely temporary, three months at a time  and\r\n\r\nthey  had  to be passed and renewed.  After we took over,  we\r\n\r\nretained  that  power  under the Public  Peace  and  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance (PPSO), giving the power to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Marshall who was a passionate believer in the Rule\r\n\r\nof  Law  and  a  believer in the freedom  of  the  individual\r\n\r\nhowever added a safeguard.  He introduced a court or tribunal\r\n\r\nof  three persons to whom an appeal may be made by the person\r\n\r\ndetained and who may release that person if the tribunal  was\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied  that it was necessary to detain  the  person.\r\n\r\nBut  the PAP, when they took over, and the great champion  of\r\n\r\npersonal liberty when Mr David Marshall was in power  -   the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  of  the  country   -   did  away  with  that\r\n\r\nprovision  appointing the tribunal and reverted  back  to  an\r\n\r\nadvisory  panel without any power to release.  The  power  is\r\n\r\nonly necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat\r\n\r\nand  so  we do not need it any more.  Let us for once realise\r\n\r\nthat  it is a violation of the Rule of Law.  Let us be honest\r\n\r\nand repeal it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act again was a\r\n\r\ntemporary  measure.  It was passed to deal  with  the  threat\r\n\r\nfrom  secret  societies in those days.  I remember  I  was  a\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge in those days having to record statements from\r\n\r\npersons who had been detained under this Act or Ordinance  in\r\n\r\nthose  days.   A  lot of them were later released  after  the\r\n\r\nstatements  were  recorded and it was established  that  they\r\n\r\nwere perhaps not members of any secret society.  So that  was\r\n\r\na  temporary measure and we do not need that now.  But now it\r\n\r\nis used for lots of other reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, my suggestion is that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be proper safeguards.  We should  require  the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Central Narcotics Bureau to get a court order\r\n\r\nbefore  a  person  is detained, present the evidence  to  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Judge or Magistrate and let the District  Judge  or\r\n\r\nMagistrate decide whether, on the medical evidence  presented\r\n\r\nhe  is  satisfied that the person is a drug addict  requiring\r\n\r\ntreatment,  to  make  an order for detention.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nprovision  under  the Mental Disorder Treatment  Act  and  we\r\n\r\nshould take that over into the Misuse of Drugs Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then about the arrests that I mentioned, that is, the\r\n\r\nsecond  violation. It is, as I said, the law that an  accused\r\n\r\nperson must be told the reason and the charge for which he is\r\n\r\narrested.   It  was declared so by the House of  Lords  many,\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago  in  what came to be known  as  the  Christy\r\n\r\nLynskey  case.  But in Singapore, persons are just picked up,\r\n\r\nnot  told  the reason, that alone the charge. They  are  just\r\n\r\ntold, \"Follow me or come to the CID or the CNB.\" And if  they\r\n\r\nask  why,  he is told, \"You will be told there.\"  That  is  a\r\n\r\nviolation of the Rule of Law.  You are interfering with  that\r\n\r\nperson's  liberty without any legal justifications.   Even  a\r\n\r\nminute's  interference of the person's liberty is unjustified\r\n\r\nunless  the  law  allows  it.   And  similarly,  with  search\r\n\r\nwarrants. There was the recent case and the Minister of State\r\n\r\nreplying  to it said, \"Oh, yes, but the Misuse of  Drugs  Act\r\n\r\nprovides.\"  Yes, I know it does.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up\r\n\r\nyour time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I shall be\r\n\r\nbrief.   I  know that Singapore has been voted as having  the\r\n\r\nbest  judicial system in this part of the world but  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  the  Rule of Law is not  purely  about  the\r\n\r\njudicial system.  It means more than that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rule of Law does not mean just plain justice that is\r\n\r\nobserved  in  our  courts.  I have no  complaints  about  our\r\n\r\ncourt's  function.  In fact, I think they are  doing  a  very\r\n\r\ngood job.  The Rule of Law to me\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans  that the Government, in its dealings with the  people,\r\n\r\nhas  to  be fair, transparent and predictable.  I cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's dealings with the Opposition  parties\r\n\r\nhave  been fair, transparent and predictable.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas  control  of  every  public function  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition parties are, of course, not happy with the way the\r\n\r\nGovernment  treats  them in regard to  applications  to  hold\r\n\r\nthose  functions.  The Opposition parties are treated  as  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  obligated  to  the  Government  and  have  to  get\r\n\r\npermission to organise any public functions such as  dinners,\r\n\r\nlantern festival or pasar malams. The Opposition do not  mind\r\n\r\napplying  for  permission  if they  are  done  for  a  purely\r\n\r\nadministrative purpose.  But asking for permission or licence\r\n\r\nis done more for political reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, when Opposition parties apply for a Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Licence or other applications, they do not get\r\n\r\na quick reply.  They are left in a limbo and have to wait for\r\n\r\na  long  time.   And  in their anxiety,  they  telephone  the\r\n\r\nappropriate department and they are told, surprisingly,  that\r\n\r\nthat  department is waiting for word from the  top.   We  are\r\n\r\njust  wondering whether a simple application for  permission,\r\n\r\nsay,  to  hold a lantern festival or a pasar malam or dinner,\r\n\r\nyou must wait for permission from the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked for examples. We have only just\r\n\r\nrecently  held  the 6th Anniversary Dinner of  our  Party  on\r\n\r\nSaturday,   20th   November.   We  applied   for   a   Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Licence on 16th October and our answer did not\r\n\r\ncome  until  15th  November, five days  before  the  function\r\n\r\nstarts. As you know, if you are organising a dinner, there is\r\n\r\na  lot  of  organising to do.  This uncertainty of whether  a\r\n\r\nlicence shall be given at all makes organising such functions\r\n\r\nvery difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the licence came, permission was given to karaoke\r\n\r\nsinging,   song  items  given  by  the  old  folks   at   the\r\n\r\nconstituency,  lion dance, lucky draws, but no speeches  were\r\n\r\nallowed.   I  was  taken aback. I am the  elected  Member  at\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir,  and  I  am  not  allowed  to  speak   to   my\r\n\r\nconstituents!  I had to hurriedly send an appeal to say,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Please  allow me to speak.\"  Their reply came,  \"All  right,\r\n\r\nyou  can  speak  but  only for ten minutes  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nthanking your constituents for coming and acknowledging their\r\n\r\nsponsorship and gifts that they have given to you.\"  I do not\r\n\r\nthink it reflects that we have the Rule of Law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking much. I am just asking the Government,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  deal  with the Opposition, let us have  fairness,\r\n\r\ntransparency  and a predictable system. So when  we  write  a\r\n\r\nletter  or  even before we hold a function, we know  what  is\r\n\r\ncoming, what is allowed and what is not allowed.  But  as  it\r\n\r\nis,  the  whole  situation is always very difficult  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith.   It  is  even now. You may like to know that  for  any\r\n\r\nfunction  if  we make an application, we do not get  a  reply\r\n\r\nuntil five days or so before the function starts.  So how can\r\n\r\nyou  hold  a function without having any anxiety? We  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether or not permission will be given, we do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  part of the programme will be  allowed,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking too much. I am just asking the\r\n\r\nGovernment, when it deals with the Opposition, please let  us\r\n\r\nhave fairness, transparency and predictability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, in this motion there is much\r\n\r\nto  agree  with.  But in the arguments put forward, there  is\r\n\r\nmuch I find that I cannot agree with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with what I do agree with. I agree that\r\n\r\nRule of Law is very important and I think all of us would.  I\r\n\r\nalso agree that the Rule of Law takes us beyond a very narrow\r\n\r\nlegalism, but that law is more than what we put on a piece of\r\n\r\npaper  and  pass  in  this House. There are  certain  natural\r\n\r\nattributes to law. That I agree.  When you agree that law  is\r\n\r\nmore than legalism, you look for some idea of fairness.   But\r\n\r\nthere,  we  can disagree.  What may seem fair to me  may  not\r\n\r\nseem  fair  to another person or to NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam,  who\r\n\r\nmoved   this   motion.   In  this  sense,  we  must   quickly\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between  the  fair  procedure  of  law  and  the\r\n\r\nfairness  in  substance of law.  For procedure,  we  find  it\r\n\r\neasier to agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion and his arguments, I tried to\r\n\r\nlisten to NCMP Jeyaretnam carefully.  I think there are  some\r\n\r\nproblems in his arguments in terms not so much of this  broad\r\n\r\nidea  of the Rule of Law but in his complaints and instances.\r\n\r\nThis  relates specifically to certain dichotomies, the  first\r\n\r\nof  these is an abstract perfection of what is Rule  of  Law,\r\n\r\nagainst  the  reality  of a working system,  the  society  in\r\n\r\nmotion,  in  action.  When we compare any  society  to  those\r\n\r\nabstract  perfections, there are shortcomings,  instances  of\r\n\r\nweakness or areas of improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then have to ask myself, when I listened to the\r\n\r\ninstances brought forward by the NCMP, whether this speaks of\r\n\r\na  systemic abuse and failure of the Rule of Law, or  whether\r\n\r\nthese  instances  are  just that,  instances.   If  they  are\r\n\r\ninstances,  there is recourse to the Rule of Law itself,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  the  day or certain  officials  are  not\r\n\r\nfulfilling  the Rule of Law, there are other ways of  getting\r\n\r\nthe  Rule of Law done and observed, and this is to go to  the\r\n\r\ncourts.   And  on this, I found the MP for Potong  Pasir,  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  See  Tong's argument is of dual-headed.   He  says  he\r\n\r\ntrusts  the  courts.  He himself pointed out that our  courts\r\n\r\nare  one  of  the  most respected.  Yet, he complained  about\r\n\r\ncertain  systems of unfairness. The answer must  be,  if  the\r\n\r\ncourts are fair, but there are instances of difficulty in his\r\n\r\nview, he must go to the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that in recent years, there\r\n\r\nhave been a number of cases in which people have done exactly\r\n\r\nthat.  They have taken hard cases to the courts and they have\r\n\r\nwon against the Government. There was the Eddie Taw's case on\r\n\r\nthe  constitutionality of Prevention of Corruption Act. There\r\n\r\nwas  the  Christopher's Bridges' case on the Official Secrets\r\n\r\nAct.   There  was a recent decision against the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower on certain actions they took in arbitrating  between\r\n\r\nemployer and employee in which the courts felt that they have\r\n\r\nover-exceeded their powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further back, the courts have also struck down\r\n\r\ndecisions  by  the Housing and Development Board,   which  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  mentioned, as well as the Registry  of  Companies\r\n\r\nand  Businesses.  My point is, if our system  is  endemically\r\n\r\nweak,  the whole system is bad,  then we really have to  call\r\n\r\nfor  this  motion.  But if there are only limited  instances,\r\n\r\nthe very courts which Mr Chiam mentioned are the upholder  of\r\n\r\nthe Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one exception I think that NCMP Mr Jeyaretnam had on\r\n\r\nhis  cards  was the Internal Security Act (ISA). That,  as  a\r\n\r\nlaw,  the  ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense\r\n\r\nthat there are only very limited grounds on which a court can\r\n\r\nreview  the decision of the Minister.  It is in that sense  a\r\n\r\nsubjective discretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam then shared his idea on whether there was\r\n\r\na  need  for amendment, and called for the abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nISA.  When I first became an NMP, I was asked about this.  My\r\n\r\nview  was that the time has come to seriously re-look at  the\r\n\r\nISA.   I still think we should re-look at it.  But, in asking\r\n\r\nfor  this, I have had to re-look at some of my premises  too,\r\n\r\nbecause  in the last year, I asked in this House, and  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  we  do have present detainees under the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Act.  And why?  These are not political  detainees.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some allegations of espionage and  other  things.\r\n\r\nThis  was  all  released to the public after the  question  I\r\n\r\nasked in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that, in that sense, we are not arguing\r\n\r\nabout  preventive detention in abstract anymore.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nperfect  abstraction.  There was no public  furore  or  upset\r\n\r\nabout  these  recent  ISA  cases  when  they  were  announced\r\n\r\npublicly. As far as I know, the human rights Non-governmental\r\n\r\nOrganisations (NGOs) are not more upset than they  have  been\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore before. The NGOs have also never raised their\r\n\r\nhand  against  the  Criminal Law (Temporary  Provisions)  Act\r\n\r\nwhich  NCMP  Mr Jeyaretnam has mentioned today.   I  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that the NCMP himself has not completely questioned\r\n\r\nthe basis of the Misuse of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs Act.  It also has preventive detention powers.  This is\r\n\r\ntherefore an inconsistency in his stand.  So my point is that\r\n\r\nnone  of  these are we really arguing on principle,  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  yes  or  no,  black or white.   It  is  a  case-by-case\r\n\r\ndecision,  because that is how we live our lives  in  a  real\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP drew a lot of precedents from England. Can I\r\n\r\npoint  out  that while England has had a very good record  in\r\n\r\ntalking  about principles, of Rule of Law and  living  up  to\r\n\r\nmany of them, there are also shortcomings in their court,  as\r\n\r\nin  every country  -  emergency laws in Ireland to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  emergency there.  Many of the precedents that our courts\r\n\r\nfollow in accepting the subjective discretion of the Minister\r\n\r\ncome from English precedents.  So I would not think that  any\r\n\r\nsociety  has  all the answers.  I think of this particularly,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  thought this motion should be understood  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  not  so much of the past, which NCMP Jeyaretnam  has\r\n\r\ntried  to  re-establish for us, but in  the  context  of  the\r\n\r\npresent crisis in our region.  This crisis has been one  that\r\n\r\nhas also raised many questions about good governance, and one\r\n\r\nof the elements of good governance is the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transparency International, an NGO, has named\r\n\r\nSingapore   the  highest  ranked  country  in  Asia   against\r\n\r\ncorruption.   I  think it is the seventh  or  eighth  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   When you look at the region around us, you  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that there are many realities which do not measure\r\n\r\nup to the benchmarks of Transparency International.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Indonesia last week and I met with various\r\n\r\nofficials there.  They have a severe task in front  of  them.\r\n\r\nAn  old  acquaintance, Marzuki Darusman,  is   now  Attorney-General.  He, I think, and this is my personal belief,  is  a\r\n\r\nman  who  would try to make a difference, to try to establish\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of Law, but the institutions, the officials,  some\r\n\r\nare  good  and  some  are  not so good.   There  has  been  a\r\n\r\nsystemic  problem,  which we do not have in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nanswers, in this context, are much more complex and difficult\r\n\r\nthan ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Singapore is different - size, heritage, a\r\n\r\nGovernment that has been clean and not corrupt, and I do  not\r\n\r\nsay  that we are perfect.  But my point today is that if this\r\n\r\nmotion  was about the importance of the Rule of Law and  how,\r\n\r\nwithout being perfect, our Government has tried to observe it\r\n\r\nand  how  if Government does not observe it, then the  courts\r\n\r\nwill fill that gap, I would have agreed with the motion.  But\r\n\r\nas has been argued by the two speakers before me, I regret  I\r\n\r\ncannot support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, a question for Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you seeking a point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I am surprised that the NMP\r\n\r\nsays  that  I  should  go  to court  when  I  was  not  given\r\n\r\npermission to speak.  I have been a practising politician for\r\n\r\nover  20  years  now.  I would like to ask  him  whether  the\r\n\r\ndecision  not to allow me to speak is a judicial decision  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the Minister, or is it a political decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am really surprised that Mr Chiam does\r\n\r\nnot  understand  judicial  review.   Of  course,  it  is  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  official in charge, but  if  the  official\r\n\r\ntransgresses certain parameters of the law, if he  is  acting\r\n\r\nunreasonably, if he is acting unfairly without due cause,  if\r\n\r\nhe  has  favoured a PAP official and not Mr Chiam, these  are\r\n\r\nall subject to judicial review.  In this sense, while many of\r\n\r\nour  laws  do not have appeal to the courts, the  courts  use\r\n\r\njudicial  review to ensure that things observe  the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw.  Is that clear enough, Mr Chiam?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think it is difficult for us to go\r\n\r\ninto  a debate, because Mr Simon Tay is an academician and  I\r\n\r\nam speaking as a practical politician.  He thinks I am like a\r\n\r\ncry  baby, go to the court to get remedy.  To me, this  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  decision  and it has to be rectified  politically.\r\n\r\nAnd I think we know how to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the NCMP never fails to bore us, never\r\n\r\nfails to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow  us  that he lives in the past, never fails to  show  us\r\n\r\nthat  he is good in delivering lectures on very basic points,\r\n\r\nwhich  any first year law student would know.  For the  first\r\n\r\nalmost  30 minutes of his speech, he had talked about  things\r\n\r\nof  the  past  -  Magna Carta, Confucius  - things which  are\r\n\r\nnot   of  relevance  in  Singapore,  before  coming  to   the\r\n\r\nConstitution, which is what really matters.  He had mentioned\r\n\r\nbasic  points  that  any first year law student  would  know,\r\n\r\nwhich  I think highlights the fact that this motion is really\r\n\r\nunnecessary and gratuitous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he is right. We have heard enough of him, because\r\n\r\nthat is what he said in this House, and we truly agree.   Why\r\n\r\ndo  I  say  that this motion is not necessary and gratuitous?\r\n\r\nAs  Mr  Tay  and all of us believe, there is undoubtedly  the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law in Singapore.  And all our Ministers, officials\r\n\r\nand  public  servants fully observe the Rule of Law.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore absurd to even imply that the Rule of Law does  not\r\n\r\nprevail  in  Singapore.  Of course, he will  cite  instances,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will  deal  with later on.   But  again  these  are\r\n\r\ninstances which he culls from the past.  It is as though,  in\r\n\r\npreparation for this motion, he had gone through the  Hansard\r\n\r\nto  see  what  were  the points he had raised,  probably  re-reading his speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I did not do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. He probably went\r\n\r\nthrough  his files or his diary to see what points he raised.\r\n\r\nBut  he  did not read carefully the replies that were  given,\r\n\r\nbecause  he has raised all these points before.  I  was  very\r\n\r\ndiligent  in  trying to see what new points I could  counter.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is,  for example, rights of an  accused  person,\r\n\r\nright  to  counsel, right to be informed of  the  grounds  of\r\n\r\narrest,  or  our  preventive  detention  laws,  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Act,  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  Misuse of Drugs Act, or other matters such as Ministers'\r\n\r\nactions at the last general elections, or purchases of  flats\r\n\r\nat  Nassim  Jade and Scotts 28, or the need  to  hold  a  by-election, whether or not they are unconstitutional, all these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been debated, all these have been answered.  So I do not\r\n\r\nthink  I  want  to prolong the agony of this House  by  going\r\n\r\nthrough the points one by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Just sit down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> He would like that. But he has\r\n\r\nheld  the floor for one hour.  So I think I should do, though\r\n\r\nnot  quite likewise, but at least take some time to  show  up\r\n\r\nhis  motion.   I would say that instead of this House  moving\r\n\r\nthis  motion,  this House should commend the  Government  for\r\n\r\nensuring that all in Singapore observe the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went though the Hansard. He may not have gone through\r\n\r\nthe Hansard, but I went through the Hansard,  the compilation\r\n\r\nof  all our debates.  And I can tell this House that since he\r\n\r\nfirst  entered Parliament in 1981, until 1986, and then after\r\n\r\nhe  re-entered  Parliament in 1997, he has raised  all  these\r\n\r\npoints  before.  Indeed, since 1997, he has filed innumerable\r\n\r\nquestions  for  oral answers, Committee of  Supply  cuts  and\r\n\r\nseveral  motions, not less than 10 motions or  so,  including\r\n\r\nabout  six  main and two adjournment motions covering  topics\r\n\r\nthat  have  been covered today.  I am sure he would  remember\r\n\r\nour previous encounters in 1997 when we talked about the need\r\n\r\nto  set up a commission of inquiry to look into the rights of\r\n\r\naccused  persons, a commission of inquiry to look at  whether\r\n\r\nor  not our defamation laws ought to be changed, respect  for\r\n\r\nthe  Judiciary, and we had long debates.  That is why when  I\r\n\r\nprepared  for this motion, I wanted to see whether  there  is\r\n\r\nneed  to  do more.  Because if there is a need to do more,  I\r\n\r\nwill do more.  But alas, hearing the NCMP out for one hour, I\r\n\r\nthink he has said nothing new.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Simon Tay said, he picks on instances, areas. He\r\n\r\ndoes not see the big picture.  I think he is coloured by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that he has been around a long time.  He does  not  see\r\n\r\nthe  big  picture,  especially  of  what  is  new,  what  has\r\n\r\ntranspired in Singapore over the last 10-15 years.  I applaud\r\n\r\nMr  Tay.   He says that he took a certain position as regards\r\n\r\njudicial review under the ISA, in the light of the fact that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  recent detentions, he is prepared  to  re-consider his earlier opinion.  This means that he does listen\r\n\r\nto  what transpires in this House, what Government has to say\r\n\r\nin  explaining why certain Acts are necessary and why certain\r\n\r\nlaws  are necessary.  But not so Mr Jeyaretnam.  This is what\r\n\r\nhe  does.  He takes specific instances and then he puts  them\r\n\r\nall  in a very alarming manner, as though the Rule of Law  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that does not exist in Singapore, as though  there\r\n\r\nis a systemic problem with the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that that is not the case. Even then, the\r\n\r\ninstances   that  he  cites  are  all  based   on   erroneous\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  both of the law and, in some  instances,  of\r\n\r\nthe  facts.   It is just like what transpired earlier  on  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  when  he challenged the Minister  of  State  for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Information Technology saying that  if  we\r\n\r\nclamp  a person's car, we are punishing him, we are punishing\r\n\r\nan  innocent person.  I am quite surprised with that.  Surely\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam must know that this is not an innocent person.\r\n\r\nHe has been summoned to court for a parking offence.  He does\r\n\r\nnot come.  And then a warrant of arrest is issued against him\r\n\r\nand  he  also  does not comply with the warrant.   So  he  is\r\n\r\ncocking  a  snook  at the law.  He is not complying  with  an\r\n\r\norder of the court to appear.  And so you clamp his car,  not\r\n\r\nto  punish him, but to inconvenience him, to ensure  that  he\r\n\r\nappears  before  a  court.  This is not  judicial  punishment\r\n\r\nwhich, of course, will be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I by way of clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Prof. Ho?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In short, the Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw  refers  to  the  supremacy of law,  as  opposed  to  the\r\n\r\narbitrary  exercise of power.  The other key  tenet  is  that\r\n\r\neveryone  is equal before the law.  The concept also includes\r\n\r\nthe  notions  of  the transparency, openness and  prospective\r\n\r\napplication  of  our laws, observation of the  principles  of\r\n\r\nnatural  justice, independence of the Judiciary and  judicial\r\n\r\nreview of administrative action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state very clearly that all these are established\r\n\r\nfeatures  of our legal system.  We all know that everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is subject to the law.  No one is above  the  law.\r\n\r\nOther  nations  admire  us  for  this  aspect  of  our   good\r\n\r\ngovernance,  the  Rule  of Law.  Hence,  everyone,  from  the\r\n\r\nPresident  to the humblest citizen, is subject  to  the  same\r\n\r\nlaws.   There are no double standards or favouritism, and  no\r\n\r\none  is  exempt.   This  is an important  point  because  the\r\n\r\nintegrity and credibility of our institutions, including  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and civil service and their players, are  the  key\r\n\r\nfoundations  of Singapore's success.  Also for  this  reason,\r\n\r\nMinisters   and  MPs  suspected  of  wrongdoing   have   been\r\n\r\ninvestigated and indeed some have been prosecuted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members recall, three years ago, Senior Minister and\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  came  to  this House to explain  their  actions  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to some property purchases they had made  which  PM\r\n\r\nhad  earlier  investigated.   All  these  again  are  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard.   To  me,  this  is a very clear  example  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  upholds the Rule of Law and ensures  that  it  is\r\n\r\nfully  observed  by  all.   It shows  that  the  honesty  and\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  Ministers  and public  servants  is  zealously\r\n\r\nsafeguarded, not only in words but also in deed.  What is the\r\n\r\nNCMP  talking  about?   In fact, I will  say  that  the  NCMP\r\n\r\ninsults  Singaporeans by alleging that the Rule of  Law  does\r\n\r\nnot prevail in Singapore because this Government which stands\r\n\r\non  the  Rule  of  Law has been repeatedly re-elected  in  10\r\n\r\ngeneral elections since 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that the Government is a mafia. I think he\r\n\r\nused that word \"mafia\".  I must say that I am very surprised.\r\n\r\nThis is really absurd.  Singaporeans are being led by a mafia\r\n\r\norganisation!   All  of  us here are members  of  the  mafia!\r\n\r\nForeigners are coming here to live, some wanting to  be  part\r\n\r\nof   the  Singapore  family  as  permanent  residents  or  as\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Why?  Because they also want to join the mafia.  I\r\n\r\nhope Mr Jeyaretnam will have a bit more sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example where the Rule of Law prevails in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  what  Senior  Minister,  who  was  then  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  said in the House in January 1988, in  respect  of\r\n\r\nrumours   and  allegations  of  impropriety  concerning   the\r\n\r\nprevious Attorney-General:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every allegation made against any official of corrupt,\r\n\r\nillegal  or  improper conduct or action will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the official complained against is the Attorney-General,   the   highest   legal   officer   in   charge   of\r\n\r\ninvestigation, will not prevent such investigations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister added that the allegations had been\r\n\r\ninvestigated  and were proven unfounded.  But  he  also  said\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  had  been substantiated, the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nwould have to face the consequences.  So no one, not even the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  who has the discretion to  prosecute  cases\r\n\r\nunder  the Constitution, something which Mr Jeyaretnam  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,   will   embrace  with  his  heart,  is   exempt   from\r\n\r\ninvestigation and prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our laws are tough against criminals and\r\n\r\nwrong   doers.   We  do  have  laws  which  allow  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention   without  trial,  the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Act, for example.  There is a sunset  clause  and\r\n\r\nevery five years we come before this House to justify why  it\r\n\r\nshould be continued.  Indeed, even for the other laws such as\r\n\r\nthe  ISA  and the Misuse of Drugs Act, they have  been  fully\r\n\r\ndebated  in this House.  The last time I think it was debated\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Chiam and DPM Lee when DPM Lee explained very clearly\r\n\r\nwhy  the ISA was still needed today.  Mr Jeyaretnam calls for\r\n\r\nthe  repeal  of  these laws.  Will he be  responsible  if  we\r\n\r\nrepeal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  laws  and  secret  societies start  infiltrating  into\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Of course, he would not be because he is just  an\r\n\r\nNCMP.  But the Government, the Minister for Home Affairs  and\r\n\r\nmyself, as his No. 2, will have to be responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell Mr Jeyaretnam why preventive detention laws\r\n\r\nare  important.  I have explained it many times  before.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act,  we\r\n\r\nare  dealing  with triads, secret societies.   Witnesses  are\r\n\r\nfearful  to  testify  in  open court.   So  we  have  to  act\r\n\r\ndecisively.   Having said this, does it mean  therefore  that\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of  Law does not prevail?  Does it therefore  mean\r\n\r\nthat there are no safeguards?  Mr Jeyaretnam must look at the\r\n\r\nHansard  in  detail  because I remember  very  clearly,  many\r\n\r\ntimes,  not just once, including the last time when  I  moved\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to  continue  the CLTPA for  another  five  years,\r\n\r\nsetting  out  all the safeguards, including advisory  boards.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  is  that for the ISA, there is an  advisory  board\r\n\r\nheaded by a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.  If they disagree with the Minister's decision to\r\n\r\ncontinue detaining the detainee, it goes to the President who\r\n\r\nwill then exercise his discretion.  Is Jeyaretnam looking  at\r\n\r\nall these safeguards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our penalties can of course be harsh in some cases, but\r\n\r\nthis  is necessary.  This is again not against Articles 9  or\r\n\r\n12  that  Mr Jeyaretnam is wont to raise. These are all  done\r\n\r\nlegally  and  carefully  drafted  by  our  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers.  And of course, all are subject to the requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution  and all coming to  this  House  to  be\r\n\r\ndebated and passed.  The courts interpret the laws and  apply\r\n\r\nthe  laws  so that citizens can live in safety.  I was  quite\r\n\r\nsurprised when the NCMP said that the court's right of review\r\n\r\ncan be excluded.  Yes, for a few important statutes, like the\r\n\r\nISA,  judicial  review  has  been  curtailed.   But  judicial\r\n\r\nadministrative actions to the court, whether it  is  mandamus\r\n\r\nor prohibition or certiorari are always available to a person\r\n\r\nwho  is aggrieved.  The important point is that we must  have\r\n\r\ncourts which are independent.  Mr Chiam has already said that\r\n\r\nhe believes the courts are competent and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependent.  They must be fair and they must apply the  laws\r\n\r\nfairly.  That is an important safeguard.  Or is Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\ninsinuating  also  that this safeguard does  not  prevail  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   That our courts cannot be trusted to  apply  the\r\n\r\nlaws fairly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do not put words into my mouth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Mr  Low, for example, has been quoted  in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times where he said that he finds no  reason  to\r\n\r\nsay that Government departments discriminate against ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> On Saturday, 20th November 1999, I\r\n\r\nwas  deprived of my freedom of speech.  I was not allowed  to\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

So my question is: has he been  given\r\n\r\npermission to speak under the Public Entertainments Act?  Was\r\n\r\nhe given permission?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chiam complains about not\r\n\r\nhaving  been given a licence to speak at a function that  was\r\n\r\nin  the open.  The event was the 6th anniversary of the  SPP.\r\n\r\nHe had applied, in fact, initially just for karaoke. That was\r\n\r\non 15th October.  Later on, on 27th October, a new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication was submitted, this time saying speeches would be\r\n\r\nmade.  This will definitely turn the event into something not\r\n\r\nquite  the same as the original function.  Therefore,  police\r\n\r\nlooked  anew at his application on 27th October,  and  within\r\n\r\nthe  three weeks which is stipulated, which police  has  said\r\n\r\nthey will try to process all applications, gave Mr Chiam  his\r\n\r\nreply  on  15th November, which still gave him  five  or  six\r\n\r\nclear  days  to  organise  the event.   That  is  the  point.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  if  we do not clarify this, Mr Chiam  will  think\r\n\r\nthat police is being unfair to the Opposition.  Indeed, there\r\n\r\nwas another event.  In 1998 ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister of State said the police\r\n\r\ngave five or six days, which is enough to organise the event.\r\n\r\nWe have got 83 tables and we have got over 800 people coming.\r\n\r\nDoes he think that five days would be enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> There are two things Mr Chiam\r\n\r\ncan  do.  He can either submit earlier, which means that  the\r\n\r\nreply will come earlier, or surely he does not wait till  the\r\n\r\npermit  comes before doing everything.  I would ask Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nwhether this is something new.  The SPP, and before that  the\r\n\r\nSDP  when  he led it, had submitted many applications  before\r\n\r\nfor indoor talks.  Speeches were made and all these have been\r\n\r\napproved.   He  knows  that,   because  this  is  the  stated\r\n\r\nprocedure, stated policy.  If political parties want to  hold\r\n\r\ntalks outdoors, whether it is PAP or SPP, the answer will  be\r\n\r\nno.  In  fact, we have stated this in Parliament before.   Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia Khiang had an exchange in 1992 with Prof. Jayakumar\r\n\r\non  this point, and Mr Simon Tay raised the question  on  the\r\n\r\nprocedures for applying for a PEL, and certainly in the media\r\n\r\nwhere Government gave out many statements explaining why  for\r\n\r\npolitical parties an outdoor permit will not be given.  So Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  knows.   He was fishing. He was hoping for  the  best.\r\n\r\nBut  he  knows that, given the current policy which is stated\r\n\r\nand  known  to  all, he will probably not get  permission  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  Now he wants to make a song and dance about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Can I go on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, Prof. Ho is not giving way. Can\r\n\r\nyou continue, Prof. Ho?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So what is the result of our\r\n\r\napproach  to law and order?  Our approach is that we  have  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  which is safe, a Singapore which people feel  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  home, which people feel that they can raise children\r\n\r\nin  and  one  in  which they can walk the  streets  at  night\r\n\r\nsafely.   Having said this, there are also specific  internal\r\n\r\nguidelines to ensure that, whether it is the police or  other\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement agencies, there will be no abuse.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  very  clear because, yes, there have been black  sheep.\r\n\r\nBut  do  we  cover up the black sheep?  Government  does  not\r\n\r\ncover  up the black sheep.  Indeed, if the police themselves,\r\n\r\nas they have done, uncover wrongdoing among their ranks, they\r\n\r\nwill pursue investigations and prosecutions to the end.  That\r\n\r\nis   the   assurance  the  Minister  and  I  have  given   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  that we do not cover up wrongdoing  and  black\r\n\r\nsheep will be exposed.  That is the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point about the Rule of Law is that an\r\n\r\nindependent,  impartial and efficient judiciary  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the laws which are passed will apply to all.   It  will\r\n\r\nalso   ensure  that  the  laws  which  are  passed  are  also\r\n\r\nconstitutional.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam has raised this point.\r\n\r\nYes,  of course, our laws must be subject to the Constitution\r\n\r\nbecause the Constitution is the overriding document that sets\r\n\r\nthe  framework upon which the other laws stand.  I  thank  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay for enumerating the many cases where those who have\r\n\r\nbeen  aggrieved have mounted challenges in our courts, filing\r\n\r\nadministrative  actions  and some succeeded.   Indeed,  in  a\r\n\r\nrecent  case,  Standsfield  Business  International  Pte  Ltd\r\n\r\nagainst  Minister for Manpower, the court, in fact,  accepted\r\n\r\nthe complainant's argument that the Ministry's enquiry failed\r\n\r\nto  comply  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice.   So  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff won the case against the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the NCMP is mired in the past. He has not\r\n\r\nrealised that Singapore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PAP,  and  the  civil service are moving  on  with  fast\r\n\r\nchanging times, something the NCMP most evidently cannot cope\r\n\r\nwith.   S21  vividly captures the Government's approach.   As\r\n\r\nfor  the civil service, PS21 sets the tone.  Even our  courts\r\n\r\nhave  moved on.  Because if you look at what the courts  have\r\n\r\ndone, they have introduced many innovations.  They have  also\r\n\r\nreached  out to the public through exhibitions, seminars  and\r\n\r\ntalks.  This is also an important aspect of the Rule of Law - that   Singaporeans  know  what  the  law   is   all   about;\r\n\r\nSingaporeans know how their rights are governed by the  laws.\r\n\r\nThey  know  how to find these laws - statute books which  are\r\n\r\navailable,  can be bought, can be read in the  library.   And\r\n\r\nthey  also know where they can have their legal rights aired,\r\n\r\nwhich  is our courts.  The Subordinate Courts, in fact,  have\r\n\r\ndone a marvellous job.  The Subordinate Courts have been held\r\n\r\nup  as a model by the World Bank.  And the Subordinate Courts\r\n\r\nhave  introduced  many  innovations  so  that  citizens   are\r\n\r\ninvolved in the law, for example, family conferencing, multi-door  court  house.   These are all  examples.   That  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant aspect of the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would not go into it very much. But\r\n\r\nthis  point  has  also  been  mentioned  by  other  speakers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  Mr Tay who mentioned the polls that  show  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has a very high standing with regard to the Rule of\r\n\r\nLaw.   I  have  mentioned this before  in  this  House.   The\r\n\r\nPolitical  and  Economic  Risk  Consultancy,  World  Economic\r\n\r\nForum,  and  other  polls  show  that  both  foreigners   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  believe that we have good  judicial  and  legal\r\n\r\nsystems,  fair administration of justice.  And  this  is  not\r\n\r\njust  from  businessmen because polls conducted in  Singapore\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans and foreigners also underscore this belief\r\n\r\nand trust.  So there you have it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude. By this motion, Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nimplies that our Ministers and public officials get away with\r\n\r\nbreaking the law.  Any such insinuation impugns the integrity\r\n\r\nof  Parliament which passes these laws, judges who apply  the\r\n\r\nlaws  and  the AG who enforces these laws.  This is  entirely\r\n\r\nunfair.  In a recently concluded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this  House on the President's Address,  not  one\r\n\r\nspeaker  attacked Singapore's key institutions, such  as  our\r\n\r\njudges and civil servants, a point highlighted by Mr Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh  in  his  closing speech.  Indeed, the  Government  has\r\n\r\nvigorously   defended  the  integrity  of  our  judges   when\r\n\r\nOpposition politicians in courting foreign support  had  cast\r\n\r\naspersions on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example was a motion that we debated in 1995 on\r\n\r\nthe independence and integrity of Singapore's Judiciary.  And\r\n\r\nalso  the  AG.   The  House has taken  great  pains   -   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law has done this  -  to explain to this  House\r\n\r\nthe  role  of the AG, why he exercises independent  judgement\r\n\r\nwhen  he wears his hat as the Public Prosecutor, which he  is\r\n\r\nconstitutionally required to do, something which I am sure Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam will also fly his flag very high for.  And that is\r\n\r\nwhy  when  he issued a considered statement to say  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters in the last Cheng San GRC general election did  not\r\n\r\nviolate the law, he meant it.  Because his readiness to issue\r\n\r\nan  open statement means that he is prepared to stand by that\r\n\r\nstatement,  not  just  to this House, but  to  other  jurists\r\n\r\naround  the  world.  So the integrity of the AG is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  also  very important which Mr Jeyaretnam  impugns.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  he says that people get away with  breaking  the\r\n\r\nlaw, the Government gets away with double standards, then  he\r\n\r\nis  also  impugning  the  integrity of the  Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, let no one doubt that the NCMP is  making  a\r\n\r\nserious  but  absurd  and  baseless charge  by  tabling  this\r\n\r\nmotion.   And one can only conclude that by doing  this,  the\r\n\r\nNCMP is really craving for publicity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, it is regretted that the\r\n\r\nNCMP has all these years habitually made baseless allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government for not observing the Rule  of  Law.\r\n\r\nThis motion is yet another example.  Sir, this motion must be\r\n\r\nsoundly defeated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would like to get a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister of State.

Please,  your\r\n\r\nears must be open.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nwith  all the isolated incidents that have been mentioned  by\r\n\r\nMr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam, they have detracted actually from\r\n\r\nthe rather broader motion that has been put forward, which is\r\n\r\nreally that we should look at the function of the Rule of Law\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Rule of Law is a fundamental constitutional\r\n\r\ndoctrine.   I  believe it is deeply valued in Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  more  than that, I believe it is internalised  in  the\r\n\r\nculture  of  the public service.  Mr Jeyaretnam,  of  course,\r\n\r\nmentioned just now the concept by Dicey, and it is not a very\r\n\r\naccepted concept these days.  There have been quite a  number\r\n\r\nof  writers who have developed it.  And I think since he  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  it, perhaps I would take a couple of minutes  just\r\n\r\nto update Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam and the House as to how the Rule of Law concept is\r\n\r\nusually talked about these days.  It is usually talked  about\r\n\r\nwith a little bit more focus.  Broadly speaking, and this  is\r\n\r\nthe  Diceyian concept, it means that the people are  governed\r\n\r\nby  law  and not by arbitrary or capricious force.  But  more\r\n\r\nnarrowly,  and I think it is a concept that applies  to  this\r\n\r\ndebate   today,  it  refers  to  the  doctrine  that   guides\r\n\r\nauthorities into making decisions that are reasonable and  in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest.  Decisions of public officers are open,\r\n\r\nrational assessment and justified on the basis of our  shared\r\n\r\nvalues.   The  best way perhaps to look at the  Rule  of  Law\r\n\r\ntoday is to enumerate some of the fundamental principles that\r\n\r\nit  represents.  Some of them actually have been mentioned by\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam, Mr Simon Tay and others.  But  I  would  just\r\n\r\nlike to consolidate the thoughts on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that, which I think everyone would agree\r\n\r\nwith, in fact I think they would agree with all, all laws are\r\n\r\nprospective,  stable, properly and constitutionally  enacted.\r\n\r\nThat is a principle of the Rule of Law.  Second ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Prof. Chin,\r\n\r\nmay I just interject here.  I think we all enjoy listening to\r\n\r\nyour  lecture.  So can you please direct your lecture to  all\r\n\r\nof us and look at us, and not look back at Mr Jeyaretnam?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I will do that certainly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All laws are prospective, stable, properly and\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  enacted.   The  application  of  laws,  the\r\n\r\nmaking of legal orders by public officers should be guided by\r\n\r\nclear and general rules, that is, avoiding any personal  bias\r\n\r\nor  favour,  treating equal cases equally,  making  decisions\r\n\r\nrationally and in the public interest, and in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  written laws of the land.  In this particular  instance,\r\n\r\non  this  principle, I want to refer back to Mr  Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\noriginal  introduction when he said that  a  government  that\r\n\r\nacts by decree is not acting under the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule of Law.  I do not have any objection to that if you  say\r\n\r\na  government  acts only by decree without any circumscribing\r\n\r\nof  such  decrees by other laws.  But it would  be  wrong  to\r\n\r\nthink that is the situation in Singapore.  In this particular\r\n\r\nprinciple  where you have laws, obviously such laws  must  be\r\n\r\napplied and obviously the laws are applied by public officers\r\n\r\nwho   make   legal  orders.   If  these  legal   orders   are\r\n\r\nsubstantiated  by subsidiary legislation, if this  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  sanctioned by parent Acts,  by  the  primary\r\n\r\nlegislation,  then  any  order  issuing  from  it  would   be\r\n\r\nlegitimate  and would comply with the Rule of Law.   And,  if\r\n\r\nanyone  is unhappy with that, there is always the next aspect\r\n\r\nor  principle  of  the Rule of Law, and  that  is,  that  the\r\n\r\njudiciary  has  the  power and the authority  to  review  any\r\n\r\nadministrative action.  So that is the third principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final principle, which is already mentioned by a\r\n\r\nnumber  of Members, is that the judiciary must be independent\r\n\r\nand the courts should be generally accessible to all who seek\r\n\r\nrecourse  to  them.   I think all of us  in  this  House,  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  and  Mr Chiam included, would  not  dispute  this\r\n\r\nprinciple  that is the foundation perhaps of the modern  Rule\r\n\r\nof Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is by no means a complete list of principles\r\n\r\nbut, I believe, they constitute the more important principles\r\n\r\nof  what  we  are talking about today.  We can examine  these\r\n\r\nprinciples one by one and see how the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nmeasures  up to these, but that would be unnecessary  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of what the Minister of State has mentioned.   He  has\r\n\r\nenumerated a number of instances where clearly we have abided\r\n\r\nby all these principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of laws laid before Parliament, it is quite\r\n\r\nobvious  to  all of us, including the Opposition Members  who\r\n\r\nparticipate in debate and sometimes participate more than  we\r\n\r\nwould  like,  but no doubt expected, time given  between  the\r\n\r\nFirst  Reading and the Second Reading is more than sufficient\r\n\r\nto  allow  Members to prepare for the debate.  Procedures  of\r\n\r\nParliament are inherited from the Westminster model which,  I\r\n\r\nam sure, Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  would like, cannot be faulted.  All  legislation,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)  Act,  is\r\n\r\npassed after due deliberation.  As for the civil service, the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for Law has already told this  House  more\r\n\r\nthan  once,  and  in fact just now, how the Rule  of  Law  is\r\n\r\nobserved  from top to bottom, from the Minister,  to  use  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's  words,  to  the most junior  constable.   These\r\n\r\nexamples  show  that at the very least, a deep commitment  to\r\n\r\nthe principles of the Rule of Law.  In fact, we all know that\r\n\r\nthe penchant for Singapore civil servants to follow rules and\r\n\r\nprinciples  is  well  known,  not  just  in  Singapore,   but\r\n\r\noverseas.   There  are jokes about Singapore  civil  servants\r\n\r\nfollowing  rules.  The more popular one has to  do  with  two\r\n\r\nSingapore  civil servants being marooned on a  desert  island\r\n\r\nwith a pretty lady and they did not know what to do except to\r\n\r\nput  a  message  in  a  bottle and  float  back  for  further\r\n\r\ninstructions.  This is the sort of picture that  we  have  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  civil  service.  It suggests,  it  more  than\r\n\r\nsuggests, it emphasises the fact that the culture of the Rule\r\n\r\nof Law is deeply rooted in the public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, recently, the public service aspires to do even\r\n\r\nmore.   The  Rule of Law is the primary point from  which  it\r\n\r\nstarts.  It aspires to be even more responsive to the people.\r\n\r\nIt  seeks  to help rather than to hinder and such an attitude\r\n\r\nmust of course be welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the courts are concerned, we have no question\r\n\r\non  that.   All are agreed in this House that the quality  of\r\n\r\njustice  is high, and that we have not just local recognition\r\n\r\nof   the   quality  of  justice  but  also  of  international\r\n\r\nrecognition.   There  are  now in  place  various  means  for\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens to obtain justice, not  just  through  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court, not just through the Subordinate Courts,  but\r\n\r\nalso  in  the  Small  Claims Tribunals,  Community  Mediation\r\n\r\nCentres,  and  so  on.   Access to  justice  has  never  been\r\n\r\ngreater.  The judicial process, as the NCMP knows, rigorously\r\n\r\npursues  a  rapid settlement of disputes.  There, of  course,\r\n\r\ncan  be  room  for  improvement.   For  example,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to see how legal cost can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  brought down to a more affordable level and that  is\r\n\r\nan  area  where  all  lawyers can help,  including  the  Non-Constituency MP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now looking at the original motion filed by the Non-Constituency MP and listening to all the speakers that have\r\n\r\ncome before me, there are two main flaws in the motion as  it\r\n\r\nstands  and  this would detract from its acceptability.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  actually  in  the  first  limb  \"That  this  House\r\n\r\nrecognises the Rule of Law .\".  I think the word \"recognises\"\r\n\r\nsets  the standard too low.  We not only recognise it, it  is\r\n\r\npart  of  our legal culture, we internalise it, we value  it.\r\n\r\nIt  follows  from what I said about the first limb  that  the\r\n\r\nphrase  used  in  the  second limb is also  wrong,  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters, officials and public servants should be  urged  to\r\n\r\nobey  the Rule of Law.  We have heard the many ways in  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government has not only observed the Rule of Law but has\r\n\r\ngone  out of its way to promote and internalise it among  all\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.   In other words, this is not  the  time  to\r\n\r\nurge.   This  is the time to commend.  That is  why  we  have\r\n\r\nreached  the  stage  of the debate that  we  should  have  an\r\n\r\namendment to the motion for this debate to proceed further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move an amendment to the motion standing\r\n\r\nin  the  name of the Non-Constituency MP.  I have  taken  the\r\n\r\nliberty to ask the Clerk of Parliament to have copies of this\r\n\r\namendment which I would ask your permission to distribute  to\r\n\r\nMembers in the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

I have three  instances,  one  of\r\n\r\nwhich Mr Chiam has raised about speeches.  On the surface  of\r\n\r\nit,  advisors  to grassroots organisations can  speak  freely\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are under grassroots organisations.    Whereas\r\n\r\nelected  Members  of Parliament like us also have  committees\r\n\r\nwhich  deal  with  grassroots activities  but  they  are  not\r\n\r\nrecognised  as part of a grassroots organisation,  hence  the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between  grassroots  organisations  and   events\r\n\r\norganised by political parties.  The policy is such that  for\r\n\r\nevents organised by political parties a licence to speak will\r\n\r\nnot  be  granted.   Whereas for grassroots  organisations,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they  do not even need to apply for a  licence.   In\r\n\r\nboth  instances,  yes, one is a policy and  the  other  is  a\r\n\r\nprovision under the law.  The question is whether it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   applied   fairly  because  all  advisors  to  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  are allowed to speak.  We are  not  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.  So the question is:  is this fair?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other instance is an old issue which was debated in\r\n\r\nParliament  and  that concerns the use of HDB  premises,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  PCF's use as kindergartens.  I  remember  the\r\n\r\nrules  for granting such premises concessionary rental,  that\r\n\r\nis, you have to register it as a charitable organisation with\r\n\r\na  paid-up  capital of $5 million.  So the Opposition  cannot\r\n\r\nfulfil the requirement and thereby under the rule you are not\r\n\r\nqualified.  Is that fair?  It is under the law, yes.  But  my\r\n\r\nquestion is: is this fair?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other instance is pasar malam. In the past, my\r\n\r\ncommittees were allowed to organise pasar malam but  suddenly\r\n\r\nthe   rule   was   changed.   Right  now,   only   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations or town councils are allowed to organise  pasar\r\n\r\nmalams.   So there is this change of rule, whether policy  or\r\n\r\nwhatever,  that disadvantages the Opposition and it  concerns\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of  Law.  I leave it to the people  in  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession to judge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there is this question of what sort of\r\n\r\nlicences are issued.  There are people who are worried  about\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  licences  are being  granted  with  certain\r\n\r\nconsideration.   Many a time the Government  departments  who\r\n\r\ngrant licences say, \"Well, we will consider on a case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.\" What is case-by-case basis?  I do not think there  is\r\n\r\na  very  clear  administrative ruling, in terms  of  granting\r\n\r\nlicences  and  other things.  The transparency  is  not  good\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the amended motion, I agree with point\r\n\r\none \"values the importance of Rule of Law\".  My understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  Rule of Law is to apply the law fairly to  everyone.\r\n\r\n\"Commends  the Government for upholding the Rule of  Law  and\r\n\r\nensuring  that it is fully observed by all\", I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether or not the Government upholds the Rule of Law because\r\n\r\nmy  Secretary-General has obviously pointed out that it  does\r\n\r\nnot seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you said that any\r\n\r\nspeeches  after the amendment was moved must be  confined  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment.

I am\r\n\r\nobliged to you.  I have no quarrel with the changing  of  the\r\n\r\nword  \"recognises\"  to \"values\".  I see  that  the  amendment\r\n\r\nunderscores the importance and the need for the rule of  law.\r\n\r\nI  have  no  objection  to that.  But  I  am  surprised  that\r\n\r\nthereafter  he  goes on to amend the rest of  the  motion  by\r\n\r\nasking this House to commend the Government for upholding the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by  all.\r\n\r\nIt  appears  to  me,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  this  amendment\r\n\r\nignores the realities in Singapore and tries to shut them out\r\n\r\nand  just  look at what Prof. Chin wants people to  look  at.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  got to be honest and look at the realities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If we look at the realities, can we then  commend\r\n\r\nthe  Government for upholding the Rule of Law?  I am  obliged\r\n\r\nto  him  for  his  observation that the  debate  was  somehow\r\n\r\nhijacked  by concentrating on instances, rather than  looking\r\n\r\nat  the whole principle and whether it is being applied.   It\r\n\r\nis  like  you  are  not looking at the wood but  just  simply\r\n\r\nlooking  at  one  or two trees there.  But  if  you  want  to\r\n\r\ncommend  the  Government for upholding the Rule of  Law,  you\r\n\r\nhave got to answer a number of questions and ask whether  the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law  has been observed in the situations  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin again raises, but was already said by Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay,  that  the laws are properly enacted,  passed  by\r\n\r\nParliament,   subsidiary  legislation  is  made   under   the\r\n\r\nauthority of the parent legislation.  We all know that.   But\r\n\r\nthe  point  is,  as  the Privy Council  pointed  out  in  the\r\n\r\njudgement of Ong Ah Chuan that even an Act of Parliament  may\r\n\r\nviolate the Rule of Law if it is completely contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  natural justice.  Of course, Parliament, which  is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  almost  entirely by  Members  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nparty, can pass any law according to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Clarification, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you allow Prof. Chin to make a\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Bring it up later. Of course, having\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  two-thirds majority, the Constitution  can  be\r\n\r\namended  at any time. That is why it is absolutely  essential\r\n\r\nin  any democratic society that the ruling party should never\r\n\r\nhave  more than a two-thirds majority if it wants to  have  a\r\n\r\nstable   democratic  government.   It  follows  without   any\r\n\r\nexplanation.  Otherwise, it becomes a tyranny, a  tyranny  by\r\n\r\nthe  party which controls Parliament and, of course, we  know\r\n\r\nthe situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1966 to 1981, it was an entirely PAP Parliament.\r\n\r\nThere  was no one from any other party in Parliament.  So  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  one party passing laws - yes, strictly following  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the procedure - but ignoring  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nrules of natural justice and saying that they are abiding  by\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of Law when they passed a Bill, that it  has  been\r\n\r\npassed  in  accordance with the Constitution.   That  is  not\r\n\r\ncompliance with the Rule of Law as the Privy Council tried to\r\n\r\npoint  out.  After 1981, Parliament continued with a majority\r\n\r\nof  PAP members.  And this is the great drawback in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  one on which the PAP has capitalised, and that  is,\r\n\r\nthey go to any length to keep out any Opposition building  up\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  That\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin itself, to me, is a flagrant violation of the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate what I mean by just making reference to the\r\n\r\nway the elections were conducted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections in Singapore are all one-sided. The field is\r\n\r\nnot  an even playing field.  It will be idle to pretend  that\r\n\r\nwe  have an even playing field in Singapore when it comes  to\r\n\r\nelections.   I  have  said this before,  in  many  countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the Commonwealth countries,  that  elections\r\n\r\nare  the responsibility of an independent body, that is,  the\r\n\r\nElections Commission.  Do we have an Elections Commission  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  The Opposition parties, I remember, asked for  it\r\n\r\nin the 1970s.  Have we got an Elections Commission?  No.  The\r\n\r\nelections  are  run  as  though  it  was  a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and Government alone.  It is run on the decree of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister in whose Ministry the Elections Department\r\n\r\nis put.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where is the Rule of Law there to ensure equality to\r\n\r\nall parties to contest the elections?  Straightaway, you have\r\n\r\na  fundamental breach of the Rule of Law.  When you, on  your\r\n\r\nown,  decide to re-draw boundaries just because an Opposition\r\n\r\nhas  gained  a foothold in one constituency, you decide  that\r\n\r\nyou  will  bring it in, put it with other constituencies,  ad\r\n\r\nnauseam  change boundaries to ensure that the  Opposition  is\r\n\r\nkept out of Parliament.  So, that is a glaring instance of  a\r\n\r\nviolation of the Rule of Law.  And then when it comes to  the\r\n\r\nactual  conduct  of  the elections, I am  surprised  that  no\r\n\r\nattempt  is  made  to try to answer what I have  said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech.   I  mentioned about the conduct  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters  during  an election campaign.  Have  Members  here\r\n\r\nforgotten  how the Government won the constituency  of  Cheng\r\n\r\nSan?   The Parliamentary Elections Act has a provision  which\r\n\r\nsays  that  any elections won by intimidation or  bribery  of\r\n\r\nvoters  is  illegal  and  can be set  aside  on  an  election\r\n\r\npetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What took place on 1st January 1997? The Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncame to Cheng San,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nheld  a rally and he had only about 2,000 people in front  of\r\n\r\nhim  and what did he say?  Did he say, \"You vote for the PAP,\r\n\r\nwe are a better party, the Workers' Party cannot be trusted?\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  all  in the rules.  What did he say to the  voters?\r\n\r\nPlease  look it up.  It was next day headlined in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes.   I will come to that.  That was another violation  of\r\n\r\nthe Rule of Law.  In the front page it said, \"PM to voters  - all  or  nothing\".  And he said, \"You vote for  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty, you would not get anything.  Even what you have in the\r\n\r\nway  of any benefits will be taken away from you.  But if you\r\n\r\nvote  for  us, you will have what you have got  and  you  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to get more.  But if you vote for the Workers'  Party,\r\n\r\nupgrading  will cease, you may not get your MRT, trains  will\r\n\r\nnot  stop here, you would not get your LRT, you would not get\r\n\r\nyour  new  town,  your children may not get  good  places  in\r\n\r\nschools.\"  If that is not intimidation, I would like to  know\r\n\r\nwhat is intimidation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was his threat, all or nothing. We referred this\r\n\r\nmatter  for an opinion to a Queen's Counsel in London and  he\r\n\r\nsaid  it  was clearly an intimidation and in breach  of  that\r\n\r\nsection  under the Parliamentary Elections Act.  PM told  the\r\n\r\nvoters that if they did not vote for the PAP, they were going\r\n\r\nto  lose  everything. But that is not all.  On election  day,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  law  is  that no one, other than the  voters,  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  and  his agent, will be allowed into  the  polling\r\n\r\ncentre,  we  had  the  Prime Minister and  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister driving in, shaking hands with voters queuing up  to\r\n\r\nvote,  and  going beyond that into the area where  they  were\r\n\r\ncasting their votes, watching over them.  That seemed  to  us\r\n\r\nto be a clear breach of the Parliamentary Elections Act which\r\n\r\nsaid  that  no one, other than the voters, the candidate  and\r\n\r\nhis  agent  will be allowed, besides of course  the  election\r\n\r\nofficials and the police officers to keep the order.  If that\r\n\r\nis not a violation of the Rule of Law, what is it then?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also refer to the publication by the papers. The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  carried it on their front page.   I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the  Chinese newspapers also  carried  the  same\r\n\r\nmessage on their front page.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Paper thought that it would go one better.  It tabulated,\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the readers, what they would get and what\r\n\r\nthey would not get, depending on their choice.  Vote for  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party, you would not get this, you  would  not  get\r\n\r\nthat,  etc.   The Parliamentary Elections Act  says  that  on\r\n\r\npolling  day  itself,  there shall be no  campaigning,  there\r\n\r\nshall be no intimidation, there shall be no forcing of voters\r\n\r\nand  yet,  the papers blatantly carried all these on  polling\r\n\r\nday.   Was  any action taken against the papers?  Is  that  a\r\n\r\nviolation  of the Rule of Law or not?  And yet, we are  asked\r\n\r\nto  commend the Government for upholding the Rule of Law  and\r\n\r\nensuring  that it is fully observed by all.  I  selected  the\r\n\r\nelections  because  that  is the  starting  point,  the  main\r\n\r\nfoundation for ensuring that there is a democracy, a properly\r\n\r\nelected  government ruling the country, a government  elected\r\n\r\nby   the  people  with  complete  freedom  to  choose   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives without any fear, without any constraint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Cheng San voters have that freedom? Will you\r\n\r\nplease try and answer that?  You have the Prime Minister, not\r\n\r\nthe PAP official.  You have the Prime Minister because he was\r\n\r\nalready  Prime  Minister on nomination  day.   There  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion that he would be the Prime Minister.  He went  there\r\n\r\nand  he  said this.  So what freedom of choice did the  Cheng\r\n\r\nSan  voters  have?  Let us be honest and ask  this  question.\r\n\r\nHere  is  the  Prime Minister telling you,  \"I  am  going  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  everything from you.\"  What is more, he told  them,\r\n\r\n\"If  you  vote for us, you'll have a hot line to me.   You'll\r\n\r\nhave  a hot line to two Deputy Prime Ministers.\"  I have been\r\n\r\ntelling some of the Cheng San voters, \"Why do you not ring up\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister?  Ring him up and say, this is  the  hot\r\n\r\nline,  Mr  Prime Minister.  Will you listen to me?\"  and  see\r\n\r\nwhat response you get.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detention under the Internal Security Act is not\r\n\r\nanswered  simply  by  saying that we  may  need  it.   It  is\r\n\r\njustified.   The question you have to answer is: does  it  or\r\n\r\ndoes  it  not violate the Rule of Law?  The rule, as I  said,\r\n\r\nwas  propounded in the 13th century when the Barons said, \"No\r\n\r\none will be deprived of his liberty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcept by the lawful judgment of the court.\"  Is it or is  it\r\n\r\nnot  a  violation of the Rule of Law?  It is no good  arguing\r\n\r\nthat it is necessary because you want to keep Singapore safe.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep Singapore safe, then shoot all criminals.\r\n\r\nThen  perhaps people may not take up to crime.  Have  summary\r\n\r\ntrials,  summary justice, then Singapore will  be  absolutely\r\n\r\nsafe.  But is that what we want in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must look at the picture as a whole. Does\r\n\r\ndetention without trial violate the Rule of Law?  Do not just\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  keeps  Singapore safe, we will  not  have  any\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Let us be honest and say, \"No, in Singapore, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  uphold the Rule of Law.  We don't think the Rule of  Law\r\n\r\nreally  is necessary for our society because we want to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  safe.   So  we  are going to  give  our  Ministers\r\n\r\narbitrary power to keep Singapore safe.\"  Then, at least, the\r\n\r\nworld  will  know that we are being honest, that we  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested in the Rule of Law.  We have our own way of  doing\r\n\r\nthings.  But if you keep saying that we observe the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  then you have got to ask the question: do we?   And  if\r\n\r\nyou  examine  the record of this Government,  certainly  from\r\n\r\n1965  onwards, you will find that this is a Government which,\r\n\r\nthrough its Ministers, through its civil servants, especially\r\n\r\nthe  law enforcement agencies, has violated the Rule of  Law.\r\n\r\nI  have mentioned the instances.  But, as I said, you do  not\r\n\r\njust  look at it at one instance, two instances.  I could  go\r\n\r\non  and explain in detail, but I do not think I will have the\r\n\r\ntime for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way Police investigations are carried out violates\r\n\r\nthe  Rule  of  Law; not informing arrested persons  of  their\r\n\r\nright,  denying them counsel once they are taken into custody\r\n\r\nfor  up  to three weeks violating the Rule of Law.  Yes,  you\r\n\r\ncan,  of  course, say it is necessary.  Our  police  have  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate, our police have to stamp out crime.  So we  have\r\n\r\ngot to give them these powers.  Let us say we do not want the\r\n\r\nRule  of Law.  For us, it is more important that our officers\r\n\r\nhave  the  power  to get criminals out of  the  society  and,\r\n\r\nsimilarly, with other powers of the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment ignores the realities in Singapore. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  look  at  the  situation in  Singapore  but  seeks\r\n\r\napproval  or  approbation because Singapore is  such  a  good\r\n\r\nplace.  Everyone is happy.  Well, that is questionable.   But\r\n\r\nit  ignores  the realities, because we have got this  result.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  matter about the means.   But  the  means  are\r\n\r\nimportant.   It is not just the end.  It is the  means  which\r\n\r\nwill  justify  the  end, not the end that  will  justify  the\r\n\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other constant theme of Mr Simon Tay and even Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  is, \"Go to the courts, go to the courts.\"  But that  is\r\n\r\nto  miss the whole point of the argument.  Does Mr Simon  Tay\r\n\r\nknow  that  with the amendment to the Internal Security  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  courts are now precluded from inquiring into the  merits\r\n\r\nof the detention?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do that afterwards.

Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used\r\n\r\nup your 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I speak very briefly on the\r\n\r\namendment to the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prefacing my remarks, may I just reply perhaps to the\r\n\r\nrhetorical  question  Mr Jeyaretnam  asked  me.   Yes,  I  do\r\n\r\nunderstand what the amendments to the ISA have done.   In  my\r\n\r\nremarks  earlier,  I  said that I saw this  therefore  as  an\r\n\r\nexception to the rule of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why? Why is it an exception?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> That is why I argued about my own\r\n\r\nexperience in recognising some of the realities.  And I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out  to the NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, that his position  is\r\n\r\ninconsistent, because while he says he is against the ISA  on\r\n\r\na  principle  of the Rule of Law, he has not recommended,  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  the  abandonment of the Misuse  of  Drugs  Act,\r\n\r\nsimply some more safeguards.   And that is inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  is  only consistent if he looked at the realities,  which\r\n\r\nmeans to say case by case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the amendment to the motion. May I just\r\n\r\nask two points of clarification from the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nGRC,  Prof. Chin.  This is with regard to the second  leg  of\r\n\r\nthe  amendment.  In commending the Government  for  upholding\r\n\r\nthe  Rule of Law, does this amendment suggest that the courts\r\n\r\nhave  had no or very limited role in holding the Rule of Law?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  in  suggesting  that the  Rule  of  Law  is  fully\r\n\r\nobserved  by all, is this amendment suggesting that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  somehow perfect?  Because, if either of these suggestions\r\n\r\nare  there,  which I hope they are not, then I  am  afraid  I\r\n\r\ncannot  agree with this motion.  While Singapore has  a  good\r\n\r\nrecord,  it  is by no means perfect and can be improved  upon\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we do have a good record, it is not only\r\n\r\nthe  Government that has observed this and made it  possible.\r\n\r\nThey  have  had a role but it is also the role of the  courts\r\n\r\nand other institutions of this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, since Mr Tay has asked\r\n\r\nabout the amended motion, may I just make a couple of points.\r\n\r\nCommending the Government in relation to that aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law  which  relates to  the  importance  of  public\r\n\r\nservants abiding by rationality, following proper legislation\r\n\r\nand  orders,  it is, as I have said just now,  not  the  only\r\n\r\naspect of the Rule of Law that exists.  I have mentioned, and\r\n\r\nI  think the Minister of State has also mentioned, that it is\r\n\r\nquite clear that our courts also deserve to be commended  for\r\n\r\nthe good work that it has done in ensuring the Rule of Law in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But  if  you look at the  original  motion,  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  is on the public servants and the public  officers,\r\n\r\nand  that is why the amended motion follows very closely that\r\n\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your second point ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Prof. Chin, can you address\r\n\r\nyour points to the Chair?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.  In ensuring that it is fully observed by  all,\r\n\r\nthat  is an expression of an intention, an expression of  the\r\n\r\nexpectation that the Government would ensure that all  public\r\n\r\nservants obey and observe the Rule of Law, and it is no  more\r\n\r\nthan  what it says.  I hope that clarifies the situation  for\r\n\r\nMr Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I did not originally intend to\r\n\r\nspeak  but  having listened to this long and rambling  speech\r\n\r\nby  Mr Jeyaretnam, I think I should say a few words, lest  he\r\n\r\ngets  away with thinking that he is always right when  he  is\r\n\r\nalways wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no doctor, no lawyer, just a Minister. Common\r\n\r\nsense  tells  me and sometimes I read journals and  what  may\r\n\r\ninterest  me.   I  know that as we get older, our  short-term\r\n\r\nmemory gets worse.  Our long-term memory is always there.  So\r\n\r\nMr   Jeyaretnam   recalls  all  these  past   instances   and\r\n\r\nselectively remembers certain things and conveniently forgets\r\n\r\nothers  that  he has learnt over the years.  When  he  quotes\r\n\r\ncertain instances, he has forgotten all the answers that have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  in  this House or that have been replied  to  in\r\n\r\nother   forums.    He  just  completely   ignores   them   or\r\n\r\nconveniently forgets them.  The few examples he gave in  this\r\n\r\nhalf-an-hour of additional time that he has as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis amendment boiled down to three or four points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point he made was that in a democracy the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  not have more than  two-thirds  majority,\r\n\r\notherwise  it  is not a democracy.  I do not  know  by  whose\r\n\r\ndefinition  it is for this particular term of democracy  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  not  have  more  than  a  two-thirds\r\n\r\nmajority.  When you have a democratic system, in our  case  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that  allows  the  people  to  elect  and  choose   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  every five years, they decide who  they  want  to\r\n\r\ngovern  them.   We know that the people have  decided,  since\r\n\r\n1959,  that the People's Action Party is the party they  want\r\n\r\nto  govern Singapore.  Except for the initial years, we  have\r\n\r\ngot more than two-thirds majority\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince.   That is the wish of the people, not the wish of  the\r\n\r\nPAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1965 till 1981, when Mr Jeyaretnam first came to\r\n\r\nthis House and made a big song and dance about it, those were\r\n\r\nthe years when the PAP had total control of this House and in\r\n\r\nall  policy-decision making.  Of course, he would  say,  \"One\r\n\r\nparty, and therefore oppressive and bad for the people.\"  But\r\n\r\nthe records say otherwise.  Over those few years, despite the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  we faced and the issues we had  to  deal  with,\r\n\r\ndespite  some  people who wanted to down Singapore,  we  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded.  We have succeeded because of the policies that we\r\n\r\nhave  formulated, the ways we have implemented them  and  the\r\n\r\nways the people have supported them.  They knew quite well in\r\n\r\ntheir  hearts  that  this  Government  delivers  whatever  it\r\n\r\npromises.   While we had complete control in this  House,  we\r\n\r\ndid  not  abuse it.  In fact, we have had some of  our  older\r\n\r\ncolleagues  play  the  role  of the  Opposition  to  counter,\r\n\r\nchallenge  and criticise our policies to make  sure  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  not  all  of  the same mind, moving  in  one  direction\r\n\r\nregardless of whether the policies were right or  wrong.   We\r\n\r\nmoved on and we succeeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, Mr Jeyaretnam came to the House. What\r\n\r\nadditional contribution did he make?  I think the  record  is\r\n\r\nthere  for  people to see.  In 1984, Mr Chiam  came  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   In 1991, four Opposition MPs came to this House.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  people  had  enough.  In  one  term,  the  people\r\n\r\nrecognised  some  of them were just not competent  enough  to\r\n\r\nserve them and two of them are no longer in this House.  That\r\n\r\nis  the kind of Opposition we have.  So when Mr Jeyaretnam is\r\n\r\nunable  to  get  more people to support him,  and  unable  to\r\n\r\nattract the right people to work with him, do not blame it on\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party or the Government.  He should only\r\n\r\nblame it on himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam became the Secretary-General of the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party since 1972.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1971.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> 1971. What has changed in the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party since?  What new people are there?  Of course,\r\n\r\nMr  Low Thia Khiang is a rare find.  But that is a rarity  in\r\n\r\nthe  Workers'  Party.  What else do we have in  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty?  What sort of people do they produce?  Where are  they\r\n\r\nelection  after election?  Look at the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nin  1971.   Look at the people we had in 1971.  How  many  of\r\n\r\nthem are here except Senior Minister?  Who else?  1976? A few\r\n\r\nmore are still around.  But every term we have got new people\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  able  to  attract  them.   Because  we  are\r\n\r\ninclusive  and  able to accommodate all views and  take  them\r\n\r\ninto  account and that we have to stay relevant in  order  to\r\n\r\ngain the people's support.  That is how we have got here.  It\r\n\r\nis  not because of anything else.  It is only because of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes and manifestos that we have.  At every election we\r\n\r\nsay, \"This is the People's Action Party wanting to serve  you\r\n\r\nagain.  This is what we will do for you if we are in charge.\"\r\n\r\nWhat  is  wrong with that?  It is the job of every  political\r\n\r\nparty to win the election, including the Workers' Party, SDP,\r\n\r\nSPP  and  SP,  and  what have you.  But the unfortunate  part\r\n\r\nabout  it is that apart from the People's Action Party,  none\r\n\r\nof them has any concrete programme to offer the people.  When\r\n\r\nthe PAP said, \"If you vote for us, this is what we will do.\",\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam says, \"This is intimidation.\"  Is it?  But  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam is not a political novice.  He is supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nan  experienced Secretary-General of the Workers' Party since\r\n\r\n1971, for almost 28 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reality of politics. Every political party\r\n\r\neverywhere  in  the world has a political programme  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.   When they are in charge, they implement  them.   If\r\n\r\nthey  do  their jobs well, they will be re-elected.  If  they\r\n\r\nbluff  the people and cannot deliver on their promises,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  out  very fast, like the SDP MPs.  They  could  not\r\n\r\nperform  and they were out.  That is the reality.  So despite\r\n\r\nhis  long  years of experience in politics and some years  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  he  is not realistic.  That is the  unfortunate\r\n\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the half-an-hour when I was there sitting and\r\n\r\nlistening to him is a very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npainful  exercise.  It is painful to me because listening  to\r\n\r\nhim  we hear the same thing over and over again. The man  has\r\n\r\nnot got out of the past when the past is long past.  What  we\r\n\r\nhave now is the present going to the next millennium, and  we\r\n\r\nare talking of the Internet world.  But if he operates by the\r\n\r\nold system and thinks in the old way, he will never progress.\r\n\r\nCertainly, he will not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he mean that by having an Elections Commission it\r\n\r\nwill do wonders to the Workers' Party?  I doubt it.  Look  at\r\n\r\nsome  other  countries where they have Elections Commissions.\r\n\r\nWhat  have they become in some of them?  In fact,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the system has run very well in some of them,  despite\r\n\r\nwhatever systems they may have.  Our Election Department runs\r\n\r\na  small outfit.  Every four or five years, and now with  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Election works, we get the people in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice to support and help as Returning Officers, etc.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  kind of structure we have over the years and it  has\r\n\r\nworked.  If he says that it is intimidation because we  offer\r\n\r\npeople a programme and that the Election Department is unfair\r\n\r\nbecause  they are not in charge, there is one route for  him,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  to take it to the courts on an Elections Petition.\r\n\r\nIf  he  says he has a QC's opinion that what we did the  last\r\n\r\ntime was a violation of the law, then the right place to take\r\n\r\nit  to is to the courts, apply to the Election Judge and take\r\n\r\nup a petition.  That is the way, if he really believes in the\r\n\r\nRule of Law.  What else can it be, if he believes in the Rule\r\n\r\nof  Law?  To take a gun and shoot people, like he says?   No,\r\n\r\ncertainly that is not the way to do things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter is really this. Over these years, people\r\n\r\nhave  seen the PAP. They have compared the PAP with  all  the\r\n\r\nother  parties  and they know that the PAP has delivered  and\r\n\r\nthat  is why they elected us time and again.  If we tell  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  \"No, you cannot summarise the  issues,  and  you\r\n\r\ncannot   report  the  eve  of  polling  day  speeches.\",   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's  complaint will be, \"Why is  there  a  blackout?\r\n\r\nWhy  are you blacking it out and not telling people what  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes are?\"  If you do not have a programme, there is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing for the newspapers to publicise.  We have a programme\r\n\r\nand therefore the newspapers publicise us.  That is certainly\r\n\r\nnot our fault.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the ISA violate the Rule of Law? I think both Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay and Prof. Chin and my Minister of State have  said\r\n\r\nno.   The  Constitution itself says that Parliament may  make\r\n\r\nany  law  that ensures national security.  If that is against\r\n\r\nthe  law, take it up in the courts, unless Mr Jeyaretnam says\r\n\r\nwe  cannot trust our courts.  Is he saying that?  If so,  say\r\n\r\nso.   Call a spade a spade.  Do not mumbo-jumbo and  say  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of things and not get to the point.  We had four cases\r\n\r\nof  ISA  arrests which were mentioned to this House when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  was  asked by Mr Simon Tay.  We do  not  just  keep\r\n\r\npeople  unnecessarily.   If they are  no  longer  a  security\r\n\r\nthreat they will be out.  There is no reason to detain  them.\r\n\r\nBut  if  they were a threat and they have not cooperated  and\r\n\r\ntold  us everything, they will be detained.  As a result,  of\r\n\r\nthe  four cases, two have already been released because  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  level with the Internal Security  Department  and\r\n\r\nhave  recanted.  They have explained their role and now  they\r\n\r\nare no longer a threat and therefore they were released.  The\r\n\r\nother two are still being detained because they have not been\r\n\r\nfully honest with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he talked about is police\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer.   I  am  only  the\r\n\r\nMinister overseeing a department of police officers.  If they\r\n\r\nhave  violated  the law, Mr Jeyaretnam, who  has  represented\r\n\r\nmany  cases, would have won them, would he not?    But  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  of the results of that.  All I know is that when police\r\n\r\ninvestigates, they follow the rules and the law.  They go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General and the Attorney-General  sanctions  it\r\n\r\nbefore   it  goes  to  prosecution.   The  success  rate   in\r\n\r\nprosecution  is  pretty high.  But that does  not  mean  that\r\n\r\nevery case prosecuted will be successful. The court has, from\r\n\r\ntime to time, found it justified that either the case was not\r\n\r\nproperly  investigated  or there was no  case  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthrew  it  out.  That is the Rule of Law in application.   We\r\n\r\nmust look at it, as Mr Jeyaretnam says, in perspective,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  the  whole picture.  But, unfortunately, he could  only\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Look  at  the whole picture\", when in effect  he  only\r\n\r\nlooks  at  the tree.  That is the unfortunate part  and  very\r\n\r\npainful to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, by way of clarification, put two\r\n\r\nquestions  to  the Minister.  Is it or is it not intimidation\r\n\r\nfor the Prime Minister of the country to come and tell voters\r\n\r\nthat  if  they vote for the Opposition party, his  Government\r\n\r\nwill  deny them everything?  Is it or is it not intimidation?\r\n\r\nI  told him that a Queen's Counsel is of the view that it  is\r\n\r\nintimidation.  Will he answer that question?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the Minister aware, perhaps he does not\r\n\r\nbother to read anything that the Workers' Party put out, that\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party had a manifesto outlining all the areas of\r\n\r\nGovernment  and outlining the Workers' Party's proposals  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes?   If he has not read it, it is not  our  mistake.\r\n\r\nOf course, the papers would not give it prominence but do not\r\n\r\nmake  an  accusation that we did not have a  programme  or  a\r\n\r\nmanifesto.   I  will produce it to you and  will  you  please\r\n\r\nproduce  to us the manifesto that the PAP put out during  the\r\n\r\nelections.   Was  it  in  a book form, a  comprehensive  one,\r\n\r\ncontaining  all  the policies that will be  implemented,  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes of the party?  I have not seen anything.  So  will\r\n\r\nhe please let us have that and I will give him mine.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, again he says the PM has\r\n\r\nintimidated  the  voters.   The  PM  says,  \"These   are   my\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   If you vote for me, this is what you  get.   If\r\n\r\nyou  vote for the Opposition, this is what you will  not  get\r\n\r\nfrom  me.\"   I think that is fair.  Why?  Because it  is  our\r\n\r\nprogramme, you vote for me, I give you my programme.  If  you\r\n\r\nvote for the Opposition programme, and if I still give you my\r\n\r\nprogramme, then I must be stupid!  Cannot be, is it not?   If\r\n\r\nwe  are  stupid, we would not be here.  Workers' Party has  a\r\n\r\nmanifesto.  Yes, I am aware of that manifesto.

Is the\r\n\r\nMinister saying that whatever Opposition has, because we  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  charge of the Government, even if we  can  bring  up\r\n\r\nwhatever  programme,  it will be useless?   And  the  PAP  is\r\n\r\ncapitalising itself on its position as the Government to  say\r\n\r\nthat  because  it  is  in charge, it  will  give  the  people\r\n\r\neverything  that  this Government has.  But  where  does  the\r\n\r\nmoney  of the Government come from?  The people.  If  you  do\r\n\r\nnot  vote  for  me, I will not give you, whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  the  PAP as a party or the  programme  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Are you saying that the Secretary-General of PAP\r\n\r\ncan  go  to  the  voters and say, \"Well, I am the  Secretary-General.   I can give you.\"?  I wonder whether a person,  who\r\n\r\nbecomes  the  Prime Minister of a country, should  behave  as\r\n\r\nthough  he is the Secretary-General of the ruling party.   Is\r\n\r\nhe  looking after the interests of the Party or looking after\r\n\r\nthe interests of the nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think these are fine points\r\n\r\nthat  we  are debating.  If the PAP is in charge, we are  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Over  the  last 40  years,  we  have  been  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Whatever that were accumulated is a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis Government's policies, and that is a fact and a reality.\r\n\r\nSo  when we make a promise and say, \"Well, you elect  us,  we\r\n\r\nwill do this for you, we will carry out our programme.\"   And\r\n\r\nfor  the last 9 or 10 terms, this is what we have been doing.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a reality.  We are not politically naive  as  that,\r\n\r\nsurely.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlistening to the debate in this House over the motion and the\r\n\r\namendment, I was reminded of this story.  Two housewives went\r\n\r\nto  the  market  and they saw a rather big fish.   They  were\r\n\r\narguing  about how long it was.  Housewife A said,  \"Well,  I\r\n\r\nhave  got  a  way to determine this.\"  And she pulled  out  a\r\n\r\nstring,  measured the fish and then compared it to  her  arm,\r\n\r\nand  she  said, \"It is about 50 cm.\"  Whereupon  housewife  B\r\n\r\nsaid, \"No, it is not.\"  She took a look and she said, \"It  is\r\n\r\n49.74  cm.\"  Whereupon housewife A said, \"How did  you  know?\r\n\r\nHow  can  you  be  so  accurate?\"  And housewife  B  replied,\r\n\r\n\"Ruler, lor.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we debate what Rule of Law means in this House\r\n\r\nand whether we value it or not, I think sometimes we must  be\r\n\r\nclear  that we know what we are talking about.  We cannot  be\r\n\r\ninexact and flawed in our definition of what Rule of Law  is.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot take a string and say this is what I think Rule of\r\n\r\nLaw  is.  I do believe that Mr J B Jeyaretnam who has  spoken\r\n\r\nextensively acknowledges that there is Rule of Law.  The only\r\n\r\nproblem  he has is that this Rule of Law, because  it  is  so\r\n\r\nwell  upheld by the Government, he has to re-define it.   And\r\n\r\nhe  very cleverly uses a case from the Privy Council to  say,\r\n\r\nyes,  Rule  of  Law does not mean written law; yes,  we  have\r\n\r\nobeyed  the written law.  But besides the written law,  there\r\n\r\nis  something called the rules of natural justice.   Speaking\r\n\r\nas  a  lawyer, I think it is indeed true that there are rules\r\n\r\nof justice which are part of the laws of Singapore, and we do\r\n\r\nnot  deny  that.  Perhaps the debate is so esoteric a  topic,\r\n\r\nthat  it is the reason why most of the speakers in this House\r\n\r\nso far have been lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me just give a graphic illustration of what Rule\r\n\r\nof  Law is and is not.  If you talk about Rule of Law, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  exact  opposite of law of the ruler.  Rule of Law  means\r\n\r\nthe  law decides what you can do, what you as a ruler can do.\r\n\r\nLaw  of  the ruler means what I say as a ruler, that is  law.\r\n\r\nIn  some countries around us, we have read the newspapers, it\r\n\r\nmakes  headlines  when a ruler stops at the  traffic  lights.\r\n\r\nBecause in that country, the Rule of Law is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso abused and violated that when finally a ruler does stop at\r\n\r\na  traffic light, it is news!  I think what would be news  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be  a Minister or an MP  shooting  the  red\r\n\r\nlight.   That is breaking the law, and they will be taken  to\r\n\r\ncourt, I am quite sure, if that happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr J B Jeyaretnam finds nothing wrong with the law,\r\n\r\nand nothing wrong with our application of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I have a point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> I am not giving him the\r\n\r\nfloor.  It gives me concern that his flawed definition  would\r\n\r\ntherefore mislead those in the House who are not lawyers, and\r\n\r\nmislead  the public who are not lawyers.  When we talk  about\r\n\r\nthe  ISA,  he cites that as an example of the breach  of  the\r\n\r\nRule  of Law.  But if you look at the principles of the  Rule\r\n\r\nof  Law,  and  particularly  at  the  principles  of  natural\r\n\r\njustice,  natural  justice  requires  essentially  two  basic\r\n\r\nprinciples.  One is that you have the right to be  heard  and\r\n\r\nto  explain  your  case,  and, two, is  the  right  to  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment.   A right to have your case heard also means  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a review.  As the Minister of State has mentioned,\r\n\r\neven  in the ISA we have got Advisory Boards that review  the\r\n\r\ncases and recommend to the President whether the detention is\r\n\r\nto be upheld or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we do have rules of natural justice applied. There\r\n\r\nare appeals possible and there are reviews possible.  And  as\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay  has  mentioned, there are courts  that  would\r\n\r\nreview our decisions and the decisions of administrators.  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia Khiang has said that there is a difference  between\r\n\r\nthe  policy and the law.  Perhaps there is, perhaps there  is\r\n\r\nnot.   But if a policy is made and it is in contravention  of\r\n\r\nthe  law, the courts will strike it out.  The Ministers would\r\n\r\nnever  have allowed it if they realise it is in violation  of\r\n\r\nthe  law.   Nonetheless, if Queen's Counsel or  any  esteemed\r\n\r\nlawyers  have given an opinion to the Opposition that  things\r\n\r\nare otherwise, they should test it out in the courts, and our\r\n\r\ncourts are independent,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Opposition does admit it.  And we have examples.   Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay  has  mentioned examples of how  the  courts  have\r\n\r\nactually  ruled against the Government.  So there is  natural\r\n\r\njustice, and we must not say that there is not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam chides the House and certain Members of\r\n\r\nthe  House, and I do believe he does chide the Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  too, both from his party and from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's  Party,  saying  that they are  just  hijacking  the\r\n\r\ndebate from this high abstract concept of natural justice  to\r\n\r\ninstances,  isolated  instances, I must  say.   And  isolated\r\n\r\ninstances may sometimes prove a point, but I agree with Mr  J\r\n\r\nB  Jeyaretnam  here  that  we should  not  look  at  isolated\r\n\r\ninstances  but  look at the whole wood.   Having  said  that,\r\n\r\nhowever,  he  goes  on ad infinitum on an isolated  case  and\r\n\r\nisolated  cases.   I would say that natural justice  requires\r\n\r\nthat  the courts are independent and impartial and nobody  in\r\n\r\nthis  House has disagreed with that.  So the ruler  does  not\r\n\r\ndecide  what the law means.  It is the court, independent  of\r\n\r\nthe ruler, who decides what it means, and that to me, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthe Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say also that Mr J B Jeyaretnam's arguments are\r\n\r\nflawed.  For example, he says that we should put the CPIB and\r\n\r\nthe  Police  under,  I do not know what, but  away  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Out of political control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

He\r\n\r\nforgets that if the Police are not accountable to anybody and\r\n\r\nif  they are not checked by anybody, then it will be a Police\r\n\r\nstate beyond what he can imagine.  It will no longer be  Rule\r\n\r\nof Law.  At least, under the political masters, the political\r\n\r\nmasters  are  subject  to checks, and there  are  very  clear\r\n\r\nchecks.   One  is  that the courts can say, you  are  out  of\r\n\r\norder, you cannot do this.  And the courts have done that, as\r\n\r\nI  have said.  Two, every five years or less, they go to  the\r\n\r\nballot  box.  And if they have systematically abused the  law\r\n\r\nand the system,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey would not be elected, they would be chucked out, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  not seen that happen yet to the People's Action  Party.\r\n\r\nSo  I do not believe that the population thinks that there is\r\n\r\na blatant disregard for the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam thinks that an Elections Commission\r\n\r\nwould solve all these problems.  Perhaps he thinks that  with\r\n\r\nan Elections Commission, the Workers' Party would be a ruling\r\n\r\nparty.   I  do  not  think  so.  The people  finally  decide,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  an Elections Commission  or  not.   But  the\r\n\r\nElections Commission is not the cure because, if it  was,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Wong has pointed out, then there are many countries  that\r\n\r\nhave Elections Commissions  -  they should not be having  the\r\n\r\nproblems  they are having.  And we have got examples recently\r\n\r\non  this.   Mr J B Jeyaretnam would, I am sure, say that  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States of America is a prime example of the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw.   I  would say that if he thinks so, and I know  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid this in not so many words before, that the country is  a\r\n\r\nprime  example of the Rule of Law.  Perhaps he  forgets  that\r\n\r\neven  in a country like that, we have got Presidents who have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken to task for breaching the Rule of Law.  The  Iran\r\n\r\ncontra affair during the Reagan's years is one example.   And\r\n\r\nPresident  Nixon had to resign because of another  breach  of\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He had to face the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

That where you have a Rule of Law, a country  that  has\r\n\r\nrespect for the Rule of Law, it is not whether the system  is\r\n\r\nperfect or not.  Nobody says our system is perfect.   But  it\r\n\r\nis  what we do when there is a breach of the Rule of Law, and\r\n\r\ngovernments  get knocked out.  Actually Reagan  did  not  get\r\n\r\nknocked  out,  but  that is another story.   Governments  get\r\n\r\nvoted out and they get imprisoned if they have very blatantly\r\n\r\nbroken  the law.  So as far as I am concerned, the  Elections\r\n\r\nCommission,  the absence or presence of it,  does  not  equal\r\n\r\nRule  of Law.  So we have done what we could.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas  done  what  it has to do to make the Rule  of  Law  well\r\n\r\nrespected  among  Ministers, civil servants and  all  parties\r\n\r\nthat uphold the law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam has got some complaints about how the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  deal  with  his Party.   Sir,  the  last  time  I\r\n\r\nchecked, the editors of the Straits Times and Zaobao had  not\r\n\r\noccupied the Istana yet.  They are not the Government.   They\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  brought into this debate which  we  are  now\r\n\r\ndebating,  and  that is, that we commend the  Government  for\r\n\r\nupholding the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must add that perhaps if you were to look at\r\n\r\nanother  way of summarising what we mean by the Rule of  Law,\r\n\r\nit is that the Rule of Law is a situation where laws are fair\r\n\r\nand transparent and predictable, as Mr Chiam has cleverly put\r\n\r\nit,  in a moment of inspiration perhaps.  I do not think that\r\n\r\nwe  have problems with this, and I do not think Mr Chiam  has\r\n\r\nproblems with this.  He has one instance, and I believe  that\r\n\r\ninstance came about from a misinterpretation of what the  law\r\n\r\nand  the  policy  said, and so I think he  should  be  better\r\n\r\ninformed now as to how that law or that policy was applied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instances like that only go to show that we are not\r\n\r\nperfect.   There  are  things you  can  do  to  improve,  but\r\n\r\ncertainly we are living in a country where the Rule of Law is\r\n\r\nsupreme and we have to commend our Government for it.

Proceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I hope I have a moment of\r\n\r\ninspiration  now as I speak.  I would like to  speak  on  the\r\n\r\namendment to the motion of Mr Jeyaretnam.  I wonder why Prof.\r\n\r\nChin uses the word \"values\" rather than \"uphold\".  Sometimes,\r\n\r\npeople  value  some belief and yet they do not  uphold  their\r\n\r\nbelief.   So  I  think \"uphold\" is a better word.   Also,  he\r\n\r\nwants  the  motion to be amended on the second limb \"Commends\r\n\r\nthe  Government  for upholding the Rule of Law  and  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  it is fully observed by all\".  I cannot agree with this\r\n\r\nbecause of my experience in my constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite some of the examples where Rule of\r\n\r\nLaw  is  not observed in my constituency.  Sir, some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers here may think that that is trivial.  When talking of\r\n\r\nadvancement of the Internet, it is probably a small thing to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalk  about what happens on the ground.  But I can  tell  you\r\n\r\nthat the battle for each seat here in Parliament is fought at\r\n\r\nthe  constituency, on the ground level.  So it is  important.\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  also  said that if you are not  happy,  you  can\r\n\r\nalways  go for a judicial review.  But how do you  go  for  a\r\n\r\njudicial review when a Minister makes a decision not to allow\r\n\r\nthe  MP even to plant a tree there?  Yes, it happened to  me.\r\n\r\nAt  that time, one of the members of the public felt that  he\r\n\r\nshould  present  me with a tree because my  MP's  office  was\r\n\r\nabout  to  be opened, in memory of that.  Like a good  MP,  I\r\n\r\nwrote  to  the HDB for permission to plant one tree and  they\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"No.  Very sorry.  It is not included in the  planting\r\n\r\nplan of the constituency.  You better write to the Parks  and\r\n\r\nTrees  Department.\"   So  we  wrote.   The  Parks  and  Trees\r\n\r\nDepartment replied that the earth there was not suitable  for\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  tree.  When I read that,  I  went  ahead  and\r\n\r\nplanted  the tree.  So the tree was planted.  On that  night,\r\n\r\nsomebody  came and pulled it out and put it in  front  of  my\r\n\r\noffice.  Of course, we planted it back in a pot, just  to  be\r\n\r\nsafe,  but  not on the ground.  How do we go for  a  judicial\r\n\r\nreview  to get permission to have the right to plant a  tree?\r\n\r\nI  do  not know how it is done.  Maybe somebody should advise\r\n\r\nme.   But to me, this is a political matter and it should  be\r\n\r\nresolved politically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, at one time, the PAP was generous enough to give\r\n\r\nOpposition  members a walled-up office at the void  deck.   I\r\n\r\nwas  given one and was very happy and we made good use of  it\r\n\r\nfor our meet-the-people sessions.  Residents could come in to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  their personal problems with privacy in the  office.\r\n\r\nBut now, I do not have an office.  It was torn down and given\r\n\r\nto  somebody  else.   So we have to hold the  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession with just a temporary curtain across and very  little\r\n\r\nprivacy.   We have to speak very softly so that other  people\r\n\r\ncould  not hear.  The office was torn down, so what do I  do?\r\n\r\nDo  I  go for a judicial review and say, \"Look, you have made\r\n\r\nthe  decision to give us an office.  Now it is torn down.   I\r\n\r\nthink the decision is wrong, not properly done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  clear, not rational, not in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIt does not qualify as an appropriate action.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this problem of pasar malams. Pasar malams\r\n\r\nof  course  earn for the people who organise it.  Every  time\r\n\r\nyou  organise it, you get something like $25,000.  The  money\r\n\r\ncan be useful for welfare work and promoting your interest at\r\n\r\nthe constituency.  But suddenly the rules were changed and we\r\n\r\nwere  deprived of holding pasar malams.  They said, \"You  can\r\n\r\nhave  two pasar malams a year.\"  But suddenly some grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, I am not very clear, were given two  years  of\r\n\r\nquota  of  pasar malam.  Instead of one year once, they  were\r\n\r\ngiven  two  years.   In  others words, we  were  straightaway\r\n\r\ndeprived  of two years.  How do you vouch for that?   How  do\r\n\r\nyou  take  that  for a judicial review?  So these  are  small\r\n\r\nproblems which you may think are trivial.  But these  add  up\r\n\r\nto  the popularity or status of the MP there.  If he can hold\r\n\r\npasar  malam or plant a tree, people go round and say,  \"That\r\n\r\nis  the tree planted by the Opposition.\"  Politically, it  is\r\n\r\nprobably not prudent for them to allow all this thing.   That\r\n\r\nis why they were taken off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the battle of the notice boards. The RCs have\r\n\r\nnotice  boards, so do our town councils.  We are supposed  to\r\n\r\nput  up only notices concerning the town council and the  RCs\r\n\r\nare   supposed  to  put  up  only  notices  concerning  their\r\n\r\nactivities.  But if they turn political and put up reports of\r\n\r\nthe   Prime   Minister  and  photograph  of  the  prospective\r\n\r\ncandidate there, advertising himself all the time, and a  lot\r\n\r\nof  political matters, what do I do?  Do I go and complain to\r\n\r\nthe  courts and say, \"Look, this is only meant for RC matters\r\n\r\nand no political matters are to be put on the notice boards.\"\r\n\r\nAgain,  these are little problems.  In the end, maybe Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang is right.  What actually is needed is not Rule of\r\n\r\nLaw,  but  what is fair to both sides.  I am not particularly\r\n\r\nworried  that  all  these things are done  because  they  are\r\n\r\nactually   political  matters  and  should  be  resolved   by\r\n\r\npolitical means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I call for a division, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Those Members in support of a\r\n\r\ndivision please rise in their seats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I call for a division.

But may I just take up a few things which\r\n\r\nwere not brought up in the amendment speech.  The Minister of\r\n\r\nState  said in his speech - I want to reply to him because  I\r\n\r\nthink I have already dismissed the others - as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  understand it, that all are subject to the same law.  This\r\n\r\nis  what we want, equality, all subject to the same law.  But\r\n\r\nhe  does not deal with the specific inequalities that we have\r\n\r\nshown that have happened in Singapore.  I have mentioned  the\r\n\r\nelections as an example and nothing has been said about that.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned about the purchases of the apartment.  This,\r\n\r\nI  have  said, came under the second limb about  all  persons\r\n\r\nbeing  equal under the law.  All that the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\ncan  say  is,  \"The  Senior Minister  and  the  DPM  came  to\r\n\r\nParliament to explain the purchases.\"  We have the Prevention\r\n\r\nof  Corruption Act.  We have section 8 in that Act which says\r\n\r\nthat  where  any public official gets any benefit, advantage,\r\n\r\nfavour  from  anyone who has any dealing with the Government,\r\n\r\nthen  he  will be deemed to have got that benefit  or  favour\r\n\r\ncorruptly.   And  we had here Ministers, not only  Ministers,\r\n\r\nJudge  and  other public officers getting this benefit.   The\r\n\r\nmatter  was not referred to the CPIB for investigation.   But\r\n\r\nwhat was done was for the Prime Minister to take it into  his\r\n\r\nhands  and  to  appoint another Minister  and  somebody  else\r\n\r\noutside  to  look into it. Where is the equality between  the\r\n\r\nMinisters and anybody outside the Government?  In their case,\r\n\r\nit  would  have  been referred immediately to  the  CPIB  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation.   But it was not.  That is one  example  where\r\n\r\nthe law was not applied equally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says, \"Police do not take decisions from\r\n\r\nMinisters.\"  May I tell the Minister of State and this  House\r\n\r\nthat in a proceeding in a court when I was charged along with\r\n\r\nthe  then  Chairman for speaking without  a  permit,  and  we\r\n\r\nclaimed  trial and the licensing officer was called  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence  for  the prosecution, in answer to my question,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Yes, I have been appointed under the Act to  consider\r\n\r\nevery  application and to make the decision.\"   But  he  said\r\n\r\nthat there was a ruling that if any application is made by an\r\n\r\nOpposition  political  party,  that  application  should   be\r\n\r\nreferred to the Ministry first.  Of course, we had known that\r\n\r\nbecause previously, prior to that case, every time I rang him\r\n\r\nup  he  said,  \"Well, I am afraid that  I  do  not  know  the\r\n\r\ndecision yet.  You have to wait. I will let you know  when  I\r\n\r\nget the decision.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell,  that  was  giving  himself away.   So,  there  was  an\r\n\r\nadmission   in   court  that  applications  from   Opposition\r\n\r\npolitical   parties  were  being  treated  differently   from\r\n\r\napplications  by other organisations or individuals.   There,\r\n\r\nyou  have a clear breach of the Rule of Law that all  persons\r\n\r\nare equal and no one is above the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point, which I would like to make, is to\r\n\r\nunderscore what Mr Chiam has said.  The Rule of Law does  not\r\n\r\ntalk  about how judicial decisions are to be made.   That  is\r\n\r\nsomething quite different.  That is built up under the common\r\n\r\nlaw  and there are rules of court.  But what the Rule of  Law\r\n\r\nsays  is  that  the executive cannot deprive  anyone  of  his\r\n\r\nliberty or his goods without a specific law and observing  in\r\n\r\nexecuting that law, the rules of natural justice.  It  is  no\r\n\r\nanswer  to  say we have the Rule of Law because we  have  the\r\n\r\ncourts. We are not talking about the same thing. The Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw  is outside the courts.  It is for the executive, for the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  abide by.  It is for the  man-in-the-street,\r\n\r\nthe  public, to abide by, and of course the courts themselves\r\n\r\nto  abide  by it.  But the Rule of Law is not just  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  decisions  made by the courts.   The  Rule  of  Law  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  to ensure that the executive, that the  Government\r\n\r\nis  under  law,  just  like  any ordinary  citizen.   It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, no answer to say the courts are there to judge, we\r\n\r\nare  not  infringing the Rule of Law.  It is a  non  sequitur\r\n\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

First, I think I have to put on record  that\r\n\r\nwhen I said that the Minister does not direct the Police what\r\n\r\nto  do, it is not in relation to matters, all and sundry, but\r\n\r\nit   is   in  relation  to  applications  under  the   Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct  when  political parties are concerned.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwhen  an  Opposition party applies for a PEL,  the  licensing\r\n\r\nofficer  will have to exercise his professional judgement  as\r\n\r\nhe is required to do under the Public Entertainments Act.  He\r\n\r\ndoes not seek the approval of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That was not what that officer said.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am telling him the practice\r\n\r\nas  we  do  it now.  The other point is Mr Low Thia  Khiang's\r\n\r\ncomment about fairness. What is important is that if we  have\r\n\r\nrules,  for  example, like setting up a community foundation,\r\n\r\nit is open to everybody to do it, not just PAP but Opposition\r\n\r\nparties.   If  you are unable to do it because  of  financial\r\n\r\nconstraints, you should not say that there is no Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam brought up some instances on the\r\n\r\nground  which he has lived with.  These are, as he has  said,\r\n\r\nnot  problems  of the Rule of Law but how all  of  us  handle\r\n\r\nmatters on the ground to reach out to constituents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question, as amended, put , and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House (i) values the importance of the Rule of\r\n\r\nLaw;  and (ii) commends the Government for upholding the Rule\r\n\r\nof Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \"\r\n\r\n- [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight minutes past Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\u0000\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
