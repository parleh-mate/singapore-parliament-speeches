-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Because of our close links with our\r\n\r\nneighbours in the South East Asia region, Singapore is  affected\r\n\r\nby the economic well-being of their economies.   It is therefore\r\n\r\nin  our  interests  to do what we can to maintain  economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial stability in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first take up Mr Inderjit Singh's question and\r\n\r\nexplain the nature and form of the rescue package to Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's contribution to the Indonesian reform package\r\n\r\nis  in  two  parts.   The first is a loan  of  US$5  billion  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the aid package offered jointly by the International\r\n\r\nMonetary  Fund  (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian  Development\r\n\r\nBank (ADB).  The second is the purchase of Rupiah to support the\r\n\r\nIndonesian currency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on the first part of our assistance\r\n\r\npackage.   Indonesia  has  adopted  a  strong  economic   reform\r\n\r\nprogramme  which  should  help  to  restore  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.    This  programme,  which  was  formulated  with   the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  the IMF, World Bank and ADB, will  be  supported\r\n\r\nwith  US$23  billion  of financing from the  three  multilateral\r\n\r\nagencies  as  well  as from Indonesia's own substantial  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves.    However,  if  for  some  unforeseen  reasons,   the\r\n\r\nmultilateral  financing proves to be inadequate, then  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  several other countries with regional interests,  including\r\n\r\nJapan,  the United States, Malaysia, Australia and Brunei,  have\r\n\r\nagreed  to  provide  supplementary  financing  to  support   the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   In particular, Singapore has pledged to  contribute\r\n\r\nup  to US$5 billion to this \"second line of defence\".  There  is\r\n\r\nevery  likelihood  that there may be no need  to  draw  on  this\r\n\r\nsupplementary line of credit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of our assistance package involves the\r\n\r\npurchase   of   Rupiah  to  support  the  Indonesian   currency.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Japan share the view that loss of confidence  was\r\n\r\nthe primary cause of the recent depreciation of the Rupiah.  The\r\n\r\nfall  in  the value of the Rupiah has been excessive  and  could\r\n\r\njeopardize the successful implementation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  reform  programme.   Therefore,  both  countries  have\r\n\r\nagreed  to  collaborate  with  Bank  Indonesia,  through   joint\r\n\r\nintervention  in  the foreign exchange market,  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of  the  Rupiah to levels  more  consistent  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia's   economic  fundamentals.    The   amount   of   our\r\n\r\nintervention   is   not  predetermined  and   will   depend   on\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the foreign exchange market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has asked whether the US$1 billion loan\r\n\r\nto Thailand and US$5 billion assistance to Indonesia will affect\r\n\r\nour  reserves  and  Singaporeans' Central Provident  Fund  (CPF)\r\n\r\nsavings,  in  case of default.  I would like to assure  Mr  Seng\r\n\r\nthat  our  CPF  savings are not at risk at all.  CPF  funds  are\r\n\r\ninvested  in  Singapore Government bonds  and  the  Government's\r\n\r\nexternal reserves are well in excess of its CPF obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the facilities offered to Thailand and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  are  sovereign loans and remain part of  our  foreign\r\n\r\nassets.   The  loans  are to help maintain foreign  reserves  of\r\n\r\nthose two countries at a \"comfortable\" level to instill investor\r\n\r\nconfidence.  Neither Thailand nor Indonesia have ever  defaulted\r\n\r\non their sovereign debts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has asked why Singapore, being such a\r\n\r\nsmall country, needs to contribute an amount equal to Japan's to\r\n\r\nassist  Indonesia.  I would like to point out  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nloan  was  made  as  a result of a request from  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  for assistance, and Japan subsequently  matched  our\r\n\r\noffer.  Our willingness to extend a substantial loan despite our\r\n\r\nsmall size is reflective of the importance Singapore places upon\r\n\r\nits  relationship with Indonesia and the close ties between  the\r\n\r\nleaders of Indonesia and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has also asked how Singapore and other ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries will benefit from Singapore's financial assistance  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  The recent currency turmoil has revealed  the  close\r\n\r\ninterdependence of the economies in this region.  As the largest\r\n\r\neconomy in ASEAN and a close\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneighbour, the health of the Indonesian economy is critical  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  Singapore  but also to the overall prosperity  of  the\r\n\r\nregion.   The  restoration of investor confidence  in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nwill  help  to stabilise regional financial markets.   Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  also benefit in the long term when the Indonesian  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers and resumes strong growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister who will administer the US$5 billion  loan.   Will\r\n\r\nIMF  do  it  or  will  Singapore do it directly?   Is  the  loan\r\n\r\ntargeted  for  any specific spending in Indonesia  or  is  it  a\r\n\r\ngeneral fund?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the loan is administered, will it affect any\r\n\r\nSingapore Government's spending plan for the next few years, eg,\r\n\r\nin  upgrading  programmes or any other programmes like  the  MRT\r\n\r\nlines and so on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The loan will be administered\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Monetary  Authority of  Singapore  (MAS)  and  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Ministry of Finance.  It will be a direct  loan  from\r\n\r\nMAS  to  the  Indonesian government and  will,  as  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, if  drawn down, be used basically to act as part of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian government's foreign reserve.  It will have no impact\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  on  the  Singapore  Government's  current  operating\r\n\r\nexpenditures and therefore its surpluses, if there are  any,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  should  be  no direct impact  on  the  Government's\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  including  the upgrading programmes,  provided  the\r\n\r\nGovernment continues to run current surpluses in its  budget  in\r\n\r\nthe next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I have about three questions.  May I ask them altogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I had intended to ask the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthese  questions but I see he is not in the House.   So  I  will\r\n\r\naddress them to the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should first of all like to know where and when was this\r\n\r\ndecision  taken to grant the assistance to Indonesia.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwho took the decision?  Was it taken by the Cabinet or by any of\r\n\r\nthe Ministers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThirdly,  why  was the approval of Parliament not sought  before\r\n\r\nthe  decision was taken and the announcement made?  Finally, was\r\n\r\nthe  approval  of the President sought before the  decision  was\r\n\r\ntaken and the announcement made?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nexactly  where and when the decision was made but it was several\r\n\r\nweeks  ago, and the decision was taken by the Prime Minister  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with his senior advisers, which include the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister, the Deputy Prime Minister and myself, and subsequently\r\n\r\nthe decision was approved by Cabinet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who took the decision? The Prime Minister ultimately,\r\n\r\nincluding  his senior Ministers.  Why was Parliament's  approval\r\n\r\nnot  sought?   A  decision of this sort is entirely  within  the\r\n\r\nprerogative  of the Executive.  It is no more than a  conversion\r\n\r\nof  one loan to another form.  For example,  we buy from time to\r\n\r\ntime  large  quantities of, let us say, 5-year US  bonds.   This\r\n\r\nloan  to Indonesia merely converts the US$ loan extended to  the\r\n\r\nUS  government  to a loan extended to Indonesia.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nchange  in the asset position.  Therefore, there is no  need  to\r\n\r\nrefer to Parliament.  Equally, for the same reason, there is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  refer  the  matter to Parliament because  Parliament's\r\n\r\nresponsibility is to approve legislative matters and not to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in Executive decisions on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's approval was not necessary because in 1980\r\n\r\nPresident   Sheares  had  already  approved  the   purchase   of\r\n\r\nIndonesian  assets  and  in  1986 President  Wee  Kim  Wee  also\r\n\r\napproved   the  purchase  of  Indonesian  equities   and   these\r\n\r\nPresidential  approvals  are  still  valid  notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\nelection  of  the  Elected President.

As he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmentioned, there are very close economic links between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries,  eg, the trade ties between Indonesia  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  what are the figures.  Secondly, could he elaborate on  the\r\n\r\nreserve  that will be drawn upon and where will the  money  come\r\n\r\nfrom?  Does it need us to sell off some of our foreign assets or\r\n\r\ndraw down on some of our own particular reserves held in various\r\n\r\ncurrencies  and what sort of impact will it have  on  the  funds\r\n\r\nthat we have?  Thirdly, could the Minister elaborate on some  of\r\n\r\nthe  details of the loan, eg, the interest rate if  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndrawdown,  the repayment schedule and the terms of repayment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the question of trade ties, I\r\n\r\nwill  refer his question to the Minister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\nI  think  he will have occasion to speak later on some question.\r\n\r\nHe has the exact figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the money come from? It comes from MAS' own\r\n\r\nassets.   MAS manages a portfolio of substantial size and  holds\r\n\r\nits  financial assets in various forms, largely financial assets\r\n\r\nin  US  dollars, Deutsche Mark or Yen.  As I mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian loan is therefore a conversion of one asset form\r\n\r\nto another, so it has no impact on MAS' reserve position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan is a five-year facility drawn down on five\r\n\r\ntranches  of  $1  billion each at the request of the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment.  It will be at commercial interest rate,  ie,  SIBOR\r\n\r\nplus  a  premium,  SIBOR being six months US  dollar  inter-bank\r\n\r\ninterest  rate.  The loan will have to be repaid either  earlier\r\n\r\nor the maximum of five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, as regards the 16\r\n\r\nIndonesian  banks  that  were  asked  to  be  closed  by   their\r\n\r\ngovernment,  do  the  Singapore  Government  and  any  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment related companies have an interest in them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As far as I am aware, none.

Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nproblem   began  in  late  September  when  the  Johor   Customs\r\n\r\nimplemented  stringent  checks on  both  outgoing  and  incoming\r\n\r\nvehicles.   The  result was massive congestion at  the  Causeway\r\n\r\nwith  long  lorry  tailbacks from Johor Customs  Tanjong  Puteri\r\n\r\nComplex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, checks are conducted on a selective basis in line\r\n\r\nwith  the  Best Customs Practices' code advocated by  the  World\r\n\r\nCustoms  Organisation, of which both Singapore and Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nmembers.  The sudden change in procedure resulted in long delays\r\n\r\nof up to seven hours to clear the Johor Customs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jams at the Causeway have affected bilateral trade and\r\n\r\nespecially manufacturers with plants situated in both  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Johor.   Parts  and components are sent from  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nJohor on a daily basis to be assembled, and then transported  to\r\n\r\ntheir  Singapore plants on a Just-in-Time basis (JIT) for  final\r\n\r\nassembly and distribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any impediment to the free flow of cargo along the Causeway\r\n\r\ndisrupts production schedules, and directly impacts the Just-in-Time  concept  of modern factory operation.  To  overcome  this,\r\n\r\ncompanies  on  both sides of the Causeway had to increase  their\r\n\r\ninventories  and  rent  more  lorries  to  transport  parts  and\r\n\r\ncomponents, resulting in higher operating costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised this issue with my Malaysian counterpart Rafidah\r\n\r\nAziz  at  the ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting in Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nlast month.  Prime Minister Goh subsequently discussed the issue\r\n\r\nwith the Malaysian Prime Minister during bilateral talks at  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  in  Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe  two  Prime  Ministers agreed that the  relevant  Ministries\r\n\r\nwould  look  into  the matter to see how it could  be  resolved.\r\n\r\nForeign Minister Jayakumar also followed up on the subject  with\r\n\r\nhis Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Badawi who said that he would\r\n\r\ninstruct the relevant Malaysian ministries to get in touch  with\r\n\r\ntheir Singapore counterparts to deal with the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, our Government agencies at the Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint did all they could to alleviate the traffic jam.  The\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  increased  their  manpower  deployment  at  the\r\n\r\nCheckpoint  and  Causeway  to manage  traffic,  as  well  as  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the movement of Johor-bound lorries by allowing  them\r\n\r\nto  occupy up to two lanes on the Causeway, instead of the usual\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the past two weeks appears to have\r\n\r\nimproved.   Nevertheless,  we  will  continue  to  monitor   the\r\n\r\nsituation  and,  if necessary, work with the relevant  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities to ensure that the problem does not crop up again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the second crossing next year will help to\r\n\r\nreduce  traffic at the Causeway and minimise the traffic  queues\r\n\r\non  both Woodlands Road and the Bukit Timah Expressway.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  whether  he  is aware that as a  result  of  the  sharp\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of  the  Malaysian  ringgit,  large   numbers   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have been crossing the Causeway to shop  in  Johor\r\n\r\nBaru, causing a severe drop in business for Singapore retailers,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  in Woodlands and, if so, whether  he  has  an\r\n\r\nestimate  of  the  loss in GST revenue arising  from  this;  and\r\n\r\nwhether,  in  view  of this, he will review  the  GST  exemption\r\n\r\nlimits  on goods brought into Singapore, to reduce this  revenue\r\n\r\nloss and to encourage Singaporeans to shop in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent weeks,\r\n\r\nthere has been an increase in the number of Singaporean shoppers\r\n\r\nto  Johor  Baru  to  take advantage of the depreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  ringgit  as  well as shopping sales  in  Johor  Baru.\r\n\r\nCustoms and Excise Department has stepped up GST checks  at  the\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  to  ensure that all Singaporean shoppers  returning\r\n\r\nfrom Johor comply with the GST requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable GST exemption is given for goods imported by\r\n\r\nbona fide travellers.  The intention is to relieve a person from\r\n\r\npaying GST on a reasonable amount of purchases he may bring into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Currently, an adult traveller, which is a person  18\r\n\r\nyears old and above, who had been away for more than 48 hours is\r\n\r\nallowed  an  exemption from GST up to $400 of the value  of  the\r\n\r\ngoods  brought in.  If a traveller is below the age of 18 years,\r\n\r\nthe  GST  exemption is on the value of goods up  to  $200.   The\r\n\r\nabove limits are halved if he has been away less than 48 hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October this year, an average of about 7,000 Singapore\r\n\r\nregistered   cars   return  from  Malaysia   every   day.    If,\r\n\r\ntheoretically,  each  car contains purchases  up  to  $800  (the\r\n\r\nmaximum  GST  exemption on the assumption that each car  carries\r\n\r\nfour  adults, including the driver), the potential  GST  revenue\r\n\r\nloss  per  year can be up to $60 million.  Even if  each  person\r\n\r\nbuys  only  up to half his GST exemption limit, the  loss  would\r\n\r\nstill  be  some $30 million.  In practice, of course, not  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean is likely to use up his exemption limit and many  of\r\n\r\nthe day purchases are in the form of groceries and poultries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly reviewing the GST system, including the\r\n\r\nGST  exemption limits, to ensure that the GST system  introduced\r\n\r\nonly  three  years ago in 1994 is working well.   We  will  take\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  safeguard  revenue  loss  arising  from  the   GST\r\n\r\nexemption limits if the situation necessitates such a move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Several MPs had written to the\r\n\r\nCommittee  strenuously opposing Mr Tang Liang Hong's appointment\r\n\r\nas  an  NMP.  The MPs had also spoken to BG Lee at the  time  to\r\n\r\nexpress the same views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG Lee told me about the MPs' views, and gave me copies of\r\n\r\nthe  letters during the last General Election.  He had asked the\r\n\r\nSpeaker for the letters as he did not have them with him on  the\r\n\r\nday  he  spoke  to me about the MPs' views.  The letters  showed\r\n\r\nclearly  that  Tang  was  a Chinese chauvinist.   I  decided  to\r\n\r\nrelease  them  to  the media.  Tang was standing  for  election.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans had a right to know before the election  that  long\r\n\r\nbefore  Tang  contemplated  entering opposition  politics,  four\r\n\r\nChinese  educated MPs, plus Dr Tay Eng Soon,  all  of  whom  had\r\n\r\nknown Tang for many years, had concluded that he was a dangerous\r\n\r\nextremist.   There  was nothing personal.  But  they  considered\r\n\r\nTang unfit to be a Nominated Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By December 1996, Dr Tay Eng Soon had passed away. The\r\n\r\nother MPs consented to their letters being made public.  The MPs\r\n\r\nalso   publicly  repeated,  confirmed  and  elaborated  on   the\r\n\r\nstatements  in  their letters.  There was  no  question  of  any\r\n\r\nbreach of confidentiality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand Tang being embarrassed by these letters,\r\n\r\nwhich  were  written four years before he became a candidate  in\r\n\r\nthe  1996 elections, and therefore carried that much more weight\r\n\r\nwith  the  people  and the court.  But I am surprised  that  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party, which has repeatedly pressed the Government  to\r\n\r\nprovide Singaporeans with more information to make up their  own\r\n\r\nminds, should make an issue of the publication of the letters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister that my purpose\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  asking  this question was not for him to air  his  views  on\r\n\r\nwhether  Mr  Tang  Liang Hong is a Chinese chauvinist  or  anti-Christian.

So  we  had  the\r\n\r\npermission  of the authors of the letters and they could  easily\r\n\r\nrepeat in public those same opinions which were contained in the\r\n\r\nletters,  which they did, not just once but several times,  with\r\n\r\ntelling blows during the General Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he thinks that it is enough to say that  those\r\n\r\nwho  wrote the letters consented?

There  was  some impact on the volume of  re-exports  and\r\n\r\nvisitor  arrivals.  Nevertheless, economic growth picked  up  in\r\n\r\nthe  third  quarter to 10.1% compared with 8.2%  in  the  second\r\n\r\nquarter.   For the whole of 1997, we are on track to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nGDP growth rate of about 7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main factors have provided underlying support for our\r\n\r\nhealthy growth this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, we are benefiting from the recovery in global\r\n\r\nelectronics  demand, with favourable spin-off effects  on  trade\r\n\r\nand hub services;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, a large part of Singapore's regional trade\r\n\r\nconsists  of intra-firm movement of parts, components and  final\r\n\r\nproducts  by  multi-national  companies.   As  demand  from  the\r\n\r\neventual  markets of the US and EC remained strong,  Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrade  was  not  seriously  affected by  the  regional  currency\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead into 1998, we can expect some moderation in\r\n\r\ngrowth.   The sustained global electronics recovery and expected\r\n\r\nhealthy growth in the US and EU will continue to provide  strong\r\n\r\nunderlying  support for Singapore's economic  growth.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  regional  financial  turmoil  is  expected  to  affect  our\r\n\r\nservices sector somewhat.  Activity in the commerce sector  will\r\n\r\nbe  dampened  by  fewer visitor arrivals from  ASEAN  and  lower\r\n\r\nspending   from   those  who  come,  reflecting  their   reduced\r\n\r\npurchasing  power.   Re-export trade may  also  be  affected  by\r\n\r\ncutbacks  on  imports  to  the region, although  this  would  be\r\n\r\nsomewhat  offset by the electronics recovery.  Any  slowdown  in\r\n\r\ntrade  would  also  have  a  negative  knock-on  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ntransportation sector.  The financial services sector is  likely\r\n\r\nto  see  slower growth in the Asian Dollar Market next  year  as\r\n\r\nmajor  infrastructure  projects in  the  region  are  postponed.\r\n\r\nGeneral uncertainty about the region could also keep funds  away\r\n\r\nand  dampen  the fund management industry, although fundamentals\r\n\r\nin  the  region  remain sound and when the currency  and  equity\r\n\r\nmarkets   stabilise,  foreign  funds  could  return   within   a\r\n\r\nrelatively  short period, to seek good investment  opportunities\r\n\r\nat  attractive  lower  levels.  Taking all  these  factors  into\r\n\r\nconsideration, MTI's preliminary GDP forecast for 1998 is 5%-7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This currency crisis has highlighted the importance of\r\n\r\nfiscal prudence and sound financial management.  Singapore has a\r\n\r\nstrong current account surplus which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstands  at  15% of our GDP.  The Government budget has  been  in\r\n\r\nsurplus  for  many years and there has been no  need  to  borrow\r\n\r\nmoney  for  public  expenditure.   The  MAS  has  imposed   high\r\n\r\nprudential standards on our financial institutions.  Our foreign\r\n\r\nreserves are strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors have remained confident of Singapore's economic\r\n\r\nprospects,  despite  the regional financial turmoil.   Recently,\r\n\r\nMNCs  like  3M  and Molex announced their plans to expand  their\r\n\r\nplants  in  Singapore.   In  the  third  quarter  of  1997,  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector registered investment commitments of  S$2.2\r\n\r\nbillion in fixed assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does not expect the depreciation of the\r\n\r\nregional  currencies  against the Singapore  dollar  to  have  a\r\n\r\nserious  impact  on our export competitiveness, although  it  is\r\n\r\nmonitoring   the   situation  and  will  recommend   appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures,  if  necessary.   Although the  Singapore  dollar  has\r\n\r\nappreciated  against the regional currencies, it is  competitive\r\n\r\non  a  trade-weighted  basis as it has depreciated  against  the\r\n\r\ncurrencies of most developed countries.  With about half of  our\r\n\r\nexports  going  to the OECD countries, the depreciation  against\r\n\r\nthese currencies will help our exports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of Singapore's exports of goods and\r\n\r\nservices  is also different from those of other ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\nOver  the years, we have upgraded our manufacturing and  service\r\n\r\nsectors  to stay ahead of our regional competitors in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntechnology, skill content and value added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain competitive, we have to continually improve our\r\n\r\nproductivity  by  upgrading  our capabilities  and  moving  into\r\n\r\nhigher value added activities.  The Government will continue  to\r\n\r\ninvest  heavily in education and training, improve our  business\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, optimise the use of our limited land and  labour\r\n\r\nresources, and keep a close track of our cost situation so  that\r\n\r\nwe remain internationally competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, with the currency and stock market\r\n\r\nturmoil,  our economy has performed rather well during the  last\r\n\r\nquarter.

There  has  been  some impact, eg, in  terms  of  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals and this has also affected the retail trade.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  impact would probably be greater in the fourth quarter than\r\n\r\nin  the  third  quarter,  and this is  compounded  by  the  haze\r\n\r\nproblem.   We have to tell our foreign visitors from Europe  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere that the haze has, in fact, cleared.  But the  message\r\n\r\nis still there, ie, there is a haze problem here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency turmoil has affected us in different ways. In\r\n\r\nthe  real economy, in manufacturing, in fact, we have done  very\r\n\r\nwell  and  we  are geared for further growth.  We have  recently\r\n\r\ncompleted  a petrochemical project.  Our electronic  plants  are\r\n\r\ndoing  well and the world economic recovery has set  in  in  the\r\n\r\nfield   of   electronics.   For  next  year,  if  the  situation\r\n\r\nstabilises and the funds start to come back and the stock market\r\n\r\npicks  up, obviously the situation would be better.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nhard to say how much without proper estimation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, to the extent that the other ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  as  well  as  Korea  are  able  to  effect   a   real\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of  their  currencies,  would  not  the   Minister\r\n\r\nanticipate that there will be greater cost competitive pressures\r\n\r\non  Singapore, and also that there will actually  be  a  greater\r\n\r\noutflow  of  investments from Singapore as  a  result  of  this,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind that it is not just the ASEAN countries but also\r\n\r\nour  competitors, eg, Korea, that have depreciated in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntheir currencies?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> As I have mentioned, relative to the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries, our export composition is somewhat  different.\r\n\r\nFor example, Indonesia is still very dependent on exports of oil\r\n\r\nand  natural produce and their manufactured goods are lower  end\r\n\r\nproducts.   Our  closest competitor is probably  Malaysia.   But\r\n\r\nthere again, we are ahead of them in terms of the skill content.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  are higher up the value added ladder.  We will have to  keep\r\n\r\nahead of them.  Where we are exporting the same kind of products\r\n\r\nto  the  same  markets, then they may have a cost  advantage  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  their lower local cost.  But if they are importing  a\r\n\r\nlot of components, for example, and the value added component is\r\n\r\nreally not very big, the question is whether they can keep their\r\n\r\ncost  down.  There will be higher inflation, there will be  wage\r\n\r\npressures and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative to the NIEs - Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea - in\r\n\r\nfact, they are worried that ASEAN currencies having depreciated,\r\n\r\napart  from  the Singapore dollar which has also depreciated  by\r\n\r\nabout  10%, the others have gone down by about 30-40%.   Taiwan,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  has  allowed its currency to come down  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncompete  and  its situation is somewhat similar to  ours.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong  is  still maintaining its peg and this has been translated\r\n\r\ninto impact on the interest rate as well as the real economy and\r\n\r\nthe stock market.  Korea is in a rather difficult situation.  We\r\n\r\nhave to watch and see.  But there again, they have tried to keep\r\n\r\ntheir currency at a certain level, which is rather high relative\r\n\r\nto the US dollar.  Of late, it has come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I am aware that the Chinese\r\n\r\nRenminbi  has been rather stable and unhurt thus far.

The Chinese government  will,\r\n\r\nof  course, monitor and they may have to adjust.  I do not know.\r\n\r\nIt  is  up to them.  But so far, the country is performing  very\r\n\r\nwell and the growth rate is very high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my answer, we will have to assess and monitor\r\n\r\nand  see how it goes.  So far, it looks all right.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the investment flow to Singapore, we are still  doing\r\n\r\nvery  well.   EDB  is still very confident and, if anything,  we\r\n\r\nare  in  a  somewhat  stronger position  now  in  terms  of  our\r\n\r\nstability  and ability to sustain real activity.

Does the Minister not expect that\r\n\r\nto  the  extent  that  there  is a  real  devaluation  by  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  actually  there  would  be  a  greater  outflow   of\r\n\r\ninvestments from Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> In Singapore's case, we cannot avoid\r\n\r\nhaving this effect.

Our aim should be to go higher.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe are working closely with the Indonesians in Batam, Bintan and\r\n\r\nso  on, to the extent that it is more attractive now for them to\r\n\r\ngo overseas.

The belief is that some  mechanism\r\n\r\nshould  be  introduced to control speculative  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls are unrelated to the concept of regulating\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial sector with a \"lighter touch\", as outlined\r\n\r\nby  DPM  BG  Lee  in his speech to SESDAQ on 4th November  1997.\r\n\r\nRegulating with a \"lighter touch\" does not mean the lowering  of\r\n\r\nsupervisory  standards.   The maintenance  of  high  supervisory\r\n\r\nstandards  will remain a cornerstone of Singapore's  development\r\n\r\nas a financial centre.  It means modifying the style and balance\r\n\r\nof  regulation and supervision.  The proposal is to set  clearer\r\n\r\nrules to encourage the private sector to play a greater role and\r\n\r\nto  allow  more  innovation, but to  accompany  this  with  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive supervision to ensure compliance.  The reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  change  in  approach is the need  to  respond  to  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging banking technology and international competition.  This\r\n\r\nis a strategic shift in approach which we must do independent of\r\n\r\nthe short-term economic ups and downs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EN-BLOC SALES IN PRIVATE CONDOMINIUMS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Law whether he\r\n\r\nwill  consider  making it easier for en-bloc  sales  in  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums to be effected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In these cases, the vast majority are\r\n\r\nunable  to proceed to sell their residential developments  at  a\r\n\r\npremium,  in  order  to  maximise their  development  potential.\r\n\r\nThere is also a public interest because rejuvenation of estates,\r\n\r\nthrough en-bloc sales of older developments, cannot be realised.\r\n\r\nGovernment recognises that there is a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a basic principle, the Government has never allowed\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the overwhelming interests of the majority to  be\r\n\r\nheld   up  by  a  minority.   Compulsory  land  acquisition   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate comprehensive development is an example.  It  defeats\r\n\r\nnational objectives if changes in Development Guide Plans cannot\r\n\r\nbe  translated into better utilisation of scarce land  resources\r\n\r\nin  those  cases because disagreements have held up or prevented\r\n\r\nen-bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore amend the law to make it easier for en-bloc sales to be effected by removing the requirement to obtain\r\n\r\nthe  agreement of 100% of owners.  However, we will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  appropriate safeguards to protect  minority  owners,\r\n\r\nsuch as ensuring that the purchase price is fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a practice will not be peculiar to Singapore. In some\r\n\r\nCanadian states and Hawaii, owners' unanimous agreement  is  not\r\n\r\nrequired  to  terminate a strata-titled development.   In  those\r\n\r\nstates,  land  is  abundant.  In land-scarce Singapore,  such  a\r\n\r\nchange  is  even more imperative, as it will release more  prime\r\n\r\nland  for higher-intensity developments to provide more  quality\r\n\r\nhousing for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if the Government is going to amend\r\n\r\nthe  law  to  allow the majority to have their  way  in  en-bloc\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  how  many  per cent of  the  residents  must  give\r\n\r\nconsent before this en-bloc development is allowed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The\r\n\r\nBill  sets  out the scope of Singapore's Government  procurement\r\n\r\ncovered  by  the GPA and the regulations governing the  receipt,\r\n\r\nprocess  and  disposal of any complaint or  \"bid  challenge\"  by\r\n\r\nsuppliers   of   any  alleged  non-compliance   with   the   GPA\r\n\r\nrequirements  by Government Ministries, Departments,  Organs  of\r\n\r\nState and Statutory Boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background to the GPA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA took effect on 1st January 1996. It is an\r\n\r\ninternational framework designed to make government  procurement\r\n\r\nmore  transparent, and to ensure that Government do not  protect\r\n\r\ndomestic  products  and  suppliers,  nor  discriminate   against\r\n\r\nforeign products and suppliers.  The GPA requires that signatory\r\n\r\nmembers  shall  not discriminate against the products,  services\r\n\r\nand suppliers of another member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 25 GPA members, including the United\r\n\r\nStates of America, Canada, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Korea,\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and most of the European Union countries.     It  is\r\n\r\nthus  beneficial for Singapore to accede to the GPA.  It is also\r\n\r\na  re-affirmation of Singapore's open and transparent Government\r\n\r\nand  our  commitment to the open multi-lateral  trading  system.\r\n\r\nSingapore's application to join the GPA was approved by the  WTO\r\n\r\non 20th September 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predecessor of GPA is the Tokyo Round Government\r\n\r\nProcurement  Code, which came into effect on 1st  January  1981.\r\n\r\nIt  covered  the procurement of goods at the central  government\r\n\r\nlevel.   Singapore is a signatory to the Tokyo Round  Government\r\n\r\nProcurement  Code.    The  GPA  goes  beyond  the  Tokyo   Round\r\n\r\nGovernment  Procurement  Code  by offering  services,  including\r\n\r\nconstruction; procurement by sub-central government, ie, states,\r\n\r\nprovinces and prefectures;  as well as procurement by government-related or linked entities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA will cover procurement of goods and services by our\r\n\r\nMinistries and Organs of State and 25 statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore's Government procurement system</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always practised an open and competitive\r\n\r\nsystem   of  Government  procurement.     The  three  principles\r\n\r\nunderpinning Singapore's public procurement policies are :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Open, fair, competitive and transparent rules and\r\n\r\nprocedures.   The processes and procedures of submitting tenders\r\n\r\nfor  Government  projects  are well publicised  and  adhered  to\r\n\r\nstrictly;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Honesty and integrity in the evaluation of tenders and\r\n\r\nquotations; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Value for money based on overall cost-effectiveness and\r\n\r\nefficiency.    This ensures that we stretch the  tax-dollar  and\r\n\r\nkeep the cost of Government low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These principles have stood us in good stead over the years\r\n\r\nand  have  earned us a high reputation amongst  both  local  and\r\n\r\ninternational  suppliers and contractors.   The  private  sector\r\n\r\nknows that it cannot win Government projects through connections\r\n\r\nor  under-the-table methods.  As they know that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  be  rational in its evaluation of tenders, many have  also\r\n\r\nproposed  better  and  more cost-effective  alternatives,  hence\r\n\r\nhelping us to operate more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have improved the system to make it more\r\n\r\nefficient  and effective.  For example, we now post tenders  and\r\n\r\naward  information on the Internet under the Government Internet\r\n\r\nTendering  Information System (GITIS).  Any  supplier  from  any\r\n\r\npart  of  the  globe  can  access easily  and  cheaply  collated\r\n\r\ninformation  on  tenders  called by the  Government  Ministries,\r\n\r\nDepartments and Statutory Boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA requirements are congruous with our procurement\r\n\r\nprinciples.    We have no fundamental problems adhering  to  the\r\n\r\nGPA  requirements.    Some administrative  changes  are  however\r\n\r\nnecessary.    For example, GPA imposes a minimum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntendering period of 40 days, longer than our present minimum  of\r\n\r\n21 days;  and a bid-challenge system has to be instituted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provisions of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now bring Members through the salient provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) First, the Bill provides for the identification of the\r\n\r\nprocurement entities and types of procurement to be subjected to\r\n\r\nthe GPA, the method of valuing each procurement to determine  if\r\n\r\nit  is within the GPA threshold value, and types of  procurement\r\n\r\nthat  could  be excluded, as provided for by the  GPA,  such  as\r\n\r\nthose  on grounds of national security, defence, public  morals,\r\n\r\norder  or  safety,  human, animal or plant  life  or  health  or\r\n\r\nintellectual  property, or products or services  of  handicapped\r\n\r\npersons and of philanthropic institutions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, the Bill specifies the procurement procedures\r\n\r\nin respect of:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the technical specifications to be included in tender\r\n\r\ndocuments;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the procedures for the qualification of suppliers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the procedures for the award of a procurement contract;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the collation and provision of information on\r\n\r\nprocurement activities of entities covered under the GPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill sets out the provisions for the bid\r\n\r\nchallenge  system. This is required under the GPA to provide  an\r\n\r\navenue  through  which aggrieved suppliers can lodge  complaints\r\n\r\nover  alleged non-compliance with the GPA requirements, and seek\r\n\r\ncompensation.    This   is   to  be  implemented   through   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Government Procurement Adjudication Tribunal.\r\n\r\nIts  members will comprise a Commissioner and a number of Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioners.  The hearing of the challenge will be done either\r\n\r\nby  the  Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner.  Procedures  and\r\n\r\nrules  governing  the  lodging and hearing  of  the  challenges,\r\n\r\nconsistent with the GPA\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequirements, have been included.    Powers of the Tribunal such\r\n\r\nas  those relating to the proceedings, costs and damages  to  be\r\n\r\nawarded and suspension of procurement are spelt out in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector in Singapore has, over the years, built\r\n\r\nup high standards of integrity, honesty and efficiency in public\r\n\r\nprocurement.   The Government Procurement Bill will  bring  some\r\n\r\naspects  of  our public procurement policies and  procedures  in\r\n\r\nline  with  other  GPA  signatories.  This will  help  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  supplying goods and services  to  the  government\r\n\r\nagencies  of  GPA members.  At the same time, it re-affirms  our\r\n\r\ncommitment  to our own high standards of public procurement  and\r\n\r\nour commitment to the open global multi-lateral trading system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for letting me speak on the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Bill shows the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  support  for international relations  as  well  as\r\n\r\nmulti-lateral  trade.   It  is gratifying  that  this  Bill  has\r\n\r\nprovision  for  mediation, which is a feature  of  our  judicial\r\n\r\nsystem.  This will help in resolving disputes.  However, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam a little disturbed as clause 7(3) takes away the power of the\r\n\r\nCourt, but it is reassuring that clause 8 has provision for  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Tribunal.  Sir, may I first read clause 7(3)?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A breach of a duty referred to in subsection (1) shall not\r\n\r\nbe  the  subject of any proceedings in any court but may be  the\r\n\r\nsubject of a challenge brought before the Tribunal by a supplier\r\n\r\nto  whom  the  duty is owed and who has suffered, or  reasonably\r\n\r\nrisks suffering, loss or damage as a result of the breach.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it is reassuring that the Tribunal would look\r\n\r\nafter  the  interest of the aggrieved supplier, it is  a  little\r\n\r\ndisturbing that in the UK a High Court Judge hears the  dispute,\r\n\r\nbut  in Singapore the Tribunal is to be headed by a layman.   To\r\n\r\ngive  assurance to the public at large, may I urge the  Minister\r\n\r\nto consider a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovision which we have in other statutes as well, such  as  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Parents Tribunal or Strata Titles Board.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  practice  in this country to have a legally-qualified\r\n\r\nman,  and  if  he  is  not happy that he should  have  the  same\r\n\r\nqualification as a High Court Judge, may I urge him to  consider\r\n\r\na  person  who  is legally qualified.  There is no  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntalents  in Singapore and there are many lawyers who  have  more\r\n\r\nthan 10 years of standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tribunal would have to deal with disputes and\r\n\r\nlawyers  would  have  the right of audience,  and  questions  of\r\n\r\nevidence and procedures have to be looked at.  I would urge  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  consider  the position of having a  legally-qualified\r\n\r\nperson to head the Tribunal.  I am happy with the provision that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  Commissioner and a number of Deputy Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThere  are two ways of going about it. Either we have a legally-qualified person  or we could have a panel of three, of whom one\r\n\r\nmust  be  the chair person, ie, the Commissioner or  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner, who must be legally-qualified.  I leave it to  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  discretion.   But  as  the  Tribunal  has  the  same\r\n\r\nimmunity  as  that of the High Court, perhaps the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nconsider having a person who is qualified under the Constitution\r\n\r\nto  be  a  High  Court  Judge  to be a  Commissioner  or  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am mindful of the fact that we should not clog up\r\n\r\nour  court  but  in  order to give confidence  to  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  the public, it would be in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  to have a person who is legally-qualified.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to reconsider this because all we have  got  under\r\n\r\nclause 8(4) is:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No person shall be appointed or shall continue to hold\r\n\r\noffice as Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner if he -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is of unsound mind;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is an undischarged bankrupt or has made any arrangement\r\n\r\nor composition with his creditors; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, fraud or\r\n\r\nmoral turpitude or has not received a free pardon.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are rather prohibitive qualifications. What we\r\n\r\nrequire are some positive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nqualifications  to  show that the person who  is  heading  is  a\r\n\r\nperson who is capable of discharging his duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just want to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister.  If this Bill comes  about,  if\r\n\r\nwe  accede  to the Agreement on Government Procurement  made  at\r\n\r\nMarrakesh  on  15th April 1994, what advantage  do  we  have  by\r\n\r\nimplementing  this Bill to keep in line with the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis Agreement on Government Procurement that is internationally\r\n\r\nrecognised?   What  are the advantages to us?   Is  it  not  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  itself,  without  joining  this  international  body\r\n\r\nagreement, able to maintain a high standard of procurement?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> To answer the NMP's question first,\r\n\r\nI take the point about the Member's concern over the possibility\r\n\r\nthat  non-legally  qualified people may be appointed  to  become\r\n\r\nCommissioner and Deputy Commissioners.  But our proposal  really\r\n\r\nis  to  provide flexibility so that persons who do not meet  the\r\n\r\nqualifications of High Court Judges can also be appointed to  be\r\n\r\nCommissioner, in order to widen the scope of people who  can  be\r\n\r\nappointed.   There are many cases where very experienced  people\r\n\r\nwho know the Government procurement procedures will probably act\r\n\r\nand  serve  better  than  a legally qualified  person.   We  are\r\n\r\ntalking  here  about a very specific and narrow field  of  legal\r\n\r\ninterpretation.   Therefore, we will certainly  take  his  point\r\n\r\ninto  account  in the appointment of suitably qualified  people,\r\n\r\npreferably with the legal qualifications which he has mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, many people who would eminently fulfil the\r\n\r\nrole of Commissioner may not start off their careers as lawyers.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  do not want to miss out the possibility of using  these\r\n\r\npeople  to act as Commissioner or Deputy Commissioners.   It  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  that the pool of candidates in Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nBench  is very limited and to impose further demands on them,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  would  be probably not wise, and it may be difficult  to\r\n\r\nfill  these several positions if we had to confine ourselves  to\r\n\r\nthose with the legal qualifications alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnlike  High Court Judges whose cases span a very wide spectrum,\r\n\r\nthe  Tribunal  Commissioner and Deputy  Commissioner  relate  to\r\n\r\nGovernment procurement only.  Therefore, I think the flexibility\r\n\r\nwe  are asking for under this Bill is really our objective.  But\r\n\r\nthe  points  he  has raised are well taken and we will  consider\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question by Mr Chiam, I agree that our present\r\n\r\nprocurement  procedures are more than  adequate.   In  fact,  in\r\n\r\nmany cases, it probably exceeds the GPA requirements.  But it is\r\n\r\ngood  for us to join an international arrangement of this  sort,\r\n\r\nnot  only  because it suggests that we have nothing to hide  but\r\n\r\nthe  other advantage, of course, is when our suppliers of  goods\r\n\r\nand  services  go  to other countries to tender  for  Government\r\n\r\nprojects, they would be more acceptable to the host countries if\r\n\r\nthey  know  we in Singapore also accede to the GPA requirements.\r\n\r\nSo  there is an advantage clearly in joining, even though it may\r\n\r\nbe marginal in our case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If we are a member of this\r\n\r\ninternational convention, would that not open the floodgates  to\r\n\r\nother  contractors  coming into Singapore in fierce  competition\r\n\r\nwith our own contractors, especially supplying services?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> This situation already exists\r\n\r\nbecause we are not restricting anybody from coming in.

The Convention came  into\r\n\r\nforce  in Singapore on 1st April 1996.  Currently, 113 countries\r\n\r\nand  the  European  Union are Parties to the  Basel  Convention.\r\n\r\nBesides   Singapore,   four  other  ASEAN   countries,   namely,\r\n\r\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam have also  ratified\r\n\r\nthe Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will enable us to fulfil our obligations\r\n\r\nunder  the Basel Convention.  Before I proceed to highlight  the\r\n\r\nmajor  provisions of the Bill, I would like to inform the  House\r\n\r\nof our obligations under the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as a Party to the Convention, we will not permit the\r\n\r\nexport  of  hazardous  and other wastes to  Parties  which  have\r\n\r\nprohibited the import of such wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe generation of hazardous and other wastes within Singapore is\r\n\r\nreduced to a minimum.  We must have adequate facilities to treat\r\n\r\nand  dispose  of the wastes in an environmentally sound  manner.\r\n\r\nWe will ensure that transboundary movements of hazardous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  other  wastes  are  reduced to  a  minimum.   Transboundary\r\n\r\nmovements will be conducted in a manner that will protect  human\r\n\r\nhealth and the environment against any adverse effects which may\r\n\r\narise from such movements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will prevent the import of hazardous and other\r\n\r\nwastes if we have reasons to believe that the wastes in question\r\n\r\nwill not be managed in an environmentally sound manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will consider that illegal traffic in hazardous\r\n\r\nor other wastes is criminal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we will not permit hazardous and other wastes to be\r\n\r\nexported  to  a  non-Party or to be imported from  a  non-Party.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Article  11  of  the Convention  allows  us  to  trade\r\n\r\nhazardous and other wastes with a non-Party if we enter  into  a\r\n\r\nbilateral agreement with the non-Party.  The provisions of  such\r\n\r\nagreement  must  not be less environmentally  sound  than  those\r\n\r\nprovided for by the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore only acceded to the Convention in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1996, the Government has all along been deeply concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  potential  threat  posed  by  hazardous  wastes.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  been  regulating  the  generation,   collection,\r\n\r\ntransportation   and  disposal  of  such  wastes   through   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental    Public   Health   (Toxic   Industrial    Waste)\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, about 64,000 tonnes of hazardous wastes were\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  a  wide range of industries, ranging  from  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle   workshops  to  the  large  petroleum  refineries   and\r\n\r\npetrochemical  complexes  in Singapore.   The  hazardous  wastes\r\n\r\nincluded  spent  acids,  solvents  and  etchants,  waste   oils,\r\n\r\npathogenic  wastes  and  so on.  These hazardous  wastes  are  a\r\n\r\npotential  public  health problem.  We need  to  comprehensively\r\n\r\nmanage them to avoid contaminating our precious water resources,\r\n\r\nwaterways and scarce land resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, most of the hazardous wastes generated in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are collected for specialised treatment and  disposal\r\n\r\nlocally.  However, small quantities of wastes, such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas   PCB   (polychlorinated  biphenyl),   spent   Nickel-Cadmium\r\n\r\nbatteries, spent catalysts, chlorobenzene wastes, and so on, are\r\n\r\nexported  to  countries such as the United Kingdom,  France  and\r\n\r\nJapan  for  treatment and recycling.  We lack the facilities  to\r\n\r\ntreat  and recycle these wastes here.  Such wastes are  exported\r\n\r\nwith the prior approval of the environmental authorities of  the\r\n\r\nimporting countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste)\r\n\r\nRegulations were promulgated for the control of hazardous wastes\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore.  They are consequently limited in  scope  and\r\n\r\nintent.   This  Bill enables us to fulfil our obligations  under\r\n\r\nthe  Convention.   In  preparing the  Bill,  officials  from  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   and  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  studied   the\r\n\r\nlegislation of developed countries, like Australia, and  adopted\r\n\r\nor adapted provisions which were relevant and appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide a legal framework for the control of\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes  and regulate the transboundary  movements  of\r\n\r\nsuch  wastes  through Singapore.  The Bill  also  sets  out  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  procedures  for  the  export  and  import  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes with non-Parties of the Convention.   It  will\r\n\r\nact  as  a  deterrent against illegal trafficking  of  hazardous\r\n\r\nwastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major provisions that are\r\n\r\nbeing introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of Hazardous Wastes and Other Wastes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill covers all the hazardous wastes that\r\n\r\nare listed in the Basel Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Convention, if a Party to the Convention\r\n\r\nclassifies  as  hazardous, a waste which is not  listed  in  the\r\n\r\nBasel  Convention, the waste shall be deemed to be  a  hazardous\r\n\r\nwaste.  This requirement is provided for in clause 5.\r\n\r\nControl of Export and Import of Hazardous and Other Wastes\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 and 26 of the Bill allow ENV to impose full and\r\n\r\ncomplete control on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexport  and  import of hazardous and other wastes.  Under  these\r\n\r\nclauses, any person who intends to export any hazardous waste or\r\n\r\nother  wastes  from Singapore will need to apply for  an  Export\r\n\r\nPermit  from  my  Ministry.  Environment will  issue  an  Export\r\n\r\nPermit to the applicant provided that -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the State of Import is a Party to the Convention or has a\r\n\r\nbilateral  agreement to trade hazardous and  other  wastes  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  the  State  of Import  is  not  a  Party  to  the\r\n\r\nConvention, as allowed for in the Convention;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) there are no suitable treatment and disposal facilities\r\n\r\nfor such wastes in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a Prior Informed Consent from the Competent Authority of\r\n\r\nthe  State  of Import as well as the States of Transit,  if  the\r\n\r\nwastes are transited through other states, must be obtained; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the wastes can be treated and disposed of in an\r\n\r\nenvironmentally sound manner in the State of Import.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, any person who intends to import any hazardous\r\n\r\nor  other wastes into Singapore will need to apply for an Import\r\n\r\nPermit from my Ministry.  ENV will issue an Import Permit to the\r\n\r\napplicant  provided he is able to comply with all the  specified\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control of Transit of Hazardous and Other Wastes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under clause 6 of the Bill, transit means to bring\r\n\r\nhazardous  or  other wastes into Singapore for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nbeing carried to a foreign country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 27, any person who intends to bring such\r\n\r\nwastes  into Singapore for transit to another country will  need\r\n\r\nto apply for a Transit Permit from my Ministry.  The requirement\r\n\r\nwill cover the following situations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, vessels bringing in hazardous and other wastes into\r\n\r\nand leaving Singapore waters without unloading the wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, vessels unloading hazardous and other wastes in the\r\n\r\nport  and  the  wastes are subsequently re-loaded  onto  another\r\n\r\nvessel for another country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV will issue a Transit Permit to the applicant provided\r\n\r\nthat -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the applicant has the proper documents pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe  export and import of the wastes from the States  of  Export\r\n\r\nand Import; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the wastes can be transported safely through Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trading of Hazardous and Other Wastes with Non-Party States</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11 of the Convention allows for a Party to trade\r\n\r\nhazardous  and other wastes with a non-Party provided that  both\r\n\r\nParties  enter  into a bilateral agreement or arrangement  whose\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  not  less  environmentally  sound  than   those\r\n\r\nprovided for by the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for Singapore to enter into an agreement\r\n\r\nor  arrangement with a non-Party to trade in hazardous and other\r\n\r\nwastes.   Such  agreements or arrangements, if  made,  shall  be\r\n\r\npublished in the Government Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill allows the Minister to make\r\n\r\nregulations to give effect to such Article 11 arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environmentally Sound Management of Hazardous or Other Wastes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention requires that Parties treat and dispose of\r\n\r\nhazardous  and other wastes in an environmentally sound  manner.\r\n\r\nThis  means taking all practical steps to ensure that the  waste\r\n\r\nis  managed in a manner that will protect human health  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  against the adverse effects that  may  result  from\r\n\r\nsuch  wastes.  This requirement is provided for in clause  8  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 provides for the Minister to make regulations for\r\n\r\nguidelines and standards for any person who intends to carry out\r\n\r\ntreatment  and  disposal of hazardous  or  other  wastes  in  an\r\n\r\nenvironmentally sound manner in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exemption of Naval Vessel, Military Aircraft, etc.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention does not apply to any vessel or aircraft\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the naval, military or air forces of Singapore  or\r\n\r\nany  other country.  This is because the Basel Convention is not\r\n\r\nmeant  for the control of movements of naval vessels or military\r\n\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Basel Convention, clause 12 exempts any\r\n\r\nvessel  or  aircraft  belonging to the naval,  military  or  air\r\n\r\nforces of Singapore or any other country from the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Act Binds the Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 of the Bill binds the Government. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  Government  departments and  statutory  boards  are  not\r\n\r\nexempted from compliance with the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prohibition of Import, Export and Transit</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 to 27 of the Bill prohibit the unauthorised\r\n\r\nimport,  export and transit of hazardous or other  wastes.   Any\r\n\r\nperson who imports, exports or transits hazardous or other waste\r\n\r\nwithout a Permit shall be guilty of an offence.  In the case  of\r\n\r\nan   individual,   the  maximum  penalty  is  $100,000   or   an\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.  In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  company,  the  maximum fine  is  $300,000  and  the\r\n\r\ndirectors, managers or other similar officers of the company may\r\n\r\nalso be charged in court for the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stringent penalties are necessary to deter illegal\r\n\r\ntrafficking and dumping of hazardous and other wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Liability and Compensation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a Legal Working Group has been set up under the\r\n\r\nBasel  Convention  to  develop  a  protocol  on  liability   and\r\n\r\ncompensation to deal with damages arising from the transboundary\r\n\r\nmovements of hazardous or other wastes.  The protocol has yet to\r\n\r\nbe completed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 enables ENV to make regulations to give effect to\r\n\r\nthe protocol when it is completed and accepted by Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, clause 48(d) allows the Minister to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations to deal with such incidents and recover  costs\r\n\r\nfrom the offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 34 empower the Director and other authorised\r\n\r\nofficers to take enforcement actions against persons engaging in\r\n\r\nactivities  that  could  be  or  are  in  contravention  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regulations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 48 empowers the Minister to make regulations on\r\n\r\nmatters  under the Act.  The maximum penalty prescribed for  the\r\n\r\nregulations   shall  not  exceed  a  fine  of  $10,000   or   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of a continuing offence, the penalty is a further fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $1,000 for every day or part of the day during  which\r\n\r\nthe offence continues after conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has always been conscientious in\r\n\r\nregulating  the generation, movement and disposal  of  hazardous\r\n\r\nand  other  wastes.   We have ensured that no  hazardous  wastes\r\n\r\ngenerated  in  Singapore have been exported to  other  countries\r\n\r\nwithout  the  consent  of the receiving country.   We  have  not\r\n\r\nallowed  our industries to dump their toxic wastes overseas,  as\r\n\r\nwe  follow very closely such wastes from generation to treatment\r\n\r\nto disposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill is timely as Singapore enters\r\n\r\nthe   next   lap   of   industrialisation.    Other   countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  in this region, are also  undergoing  rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.   More  and  varied  hazardous  wastes   will\r\n\r\ninevitably be generated from the new industries in Singapore and\r\n\r\nother  countries.  This Bill will tighten the control of import,\r\n\r\nexport  and  transit  of  hazardous and  other  wastes.   Proper\r\n\r\ncontrol  will minimise, if not prevent, illegal trafficking  and\r\n\r\nindiscriminate dumping of such wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is of particular importance also as Singapore is\r\n\r\na major transhipment centre.  It will enhance our enforcement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npowers  against unauthorised transhipment of such wastes through\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Bill, we will be able to fulfil Singapore's\r\n\r\nobligations fully under the Basel Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has actively sought the views and inputs of\r\n\r\nMTI,  MinCom, the Maritime Port Authority, PSA, EDB and  TDB  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the private sector during the preparation of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nAll  parties have given their general agreement and  support  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you very much\r\n\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill not only because it is a necessary\r\n\r\nconsequence  or consequential legislation so as  to  give  legal\r\n\r\neffect  to  the  fact that Singapore is now a signatory  to  the\r\n\r\nBasel Convention but, more importantly, as a small country  with\r\n\r\nno hinterland and with major international sea and air ports, it\r\n\r\nis in our own interest that we support the international control\r\n\r\nof the transport of hazardous waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his address has stated that, under the\r\n\r\nobligations  of  the  Convention, we would  take  the  necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures to ensure that the generation of hazardous waste,  both\r\n\r\nin terms of quantity and hazard potential, would be reduced to a\r\n\r\nminimum.   Sir, that is good.  But there are those  who  do  not\r\n\r\ngenerate  hazardous waste as part of their normal  business  but\r\n\r\nuse  equipment  containing hazardous substances.   For  example,\r\n\r\nalthough radioactive substances are not covered under this  Bill\r\n\r\nbut  under  other legislation, in nature, they are certainly  no\r\n\r\nless  hazardous  than substances and wastes covered  under  this\r\n\r\nBill.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister how we should\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  disposal  of  equipment,  especially  medical  and\r\n\r\nlaboratory   equipment,  containing  such  hazardous  substance.\r\n\r\nWithout  strict control, Sir, such substance may become part  of\r\n\r\nthe normal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmainstream  garbage  which,  in our case,  may  be  incinerated,\r\n\r\nthereby  poisoning our environment.  Sometimes, it  is  used  as\r\n\r\nlandfill, thereby affecting our land and water supplies, or even\r\n\r\nrecycled,  thereby affecting all those coming into contact  with\r\n\r\nthe recycled material.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, radioactive substances are not\r\n\r\ncovered under this Bill.  Because of the ease of such substance,\r\n\r\nthrough  the  example  I gave earlier, it could  leak  into  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  mainstream garbage.  It is  important  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister assures this House and the people of Singapore that all\r\n\r\nequipment   containing  radioactive  substances   are   properly\r\n\r\ncontrolled in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an added control, I would like to ask whether we\r\n\r\nhave radiation detecting equipment at our central rubbish dumps.\r\n\r\nIf  not,  could the Ministry look into the procurement  of  such\r\n\r\nequipment to make sure that the rubbish that we collect  do  not\r\n\r\ncontain any radioactive material?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this Bill, I would like to seek the\r\n\r\nfollowing  clarification from the Minister.  (1) Do  we  require\r\n\r\nregistration  of  all those who generate hazardous  wastes?   If\r\n\r\nnot, how do we prevent hazardous waste from becoming part of the\r\n\r\nmainstream  garbage?   (2)  Do we  require  that  some  type  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes must be exported?  Sir, we must remember  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  small  country  and  perhaps  there  are  some\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes that should not be disposed of  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\n(3) The Minister has already mentioned that Singapore is a major\r\n\r\ntransit  point.   Therefore it is important for  us  to  control\r\n\r\ntransit of hazardous wastes.  He has given some comments on  how\r\n\r\nsuch  transit  items could be controlled.  While  I  can  safely\r\n\r\npresume that there will be adequate control of legal transit  of\r\n\r\nsuch  wastes  through Singapore, what about illegal  traffic  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes?  How do we control this and how  do  we  deal\r\n\r\nwith illegal traffickers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that while we punish drug traffickers with\r\n\r\nthe  death sentence, the punishment for illegal hazardous wastes\r\n\r\ntrafficking  is comparatively light.  Despite what the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas said that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  be  fined  a maximum  of  up  to  $300,000  and\r\n\r\nindividuals  will  be fined up to $100,000  or  a  maximum  jail\r\n\r\nsentence  of  two years, I think for these people who  illegally\r\n\r\ntraffic  in  hazardous  waste, thereby affecting  not  only  the\r\n\r\nenvironment, but also generations of Singaporeans to come,   the\r\n\r\npunishment is not stringent enough as compared to those who deal\r\n\r\nin  illegal  drug  trafficking.  So  I  would  advocate  heavier\r\n\r\npunishment  on  the individuals concerned.  After  all,  in  the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  Sir, it is the individual who is  responsible,\r\n\r\nnot a faceless corporate body.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  from  the term \"hazardous waste\", it is implied  that  the\r\n\r\nsubstance concerned has no commercial value and, if accidentally\r\n\r\nreleased  or improperly disposed of, it would endanger life  and\r\n\r\ncost  long-term contamination to our environment.  In  hazardous\r\n\r\nwaste  management, proper and professional effort is  needed  in\r\n\r\nwaste  handling, tracking, storage, treatment and disposal.   It\r\n\r\nhelps to ensure that there is no accidental release of the waste\r\n\r\nand  the  waste does not fall into the wrong hands, which  would\r\n\r\nlead  to  illegal  disposal  for  financial  gain.   The  actual\r\n\r\ntreatment  of hazardous waste and its subsequent disposal  could\r\n\r\nbe  quite  costly, and it will also add cost to the  production.\r\n\r\nUnscrupulous  businessmen  and waste treatment  companies  might\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of the lack of control in places where the anti-pollution  laws are not effectively put in place  and  dump  the\r\n\r\nwaste  over  there.  I did come across a newspaper  report  that\r\n\r\ndrums  of industrial waste were just dumped next to a children's\r\n\r\nplayground in a foreign country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the Bill, Singapore, once again,\r\n\r\nplays  a  responsible  role  as  a  world  citizen  to  help  in\r\n\r\npreventing  environmental pollution.  This  Bill  plays  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  role  in  controlling the movement  of  transboundary\r\n\r\nhazardous  waste to assist the world community in  tracking  and\r\n\r\nprevention  of illegal movement of hazardous waste  which  would\r\n\r\neventually lead to illegal dumping.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also helps us by ensuring that no hazardous waste\r\n\r\nwould  be  illegally imported into Singapore, and no  one  could\r\n\r\npossibly  carry  out illegal waste treatment activities  without\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge of the Government, because from now onwards,  all\r\n\r\nimported wastes will be tracked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling and management of hazardous wastes, while the\r\n\r\nwastes  undergo transboundary shipment, is one of the  important\r\n\r\nissues.   We should not only be concerned about the tracking  of\r\n\r\nthe movement of the waste, but also how the waste is handled and\r\n\r\nstored  during shipment.  Mishandling could result in damage  of\r\n\r\nthe  container and cause leakage of the waste.  In case of fire,\r\n\r\nthe  waste could be released into the atmosphere and the  impact\r\n\r\non  the  environment could be worse than illegal ground dumping.\r\n\r\nWe  should  therefore need other laws to deal with the  handling\r\n\r\nand  storage of the waste in the process of shipment.  A  severe\r\n\r\npenalty  should be considered if the waste is mishandled  during\r\n\r\nits shipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is stated that both the individual and the\r\n\r\ncorporation  could possibly be penalised.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether both parties will be  charged  if  anyone\r\n\r\nshould have flouted the regulations.  I believe that to sentence\r\n\r\nan  individual  with  a  mandatory jail term  would  be  a  more\r\n\r\neffective deterrent than just asking the corporation to pay  the\r\n\r\nfine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is stated that the maximum penalty is\r\n\r\n$300,000.  In the case of accidental release of the waste due to\r\n\r\nmishandling, the cost of the clean-up to contain the  pollution,\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  lives and the long-term impact on the environment\r\n\r\ncould  be much more than the penalty of $300,000.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister whether the offenders could be asked to pay\r\n\r\nfor the cost resulting from the pollution created by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does exclude marine and radioactive wastes.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister enlighten the House on  whether  there  are\r\n\r\nother  Acts that effectively control the transboundary shipments\r\n\r\nof  these types of wastes?  The latter, I believe, could be much\r\n\r\nmore hazardous compared with those mentioned in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C.Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  important Bill.  The Bill deals with  wastes  that\r\n\r\npresent  serious environmental and health hazards,  unless  they\r\n\r\nare  dealt with in an environmentally sound manner.  The illegal\r\n\r\ntrade  in  such wastes, both world-wide and Asia,  is  real  and\r\n\r\nserious.   There  has  been  a lack of internationally  accepted\r\n\r\ndefinition  of what exactly constitutes \"hazardous  wastes\"  and\r\n\r\nwhat  should  be done about them.  Such a lack of  international\r\n\r\nunderstanding can lead to misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, a Singapore company was alleged to have\r\n\r\ndumped  detergent waste called \"soap noodle\" on  a  neighbouring\r\n\r\nisland.   This was resolved when Singapore agreed  to  ship  the\r\n\r\nsubstances  back,  although  under  our  laws,  they   are   not\r\n\r\nconsidered toxic.  By following the Basel Convention, this  Bill\r\n\r\nincorporates  international  standards  and  approaches  to   an\r\n\r\ninternational  problem into our national laws.   It  is  further\r\n\r\nevidence  that  Singapore is a good citizen of the international\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Hopefully,  there will be  fewer  misunderstandings\r\n\r\nwith neighbouring states over what can or cannot be exported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill reassures ASEAN and other neighbours that\r\n\r\nSingapore will follow international practice as regards movement\r\n\r\nof  hazardous  wastes.   We are one of the  most  industrialised\r\n\r\nnations  in  the  region.   We are one  of  the  leading  ports.\r\n\r\nWithout  these  safeguards,  our  companies  may  otherwise   be\r\n\r\nsuspected   of   foisting   hazardous   wastes   on   neighbours\r\n\r\nunknowingly, while our port may become a transhipment centre for\r\n\r\nsuch wastes.  By enacting this legislation, we acknowledge state\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  transboundary  environmental  damage   from\r\n\r\nhazardous wastes.  With this Bill, it is now Singapore's duty to\r\n\r\nhelp ensure that our neighbours do not suffer environmental  and\r\n\r\nhealth damage.  A UN report has recognised that Singapore is one\r\n\r\nof   the   few  countries  in  the  region  that  has  a  legal,\r\n\r\ninstitutional  and  manpower capabilities  to  manage  hazardous\r\n\r\nwastes properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to emphasise that these duties are not\r\n\r\ntaken on without\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome cost.  The generation of hazardous waste is inevitable from\r\n\r\ncertain   industrial  processes.   If  they  are  generated   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, such wastes must either be treated and disposed of in\r\n\r\nSingapore or they must be exported for the same.  When we change\r\n\r\nthe  laws on export, therefore, this can have an impact  on  our\r\n\r\nlocal  environment.  When we mandate new rules for  industry  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  such wastes, it can also have an  effect  on  our\r\n\r\neconomic   competitiveness.   The  Bill   will   require   close\r\n\r\ncoordination  between  the  Environment  Ministry  and  economic\r\n\r\nagencies and I am glad to hear from the Minister today that this\r\n\r\nhas been done in the drawing up of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having emphasised the importance of the Bill, I wish to\r\n\r\nseek  the  assurance  of the Minister on five  matters.   First,\r\n\r\ncompliance  of  the Basel Convention.  I ask for the  Minister's\r\n\r\nreassurance  that Singapore will comply with the  Convention  in\r\n\r\nboth  letter  and spirit.  In particular, there  are  three  key\r\n\r\nessentials  of  the Basel Convention that are missing  from  the\r\n\r\nBill as presently drafted.  These are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prior Informed Consent (Article 6 of the Convention)\r\n\r\nthat Singapore must inform the receiving state of the nature  of\r\n\r\nthe waste and has received its prior consent to the shipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The prohibition of export to a country that is not\r\n\r\nparty to the Convention; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The duty to reimport wastes which have not been\r\n\r\nproperly  exported  and the duty not to  export  wastes  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has reason to believe they will not be managed in  an\r\n\r\nenvironmentally sound manner by the receiving country.\r\n\r\nNone  of these key essentials are specifically embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  in its present form.  Additionally, while the Bill  should\r\n\r\ncover exports from Singapore to a territory of another state, it\r\n\r\nis  not  clear if it also covers the exclusive economic zone  of\r\n\r\nthat state.  This should be clarified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 17 of the Bill, however, the Minister is given\r\n\r\nthe power to enact regulations to give effect to the Convention.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nask for the Minister's assurance that these vital principles  of\r\n\r\nthe  Basel Convention would be observed, either by amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  before  it is passed by this House or  in  subsequent\r\n\r\nregulations he will make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make and seek the Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance   on  is   something  he  has  already   given;   that\r\n\r\nconsultation with the industry has been fully considered.  There\r\n\r\nis  one  remaining issue on this point.  This is with regard  to\r\n\r\nnew  and potential investors.  I ask the Minister to clarify  if\r\n\r\nthe  criteria  set out in this Bill will be screened  in  future\r\n\r\ninvestments.   I ask this particularly as there  is  no  law  at\r\n\r\npresent  in  Singapore  that  mandates  the  assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental impact of such potential investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to make and ask the Minister's\r\n\r\nreassurance  is  for clarity for applicants for  permits.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill mandates businesses to apply for permits for  export,\r\n\r\nimport  and transit.  I seek the Minister's assurance that  this\r\n\r\nprocedure  will  be simple, transparent and as  even  handed  as\r\n\r\npossible,  with  the minimum of administrative  discretion.   In\r\n\r\nthis regard, I would draw the Minister's attention to section 17\r\n\r\nof  the Australian equivalent to this Act - the Hazardous Wastes\r\n\r\n(Regulations of Exports and Imports) Act, 1989 of Australia.  In\r\n\r\nthat  section, the Australian Act stipulates that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nmust grant the permit upon being satisfied of certain conditions\r\n\r\nstated  therein.  There is no equivalent in our Bill.   While  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the Minister may be reluctant to bind himself,  this\r\n\r\nwould   surely  provide  a  greater  degree  of  certainty   for\r\n\r\nbusinesses in obtaining the necessary permits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is with regard to Article 11 arrangements.\r\n\r\nUnder   the  Basel  Convention,  as  the  Minister  has  stated,\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot trade in hazardous wastes with parties that are\r\n\r\nnot  also  parties to the Basel Convention.  Article  11  is  an\r\n\r\nexception  that  allows  bilateral,  multilateral  or   regional\r\n\r\nagreements.    The   Bill,  as  is  presently  drafted,   places\r\n\r\nconsiderable emphasis on such Article 11 arrangements.   I  wish\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister  whether  Singapore  has  entered  or  is\r\n\r\nnegotiating such agreements.  If so, I seek his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassurance that such Article 11 agreements will abide by the same\r\n\r\nhigh standards found in the Basel Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and final point, Mr Speaker, is that there should\r\n\r\nbe  a  review  of  laws  regarding  the  domestic  treatment  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes.  Singapore has enjoyed a very good reputation\r\n\r\nregarding the domestic treatment of hazardous wastes.  The Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever, puts additional procedures for those seeking to  export\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes.   In these circumstances,  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  tendency to treat wastes in Singapore or  to  dump  it.\r\n\r\nThe   Environmental   Public  Health  Toxic   Industrial   Waste\r\n\r\nRegulations of 1988, as amended most recently in 1996,  must  be\r\n\r\nlooked  at to harmonise these regulations on national  law  with\r\n\r\nthe present Bill regarding import and export.  Otherwise, we run\r\n\r\nthe  temptation  to improperly dispose of wastes  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nrather   than  adhering  to  procedures  for  export  or  proper\r\n\r\ntreatment.   In this regard, I wish particularly  to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  it seems the penalty under the Environmental Public Health\r\n\r\nRegulations  of 1988 is a maximum of $10,000 or imprisonment  of\r\n\r\n12  months,  or  both.  This is in section 24  of  the  Act,  as\r\n\r\namended in 1996.  In comparison, the present Bill sees a maximum\r\n\r\nfine  of $100,000 for individuals and $300,000 for corporations.\r\n\r\nI  therefore  urge  that the penalties under  the  Environmental\r\n\r\nPublic  Health  Regulations be reviewed to  harmonise  with  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful for the Minister's response, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They  have\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  the Bill is a very important  one  because  it\r\n\r\nsafeguards not just Singapore from hazardous wastes but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  safeguards  the region from wastes which  are  transhipped\r\n\r\neither through Singapore or which originated from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng has raised quite a few points.\r\n\r\nLet  me answer them one by one.  As he has rightly pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  does not cover hazardous wastes which are related  to\r\n\r\neither ship-borne wastes or radioactive wastes as well as wastes\r\n\r\nwhich  are  contained in instruments which  may  not  have  been\r\n\r\ngenerated  by  the user but which are inherent as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  the  equipment.  Sir, these items  are  controlled\r\n\r\nunder  other  legislation. For example,  ship-borne  wastes  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the International Convention for the Prevention of\r\n\r\nPollution  from  Ships or MARPOL and this  comes  under  MINCOM.\r\n\r\nRadioactive  wastes  are  governed by the  International  Atomic\r\n\r\nEnergy   Agency   and  its  regulations  and  conventions.    In\r\n\r\nSingapore, radiation and radioactive products are covered  under\r\n\r\nthe  Radiation Protection Act, which is under the privy  of  the\r\n\r\nRadiation Protection Inspectorate of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how these items are controlled. In terms of\r\n\r\nradioactive  equipment,  all imports  of  radioactive  equipment\r\n\r\nrequire  permits  to  be  granted or  issued  by  the  Radiation\r\n\r\nProtection Inspectorate.  As part of the granting of the permit,\r\n\r\nfor those radioactive substances which have long half-lives, and\r\n\r\ntherefore cannot be dumped, we will require that the country  of\r\n\r\nexport  is  obliged  to  take back the radioactive  wastes  that\r\n\r\nresult  from  the  use of this instrument.  So we  are  covered.\r\n\r\nThere  are  other items, of course, which have very short  half-lives.   We will allow those to be dumped because the half-lives\r\n\r\ncould be in terms of a matter of days and therefore they do  not\r\n\r\npose any health hazard to Singaporeans if they are dumped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of equipment with hazardous chemicals, similarly,\r\n\r\nwe  will  require the user, when he imports such  equipment,  to\r\n\r\nundertake  to have those chemicals disposed of either internally\r\n\r\nwithin the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompany  or  disposed  of  through the  registered  toxic  waste\r\n\r\ncollectors.   So in this way we ensure that all those  equipment\r\n\r\nthat  either  result in the generation of toxic waste  or  which\r\n\r\nrequire chemicals which are toxic are properly controlled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked how we register those companies that are\r\n\r\ngenerating hazardous wastes.  Sir, as part of the duties of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment, we require all  new  industries,\r\n\r\nbefore  they  set  up their operations in Singapore,  to  obtain\r\n\r\nclearance  from  the Ministry.  And as part of  the  process  of\r\n\r\nobtaining the clearance, we will require them to furnish  to  us\r\n\r\nfull  details  of  the chemicals they use in  the  process,  the\r\n\r\nprocess  itself and the chemicals that are released as a  result\r\n\r\nof  their manufacturing processes.  In this way, we are able  to\r\n\r\ntrack  both toxic chemicals that have to be used or imported  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the toxic and hazardous substances that are the  result\r\n\r\nof  the processes.  We will also require them to let us know how\r\n\r\nthey  intend to treat the hazardous materials that are  released\r\n\r\nas  a result of their processes.  They can either do it in-house\r\n\r\nor  they  will have to get the services of one of their licensed\r\n\r\ntoxic  collectors  who will then dispose of  the  chemicals  for\r\n\r\nthem.  So in this way we ensure that whilst, as I mentioned just\r\n\r\nnow,  about  64,000 tonnes of hazardous wastes were  created  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have full control over all these wastes and we are\r\n\r\nable  to ensure that they are disposed of in a manner which does\r\n\r\nnot  pose any health hazards to human beings as well as  to  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng has also talked about the punishments which\r\n\r\nare  not adequate.  The penalties, as contained in the Bill, are\r\n\r\nquite   hefty   compared  to  what  we  have  in  our   existing\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Public Health Regulations and  Act.   And  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  Mr Heng that we will monitor very closely whether  these\r\n\r\npenalties  are  deterrent enough and, if not, I can  assure  him\r\n\r\nthat we will be prepared to further enhance these penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has asked that since the penalties\r\n\r\napply to both the company as well as to individuals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvolved in the company, whether we will charge both the company\r\n\r\nand the individuals involved.  Sir, this will vary from case  to\r\n\r\ncase.   If  we are able to prove that both the company  and  the\r\n\r\nindividuals involved are guilty, of course we will bring charges\r\n\r\nagainst both the company and the individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether the polluter will be required to\r\n\r\npay  for  the  cost  of clearing the wastes  and  damage  caused\r\n\r\nbecause  the  penalties themselves may not be  very  significant\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  damage.   Under the  Bill,  we  do  have  the\r\n\r\nauthority  to  require the polluter to pay for cleaning  up  the\r\n\r\ndamage caused by pollution and if the company is not able to  do\r\n\r\nit, we will do it on the company's behalf and we will charge the\r\n\r\nfull cost of the work to the polluter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked for information about the regulations for\r\n\r\ncontrolling  ship-borne and radioactive  wastes.   I  have  just\r\n\r\ngiven that in my answer to Mr Heng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has also supported the Bill and he has asked\r\n\r\nquite a few questions.  Let me deal with them one by one. He has\r\n\r\nasked questions on five broad areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is his observation that many of the key\r\n\r\nrequirements  in  the Basel Convention are not actually  covered\r\n\r\nspecifically in the Bill.  Sir, the Bill is a broad format which\r\n\r\ngives  us  the framework to promulgate the specific  regulations\r\n\r\nwhich will allow us to comply with each of those regulations  in\r\n\r\nthe Convention.  So let me take him through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prior Informed Consent, that will also be included in\r\n\r\nthe  Regulations.  In fact, as I mentioned in my Second  Reading\r\n\r\nspeech, we already have this practice today.  We already require\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  have to bring in hazardous  wastes  or  export\r\n\r\nhazardous wastes to either furnish the Prior Informed Consent of\r\n\r\nthe  receiving  country  or where they  are  bringing  in  those\r\n\r\nhazardous  wastes  into Singapore, we will then  give  them  the\r\n\r\nPrior  Informed Consent, provided we know that those wastes  can\r\n\r\nbe  treated  and disposed of safely in Singapore.   So  that  is\r\n\r\nalready  in practice, and this will be continued resulting  from\r\n\r\nthis Bill in the Regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the prohibition of export to non-Parties, that this is not specifically covered in the Bill. To\r\n\r\nexport  to a non-Party, the intending exporter must get a permit\r\n\r\nfrom us and this will again be covered in the Regulations.   The\r\n\r\napplication  for the permit would of course include things  like\r\n\r\nthe receiving country, whether it is Basel Convention Party, and\r\n\r\nwhether  they  have  the approval of the  receiving  country  to\r\n\r\nimport  those wastes from us.  So this would also be covered  by\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the re-import of wastes that have not\r\n\r\nbeen  properly  exported.  Sir, that again is already  available\r\n\r\ntoday under the existing Regulations and we will promulgate such\r\n\r\nregulations under this new Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has commended the Ministry for having consulted with the\r\n\r\nindustry.   I  thank  him for that.  He has also  asked  whether\r\n\r\nexisting  companies would be required to alter their  operations\r\n\r\nor processes arising from the passing of this Bill and how would\r\n\r\nthis  impact  on new investors.  Sir, the passing of  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  have no impact because under the existing Regulations,  we\r\n\r\nonly  regulate  investors and operations that are already  here,\r\n\r\nie,  the  existing operations all comply with  our  very  strict\r\n\r\nenvironmental  requirements and therefore they comply  with  the\r\n\r\nBill.   Similarly,  for  new investors, we  will  process  their\r\n\r\napplications in the same way that we are processing them now and\r\n\r\nwe will apply our existing very tight requirements on them too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third area was that he hopes that there will be clarity\r\n\r\nfor  applicants and that the application process will be simple,\r\n\r\ntransparent  and even-handed.  Sir, that indeed  is  already  so\r\n\r\ncurrently, and it will continue to be so in the future.  He  has\r\n\r\nalso asked about the Australian regulation, section 17, which he\r\n\r\nhas read out, that the Australian Minister must grant permit  if\r\n\r\nall  the conditions are complied with.  In Singapore, the permit\r\n\r\nwill  be granted and issued by the Director of Hazardous  Waste,\r\n\r\nand  the  Director will definitely grant the permit if  all  the\r\n\r\nconditions,  as  stipulated  under  the  Basel  Convention,  are\r\n\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fourth point was on Article 11 which relates to\r\n\r\nbilateral, multilateral or regional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagreements  with non-Parties to the Convention.  Sir,  Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes  not  at  the  moment have any bilateral,  multilateral  or\r\n\r\nregional agreements with non-Parties.  And I can assure  Mr  Tay\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  do  in  the  future, we  will  ensure  that  these\r\n\r\nagreements  comply totally with the requirements  of  the  Basel\r\n\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His last point is that with the passing of this Bill, it is\r\n\r\nlikely  that  there will be a greater tendency to  treat  wastes\r\n\r\nlocally,  since  now  a company that intends  to  export  it  to\r\n\r\nanother country may face problems with the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.   Sir, as I have explained earlier, we already  have  very\r\n\r\ntight  controls  on  import and export of hazardous  wastes  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  having this Bill will in no way change the situation.\r\n\r\nIn  any case, our requirements are that any wastes which are  to\r\n\r\nbe  treated  locally have to be treated in such a way  that  the\r\n\r\noutcome of the treatment poses no threat to human health and the\r\n\r\nenvironment  and we will continue to monitor the technology  for\r\n\r\ntreatment  and ensure that the most appropriate technology  will\r\n\r\nbe applied in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we harmonise penalties under the\r\n\r\nexisting  Environmental Health Protection  Act  and  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nSir,  they  are focusing on two different areas but I  take  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  the existing penalties in many ways are  inadequate\r\n\r\nand we will definitely be reviewing them and harmonising them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION (PULAU MERLIMAU)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The\r\n\r\nreclamation  and  infrastructural  works,  estimated   to   cost\r\n\r\napproximately  $142  million, will commence immediately  and  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in December 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the\r\n\r\nForeshores  Act  (Cap.  113) approves  the  reclamation  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the foreshore and seabed north of Pulau  Merlimau\r\n\r\ncontaining an area of about 34 ha as shown coloured pink on  the\r\n\r\nplan  marked  `LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO  2/97'  which  is\r\n\r\ndeposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned\r\n\r\nto a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BEYOND ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>3.19 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank  you for giving me this opportunity to speak  before\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have watched how the recent currency turmoil has raised\r\n\r\nunexpected  speed  to  turn  Asia's  economic  miracle  into   a\r\n\r\nmeltdown.  One consistent message has emerged from this  mess  - the need for good governance and good leaders acting in the best\r\n\r\ninterest of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful that Singapore has again demonstrated through\r\n\r\nthis crisis that it has a government who knows how to manage its\r\n\r\neconomic   fundamentals.   Yet  it  is  not  smugly  complacent.\r\n\r\nDespite  the turmoil in the region, it has set up five Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committees  to identify more and new ways  to  strengthen  a\r\n\r\n\"heartware\" society, as defined by the Prime Minister.  That  is\r\n\r\na good word, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this commitment by the Government to listen to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  which prompts me  to  rise  to  raise  my\r\n\r\nconcerns.   I  will  raise  five matters  today:   the  need  to\r\n\r\nprioritise social services, recognise the role of social service\r\n\r\nprofessionals, expand tertiary curriculum, encourage  a  culture\r\n\r\nof initiative and setting up Social Services 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Services as Priority Concern</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we build on our economic fundamentals, how are we\r\n\r\nstrengthening our social fundamentals?  My concern here is:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow  are we nurturing an effective human resource structure  for\r\n\r\nour  social  service  agencies which are  vital  agents  in  the\r\n\r\nexercise to forge unity of cohesion?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of fleshing out the vision of a `care and\r\n\r\nshare'  society certainly requires more than committee meetings,\r\n\r\nreports  and national campaigns.  Sir, in the realm of community\r\n\r\nservices,  we  require  a professional  corps  of  \"sharers  and\r\n\r\ncarers\"  -  I mean the social service professionals - who  would\r\n\r\ntranslate this vision by serving as a catalyst, the bridges and,\r\n\r\nby  their  own personal examples, as a role model of service  to\r\n\r\nthe needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides people, the way social services are organised to\r\n\r\ntranslate  heartware into realisable components may require  the\r\n\r\nsame  kind of detailed, cohesive and committed action plan which\r\n\r\nwould  be implemented if we were to achieve economic goals.   At\r\n\r\nthis  point,  allow  me,  Sir, to raise  some  priority  issues.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  need  for relevant social service institutions  and\r\n\r\neffective  programmes which cut across Ministries.  Second,  the\r\n\r\nneed  for additional resources to expand and upgrade the  skills\r\n\r\nof the social service professionals.  Third, the need to develop\r\n\r\na  substantive understanding among social service  providers  on\r\n\r\nsocial  issues and programme management.  Fourth, the  need  for\r\n\r\nclearer  role  differentiation between Government and  volunteer\r\n\r\nagencies.  And, fifth, the need for service standards and  audit\r\n\r\nprocedures to guarantee best practices in our frontline  service\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Ministry of Community Development must have\r\n\r\ndeliberated these issues.  Some Members have been invited to sit\r\n\r\nin committees to give feedback.  As a result, working committees\r\n\r\nwere  formed,  new  agencies  were  set  up,  new  courses  were\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  NIE, NUS, NCSS, the Family Research and  Training\r\n\r\nCentre (FRTC) and by select VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a concern, however, about whether these\r\n\r\nassets  were  coordinated and integrated  enough  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nrelevant  continuum  of services for our community,  or  whether\r\n\r\nthey were ad hoc,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsometimes  fragmented, and stand-alone training  modules,  which\r\n\r\nlacked consistent therapy methodology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we need generic services? Or do we need more\r\n\r\nspecialised ones?  Is 2% training budget sufficient for our VWOs\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  themselves annually?  How are  our  services  being\r\n\r\nprepared  for many of the recovery programmes in abuse cases  to\r\n\r\nsupport mandatory counselling court orders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While recognising the complexity of these issues as there\r\n\r\nare  no  easy  answers  readily available,  the  social  service\r\n\r\ncommunity  is anxious to hear from the Minister if  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive policy for the delivery of social services and how\r\n\r\nthe   priority   concerns  mentioned  will  be  translated   and\r\n\r\nimplemented in the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mindset Change</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that unless there is a mindset change about\r\n\r\nthe  proper role of social service professionals, even the  best\r\n\r\naction  plans  will not be fully realised.  These  professionals\r\n\r\nare  almost  an  invisible category in our community.   Seen  as\r\n\r\nquasi-volunteers,  do-gooders, people with a kind  and  stalwart\r\n\r\nheart,  and  many volunteers have done outstanding charity  work\r\n\r\nwithout regard, we overlook the need to promote a highly trained\r\n\r\nand well-paid corps of professionals to offer best practices  in\r\n\r\ncounselling, therapeutic and rehabilitation services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers in community services are acknowledged through\r\n\r\nvarious  public  service  medals.  But full-time  direct  social\r\n\r\nservice  professionals  who live with  their  clients'  multiple\r\n\r\nfamily problems are not always recognised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other social service professionals who do not care about\r\n\r\neither  money  or  recognition identify  inadequate  skills  and\r\n\r\nresources  as well as poor career development in the  sector  as\r\n\r\nmajor problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet others feel strongly about their sense of helplessness\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis Ministry administrators and frontline enforcement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficers  who  are too over-worked and equally  ill-equipped  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the helping process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes to no surprise then that against this backdrop of\r\n\r\nlow  morale,  we  face higher attrition rate among  social  work\r\n\r\ngraduates.   Minister Tarmugi reported in 1994 that since  1974,\r\n\r\nthe university had trained an estimated 830 social workers.   We\r\n\r\nare looking at 40 a year.  In 1992, the Singapore Association of\r\n\r\nSocial Workers conducted a study on the number of social workers\r\n\r\nin  social  work related jobs.  The study found  that  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  half the university social work graduates of each cohort\r\n\r\ntook up social work related jobs.  Subsequently, only a third of\r\n\r\nthe cohort remained in social work related jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an overall 30% success rate is not a cost effective\r\n\r\neducational  investment.  Nor could it meet  increasing  service\r\n\r\nneeds.   The  Government  is now talking about  developing  more\r\n\r\nfamily  service centres by the year 2000.  Where do we get  this\r\n\r\nmanpower to run these centres?  What kind of service do we offer\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans  seeking therapeutic  help?   Do  we  risk  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of re-traumatising our clients due to poor  service\r\n\r\ndelivery?   How  many  programmes were  not  implemented  simply\r\n\r\nbecause we did not have the expertise to teach our young  social\r\n\r\nworkers?   We  are  at a stage, Sir, when we  need  specialists,\r\n\r\ntherapists and consultants for the sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Start with the University</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise that in the\r\n\r\narena of human resource development, we need a long lead time to\r\n\r\nchange mindset and upgrade existing skills.  Even if we were  to\r\n\r\nstart  in  1998  to increase our undergraduate  and  polytechnic\r\n\r\nstudent  intakes into the Social Work Department  and  start  to\r\n\r\nchange  our curriculum from a general one to a specialised  one,\r\n\r\nwe  will  only see the outcome in 2001.  There is an urgency  to\r\n\r\nattend to this matter now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea related to manpower shortage was raised by the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  whether  we  could create opportunities  for  mature\r\n\r\nadults  like home-makers or early retirees to train for a social\r\n\r\nwork degree in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuniversity.  They could fill the manpower shortage in the sector\r\n\r\nand  at  the  same  time  add value to the  quality  of  service\r\n\r\ndelivery  by  sharing their life experiences  when  they  handle\r\n\r\nfamilies with multiple problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young social workers, graduated at 21 or 22, find\r\n\r\nfamily  therapy  work  overwhelming  due  to  their  youth   and\r\n\r\ninexperiences.  Importing foreign talent is obviously  a  short-term  solution.   But in the long run, Sir,  we  cannot  have  a\r\n\r\nsociety  where  the  poor,  the aged,  the  sick  and  the  less\r\n\r\nfortunate  are  all  cared for by foreigners while  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwrite the cheques for the carers and givers.  If we are to build\r\n\r\non  the  ethos of volunteerism and service excellence,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  a  strong  corps of grown decently  paid  and  well-respected social service professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To borrow an analogy. Even if a volunteer citizen army is\r\n\r\nto  work,  it must have a corps of highly motivated and  trained\r\n\r\nprofessional officers.  It is no different for social work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Job Demoralisation:  A national liability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not just about the economics of manpower\r\n\r\nplanning.   When people are demoralised due to a perceived  loss\r\n\r\nof  personal  relevance, it is the end  of  all  motivation  for\r\n\r\nchange  and  improvement.  This is a national liability  because\r\n\r\nindividuals  in  such mental state have lost  the  capacity  and\r\n\r\ncompetence to be contributing citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation may not only be applicable to the social\r\n\r\nservice  sector.  Let me quote the survey on the General  Health\r\n\r\nof   the  Singapore  Population  conducted  in  1989.   A  minor\r\n\r\npsychiatric   morbidity  (MPM),  which  is  an   indicator   for\r\n\r\nestablishing  the  extent of our population at  risk  of  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  problems, was a high 18% compared to other countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  region which ranged from 8% to 20%.  MPM does not  mean  we\r\n\r\nare  all  mad.  But it does mean that we are not all  too  well.\r\n\r\nAnd  a  subsequent report published by the IPS in 1991 indicated\r\n\r\nthat, among other factors, low self-esteem, performance anxiety,\r\n\r\nstress,  inadequate coping skills were some of  the  causes  for\r\n\r\nMPM.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is while our GDP may not be dramatically\r\n\r\naffected by a high MPM rate, it undermines our national sense of\r\n\r\nself  and weakens our collective psyche.  It may not prepare  us\r\n\r\nto cope with the extraordinary stresses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Culture of Anxiety</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned, Sir, that all our efforts to upgrade\r\n\r\nour  heartware resources will come to nought if we  do  not  rid\r\n\r\nourselves of the culture of anxiety which infuses our system.  I\r\n\r\nam  not referring to the external stresses which are part of the\r\n\r\nhuman condition, ie, poverty, making ends meet, relating to life\r\n\r\npartner, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to an anxiety syndrome within the Government\r\n\r\nservice.   The anxiety started at an early age where within  the\r\n\r\nschool system, young people are socialised into worrying how  to\r\n\r\nget through the system without tripping up.  They are driven  by\r\n\r\nthe  fear  of  being wrong rather than the desire to  be  right.\r\n\r\nThese are two different motivations.  The first is inhibited and\r\n\r\nparalysing; the second, proactive and choice-focused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked with many police case officers, social\r\n\r\nservice   providers  and  other  Ministry  administrators,   and\r\n\r\ninvariably, a culture of anxiety is omni-present.  Most of  them\r\n\r\nare  competent, dedicated, but they are afraid to make decisions\r\n\r\nfor   fear  that  they  would  be  judged  as  wrong  decisions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is better to dawdle, rather than make a  decision,\r\n\r\nespecially  one  which may break new ground.   At  other  times,\r\n\r\ntheir  hesitations were compounded by inadequate training,  poor\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the standard operation procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM has spoken of the need to decentralise decision making\r\n\r\nso  that  we do not just have a top-down society, but a  lateral\r\n\r\nsociety  of interaction and dialogue.  Sir, I think that  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to achieve PM's vision, we must seriously tackle this  fear\r\n\r\nof failure, culture of anxiety, whatever you call it, because it\r\n\r\nprevents the empowerment of Singaporeans at all levels.  And  in\r\n\r\nthe  arena  of  crisis intervention, when on-the-spot  decisions\r\n\r\nhave to be made to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsave  lives, the failure by frontline officers to act could lead\r\n\r\nto disastrous outcomes.  We do not need more weeny hose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts that Singapore is where it is today because\r\n\r\nof  our  commitment to competition and meritocracy in all fields\r\n\r\nof our endeavours.  But if we are, as PM has encouraged, to look\r\n\r\nat  improving our society with no preconceptions, I urge that we\r\n\r\nlook at how we can replace the culture of anxiety with a culture\r\n\r\nof  initiative.  By that, I mean, Sir, give people  the  freedom\r\n\r\nand  the responsibility to choose the course of action and  face\r\n\r\nthe  consequences, make the mistakes and learn from them without\r\n\r\nbeing  judged  too  harshly.   This  open  spirit  and  acquired\r\n\r\nconfidence in making a right and good judgment can only  enhance\r\n\r\nour commitment to competition and meritocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Services 21</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that a balanced development\r\n\r\nrequires  both  economic and social help.   In  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\ncreate  this  care-and-share society, who  do  we  see  are  the\r\n\r\nheartware  specialists?  Government sets the tone  and  provides\r\n\r\nthe vision but the help will actually be delivered by grassroots\r\n\r\nadvocates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of CDCs and their sincere attempts to partner\r\n\r\nwith  neighbourhood  agencies are a welcome strategy  to  foster\r\n\r\ncommunity building.  Such cooperative involvement is what  gives\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a sense of relevance and how we keep the  daughters\r\n\r\nand  sons  of Singapore on this soil.  The long-term  return  on\r\n\r\ninvestments for dollars spent on heartware resources is  when  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean will say, \"I may not be rich but I am cared for,  my\r\n\r\nwork is relevant and being recognised, and I feel I belong.\"   I\r\n\r\nhope the Government will see the social service community as one\r\n\r\nkey  partner in its vision of building a heartware society.   We\r\n\r\nneed  a paradigm shift to see social welfare beyond handing  out\r\n\r\nbenefits  here and there.  Instead, welfare involves a focus  on\r\n\r\nsocial  services  as a heartware fundamental,  integral  to  any\r\n\r\neffort  in  governance  to ensure social equity  and  the  total\r\n\r\nwellness of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the social service community would like to\r\n\r\nhelp  translate  these tenets of a care and share  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nwith a wish list.  Our wish list comprises:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career recognition;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared passion for social courses to be encouraged at all\r\n\r\ncommunity and administrative levels;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service with a clear mind and a trained skill;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer and trusted communication at all levels between\r\n\r\ninstitutions in the helping process;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to information and open exchanges of experiences;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearer protocols and procedures in case management to\r\n\r\nachieve an integrated approach; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharing of responsibility by enforcement personnel across\r\n\r\nall Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministers for Finance, Education\r\n\r\nand  Community  Development will give meaningful focus  to  this\r\n\r\nwish list for the social services in the Singapore 21 plan.  The\r\n\r\ncommunity would like to see a Social Services 21 Committee being\r\n\r\nset  up  whereby  grassroots social service professionals  could\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations and propose integrated programmes for  the\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify that by proposing SS 21, I am not\r\n\r\nasking  for  more and more subsidies.  I believe  in  the  `many\r\n\r\nhelping hands' principle, but I stress we also need many helping\r\n\r\nskills.   Sir, we need a fresh mindset willing to recognise  new\r\n\r\npriorities and change old cultures of organisations and work, if\r\n\r\nwe  are to reach beyond the already successful Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\ntouch  the lives of the marginalised and the disadvantaged  -  I\r\n\r\nmean  the underachievers, delinquents, children and families  at\r\n\r\nrisk,  the  aged, the disabled and the poor.  We  can  certainly\r\n\r\nstart by recognising that in today's affluent Singapore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe must move beyond economic fundamentals to address the equally\r\n\r\nimportant social fundamentals.  [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my\r\n\r\nMinister,  I would like to thank the NMP Mdm Claire  Chiang  for\r\n\r\nher  very comprehensive and eloquent speech.  But before  we  go\r\n\r\ntoo  much  beyond economic fundamentals, let us  get  one  thing\r\n\r\nstraight.    It   is  important  first  to  get   the   economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals  correct.  Without a strong economy, we  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  the resources to deal with the social problems and to fund\r\n\r\nthe meaningful social service programmes.  We may also face more\r\n\r\nsevere  social problems when our economy weakens.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nI   acknowledge  that she has put forward many  good  ideas  and\r\n\r\nraised many pertinent and constructive points.  The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development together with other  organisations  which\r\n\r\nare  in the social service sector will study her ideas.   I  may\r\n\r\nalso  seek  further clarifications from her and to  further  the\r\n\r\nexchange  of  ideas.   After  all, social  service  is  not  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  Government  alone.   We  look   forward   to\r\n\r\nparticipation of sincere and like-minded people.  We  also  look\r\n\r\nforward to benefiting from their ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to outline MCD's basic approach to the provision\r\n\r\nof social service  - \"Many Helping Hands\".  She has pointed this\r\n\r\nout  in  her  speech  and also mentioned  that  the  hands  need\r\n\r\ntraining of many useful skills too.  Yes, this is what  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  doing and we want to do better.  With many helping  hands,\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the voluntary organisations, the community and,\r\n\r\nin particular, the more successful citizens can come together to\r\n\r\nhelp  the less fortunate in the community.  This enhances social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   This  approach has served Singapore  well  and  this\r\n\r\nbasic approach will continue.  Whether we call it Social Service\r\n\r\n21  or  some other name, I believe we can decide later.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant to know what is it that we want to do first.  In fact,\r\n\r\nas  we approach the 21st century, we will see more helping hands\r\n\r\ncoming our way and, in a sense, also more useful skills.   These\r\n\r\ncome through from three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndirections.    First,   the  increased  involvement   of   local\r\n\r\ncommunities;   second, the increase in volunteer  participation;\r\n\r\nand, third, the development of human resources.  I think the NMP\r\n\r\nhas addressed all three.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps allow me to address them using my own frequency.\r\n\r\nFirst, involving the local communities.  The involvement of  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  was  indeed mentioned by the NMP.  In fact, the  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  and  the  CDCs  can synergise  with  each  other.\r\n\r\nVoluntary  welfare organisations have the professional knowledge\r\n\r\nand enthusiasm, while the CDCs have the local grassroots network\r\n\r\nand know the needs of the local community.  By working together,\r\n\r\nthey  can  reach  out to more people, recruit  more  volunteers,\r\n\r\nraise more funds, and serve more residents and do it better.  As\r\n\r\na  result, more residents will  benefit from more resources  and\r\n\r\nbetter  services.  We also bring the coordinator,  namely,  CDC,\r\n\r\ncloser  to the community, instead of being located far  away  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Community Development.  That way,  the  helping\r\n\r\nhands are nearer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, increase volunteer participation. We believe that\r\n\r\nthrough the involvement of local communities via the CDCs,  more\r\n\r\nlocal  residents will be willing to participate  as  volunteers.\r\n\r\nAs  they will see that they are helping a neighbour in need  who\r\n\r\nis  just perhaps not too far away, they will be more willing  to\r\n\r\ncome  forward.  Also, our students will be performing a  minimum\r\n\r\nof  six  hours a year of compulsory community service.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  initiative of the Ministry of Education, and this  will  be\r\n\r\npart  of  the school programme.  Our young people will  discover\r\n\r\nthe joy of helping people who are in need.  As they discover the\r\n\r\npleasure,  they  grow  up and become more  conscious  about  the\r\n\r\nimportance of social service.  Many of them would join the  rank\r\n\r\nof   volunteers  or  social  service  professionals.   As   this\r\n\r\nprogramme is introduced to the young people, it can become a way\r\n\r\nof life and part of Singapore 21.  With more volunteers, we have\r\n\r\nmore  helping  hands.   We can  raise the level  of  volunteers'\r\n\r\nparticipation to a level nearer that of the developed countries.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthink  we  are about half.  Some people have said, one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe  volunteers' participation of developed countries.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe should be able to catch up in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is developing human resources. I think the\r\n\r\nNMP  has articulated many ideas in this direction, both for  the\r\n\r\nsocial  service professionals as well as for the social  service\r\n\r\nvolunteers.  Like her, we attach much importance to the  quality\r\n\r\nand commitment of the social service professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House and the NMP that much has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  to try to improve and assure the quality  of  social\r\n\r\nservice professionals as well as the standard of the social work\r\n\r\ngraduates.    We  do  admit  that  sometimes  we   find   rather\r\n\r\ninexperienced  young  graduates  handling  relatively  difficult\r\n\r\ncases  in  some  of the centres.  But please  see  this  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the rapid growth of our social service sector in  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years.  The social service centres will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese younger graduates are guided, supervised and they learn on\r\n\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP mentioned the need to train a core of trained\r\n\r\nprofessional officers drawing on the analogy with the  military.\r\n\r\nLet me assure her that the Ministry of Community Development and\r\n\r\nthe NUS collectively plan for our officer cadet schools to train\r\n\r\nour  officer  cadets.  We work closely with  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Work and Psychology of the NUS to plan student  intakes,\r\n\r\nidentify training needs and review the curriculum of NUS  social\r\n\r\nwork  courses.   I  shall visit my distinguished  colleague,  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo, to find out what more we could do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want higher professional qualifications, the NUS\r\n\r\nalso  has a plan for a Masters degree and a Graduate Diploma  in\r\n\r\nSocial   Work  for  graduates  in  social  work.   The   Temasek\r\n\r\nPolytechnic has also launched its Graduate Specialist Diploma in\r\n\r\nCounselling and Guidance this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those are the training courses for professional social\r\n\r\nworkers.  And to  allow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexisting frontline workers including volunteers to upgrade their\r\n\r\nskills,  MCD encouraged and facilitated the setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Resource  and Training Centre (FRTC)  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Social Workers.  The FRTC leads in  specialised\r\n\r\nskills  training  in  new areas of social service  such  as  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of juveniles as well as family violence cases.\r\n\r\nThe  NMP  seems to have the impression that MCD has always  been\r\n\r\nvery stingy but we did provide $1.6 million since 1992 to set up\r\n\r\nand  run  the  FRTC.   We also set up a half  a  million  dollar\r\n\r\nendowment fund for them to help them generate interest  to  fund\r\n\r\nsome  of the training programmes.  I want to assure the NMP that\r\n\r\nmore funds would be provided if more courses are identified  and\r\n\r\na  need  should arise.   In addition, we also give  business  to\r\n\r\nFRTC.   We  commission  FRTC as well  as  other  agencies,  like\r\n\r\nCounselling and Care Centre, to conduct specialised  and  skills\r\n\r\nenhancement  workshops  and courses.   A  total  of  788  social\r\n\r\nworkers  from the various VWOs, police, medical and social  work\r\n\r\ndepartments and MCD have attended these courses in the last  two\r\n\r\nyears.   More  such  courses  would  be  funded  by  MCD.   Nine\r\n\r\nspecialised  courses  a year in the areas  of  family  violence,\r\n\r\nchild  abuse and juvenile delinquency will be conducted starting\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is satisfied with the professional standard of our\r\n\r\nsocial  work graduates as well as most of our social work  para-professionals.   MCD  is  also  committed  to  their   continued\r\n\r\nimprovement.  In fact, their quality of training and versatility\r\n\r\nmay  have contributed to the relatively high turnover.   Let  us\r\n\r\nface  it.   If  I am no good, and nobody wants to  employ  me  I\r\n\r\ncannot  turn over.  Perhaps our graduates are too  good.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  they turn over rather faster than we wanted them.   But\r\n\r\nthis is no reason for us not to ensure that they are even better\r\n\r\ntrained than now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, our human resources in the social service\r\n\r\nsector  are also particularly suitable for the HR sector in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  Social workers, in fact, can make very good  HR\r\n\r\nmanagers.  Sometimes they get paid more.  Social work  also  can\r\n\r\nbe  very  stressful  and  can be very emotionally  draining.   A\r\n\r\nsocial work graduate who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndoes  not  really have a heart for such work may  find  it  more\r\n\r\nworthwhile to join the private sector.  This is inevitable,  but\r\n\r\nthis  may  not be all bad.  The private sector, with more  staff\r\n\r\nwith social work experience, can turn out to be some of our many\r\n\r\nhelping hands, our hands and contacts in the business world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say that despite the high turnover we do have\r\n\r\nexcellent professional social workers who have remained  in  the\r\n\r\nprofession.   They  stay  because they find satisfaction.   They\r\n\r\nfind  that social work is work for the conscience and  work  for\r\n\r\nthe heart.  Of course, we must not take them for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngranted.

The  problem  has  not been providing  information,  but\r\n\r\nimplementing  effective measures against the fires.   As  stated\r\n\r\nseveral   times  by  the  Indonesian  State  Minister  for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, the Indonesian authorities face problems  enforcing\r\n\r\nthe  laws  against the use of fire by big plantation  owners  to\r\n\r\nclear  plantation land.  And once the fires take hold  and  rage\r\n\r\nover  a  large  area, they are very difficult to put  out.

A small number were waiting for their salary disputes\r\n\r\nwith employers to be settled.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will help foreign workers who were left\r\n\r\nstranded  when  their employers fail to pay the  foreign  worker\r\n\r\nlevy.    We   will  try  to  find  alternative  employment   and\r\n\r\naccommodation  for them.  In the recent Chander  Road  case,  we\r\n\r\nwere   able  to  assist  more  than  200  foreign  workers  with\r\n\r\nalternative  employment and accommodation.   This  was  achieved\r\n\r\nwith  the  cooperation  of the Singapore Police,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nContractors' Association Limited (SCAL) and main contractors who\r\n\r\nagreed to employ the foreign workers or re-assign them to  their\r\n\r\nother sub-contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulous employers who abandon their workers run the\r\n\r\nrisk  of having the $5,000 security bond forfeited.  This is  on\r\n\r\nthe ground that they have infringed one of the conditions of the\r\n\r\nbond  which is to provide proper accommodation for their foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  while they are in Singapore.  Such employers will  also\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed to employ foreign workers.  Their  applications\r\n\r\nfor  work  permits  will  be rejected to prevent  recurrence  of\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of stranded foreign workers is often caused by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous employers who recruit foreign construction  workers\r\n\r\nmainly  to  profit from the monetary kickback from  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal  employment  agents.   These employers  are  usually  sub-contractors or labour suppliers masquerading as sub-contractors.\r\n\r\nOften  they  obtain  the  work permits by  overstating  or  even\r\n\r\nfalsifying their workload claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has studied these malpractices and we have\r\n\r\nalready announced measures to prevent such abuses.  Last  month,\r\n\r\nI  announced  that next year, we will implement a  revised  work\r\n\r\npermit   allocation  system  which  allocates   foreign   worker\r\n\r\nentitlements  directly  to  main  contractors  only.   The  main\r\n\r\ncontractor can then use their entitlement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  employ foreign workers directly or allocate all or  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  entitlement to their sub-contractors.  In  this  way,  main\r\n\r\ncontractors  will  have direct control of  the  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nengaged for their projects.  They will also have to take care to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  sub-contractors to whom  they  allocate  work\r\n\r\npermit entitlements are actually working on their project.   The\r\n\r\nnew  work permit allocation system will minimise opportunity for\r\n\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the implementation of the new work permit\r\n\r\nallocation  system,  my Ministry will also tighten  the  current\r\n\r\nendorsement procedures for work permit applications.  Presently,\r\n\r\nboth  main  and  sub-contractors can apply for  foreign  workers\r\n\r\ndirectly  from CIDB.  Although main contractors are required  to\r\n\r\nendorse  the  work permit applications of their sub-contractors,\r\n\r\nmany  do  so without proper scrutiny. Henceforth, we will  refer\r\n\r\napplications  by  sub-contractors to their main contractors  for\r\n\r\nverification  and  support.   Main  contractors  will  also   be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  undertake to employ and provide  accommodation  to\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  of  their sub-contractors  should  the  latter\r\n\r\nsubsequently  abandon their workers.  This measure  will  compel\r\n\r\nmain  contractors to scrutinise the work permit applications  of\r\n\r\ntheir sub-contractors carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides tightening the application system, MOL will\r\n\r\nconsider  introducing an additional security  deposit  for  levy\r\n\r\npayment to deal with sub-contractors who are habitually late  in\r\n\r\ntheir levy payments or who had defaulted on payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures will minimise abuses of foreign workers\r\n\r\nand  ensure that employers do not abandon their foreign workers.\r\n\r\nHowever,  should this happen, my Ministry will ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nforeign workers' welfare is safeguarded.  We will help those who\r\n\r\nwish  to  continue working in Singapore to find  new  employers.\r\n\r\nApart  from  placing them with their main contractors  and  sub-contractors, the Ministry will require applicants for  new  work\r\n\r\npermit  to consider these displaced workers before bringing  new\r\n\r\nforeign workers to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that my Ministry will not\r\n\r\ntolerate the actions of unscrupulous employers who abandon their\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.

The\r\n\r\nincrease  will  take  effect  from  1st  April  1998.   We  also\r\n\r\nannounced  the intention to review the levy annually  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  it  remains effective in dampening the demand for  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers. Future levy increases will take into  account\r\n\r\nthe  increase in the number of foreign domestic workers as  well\r\n\r\nas the income levels of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on foreign domestic worker is meant to dampen\r\n\r\ndemand  so  that Singaporeans will not become over-dependent  on\r\n\r\nthem.  We understand that some families require the service of a\r\n\r\nforeign   domestic  worker  and  our  policy  is  not  to   deny\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of such service.  However, there is still a need to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  number  of foreign domestic  workers  remains\r\n\r\nmanageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households employ foreign domestic workers for a variety of\r\n\r\nreasons.  Some  employ a foreign domestic worker to  look  after\r\n\r\nyoung children, others to look after the aged and handicapped or\r\n\r\nthe sick, and yet others to attend to household chores or to  do\r\n\r\nall  these tasks.  We should not favour any particular household\r\n\r\nor  type of work by exempting the levy or granting a concession.\r\n\r\nThe   levy   should  remain  a  transparent  pricing   mechanism\r\n\r\napplicable  to all employers.  Granting exemption or  concession\r\n\r\non  the  levy will undermine Government's efforts to manage  the\r\n\r\ndemand for foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of the foreign domestic worker levy is not\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with  efforts  to  get  more  women  to  join  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  By adopting levy as a regulating instrument, we  are\r\n\r\nleaving  it  to  women to decide on working or staying  at  home\r\n\r\nafter balancing their income with the total cost of employing  a\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic worker. The trend of increasing female  labour\r\n\r\nforce participation rates over the years show that the levy  has\r\n\r\nnot  deterred  women from working.  In any case,  working  women\r\n\r\nshould  not consider foreign domestic workers as the only option\r\n\r\nin  managing their households.  I would like to point  out  that\r\n\r\ncountries  such  as  Japan  has a  higher  female  labour  force\r\n\r\nparticipation rate compared to Singapore, and yet does not  have\r\n\r\na large pool of domestic workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, working women who employ foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers, be it to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of children or the elderly, can claim tax relief  of\r\n\r\ntwice the levy paid for the year.  This tax relief helps them to\r\n\r\nmeet  part  of the cost of employing domestic workers  and  thus\r\n\r\nproviding  incentive for more women to work.  Hence,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  levy  revision  will  deter  housewives   from\r\n\r\nreturning to work especially if they are able to earn an  income\r\n\r\nthat  more than offsets the cost of employing a foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REGISTRATION OF PRIMARY ONE PUPILS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education whether his\r\n\r\nMinistry will consider registering primary one pupils two  years\r\n\r\nbefore  they  start school so as to facilitate the provision  of\r\n\r\npupil placements, including the construction of new schools, and\r\n\r\nat   the   same  time  enable  parents  to  make  the  necessary\r\n\r\narrangements for their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting idea which my ministry will look\r\n\r\ninto.

We\r\n\r\nhave  presented the relevant facts to the general  public  in  a\r\n\r\nconcise  and easy-to-understand manner to avoid undue alarm  and\r\n\r\nto maintain confidence in our blood transfusion service.  At the\r\n\r\nhospital  level,  our  doctors  are  also  re-assuring  patients\r\n\r\nneeding  surgical operations that the blood transfusion,  should\r\n\r\nthey need one, is safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Blood Transfusion Service (SBTS) has\r\n\r\ncontinually introduced new measures to improve the safety of our\r\n\r\nnational  blood  supply  as and when  these  are  available  and\r\n\r\napproved  for  use  in  the  developed  countries.  The   safety\r\n\r\nstandards of our blood collection system are comparable to those\r\n\r\nused  in  developed countries including USA, UK  and  Australia.\r\n\r\nBesides  adopting stringent procedures to screen  blood  donors,\r\n\r\nstate-of-the-art methods of laboratory testing are being used to\r\n\r\ntest  donated  blood at the SBTS.  In addition,  an  independent\r\n\r\nexternal  agency  from Australia carries out  annual  audits  of\r\n\r\nSBTS' blood collection and processing procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to the limitations in currently available\r\n\r\ntechnology,  there  is an inherent risk, one that  is  extremely\r\n\r\nlow,  of  contracting HIV through blood transfusion.  All  blood\r\n\r\ntransfusion services in the world face these limitations.  Until\r\n\r\ntechnological advancements can detect HIV infected blood  during\r\n\r\nthe  \"window period\" of two to three weeks, we need to  rely  on\r\n\r\nother  means to ensure that our national blood supply  is  safe.\r\n\r\nThe most important are continually educating the public on blood\r\n\r\ndonation,  and encouraging those who do not engage in high  risk\r\n\r\nbehaviour  to come forward to donate blood and help save  lives,\r\n\r\nand  ensuring  that we have effective screening  procedures  for\r\n\r\nblood donors at the blood donation centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has reviewed the process for screening blood\r\n\r\ndonors  and will be taking measures to further strengthen public\r\n\r\nand  donor  education.  The aim of such education  is  to  raise\r\n\r\npublic awareness on AIDS and other infectious diseases which are\r\n\r\ntransmissible by blood transfusion.  Persons with high  risk  of\r\n\r\nexposure to infectious diseases, including AIDS, must not donate\r\n\r\nblood, and we must strongly discourage them from doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also embark on a programme to train our\r\n\r\ncounsellors  at the Blood Transfusion Service to  improve  their\r\n\r\neffectiveness in interviewing potential donors.  They need to be\r\n\r\ndiscreet,  yet effective, in conveying the message to  intending\r\n\r\ndonors  that  they  have  to withdraw from  the  blood  donation\r\n\r\nsession  if  they are in the high risk group. My  ministry  will\r\n\r\nalso  be improving the blood donor questionaire to enable donors\r\n\r\nto withdraw discreetly, and without embarrassment, at the end of\r\n\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is very appreciative of the selflessness and\r\n\r\ncivic-mindedness of the very large number of regular donors  who\r\n\r\ntake  time  to  donate their blood at the  BTS.   As  our  blood\r\n\r\ntransfusion  service rely on voluntary blood donation  from  the\r\n\r\npublic,  we  have  to maintain a fine balance  between  imposing\r\n\r\ncriteria  on  blood  donors that are overly  inquisitorial,  and\r\n\r\nhaving an adequate supply of blood in our national blood bank to\r\n\r\nsave lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DAMAGE CAUSED BY COLLISION OF TANKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Communications (a) if\r\n\r\nhe  will  give an assessment on the amount of ecological  damage\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the  collision  of the  tankers  off  the  coast  of\r\n\r\nSingapore;  (b) what is the long-term ecological impact  on  the\r\n\r\nwildlife concerned; and (c) how much it cost in cleaning up  the\r\n\r\noil spill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the oil spill on the ecology of the affected\r\n\r\nareas can only be assessed after a comprehensive study has  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out.

More patients are being discharged  to  the  4  Day\r\n\r\nCentres  for follow-up rehabilitation and to prepare  for  their\r\n\r\ngradual  assimilation into the community.   To  complement  this\r\n\r\neffort, the hospital has also expanded its community psychiatric\r\n\r\nnursing  service, which provides trained nurses for home  visits\r\n\r\nto  review  the  progress of patients and  to  give  advice  and\r\n\r\nsupport to those caring for them.  Support groups for the family\r\n\r\nmembers on patient care activities have also been formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) Expanded training programme for psychiatrists,\r\n\r\npsychiatric   nurses,   clinical   psychologists,   occupational\r\n\r\ntherapists and Continuing Education for doctors and nurses\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are being\r\n\r\ntrained.

However, MTI has not found it necessary to use the  Act,\r\n\r\nas  keen  competition in the retail sector has made  any  direct\r\n\r\ngovernment intervention unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CLAIM FOR LOSSES IN BONUSES BY NSMEN</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\n\r\nfor Defence whether he will allow NSmen to claim losses in their\r\n\r\nbonuses  and  pay  components, in view  of  the  common  use  of\r\n\r\nflexible wage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen who attend NS training are eligible for the SAF\r\n\r\nservice  pay.

At  around  the same time, we  formed  the  National\r\n\r\nComputer  Board  to  promote  and  catalyse  IT  development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  also have the National IT Committee  (NITC)  to\r\n\r\nformulate  IT  policies  and  strategies,  and  coordinate   and\r\n\r\nintegrate IT applications nationally and in the various  sectors\r\n\r\nof society.  NITC is a high level inter-agency committee.  It is\r\n\r\ncurrently chaired by Teo Chee Hean, with DPM Lee Hsien Loong  as\r\n\r\nadvisor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has achieved considerable success in propagating\r\n\r\nthe widespread use of IT in homes, schools and industries and in\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a  significant IT economic sector.  Our  household\r\n\r\ncomputer  penetration rate of 36% is one of the highest  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   We  are spending $2 billion over the next  5  years  to\r\n\r\nprovide  computers for every pupil  in schools.   The  local  IT\r\n\r\nindustry registered revenues of almost $9 billion in 1996 and is\r\n\r\ngrowing at a phenomenal rate in excess of 30% a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milestone in our IT development is the unveiling of the\r\n\r\nnational  IT plan in 1992.  Codenamed IT2000, the plan envisions\r\n\r\nSingapore as an \"Intelligent Island\" where IT is used in  almost\r\n\r\nevery facet of life - at home, at work and at play.  IT will  be\r\n\r\nexploited    aggressively   to   boost   Singapore's    economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and enhance the quality of life of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of IT2000 is on track. A major component is\r\n\r\nthe  creation of Singapore ONE - an islandwide broadband network\r\n\r\nthat  will  run multimedia interactive services, including  fast\r\n\r\nInternet   access,  video-conferencing,  online   shopping   and\r\n\r\ndistance  learning.  Singapore ONE is expected to be  accessible\r\n\r\nto all Singaporeans by end 1998, thus bringing Singapore another\r\n\r\nstep nearer to the \"Intelligent Island\" vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done all these without a Ministry of Information\r\n\r\nTechnology.  The inter-agency arrangement under NITC has  worked\r\n\r\nwell.  NITC has provided strong and effective leadership to  the\r\n\r\npush  for IT development and use in Singapore.  Rather than  set\r\n\r\nup  a  new  Ministry,  it  is better to focus  on  refining  the\r\n\r\nexisting  arrangement, at least for the time being.

UOB had  reviewed\r\n\r\nthe  business  and  financial position of the Company,  and  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the Company was suitable for listing on the  SES.\r\n\r\nUOB  had also carried out due diligence on the disclosures  made\r\n\r\nin   the  listing  application  and  in  the  prospectus  issued\r\n\r\nsubsequently in connection with the share issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1993, CAM's accounts were audited by Cheong Khee\r\n\r\nSan  & Co.  Before the listing, Ernst & Young was appointed  the\r\n\r\njoint  auditor  starting  from the  financial  year  ended  30th\r\n\r\nSeptember  1993.  The joint auditors did not make  any  material\r\n\r\nqualifications  to  the  5-year audited  consolidated  financial\r\n\r\nresults  of  the  group  which were  submitted  in  the  listing\r\n\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the information (including the 5-year audited\r\n\r\naccounts)  contained  in  the  listing  application,   the   SES\r\n\r\nconsidered CAM to have met the minimum listing requirements, and\r\n\r\naccordingly, approved the Company for listing on the SES.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing listing applications, the SES, like other\r\n\r\nstock  exchanges  elsewhere,  has to  rely  on  information  and\r\n\r\ndocuments   prepared,  provided  and/or   vouched   by   various\r\n\r\nindependent  professionals.   These  professionals  include  the\r\n\r\nauditors  of  the  listing  applicant,  the  investment  bankers\r\n\r\nsponsoring  and  managing the listing and share issue,  and  the\r\n\r\nlawyers advising on the legal issues.  It is both impossible and\r\n\r\nimpractical  for  the SES to verify every piece  of  information\r\n\r\ncontained  in a listing application.  In CAM's case,  there  was\r\n\r\nnothing  to  cause  the  SES  to suspect  that  any  information\r\n\r\ncontained   in   the  listing  application  was  inaccurate   or\r\n\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in CAM's case would appear to be an audit\r\n\r\nfailure  resulting from alleged collusion between a  partner  in\r\n\r\nCheong  Khee San & Co and the top management of CAM  to  falsify\r\n\r\nthe   group's  financial  accounts.   Consequently,  the  5-year\r\n\r\naudited  consolidated  accounts of the group  submitted  in  the\r\n\r\nlisting  application were likely to have vastly  overstated  the\r\n\r\ngroup's  profits or concealed its losses.  Had the group's  past\r\n\r\naccounts  been properly prepared and audited, the Company  might\r\n\r\nnot have met the SES' listing requirements and the listing might\r\n\r\nnot have taken place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Issues   that   led  to  the  suspension  of  trading   of   CAM International shares in the stock market</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAM shares were suspended from trading on the SES on 29th\r\n\r\nApril  1997.  The SES took that action after it was notified  by\r\n\r\nthe  Monetary Authority of Singapore that Ernst & Young had made\r\n\r\na  report  to the Minister for Finance under section 207(9A)  of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act.  In that report, Ernst & Young concluded that\r\n\r\nit  believed  that a serious offence had been or was  likely  to\r\n\r\nhave been committed against the Company by its officer(s).   The\r\n\r\nSES  decided  that it would be in the interest of the  investing\r\n\r\npublic  to suspend trading in CAM shares until adequate  details\r\n\r\nabout  the  alleged  irregularities  and  their  effect  on  the\r\n\r\nCompany's   financial  conditions  have  been  established   and\r\n\r\ndisclosed to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the Company had appointed Price Waterhouse to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the matter, and Price Waterhouse's findings had been\r\n\r\nreleased  to the market.  However, the Company had not  released\r\n\r\nits  audited accounts for the year ended September 1996 and  its\r\n\r\ninterim results ended March 1997 within the 6 / 3 months (as the\r\n\r\ncase  may  be)  required by the SES rules.   As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\ninvesting  public  does  not have recent  information  on  CAM's\r\n\r\nfinancial  position, including its solvency.  In view  of  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it would not be appropriate to resume trading  in\r\n\r\nCAM shares now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will let the shares resume trading after the\r\n\r\nCompany  has  finalised and reported its September 1996  audited\r\n\r\naccounts  and  March 1997 interim results, and the  Company  can\r\n\r\nshow  that  it has sufficient working capital to continue  as  a\r\n\r\ngoing concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What  will MOF do to avoid similar companies from getting listed so that small investors will be better protected?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of listing applications falls within the purview\r\n\r\nof  the  SES.   No amount of rules can ever prevent  frauds  and\r\n\r\ndishonest  conduct.   To  try to do so by  introducing  more  or\r\n\r\nstricter  rules  will  increase the cost of  operations  for  an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  number of good corporate citizens.  What  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  be done is to impose severe punishment on those  persons\r\n\r\nfound to have perpetrated serious frauds that caused huge losses\r\n\r\nto  the public.  In addition, professional bodies, in this  case\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Accountants  Board and the Institute  of  Certified\r\n\r\nPublic  Accountants of Singapore, must deal with  unprofessional\r\n\r\nbehaviour of their members quickly and firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PURCHASE OF APARTMENTS IN NASSIM JADE AND SCOTTS 28</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether,\r\n\r\nin  his  inquiries conducted into the purchase of apartments  in\r\n\r\nNassim  Jade and Scotts 28 by the Senior Minister and the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, he considered the application of\r\n\r\nsection 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around mid-March 1996, MAS received reports of rumours\r\n\r\nalleging improprieties in the sale and purchase of apartments in\r\n\r\nNassim  Jade  and Scotts 28 being developed by Hotel  Properties\r\n\r\nLtd  (HPL), a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  Senior  Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien  Loong.\r\n\r\nThe reports were sent to the Prime Minister.

For  this  reason, there are  currently  already  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of provisions in the Companies Act and SES rules  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  The safeguards are as follows :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the Companies Act confers certain fundamental rights\r\n\r\non  each  and  every shareholder, regardless of  the  number  of\r\n\r\nshares  he  or  she  owns.  These include the  right  to  attend\r\n\r\ngeneral  meetings, to speak thereat and to vote  on  resolutions\r\n\r\nput  forth  at  such  meetings.  Minority  shareholders  are  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to  ask  questions and voice  their  opinions  at  such\r\n\r\ngeneral meetings;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) under the law, each director has a duty to act\r\n\r\nhonestly and in the interest of the company as a whole,  ie,  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of all shareholders;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) both the Companies Act and SES rules require all\r\n\r\nlisted  companies  to establish an Audit Committee,  which  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  majority of independent directors.  The Audit Committee\r\n\r\nhelps  to  review  internal controls, financial  statements  and\r\n\r\nprocedures for related-party dealings;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) in cases of oppression or injustice done to any\r\n\r\nminority shareholder, sections 216 and 216A of the Companies Act\r\n\r\nprovide avenues for redress; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) where the interest of substantial shareholders might\r\n\r\nbe  at variance with those of minority shareholders, such as  in\r\n\r\nmaterial  related-party transactions, the SES rules require  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  independent financial advisers  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nminority  shareholders.   Furthermore, substantial  shareholders\r\n\r\nwho  have vested interests in such transactions have to  abstain\r\n\r\nfrom voting on the relevant resolutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulations are adequate to safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  minority  shareholders.   Therefore,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to amend the law to allow for minority representation\r\n\r\nin listed companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REHABILITATED DRUG ADDICTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  whether  his  Ministry will commit  more  resources  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen supports services for rehabilitated drug addicts  and\r\n\r\nhelp them to find jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitating drug addicts is a key priority for Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  the  Singapore  Corporation  of  Rehabilitative\r\n\r\nEnterprises (SCORE).  However, in providing support services for\r\n\r\nrehabilitated  drug addicts, we must strike  a  balance  between\r\n\r\nproviding rehabilitative opportunities for addicts and  imposing\r\n\r\nsufficient deterrence against drug abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current rehabilitative programmes focus on providing\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities and aftercare support for drug addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Providing employment opportunities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of strong work ethic and discipline is a\r\n\r\nmajor focus of our rehabilitative efforts.  Addicts who can hold\r\n\r\ndown  a  stable job tend to be able to reintegrate into  society\r\n\r\nmore  easily and lead a useful life upon their release from  the\r\n\r\nDrug Rehabilitation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCentres (DRCs).  Companies have set up workshops in the DRCs  to\r\n\r\nprovide  work  opportunities.  These workshops  provide  inmates\r\n\r\nwith  a  realistic work environment, and help them to  work  and\r\n\r\nlearn  on-the-job  skills.  SCORE also  provides  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nvocational and generic training courses for drug inmates.  Since\r\n\r\n1983,  more than 5000 inmates have benefited from these training\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extension of its vocational training programme for\r\n\r\nDRC  inmates, SCORE recently initiated the Corporate  Assistance\r\n\r\nfor Rehabilitation (CARE) Scheme.  CARE encourages companies and\r\n\r\norganisations  in the private sector to play an active  role  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  service  by  contributing  towards  the  training  of\r\n\r\ninmates.    Under  this  scheme,  companies  solely  or  jointly\r\n\r\nsponsor  relevant training courses inside the DRCs.  In  return,\r\n\r\nthe trained inmates are attached to the companies for at least 6\r\n\r\nmonths after their release, where they put their acquired skills\r\n\r\nand knowledge to good use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitated addicts can also enrol under SCORE's\r\n\r\nCorporate  Adoption Scheme (CAS) after their  release  from  the\r\n\r\nDRC.   Under this Scheme, companies provide ex-addicts with jobs\r\n\r\nand  appoint  a  mentor in the company to guide and  assist  the\r\n\r\nindividual  in  adapting  to the new work  environment,  and  in\r\n\r\nregaining their self-confidence and esteem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE has also been running a Job Placement Unit (JPU)\r\n\r\nsince 1988 to assist released prisoners and drug addicts to find\r\n\r\nsuitable  jobs.   The  Unit helps to match  the  skills  of  the\r\n\r\ninmates  to the requirement of suitable companies.  So far,  the\r\n\r\nUnit has helped more than 9,200 inmates to find jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Providing aftercare support</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than employment, strong aftercare support is also\r\n\r\ncritical for the successful rehabilitation of drug addicts.  For\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts  who are sufficiently motivated to kick  the  drug\r\n\r\nhabit,   the   Prisons  Department  runs   a   Community   Based\r\n\r\nRehabilitation Programme (CBR) which allows them to be  released\r\n\r\nearlier into the community to continue their rehabilitation in a\r\n\r\nsupportive  environment.  The emphasis of the CBR scheme  is  on\r\n\r\nstable  work,  regular counselling and continuous  support  from\r\n\r\neither  the  family  members or the  community  in  the  halfway\r\n\r\nhouses.   The  results of the programme have  been  encouraging,\r\n\r\nwith a completion rate of about 80%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE also runs a well-structured and comprehensive\r\n\r\ncounselling   programme,   called  the   Aftercare   Counselling\r\n\r\nProgramme  (ACP),  for  drug addicts.  The  ACP  is  a  one-year\r\n\r\nprogramme  providing individual counselling,  group  counselling\r\n\r\nand   family  counselling  under  qualified  SCORE  counsellors.\r\n\r\nClients are encouraged to participate in social and recreational\r\n\r\nactivities organized by SCORE.  As of 30th August 1997, a  total\r\n\r\nof 940 recovering addicts and their families have benefited from\r\n\r\nthe SCORE Counselling Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than SCORE, various religious and voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  such  as the Singapore Anti-Narcotic  Association\r\n\r\n(SANA)  also  provide  various  in-care  and  aftercare  support\r\n\r\nservices for drug addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, adequate resources have been committed to put\r\n\r\nin   place  a  comprehensive  range  of  support  services   for\r\n\r\nrehabilitated drug addicts.

There\r\n\r\nis  thus  no  need  to  provide special  amenities  for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these public amenities, some employers also\r\n\r\nprovide  recreational and welfare facilities for their  workers.\r\n\r\nThese are open to both local and foreign workers in the company.\r\n\r\nSome  even  build special facilities for their foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nAn  example  of  this  is  the  Acacia  Lodge  built  by  Keppel\r\n\r\nCorporation    to   house   its   foreign   workers.     Besides\r\n\r\naccommodation, the Lodge has facilities such as a canteen, mini-mart, launderette and a multi-purpose recreational hall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB and JTC are prepared to lease out more sites to be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  as dormitories for foreign workers.  When  developed,\r\n\r\nthese  dormitory projects will also be provided  with  amenities\r\n\r\nand recreational facilities for the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>IMPROVEMENT OF WALKWAY ALONG KALLANG RIVER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whe  ther the Government can  improve  the  walkway\r\n\r\nalong  the Kallang River by constructing tunnels underneath  the\r\n\r\nroads  so  that  pedestrians and cyclists could have  continuous\r\n\r\naccess along the walkway.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walkway referred to is the Kallang Park Connector. It\r\n\r\nis  a  long  term plan by the National Parks Board to  build  an\r\n\r\nislandwide network of park connectors linking the various parks.\r\n\r\nSince  the  inception of the plan, the National Parks Board  has\r\n\r\ncompleted 2 stretches of park connector along the Kallang River,\r\n\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a 6.8 km stretch linking the Central Catchment at\r\n\r\nUpper  Thomson  Road  and Bishan Park to  the  Jalan  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nsection of the PIE;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 2.0 km stretch from Serangoon Road to Kallang MRT\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Board is giving priority to build\r\n\r\nsegments  of  park  connectors to meet the  needs  of  residents\r\n\r\nliving  nearby.  Crossings  to  improve  the  continuous  access\r\n\r\nrequire greater detailed planning, design and co-ordination  and\r\n\r\nthese are being phased in gradually when feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Board will consider tunnels as well as\r\n\r\nother appropriate crossings for park connectors. The choice will\r\n\r\ndepend on the traffic conditions of the surrounding roads,  land\r\n\r\navailability  at  site and cost. The construction  of  the  park\r\n\r\nconnectors and crossings in built-up areas like those along  the\r\n\r\nKallang   River   is  further  complicated   by   the   existing\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and developments there. So far 2 crossings  have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed  along  the Kallang Park Connector,  namely  the\r\n\r\noverhead bridge at Braddell Road and the at-grade crossing along\r\n\r\nBishan Road. More will be done in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHILD ABUSE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment, in view of the fact that in half of all child abuse\r\n\r\ncases  where the perpetrators are mothers, if he will look  into\r\n\r\nthe causes and what can be done to protect potential victims.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many causes of child abuse and the father is as\r\n\r\nlikely as the mother to commit child abuse.  One cause of  child\r\n\r\nabuse  is the lack of parenting skills and the understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  child's  needs.   Another is conflict between  the  parents\r\n\r\nresulting in innocent children being used as punching bags.  Yet\r\n\r\nanother factor is the lack of bonding between the abusive parent\r\n\r\nand the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent education and family life education programmes are\r\n\r\ntherefore  essential.  MCD has since 1985 embarked on programmes\r\n\r\nto  promote  family well-being and to enhance parenting  skills.\r\n\r\nThe  parent  and  family life programmes provide information  on\r\n\r\nsupport services which individuals and families can turn to when\r\n\r\nin need of help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also promoting public awareness of family violence\r\n\r\nand   child  abuse  and  the  services  and  support  programmes\r\n\r\navailable.   Public education materials on family  violence  are\r\n\r\ndistributed  widely to professionals as well as  individuals  in\r\n\r\nthe community.  Talks and workshops on child abuse are conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  MCD as well as voluntary organisations with the support\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry.  Workshops on child abuse and family will also\r\n\r\nbe  conducted for staff of child care centres, kindergartens and\r\n\r\nschools.   Family service centres also provide support  services\r\n\r\nto  families  who  require  help.  All these  concerted  efforts\r\n\r\nprovide  a  wider coverage for detection of child abuse  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and provide support to families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also amending the Children and Young Persons Act to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  provisions  to get the cooperation  of  parents  and\r\n\r\nguardians in seeking treatment and help for themselves  and  the\r\n\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RAISING PROFESSIONALISM OF SOCIAL WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment   if   he   will   review   service   standards   by\r\n\r\nprofessionalising  social  workers  through   a   programme   of\r\n\r\naccreditation which will require mandatory training and  regular\r\n\r\nupgrading of required counselling and therapy skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of accreditation and registration of social\r\n\r\nworkers   has   been  studied  by  the  Ministry  of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (MCD) together with the Department of  Social  Work\r\n\r\nand  Psychology of the National University of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Association of Social Workers (SASW).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, we support the proposal to accredit and\r\n\r\nregister  not only social workers but also other human  services\r\n\r\nand  helping  professions  (such as family  counsellors,  family\r\n\r\ntherapists and others) and to raise their professionalism.   The\r\n\r\nissue  is how and when such a move should be implemented  as  it\r\n\r\nhas wide implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good number of people currently in social work do not\r\n\r\nhave social work qualifications.
