There is a sum of\r\n\r\n$11,700 provided for this post for the year  1960,\r\n\r\nwhereas  for  the  year  1959  provision  was  for\r\n\r\n$7,800.  I  have  searched throughout  the  Budget\r\n\r\nEstimates    for   the   pay   for    Confidential\r\n\r\nStenographers,  and I find that even  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$7,800 is high for a Confidential Stenographer  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the  pay  of  such  other  persons\r\n\r\nthroughout the various Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a substantial increase from $7,800 to\r\n\r\n$11,700. Could the Minister please explain why  it\r\n\r\nis  that  the  post, which is already more  highly\r\n\r\npaid   than   those  of  most  other  Confidential\r\n\r\nStenographers, needs such a substantial  increase\r\n\r\nfor 1960?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on the Head, Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\n\"Manager,  $24,000\". I understand that the  person\r\n\r\nwho  is  holding this appointment is also Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Central Provident Fund Board.  Under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  that  Ordinance  an  allowance  is\r\n\r\npayable  to  the Chairman. Could the Minister  say\r\n\r\nwhether  an allowance is, in fact, now being  paid\r\n\r\nto  the  Chairman  of the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nBoard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I must commend the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark   on   the  assiduity  with  which   he   has\r\n\r\nscrutinised the Estimates. What he said about  the\r\n\r\npay of Confidential Stenographers is substantially\r\n\r\ncorrect. The post against (iii) of item (1) of sub-head  58  is at present vacant, and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board has temporarily  loaned\r\n\r\nthe  services of an Executive Officer  (Secretary)\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Ministry  of National  Development.  To\r\n\r\nregularise the position in 1960, it is intended to\r\n\r\nsecond  to  the  Board an Executive  Officer  with\r\n\r\nexperience  in Government procedure and accounting\r\n\r\nto   relieve  the  Manager  of  his  more  routine\r\n\r\nfunctions,  and to assist the Office Assistant  in\r\n\r\nthe  administration of his office. The  provision,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  includes the salary of this  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer, a book-keeping allowance and his  pension\r\n\r\ncontributions  for the period of  his  secondment.\r\n\r\nThe  salary  will be about $8,000 per  annum,  the\r\n\r\nbook-keeping allowance will be $100 per month  (or\r\n\r\n$1,200  per  annum), and the pension contributions\r\n\r\nabout $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his second query, the answer is yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in  respect of what are known  as  Temporary\r\n\r\nStaff, an Executive Officer is being brought  into\r\n\r\nthat  section as a Permanent Officer, and  because\r\n\r\nof  his present emoluments, he has to be paid that\r\n\r\nsum of money set out in the 1960 Budget?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of Manager-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

When  a  manager  was\r\n\r\nappointed  to  this  Board,  a  large  amount   of\r\n\r\npublicity  was  given to this  appointment  and  a\r\n\r\nstatement  was made that a number of  things  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  done  and  achieved.  So  far,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we have heard nothing of the  doings  or\r\n\r\nthe  achievements of this Board.

The process of winding up will entail\r\n\r\na  considerable amount of work, such as finalising\r\n\r\nof   accounts,   making  lists   of   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities and, of course, there is a fair amount\r\n\r\nof  work  still  to  be done  in  connection  with\r\n\r\npreliminary  legislation setting up  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. As I said, it is not  expected\r\n\r\nthat  the  Industrial Promotion  Board  will  last\r\n\r\nthroughout  the whole of the year,  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthe  secondment of this officer to this post  will\r\n\r\nbe really for a duration of a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I proceed with the question on the\r\n\r\nManager?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could the Minister please inform the\r\n\r\nHouse  the  quantum of the allowance paid  to  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Central Provident Fund Board,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is desirable that he should  be  paid\r\n\r\nthese  two sums of money for the work which he  is\r\n\r\ndoing  probably  during the same working  time?

This expenditure did not include  such\r\n\r\nother  amenities like badminton courts, basketball\r\n\r\ncourts and indoor and outdoor lighting for each of\r\n\r\nthese community centres. It was not the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government to build medium-sized  or\r\n\r\nsmall  community centres, and it was  agreed  with\r\n\r\nthe  then  Rural Board in 1956 that the Department\r\n\r\nof  Social Welfare should build community  centres\r\n\r\nin  the  city  area only, leaving the rural  areas\r\n\r\nclear  for  the  Rural  Board  to  build  its  own\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rural Board built large and small community\r\n\r\ncentres,  but  in 1958 it decided  to  build  more\r\n\r\nsmall community centres throughout the rural areas\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. The following Rural Board Community\r\n\r\nCentres have now been taken over by the Department\r\n\r\nof Social Welfare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large Community Centres - Bukit Panjang Community\r\n\r\nCentre  (completed  in  1954),  the  Buona   Vista\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre (completed in 1956). I think  all\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition know  this  community\r\n\r\ncentre. It is a very lavish community centre  with\r\n\r\nbeautiful   parks  and  especially   designed   to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  middle class who  live  in  that\r\n\r\narea.

There\r\n\r\nwere  very few Malay activity instructors who were\r\n\r\nemployed.  There was also only one Malay community\r\n\r\ncentre in a predominantly Malay area, i.e. the one\r\n\r\nin Jalan Eunos, costing round about $28,000, which\r\n\r\nI  mentioned earlier. We have spent quite a lot of\r\n\r\ntime   touring   various  areas   in   the   Malay\r\n\r\nSettlements  in  the State which  could  serve  as\r\n\r\npossible  sites for community centres. We  visited\r\n\r\nthe  site  at Kaki Bukit, which could serve  as  a\r\n\r\nsite   for  a  community  centre.  We  have   also\r\n\r\nreorganised  the children's social centre  in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Farm.  That site is subject to floods  and,\r\n\r\nfor  that reason, we could not reconstruct  a  new\r\n\r\nbuilding  on  that  particular site.

There is one now being built at\r\n\r\nMinto  Road.  It is in a place where a  number  of\r\n\r\nhouses  have collapsed and the site is vacant.

After studying the appointment  of\r\n\r\na Magistrate in the Juvenile Court, I discussed it\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister.  I  did  not  make  a  proper\r\n\r\nstatement  just now and I express my  regrets  for\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile crime is a very serious problem. I think\r\n\r\na  young  magistrate  will be  in  a  much  better\r\n\r\nposition to understand the ways and thinking of  a\r\n\r\nyoung man than can an old magistrate. When a youth\r\n\r\ncommits  his first crime, and if we can treat  him\r\n\r\nproperly,   then   it  will  be   beneficial   and\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to  his future.  Our  view  of  this\r\n\r\nproblem  is  quite  different  from  that  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government. If we get a capable and  able\r\n\r\nMagistrate to deal with this problem and, further,\r\n\r\nif  he can understand and analyse the factors  and\r\n\r\nreasons  for  juvenile crime,  then  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be in a better position  to  solve\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  So  if we look into  this  problem\r\n\r\ncarefully  and seriously, it will be  solved  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in case I\r\n\r\nhave  been misunderstood, I just want to  make  it\r\n\r\nvery  clear  to  the hon. Member  that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nagainst the appointment. All I ask is whether  the\r\n\r\npost could be a voluntary one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  in their discussion  today  on  the\r\n\r\nparticular  items under the Head \"Social  Welfare\"\r\n\r\nMembers  tend to forget the fact that, because  of\r\n\r\nour  young  population,  the  problems  of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare in these times will not diminish but  will\r\n\r\nincrease. That is quite understandable, because we\r\n\r\nhave one of the highest population birth rates  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.  Also, many of the 300,000 people  who\r\n\r\nhave  registered  for Singapore  citizenship  came\r\n\r\nfrom  other countries where originally  they  were\r\n\r\nnot  trained in any skilled work. Having  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, many have now found themselves reaching\r\n\r\na  stage  where  they have to find some  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  May I quote an example? It  is  quite\r\n\r\npitiable  to  see in Queen Street many  old  women\r\n\r\nhawking  by the sides of the road. Their  husbands\r\n\r\nare  dead but their children must eat. So you  are\r\n\r\nleft with a class of old women who have now got to\r\n\r\nfend  for themselves. Women have a longer span  of\r\n\r\nlife  than  men. It is just like the drones  dying\r\n\r\nfaster than the bees. But what I would like to say\r\n\r\nis this: that social welfare covers all classes of\r\n\r\npeople and considerable assistance has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   to  this  class  of  people - widows   whose\r\n\r\nhusbands are not in Singapore or are dead and with\r\n\r\nchildren to take care of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delinquency has lately been on the increase,\r\n\r\nmainly  due  to  the fact that we  have  not  been\r\n\r\nprepared  for an upsurge in the numbers  of  those\r\n\r\nliving  in Singapore and, therefore, we  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  readjust our social conditions  to\r\n\r\nfind  employment for them. It is because  of  this\r\n\r\nreason  that  social welfare cannot be  considered\r\n\r\nsolely  in  terms of dishing out public assistance\r\n\r\nfunds.  In  this respect, the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law has done very well. He has explained  his\r\n\r\nidea   surrounding  community  centres  and  youth\r\n\r\nservice  centres. The point has been made that  we\r\n\r\nhave now appointed a full-time Magistrate for  the\r\n\r\nJuvenile Court. Of course, it is desirable that we\r\n\r\nshould  accept  any help which  is  being  offered\r\n\r\nvoluntarily.  But, unfortunately, as the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  pointed out, those who have come  forward  to\r\n\r\noffer  their  services have reached a stage  where\r\n\r\nthey  fail  to  appreciate the  problems  existing\r\n\r\ntoday.  And in a Juvenile Court, it is not helpful\r\n\r\nto a young boy or girl of about 10 or 12 years old\r\n\r\nto  have a man In his sixties or seventies quoting\r\n\r\nto  him the analects of Confucius on how to behave\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  when those trite sayings  are  quite\r\n\r\ndivorced from the hectic days of modern life.  For\r\n\r\na  young  magistrate to come forward and volunteer\r\n\r\nhis  services to serve in the Court would take  up\r\n\r\nmuch  of  his  time  and, therefore,  it  is  only\r\n\r\ncorrect  that  a  full-time Magistrate  should  be\r\n\r\nemployed to serve in the Juvenile Court.  We  have\r\n\r\nno quarrel about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important point which was brought forward in\r\n\r\nthe  discussion  was  that there  were  more  male\r\n\r\nprobation  officers than lady probation  officers.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Minister has pointed out, this is because\r\n\r\nfemales tend to be less delinquent than males.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, of course, poses a real problem, and I\r\n\r\nthink  the only solution to that would be for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  devise  a  method  by which  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nproduce  more  females! It  would  also  ease  the\r\n\r\nproblem of the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all in all, I would say that when we talk of\r\n\r\nsocial welfare assistance, we ought not to  do  so\r\n\r\nin  the  light  that we are giving  out  dole.  We\r\n\r\nappreciate  considerably the difficulties  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law - that he has  a  heavy\r\n\r\nregistration of unemployed in his Ministry and, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  having these claims  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance  for the unemployed compete with  those\r\n\r\nwho  suffer from disabilities. Perhaps the  public\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  could  ease his  problems  if  they\r\n\r\ngenuinely  seek  to  come forward,  mix  with  the\r\n\r\npeople  and try to understand their problem rather\r\n\r\nthan adopting an antagonistic attitude of:\r\n\r\n\"Why did we do this? Why did we not do that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men have a tendency to group together. Those who\r\n\r\ncollect  stamps  come  together.  Those  who  take\r\n\r\nphotographs  group together. That is because  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  common interest. In Western countries,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, even nudists group together.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  would like to say is this. If we wish  to\r\n\r\ncheck  juvenile delinquency, if we wish the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore to have a feeling that they belong to\r\n\r\na society, an opportunity must be given to them to\r\n\r\ncome  together,  and  that  opportunity  is  being\r\n\r\nprovided  for by the community centres, for  which\r\n\r\n$1 million has been provided for in the Estimates.\r\n\r\nThe  opportunity  is also given  to  them  by  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of sports centres and also other  youth\r\n\r\ncentres. It is our hope that these centres  should\r\n\r\nnot  be abused and that they should not become the\r\n\r\nfocal  point  of gangsterism. It has come  to  our\r\n\r\nknowledge that some of these centres have, in  the\r\n\r\npast,  become collecting points for youthful thugs\r\n\r\nwhere  they plan their operations. It is therefore\r\n\r\nright  that the Minister for Labour and Law should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  his attention on the organisation  of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it is quite all right if\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Deputy Prime Minister  touches  on\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in passing.

But  it is my feeling that if our  Assembly\r\n\r\nwomen,  including, of course, the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,  could come forward and organise  the\r\n\r\nwomen  of  Singapore, they will go a long  way  to\r\n\r\nhelping  us  stop  juvenile  delinquency.  It  has\r\n\r\nbecome  public knowledge that, of late, those  who\r\n\r\nhave  been involved in thuggery have not only been\r\n\r\nboys  but  they have also included girls,  who  in\r\n\r\nfact  are  the leaders of the gangs.  I  will  not\r\n\r\npretend  to  know anything about how  these  girls\r\n\r\nmanage  to  organise the men. I am quite  sure  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the psychology of the female  can\r\n\r\nbe better understood by our Assembly women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree\r\n\r\nwith the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister about  the\r\n\r\nwomen  of  Singapore coming out to  try  and  stop\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency. He calls upon the women  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, and I am glad he has  included  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, and has asked her to come forward  and\r\n\r\ndo  some  work to prevent juvenile delinquency.  I\r\n\r\nwish to inform him that I have been coming forward\r\n\r\nand  have been doing this for the last six  years.\r\n\r\nMy  present plan is this. We are going up  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. I do not know whether the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  knows that in the Federation  the  women\r\n\r\nare  very active in this type of work. They go  to\r\n\r\nthe  villages and kampongs attending to the  needs\r\n\r\nof  the  people and the children. We in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  not that experience. We have arranged to  go\r\n\r\nthere  in  January.

She  said  that the  youth  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is increasing and, therefore, the number\r\n\r\nof  Principal  Youth  Service Officers  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased.  I  do not mean she is wrong,  but  the\r\n\r\npoint  is  this.  The birth rate in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be  the highest in  the  world  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  certainly  the  youth  population   is\r\n\r\nincreasing. To reduce the birth rate is one thing,\r\n\r\nbut  to  increase  the number of  Principal  Youth\r\n\r\nService Officers is quite another thing. I believe\r\n\r\nshe  is a principal of a school and she will  know\r\n\r\nthat if there are 200 pupils and one principal  in\r\n\r\na  school, and if the pupils are increased to 400,\r\n\r\nit  does  not  mean that there is need  to  employ\r\n\r\nanother  principal. Therefore, I think  this  will\r\n\r\nprove  that,  although  the  youth  population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is increasing, it is not necessary  for\r\n\r\nus   to   employ  more  Principal  Youth   Service\r\n\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the\r\n\r\nbudget  for the Ministry of Labour and Law,  I  am\r\n\r\ntaking this opportunity to put forward this  point\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  assistance given  by  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare    Department - public   aid.    The    most\r\n\r\ninteresting  feature is that  concerning  a  blind\r\n\r\nperson who receives public aid. I understand  from\r\n\r\nthe  blind person himself that originally the  aid\r\n\r\nhe received from the Social Welfare Department was\r\n\r\nadequate.  It was a sum which enabled that  person\r\n\r\nto  satisfy his daily needs. But I am surprised to\r\n\r\ndiscover  that when the new Government  came  into\r\n\r\npower,  the  usual  aid of $25 which  he  used  to\r\n\r\nreceive was reduced to $5. This matter was brought\r\n\r\nto  the  attention of the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw.  I drew his attention as to how one can  live\r\n\r\nor  subsist on $5, if he is blind. This problem is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that of other persons who  receive\r\n\r\naid, like the unemployed persons who may be able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  find some other means of employment. But to  a\r\n\r\nblind  person  who cannot see, we  must  know  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties he is facing, unless he has a special\r\n\r\ntrade  or  skill. I am told that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law has drawn up a scheme to  aid  the\r\n\r\nblind, but until now there is no announcement that\r\n\r\nthe  scheme has been implemented, I hope  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  new scheme, the persons affected will not  be\r\n\r\nmade to suffer by receiving only $5 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, to which I would like\r\n\r\nto  draw the attention of this House, particularly\r\n\r\nthat  of the Minister for Labour and Law, is  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  wish  to encourage people  to  depend\r\n\r\nsolely on public aid for their living, and we also\r\n\r\nknow  that  aid for the unemployed is  given  from\r\n\r\npublic money. Therefore, we must draw up a plan so\r\n\r\nthat the really needy cases should receive aid. In\r\n\r\nthis  matter, I should like to draw the  attention\r\n\r\nof  the Government to those needy cases who should\r\n\r\nreceive Government aid and should be given help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote as an example the circumstances of the\r\n\r\nresidents  in  the Southern Islands.  They  are  a\r\n\r\nsection  of  the society of Singapore,  and  their\r\n\r\nposition  is different from that of their brethren\r\n\r\non  the Singapore mainland. It can be said that 98\r\n\r\nper  cent of them - excluding the residents of Pulau\r\n\r\nBrani  and  Pulau Bukom - depend for  their  living\r\n\r\nsolely on fishing. The problem of fishing is  very\r\n\r\nintricate  and  complex. For  that  reason,  these\r\n\r\nislanders  cannot  find an  alternative  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  except  fishing.  For  instance,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  become hawkers because they are  isolated.\r\n\r\nTheir  means of livelihood as fishermen will  fail\r\n\r\nif  they suffer ill-health. If they become  blind,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot go out to the sea, whether  at  night\r\n\r\ntime  or day time, because they are unable to see.\r\n\r\nIt  is  obvious  then  that  they  cannot  go  out\r\n\r\nfishing.  In such circumstances, this will  be  an\r\n\r\nobstacle  to  their earning a living.  Unlike  the\r\n\r\npeople  living in the City, if they are ill,  they\r\n\r\ncannot find employment. The people in the city can\r\n\r\nfind  other  ways and means of subsistence.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier,  the  islanders  depend  solely  on\r\n\r\nfishing for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir   means  of  livelihood.  For  that  reason,\r\n\r\nassistance to them is very essential. They must be\r\n\r\ngiven  special  priority. They  must  be  made  an\r\n\r\nexception to the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nstate at the outset that this Government has  been\r\n\r\nvery  generous  as  far  as public  assistance  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  When  we came in, we  found  that  the\r\n\r\namount  allotted  for  public  assistance  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government for this year was $5,500,000.\r\n\r\nThere  was no proper supervision kept of the funds\r\n\r\nthat  were  administered by the Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nSection  of my Ministry in the sense that we  have\r\n\r\non our registers about 22,000 people who are given\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  and there are  only  about  47\r\n\r\ninvestigators to look into the claims of those who\r\n\r\nrequire  assistance. You can realise, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat, with such a large number involved, and  with\r\n\r\nso  few  investigators, and because of  the  sheer\r\n\r\nweight  of numbers, it is very hard to keep  track\r\n\r\nof  how,  in  fact,  this  money  is  distributed.\r\n\r\nHowever, we knew that to be the position,  and  we\r\n\r\nalso  knew  that  there was quite  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount  of poverty in the State. For that  reason,\r\n\r\nwe asked for a supplementary provision to increase\r\n\r\nthe  vote  from $5.5 million to $6.7  million  for\r\n\r\nthis  year. In spite of the demands that are  made\r\n\r\non  this  Government  for  money  for  development\r\n\r\npurposes, we have nevertheless been able  to  push\r\n\r\nthe  provision for public assistance  even  higher\r\n\r\nfor  next year, so that, ever since we have formed\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the vote has increased from  $5.5\r\n\r\nmillion to $6.7 million, and for next year to $7.5\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the public for\r\n\r\ntheir   co-operation  in  the  matter  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance.  We  get a numbers  of  letters  daily\r\n\r\ncomplaining   that  the  sums  which   have   been\r\n\r\nappropriated for public assistance are being  mis-spent,  and  that there are people  in  very  good\r\n\r\ncircumstances who receive this public  assistance.\r\n\r\nA  check is made on every letter received,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould say that in 90 per cent of the cases the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation  that we have received is quite  true.\r\n\r\nWe  get  our investigators to go round and recheck\r\n\r\nthe  position  and stop the allowances  where  the\r\n\r\nreports are found to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been more and more people coming to us\r\n\r\nfor  assistance, and with the proper  distribution\r\n\r\nof this money, I think that with the money that is\r\n\r\nbeing  made  available by this Assembly  for  next\r\n\r\nyear, we will be able to carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also changed the rates of assistance. The\r\n\r\nhead  of  a  household used to get $15  per  month\r\n\r\npreviously. We have taken it up to $16 per  month.\r\n\r\nThe wife, as head of the household, used to get $8\r\n\r\nper month. We have taken it up to $10 per month. A\r\n\r\ndependent child, aged 16 and over, receives $8 per\r\n\r\nmonth - we  have not changed that rate. A  dependent\r\n\r\nchild  under 16 years receives $5 a month - we  have\r\n\r\nnot changed that rate. The maximum allowance for a\r\n\r\nhousehold has gone up from $87 to $90.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for the Southern Islands said\r\n\r\njust  now  that there were fishermen  in  indigent\r\n\r\ncircumstances in the Southern Islands.  There  was\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  a  blind man who  was  refused  any\r\n\r\nallowance. I think his information is not correct,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  approved an  additional  public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance for people who  are  totally\r\n\r\nblind, to people who are totally deaf and dumb, to\r\n\r\nthe crippled, and to those who have lost both arms\r\n\r\nor the right arm or lost both legs. So that people\r\n\r\nin  those  circumstances get, in addition  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance allowance at the  normal  rate,\r\n\r\nthis special disability allowance. We have stopped\r\n\r\nsickness  allowances. It was the practice  in  the\r\n\r\npast  for  anybody  who came to the  Ministry  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance to get, in addition  to  public\r\n\r\nassistance,   what  was  known   as   a   sickness\r\n\r\nallowance.  In  order to give  them  an  increased\r\n\r\nallowance,  the officers in this Ministry  decided\r\n\r\nthat persons making a demand for public assistance\r\n\r\nshould get this augmented allowance, an additional\r\n\r\nallowance  of  $16 on the grounds that  they  were\r\n\r\nsick, though there was nothing wrong with them. We\r\n\r\nhave stopped that. We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  stopped  the grant of public  assistance  to\r\n\r\nable-bodied  single persons. A lot of  people  who\r\n\r\nare  able-bodied and single were receiving  public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowances. We have stopped  this.  So\r\n\r\nthat  with the amount that we have voted for  next\r\n\r\nyear,  I think we can extend public assistance  to\r\n\r\nan increased number of people who are in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I want to add some more words to the\r\n\r\nsubject  of the Juvenile Magistrate which  Members\r\n\r\nhave raised. We know that different societies have\r\n\r\ndifferent methods of taking care of children.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  under the past Colonial government,  the\r\n\r\nwhitecollar  class was created in order  to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  Colonialists better. In the methods of taking\r\n\r\ncare of children, they did not do much. Under  the\r\n\r\npast  Government,  many films were  shown  in  the\r\n\r\ncinemas  which  were detrimental to the  children.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the rock `n roll films, we have  seen\r\n\r\nchildren imitating that kind of behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, someone told me that a boy of 14 years\r\n\r\nold  was  the leader of a secret society.  I  have\r\n\r\nsince  heard that this 14-year old youth has  been\r\n\r\narrested  and  taken into custody  in  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department. The juvenile delinquent  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  did not like to come out. He  wished  to\r\n\r\nlearn something in the Department and make himself\r\n\r\nuseful in society in the future. Therefore,  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  society  under a different  Government,\r\n\r\nthere  are  different methods  of  treating  these\r\n\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, if we have a capable magistrate\r\n\r\nwho can understand the behaviour and character  of\r\n\r\nthe  children and understand their problems,  that\r\n\r\nmagistrate  will  be  very useful  to  the  future\r\n\r\ncitizens  of this State. For example, recently  in\r\n\r\nmy  area,  during Loyalty Week, we assembled  many\r\n\r\norganisations to take part in Loyalty  Week.  When\r\n\r\nwe  were  celebrating our Loyalty Week,  we  found\r\n\r\nmany  children taking part in our programme.  They\r\n\r\nwere  from poor families. In the past, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir poverty, they were not taken care of by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Therefore, when they were five or  six\r\n\r\nyears  of  age, their cultural standard  was  very\r\n\r\nlow, and they did not know anything. And by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchance  they  became members of secret  societies.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  P.A.P. Government took over, under  the\r\n\r\ncapable  hands  of our Minister  for  Culture  and\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education, these children are  being\r\n\r\nguided by the new policies of this Government. The\r\n\r\nlittle   children   know  how  to   behave   well.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we say that if we want to tackle  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  it  is  not  enough  to  have  so-called\r\n\r\nvoluntary  service offered by retired officers  to\r\n\r\nact  as magistrates, because their opinion is old-fashioned and would not be practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, in the Social Welfare Department,\r\n\r\nunlike the Opposition who say that they cannot  do\r\n\r\nbetter  unless they have an increase  of  money - we\r\n\r\nhave to adopt a method which is good, for example,\r\n\r\nan  educational  method by which to  educate  them\r\n\r\nabout  the kind of society they are living in,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  try  their  best  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we had better go\r\n\r\ninto  specific lanes, otherwise the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  might  be  lost  in  a  sea   of\r\n\r\narguments.  Perhaps we could now deal with  public\r\n\r\nassistance  and  complete  that  subject.

In  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries  such  as  Japan and  America,  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency  may  still  be  a  problem,  but   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  it is not so great. We, the Government,\r\n\r\nmust  prevent  juvenile delinquency  from  getting\r\n\r\nworse.  Although  there is  a  Juvenile  Court  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the magistrates presiding therein  give\r\n\r\ntheir  services without pay. But they do not  know\r\n\r\nthe   problems   and  causes  of   this   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  Therefore, at the present  time,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  many juvenile delinquents.  So  we  must\r\n\r\nappoint  a  magistrate who is well experienced  in\r\n\r\nthe behaviour and problems of the young criminals,\r\n\r\nand knows what causes them to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten asked why we\r\n\r\nshould   use   public  money   to   appoint   this\r\n\r\nmagistrate. Our Government is trying its  best  to\r\n\r\neconomise  in  every respect, but for  a  Juvenile\r\n\r\nCourt it is useless to have the voluntary services\r\n\r\nof  a  magistrate.  We  must appoint  a  full-time\r\n\r\nmagistrate and pay him. Therefore, we must appoint\r\n\r\nan  experienced magistrate. He must be well  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  juvenile delinquents' hobbies  and  their\r\n\r\nlikes and dislikes in order to lead them into good\r\n\r\nchannels. Now, since we are able to appoint a full-time magistrate with pay, we must do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much has\r\n\r\nbeen debated today on juvenile delinquents. But  I\r\n\r\nnoticed   everybody  was  talking   about   curing\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency.  Sir,  the  problem  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent it. That is more important than curing it.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be no need to cure that sickness,  or\r\n\r\ndisease as it was called, if it is prevented right\r\n\r\nfrom  the beginning. What is the cause of juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents? The Minister for Labour and  Law  has\r\n\r\nrightly    tackled    the   problem    from    one\r\n\r\nangle - community activities and youth organisations\r\n\r\nto  occupy their leisure hours. But I say that  is\r\n\r\nnot sufficient. I believe that the root of all  of\r\n\r\nthis    delinquency   lies    in    the    adult's\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of the young people. A  child  is\r\n\r\nnot  born  a delinquent. He becomes one.  And  why\r\n\r\ndoes  he become one? When he has no confidence  in\r\n\r\nhimself. And he cannot have confidence in  himself\r\n\r\nif  his  own parents do not understand him.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that, apart from community  activities\r\n\r\nand  youth  organisations, adult education  should\r\n\r\npenetrate  into the slum areas and villages  where\r\n\r\nparents  and  old  people only  know  one  way  of\r\n\r\nlife - that of their ancestors - and their children go\r\n\r\nto   school  and  learn  all  sorts  of  ways   of\r\n\r\nlife - Western    ways   and   of   the    different\r\n\r\npeople's - and these children come back  with  these\r\n\r\nideas  which are not understood by their  parents.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  cannot reconcile  their  way  of\r\n\r\nliving  with the way that their parents want  them\r\n\r\nto  live.  If they are not confident and  have  no\r\n\r\nconfidence in their own parents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nthey  turn  to  other sources  and  sometimes,  as\r\n\r\nusually  happens, the bad hats,  who  try  to  get\r\n\r\nthese  young people in with them, will pretend  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  them.

As far\r\n\r\nas labour legislation is concerned, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to  appeal to the Australian Commissioner  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to assist us to get a legal officer  who\r\n\r\nis  an  expert in labour problems to come here  to\r\n\r\nassist  us. Through his intervention we have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful   in  getting  Mr  Weston,   a   legal\r\n\r\ndraftsman in the Labour Ministry in Australia,  to\r\n\r\nbe  here  to  assist  us in  drafting  new  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation  which will be introduced  later  this\r\n\r\nyear.

I think that was  a\r\n\r\nsubject  raised  by  the Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nyesterday.  He wanted to know what steps  we  were\r\n\r\ntaking to enforce the income tax legislation.  One\r\n\r\nway of enforcing it is to get an experienced legal\r\n\r\nofficer in income tax matters to assist us in that\r\n\r\nwork. These are the legal officers we require. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we have advertised these posts  both  in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom and locally. So far we have not\r\n\r\nhad  any  response from our advertisement  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom.

As  Members  know,  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  vehicles are not  insured,  and  costs\r\n\r\narise  by  way of legal representation when  there\r\n\r\nare appeals in criminal cases to the Privy Council\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is  necessary  for  Government  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented in those appeals. We have had  claims.\r\n\r\nI   have   got  a  list  of  claims  here  against\r\n\r\nGovernment  from  1958.  There  was  a  claim  for\r\n\r\ndamages in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect  of  a  collision between a sampan  and  a\r\n\r\nMaster   Attendant's  motor   launch   for   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  ordered to pay damages  of  $900.\r\n\r\nThen there was an accident in which a citizen  was\r\n\r\ninjured  by a P.W.D. lorry and the damages awarded\r\n\r\nin that case came to $5,000. There was a case of a\r\n\r\ncitizen who was wrongfully arrested by a detective\r\n\r\nin  Joo  Chiat Police Station. The damages awarded\r\n\r\nwere $300. And there was the famous Chew Swee  Kee\r\n\r\ncase, where the Government have had to incur costs\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  representation on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax in the inquiry into  Mr\r\n\r\nChew Swee Kee's banking account. They amounted  to\r\n\r\n$3,040.50. In view of the fact that Mr Chew  Swee\r\n\r\nKee  has since renounced his citizenship and  left\r\n\r\nthis  country, I think we should make some attempt\r\n\r\nto  get  him  to pay for those legal  costs.  Then\r\n\r\nthere  were  costs  arising  out  of  damages  for\r\n\r\ntrespass,  unlawful arrest and unlawful  detention\r\n\r\nby a detective constable. They came to $750. There\r\n\r\nwas  a claim brought by the dependants of a P.W.D.\r\n\r\nlabourer  in  respect  of a  fatal  accident.  The\r\n\r\ndamages  awarded  were $13,000. There  were  other\r\n\r\nsmall   damages  that  have  arisen  out  of   the\r\n\r\nnegligence  of the serangs in Government  launches\r\n\r\nand the cost of an appeal to the Privy Council, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  total  amount that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nsustained  up  to  date  by  way  of  damages   is\r\n\r\n$25,953.05.  Hitherto it was the practice  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  these damages, as and when they were awarded,\r\n\r\nfrom  a miscellaneous vote under O.C.S.E. In  view\r\n\r\nof  the  fact  that  this is  a  commitment  which\r\n\r\nGovernment  is expected to incur annually,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  that  for next year a  sum  of  $20,000\r\n\r\nshould be voted for this purpose, from which  all,\r\n\r\nclaims for damages against Government can be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation by the\r\n\r\nMinister,  may  I be given leave to withdraw,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $446,500 for Head 38 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 40 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (4) of sub-head 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refers, Sir, to the appointment of a\r\n\r\nPublicity Liaison Secretary (Political) at  $1,400\r\n\r\nper month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon.

I quote from the Singapore Annual Report\r\n\r\n1957, page 256:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The definite need\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is for civic education of the masses -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"was created by the Singapore Citizenship Law\r\n\r\nwhich  brought  the great majority  of  the  adult\r\n\r\npopulation  into the political life of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand   the   Local  Government  Legislation   which\r\n\r\nexpanded  the  local  government  electorate   and\r\n\r\nintroduced elections for the first time into local\r\n\r\ngovernment in the rural areas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"With the passing of legislation for the first\r\n\r\nelected Councils in the rural areas, emphasis  was\r\n\r\nplaced at first on groups from the rural areas for\r\n\r\nwhom  the centralised administration had been  too\r\n\r\ndistant a factor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  civic courses, again according to the  Annual\r\n\r\nReport,  included  interviews with  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers, which probably explains  why\r\n\r\nall   but  one  of  the  Ministers  and  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters of the former government failed  to  get\r\n\r\nre-elected.  I am not blaming them for  organising\r\n\r\nthese civic courses with the election in view, but\r\n\r\nwhat I am blaming them for is for having failed to\r\n\r\nachieve their objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 a sum of $5,200 was voted for transport,\r\n\r\nand  $6,500 for meals. If you remember,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nyear 1957 was also the year when the City Council\r\n\r\nElections were in the offing, and it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally believed that the P.A.P. would stand for\r\n\r\nelection. It did and swept the polls. So in  1958,\r\n\r\nthe  amount  provided for transport was  increased\r\n\r\nfrom $5,200 to $9,600, and the vote for meals  was\r\n\r\nincreased  from $6,500 to $12,400. In  1959,  with\r\n\r\nthe   general  elections  pending,  there  was   a\r\n\r\nprovision of $12,450 for transport and $12,050 for\r\n\r\nmeals. Well, that was the rather humble origin  of\r\n\r\nthe  civics programmes which we inherited  and  we\r\n\r\ndecided  that the Civics Programmes could be  used\r\n\r\nfor  different  purposes, because we  quite  agree\r\n\r\nthat  these civic courses are quite useful. It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  ordinary people should  get  some\r\n\r\nidea  of how democracy functions, how a government\r\n\r\nworks.  Where  the visitors involved are  farmers,\r\n\r\ntrishaw  riders  or hawkers, it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprovide  transport to bring them  from  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  and to take them around and show  them  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government institutions and  other  civic\r\n\r\ncentres.   Since   we  took   over,   we   decided\r\n\r\ntemporarily  to halt these civic courses  because,\r\n\r\nas  I  indicated,  they were  designed  for  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent purposes. The courses were not  so  much\r\n\r\ninstructive as primarily propagandistic in nature.\r\n\r\nSo  it is the intention of the Government to start\r\n\r\nthese courses next year along lines which we  hope\r\n\r\nwill  be  interesting and profitable to those  who\r\n\r\nparticipate  in them. In fact, we do  not  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  civic courses should consist in  press-ganging  a  few people and herding them  into  the\r\n\r\noffices of Ministers and Assistant Ministers.  The\r\n\r\ncourses  should  be  of  a wider  scope  with  the\r\n\r\nprimary  intention of ensuring that people  get  a\r\n\r\nclear  idea of what we mean when we say, \"This  is\r\n\r\ndemocracy - a  government  of  the  people,  by  the\r\n\r\npeople\" - they   should  have   real   meaning   and\r\n\r\nsubstance.  Such  courses should be  organised  by\r\n\r\npeople who know how to conduct civic courses,  how\r\n\r\nto  organise publicity. Unfortunately,  under  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government,  this  task,  I  think  very\r\n\r\nunfairly,  was  pushed  on  to  the  shoulders  of\r\n\r\nofficers  who were not trained to conduct  civics.\r\n\r\nWith the reorganisation and the setting up of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture, we hope  we  can  organise\r\n\r\nbetter and more objective types of civic courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture is worried why I am not interested in  his\r\n\r\ngenuinely  cultural activities. That is because  I\r\n\r\nam  confident  that  all sorts  of  cultures  will\r\n\r\nthrive  under his Ministry, except yellow culture,\r\n\r\nwhich he will eliminate. Being so confident in his\r\n\r\nability  to deal with culture in all its  aspects,\r\n\r\nwe  felt  that  there was no  need  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of culture with a capital \"K\". But  when\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of his Ministry has been  designed  to\r\n\r\nbring culture and propaganda throughout Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  when  there are various items under the  sub-heads   set  out  under  his  Ministry   to   take\r\n\r\npropaganda  to the people, it seems an  odd  thing\r\n\r\nthat in the Civics Programmes, meals and transport\r\n\r\nshould  have  crept in. He spoke  at  length,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, about the previous government. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in  what the previous  government\r\n\r\ndid. I am interested in what his Ministry is going\r\n\r\nto  do  in the matter of Civics Programmes in  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming  year. And I want to  know  why  these\r\n\r\nmeals  are  to be provided. He has not  given  any\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  answer. And what  is  the  need  for\r\n\r\ntransport? Does he mean to say that the people who\r\n\r\nwant  to take advantage of these civics programmes\r\n\r\nmust  be sent for either in taxis or trishaws;  or\r\n\r\nshould pool transport be sent across to fetch them\r\n\r\nto  see  the Pasir Panjang Power Station? Is  that\r\n\r\nthe idea? I see that if the horse does not want to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the water, the Minister wants to take  the\r\n\r\nwater to the horse!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not a question of trying to\r\n\r\nbring  the horse to the water or the water to  the\r\n\r\nhorse.  It is a simple physical problem of how  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  people to Government.  The  Government\r\n\r\norganises  and provides transport in  cases  where\r\n\r\nschool  children, farmers and so on might like  to\r\n\r\nvisit  Government departments not  as  individuals\r\n\r\nbut  as groups. It is true that Government invites\r\n\r\npeople  to  come and visit these places.  In  many\r\n\r\nother  countries, groups of people are invited  as\r\n\r\nGovernment  guests  to  come  and  see   how   the\r\n\r\nMinistries  function; in our case, we like  people\r\n\r\nto know how the Pasir Panjang Power Station is run\r\n\r\nand how the Opposition conducts itself during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebates  in  this  Assembly. So there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nsinister  or  unusual in this  sort  of  organised\r\n\r\ntours.  In fact, one of the plans that we have  in\r\n\r\nmind  is  to organise launch tours for people  who\r\n\r\nhave  only seen the Island from the land-ward side\r\n\r\nand who have never seen it from the sea, which  is\r\n\r\nour lifeblood. We want people to see how Singapore\r\n\r\nlives  off the sea and how it looks from the  sea.\r\n\r\nIf  we are bringing large groups of people for the\r\n\r\nwhole day - because these tours do not last an  hour\r\n\r\nor  so, they generally last a whole day - we see  no\r\n\r\nreason why we should not provide such amenities as\r\n\r\nfood  and refreshments, since they are our  guests\r\n\r\nand  we are their hosts. I think there is no  harm\r\n\r\nin  extending the ordinary courtesies of providing\r\n\r\nthem  with refreshments and possibly a meal.  That\r\n\r\nis  the reason why we have appropriated a not very\r\n\r\nexorbitant sum to provide tours for groups  of  25\r\n\r\npeople with free lunch, tea and transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on the last\r\n\r\nremark made by the Member for Farrer Park, I would\r\n\r\nlike to say that the P.A.P., unlike the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park,  is not in the habit of  associating\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore with horses. The only time\r\n\r\nwhen  that is done is when on race days we find  a\r\n\r\nfew  people like the Member for Farrer Park  going\r\n\r\nto Bukit Timah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajah?

However,  that  is beside  the  point,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  The  idea  of the  Ministry  wishing  to\r\n\r\nprovide  hospitality and be the hospitable host - in\r\n\r\nthe same way that the Prime Minister also wants to\r\n\r\nprovide hospitality to the V.I.P.s - is a good  one,\r\n\r\nand  touches my heart.

The  previous  Government\r\n\r\nattempted  but failed to make films. In 1956,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allocated $40,000 for films  but  spent\r\n\r\nonly  $14,000 of it. In 1957, obviously they  lost\r\n\r\ninterest  in making films. The sum voted  was  cut\r\n\r\ndown  to  $25,000 and only $11,000 worth of  films\r\n\r\nwere made. In 1958, there was a sudden interest in\r\n\r\nfilms when, as you will remember, Sir, there  were\r\n\r\nrumours  of impending elections. Strangely enough,\r\n\r\nof  the  $30,000 allocated, $27,000 was  spent  on\r\n\r\nmaking  films. I may incidentally state here  that\r\n\r\nmost of these films never had a long run. They had\r\n\r\na  very  brief  existence and were withdrawn  very\r\n\r\nrapidly.  The people lost interest and  the  films\r\n\r\nare lying in the archives. I suggested to my Field\r\n\r\nSection  whether we should not show some of  these\r\n\r\nfilms  and they said, \"No. Generally, one  of  the\r\n\r\npurposes of these films used by the Film  Unit  is\r\n\r\nto  draw  a  crowd  so that you  can,  apart  from\r\n\r\nshowing them, put over other things as well!\"  And\r\n\r\nthey also said, \"By showing these films, even  the\r\n\r\nfew curious onlookers who gather around the Public\r\n\r\nInformation Services' vans generally melt away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in 1959, which again was a very significant\r\n\r\nyear, Sir, there was considerable activity in  the\r\n\r\nfilm  industry. Because the money appeared  to  be\r\n\r\ninsufficient,  $7,500  was transferred  from  some\r\n\r\nother  Head  and  another $21,000 was  transferred\r\n\r\nunder Treasury Warrant No. 178/59. In all, $58,000\r\n\r\nwas spent within the first six months of last year\r\n\r\nwhen originally the vote was for $30,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government is also interested in\r\n\r\nfilms  but  fortunately we have ideas, unlike  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  which  failed  to  influence\r\n\r\npeople and win friends primarily because the chief\r\n\r\nactors  and  the supporting cast and the  scenario\r\n\r\nwere  not such as would make a hit or a box-office\r\n\r\ndraw. Sir, we have made three films within the six\r\n\r\nmonths that we have been in office. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether   the   Members  of  the  Opposition   are\r\n\r\ninterested in films to the extent of going to  see\r\n\r\nthem or they are just asking questions but if they\r\n\r\nhad gone to the theatres during Loyalty Week, they\r\n\r\nwould  have seen a film entitled Forward With  The\r\n\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of deference to modesty, I shall quote a\r\n\r\nreview in the Straits Times of this film. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A film produced by the Ministry of Culture,\r\n\r\nwhich is different from previous films designed to\r\n\r\nshow  the  Government at work, was given  a  Press\r\n\r\npreview today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward With The People...is aptly named, for it\r\n\r\nbrings  the Government before the people and  puts\r\n\r\nthe   people  very  much  in  picture   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And it goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"While past films of this nature had been focused\r\n\r\non  the VIP's who ran the Government, Forward With\r\n\r\nThe  People  is  filled with  scenes  of  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens - the masses who cheered the Government  at\r\n\r\ntheir  first post-election appearance on the  City\r\n\r\nHall  steps,  with thousands who  changkolled  and\r\n\r\nmoved  earth, shoulder to shoulder with  Ministers\r\n\r\nto   help  build  a  new  promenade  along  Nicoll\r\n\r\nHighway,  and  the  mothers  and  babies  at   the\r\n\r\nhospital  being  attended to  with  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is very much a film about how a large part of\r\n\r\nSingapore lives, of the problems they have and the\r\n\r\nactive  roles  they are playing in  helping  solve\r\n\r\nthese problems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Minister give the date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. 2nd December, 1959. So,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, we therefore intend to make more\r\n\r\nfilms  because we believe that films are important\r\n\r\nmedia  of  information  and instruction  and  that\r\n\r\ndemocratic institutions can be sustained only by a\r\n\r\nwell-informed  and  inspired public  opinion.  The\r\n\r\nfilm  is,  therefore,  a  powerful  ally  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect and that is why we have allocated a sum of\r\n\r\n$100,000  for  next year. This  is  a  modest  sum\r\n\r\ncompared   with  what  the  Federation  Government\r\n\r\nspends  on films - it is about a tenth of  what  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government spends on films - and  is  not\r\n\r\nfar  below what the last Government spent  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of 1959. But unlike our predecessors,\r\n\r\nwe  intend  to  make full use of the  $100,000  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the people will have an understanding\r\n\r\nof  what democracy is, what good government is. If\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members are interested,  we  have\r\n\r\nalso  commissioned a film in colour to  cover  the\r\n\r\nhistoric events of Loyalty Week, and when we  have\r\n\r\nour  preview  I  shall  take  the  precaution   of\r\n\r\ninviting Members of the Opposition to come and see\r\n\r\nthe film.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to continue with the speech\r\n\r\nmade by the Minister for Culture, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  Field Section of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture has shown three or four films every  night\r\n\r\nin   several  areas  throughout  the  Island.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  feel that the amount  provided  under\r\n\r\nthis  sub-head  is  less than  what  is  required.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Minister for Culture is aware that we\r\n\r\ncannot  get all that we want, because we all  know\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a shortage of funds  due  to  our\r\n\r\nhaving been bequeathed by the past Government with\r\n\r\nan empty coffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The films shown by the Field Section of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture form a greater part  of  the\r\n\r\nfilms  bought from the Malayan Film Unit and  also\r\n\r\nloans   from   other  departments  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Mr Speaker, such films are not of good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality from the educational and nationalist point\r\n\r\nof  view.

Most of this money  will\r\n\r\nbe  spent  on  open-air  concerts  which  will  be\r\n\r\nstepped  up. Initially we started with  about  one\r\n\r\nopen-air concert a week. Our intention is to build\r\n\r\nenough  small  theatres - apart  from  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre we have in mind - all over the island and be\r\n\r\nable  to encourage concerts to be produced locally\r\n\r\nin certain areas. We can not only bring troupes or\r\n\r\nperformers to particular areas, but we also  hope,\r\n\r\nas   a  result  of  that,  that  people  will   be\r\n\r\nstimulated  enough to set up their own  shows,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  had  a very good  example  during\r\n\r\nNational  Loyalty Week. We requested  schools  and\r\n\r\ncommunity centres to provide their own shows,  and\r\n\r\nsomething  like 200 concerts were put  up.  During\r\n\r\nthat  one  week, it was shown that, if  given  the\r\n\r\nnecessary    encouragement,    stimulation     and\r\n\r\nfacilities,   people   would   spend   more   time\r\n\r\ncultivating culture, if you like, and so  much  of\r\n\r\nthis money would be spent on open-air concerts and\r\n\r\nproviding facilities for people who might want  to\r\n\r\nput up a show. For example, a school might want to\r\n\r\nput  on  a show for our open-air concert and  they\r\n\r\nmight  say: \"We can put up a nice show but  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  enough money to make uniforms\".  So  we\r\n\r\nmight assist them in that direction. That will  be\r\n\r\nthe  principal  function  of  this  promotion   of\r\n\r\nculture.  It  will  also be  spent  on,  we  hope,\r\n\r\nsponsorship  of  cultural  programmes,   such   as\r\n\r\ncourses of lectures over the Radio and so  on.  We\r\n\r\nhope  to  organise perhaps an arts  festival  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  and to help disseminate  books  by\r\n\r\nproviding   little   libraries   all   over    the\r\n\r\nplace - providing  books and manuscripts  for  them.\r\n\r\nThe  items  cannot be foreseen in any detail.

It  will\r\n\r\nbe  of  more use than if the theatre is built  for\r\n\r\nthe sake of having a theatre on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing he mentioned was the giving of\r\n\r\nmoney to schools and associations, or whatever  it\r\n\r\nis,  to  make  costumes. Could I  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture that, just as the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhave  a  department for films, the Ministry should\r\n\r\nalso have a department for costumes? The making of\r\n\r\ncostumes is a very costly affair. It is a waste of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  give  the  money away  to  schools  and\r\n\r\nassociations to make costumes if they do not  have\r\n\r\nthe  proper facilities for looking after them.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Culture could have a  department\r\n\r\nfor   costumes,   it   will   help   schools   and\r\n\r\nassociations,  for  they will be  able  to  borrow\r\n\r\nexpensive and well-looked after costumes from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture.

As far as Singapore is concerned, any paper\r\n\r\nis  free  to publish, write and print anything  it\r\n\r\nlikes  within the framework of the law. Where  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper exceeds the bounds of fair criticism and\r\n\r\nverges  on  sedition, then it must bear  the  full\r\n\r\nconsequences of the Jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know whether the hon. Member meant to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the newspapers are under a  threat  and\r\n\r\nthat the Minister for Culture summons editors from\r\n\r\ntime  to time, cracks the whip, twists their  arms\r\n\r\nand  sends  them  back to the editorial  chair  to\r\n\r\nwrite as he dictates they should write. I am quite\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir,  that if - I do not know whether  it  is\r\n\r\npermissible - the Member for Tanglin  would  cast  a\r\n\r\nquick glance up the gallery, he would see that the\r\n\r\nPress  are  quite  happy!  They  are  taking  down\r\n\r\neverything  I am saying and I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nbefore 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  11  o'clock  tonight they will not  receive  a\r\n\r\nsingle  telephone call from me.  They  will  write\r\n\r\ntheir report as they think fit, both of what I say\r\n\r\nand  what  the Member for Tanglin has  said.  They\r\n\r\nwill  select those portions which they  think  are\r\n\r\nworth  printing  from  both  our  statements   and\r\n\r\npublish them. Certainly, it is part of the duty of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry to make contacts with the Press. Very\r\n\r\noften, as I can quite well remember when I  was  a\r\n\r\nnewspaperman,  various  politicians  ring  up  the\r\n\r\nPress to plead for a particular cause, or ask  the\r\n\r\njournalists whether they could either play  up  or\r\n\r\nplay down an item. In the same way, the Government\r\n\r\nis perfectly entitled to lodge a complaint against\r\n\r\nany  newspaper, to make a plea to any  journalist,\r\n\r\nor  even  commend him for having written something\r\n\r\nwhich has caught the fancy of the Government or an\r\n\r\nindividual. In that sense - and almost daily I  meet\r\n\r\njournalists and editors - I do raise objections if I\r\n\r\nfeel  that a particular report is not fair or  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  part of the sentence has been left  out.\r\n\r\nTo  that  extent I certainly do make my objections\r\n\r\nquite  plain to any reporter or newspaper  editor.\r\n\r\nFreedom  of speech includes the freedom to express\r\n\r\nyour views on any matter about the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Tanglin was\r\n\r\ntrying  to insinuate that there is restriction  on\r\n\r\nthe freedom of the Press, which was, if I remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  one  of the lines  taken  by  him  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  by  many of his colleagues  before  the\r\n\r\nelections,  with the result that one newspaper  in\r\n\r\npremature anxiety fled across the causeway, but is\r\n\r\nnow, I think, not quite sure whether it should not\r\n\r\nhave  stayed in Singapore in the first  place.  So\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin should bring out  specific\r\n\r\ninstances  instead of just fishing around  in  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  I might say something which  could  be\r\n\r\nconstrued as interference with the freedom of  the\r\n\r\nPress.  As  far  as  I know, I  have  pleaded  and\r\n\r\nintervened with the Press on behalf of Government,\r\n\r\nbut  I have certainly never gone to the extent  of\r\n\r\nintimidating  or threatening the Press  with  dire\r\n\r\nconsequences,   unless   they   themselves    have\r\n\r\ntransgressed  the law.

I notice the language as used  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  staff of Radio  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle unusual. I hope the Minister concerned will\r\n\r\ngive  this  his consideration. I do not  say  that\r\n\r\nthere is anything wrong with the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, there are many\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the creation of culture,  which  is\r\n\r\nour  objective. I am not quite sure whether it  is\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the Ministry of Culture that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  like anything Western, and therefore  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  we wish to create a culture free from  any\r\n\r\nforeign  influence whatsoever. I hope,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  if  it is so, the Minister for Culture  will\r\n\r\nclarify where it is to be found in his programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the subject of creating a Malayan\r\n\r\nculture,  especially  on  the  subject  of  `Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage', `History of Singapore' and so  on  over\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore, is there any plan to explain  to\r\n\r\nlisteners  what  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nexplained  clearly,  that his  Ministry  does  not\r\n\r\nagree  wih the Communist policy? If there  is  any\r\n\r\nprogramme about the Government attitude being anti-Communist, I hope this will be explained fully  in\r\n\r\nthe  broadcasts  of  the Malay  section  of  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  are really longing for  a  culture\r\n\r\nthat is truly Malayan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, my\r\n\r\napologies  first of all to the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan because I am unable to follow the  trend\r\n\r\nof  what is intended by him. But, inter alia,  the\r\n\r\nMember  said that he felt concerned, or  something\r\n\r\nlike  that,  because on the subject of culture  he\r\n\r\nsaid the vote allocated was too much. The vote for\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture was not too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh. Secondly, he is prepared to compromise  with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Culture  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\ncreating   a  culture  with  a  Malayan   outlook.\r\n\r\nFurther,  he said he was most concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language, as used when the news  items  are\r\n\r\nread over Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to tell him that the vote\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  budget  for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture,  as I said earlier on, is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nWith  this limited provision we cannot fulfil  our\r\n\r\nprogramme 100 per cent for the people, in order to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  promote culture  as  we  would  have\r\n\r\nliked.  But we must be thankful because the P.A.P.\r\n\r\naims  to  restore culture which has  been  extinct\r\n\r\nover  140  years of Colonial rule and to create  a\r\n\r\nnew  culture  which will be Malayan  in  form  and\r\n\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, concerning the news items mentioned by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I am quite\r\n\r\nsure  that  Radio  Singapore  reporters  and  news\r\n\r\neditors - including   Malay,  Tamil,   English   and\r\n\r\nChinese - compile   the   news   which    is    then\r\n\r\ndisseminated and the translation is  done  by  the\r\n\r\nannouncers themselves who read the news  items.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  the language spoken in the Malay Section  is\r\n\r\nMalay  language. Here, I wish to ask other Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition, or the Member who spoke  just\r\n\r\nnow,  whether  he  understood  what  is  the  real\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  culture? Why is it necessary  that  a\r\n\r\ncommon culture should be created in the view of  a\r\n\r\ncountry which is heading for progress? What is the\r\n\r\nresult if the culture is not nurtured with healthy\r\n\r\nelements? I think, Mr Speaker, some of  them  did\r\n\r\nnot know the answers to these questions. Why I say\r\n\r\nthey do not understand is because it did not occur\r\n\r\nto  the past Government at all that culture was  a\r\n\r\nvital  element  for the people  in  a  progressive\r\n\r\ncountry.  If  culture is allowed  to  deteriorate,\r\n\r\nthus  making  it possible for damaging  influences\r\n\r\nsuch  as  `yellow' dances and rock-n-roll to  gain\r\n\r\nfull sway, then the result is that the moral well-being of the people will suffer. If our moral well-being   is  damaged,  then  peace  will  also   be\r\n\r\ndisturbed,  which  will result eventually  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment being weakened and lead consequently to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  Members of the  Assembly  becoming\r\n\r\nrobbers and gangsters. It is the aim of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto avoid the incidents which I mentioned just now.\r\n\r\nTherefore this Government is determined to set  up\r\n\r\na  Ministry  of  Culture whose aim is  to  restore\r\n\r\noriginal  cultural  values and  a  more  important\r\n\r\nfactor  is  to  unite the peoples of  this  multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other programmes for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture, but these will take time to implement\r\n\r\nbecause  of  limited votes and an  empty  treasury\r\n\r\nwhich was bequeathed to us by the past Government.\r\n\r\nOne  of  our  programmes is to unite  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities by the creation of a language. I  need\r\n\r\nnot  dwell  further on the ways and  means  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  I think it will be better  if  these\r\n\r\ndetails  are given by the Minister himself.  Also,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, during the six months that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas   come   into   power,  we  have   made   many\r\n\r\nimprovements as far as culture is concerned  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  neglected by the past  Government.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  have inaugurated  the  Aneka  Ragam\r\n\r\nRa'ayat  in  an effort to try to unite the  people\r\n\r\nthrough  the radio and other media. I  think  this\r\n\r\nwill  satisfactorily answer the queries  asked  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kembangan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Radio Singapore, I am sure the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kembangan  is  not  following\r\n\r\nclosely  its broadcasts. However, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  for  the  benefit of the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  that  the  Chinese  Section  of   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore has started a special programme on Malay\r\n\r\nlessons,  on  Malayan culture, on  definitions  in\r\n\r\nMalay,  and  I  have personally listened  to  this\r\n\r\nprogramme. Similarly, in the Tamil section,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  special programme set aside for  the  items\r\n\r\nwhich  I  mentioned just now, with the  object  of\r\n\r\nestablishing a Malayan nation. I hope I have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  give some explanation to the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan and that he now understands  the\r\n\r\nsteps that we have taken in that direction and the\r\n\r\nmeans at our disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

What I said\r\n\r\nin  this  House  regarding  the  news  from  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  Malay  concerns  sittings  of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. That is what I was directing\r\n\r\nmy  query  to. It seems that the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwent  beating about the bush and went astray  from\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar to Changi! I say here that I did not\r\n\r\nwish  to  make  a hue and cry about this.  He  has\r\n\r\naccused me of not having listened to the radio.  I\r\n\r\nhave one radio and I cannot tune to all programmes\r\n\r\nat  once.  So  I  cannot listen to  all  the  four\r\n\r\nlanguages  at one time. I am sure the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson has got many radios, so he can listen to all\r\n\r\nthe  sections at the same time. I hope what I have\r\n\r\nexpressed just now on the news of the sittings  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly is understood. That does not  matter\r\n\r\nto  me. But what I expect is a true report of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly proceedings broadcast in  the\r\n\r\nMalay programmes. It is hoped that my constituents\r\n\r\nin  Kampong  Kembangan are not given to understand\r\n\r\nthat  Opposition  Members  are  attacked  by   the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Government to such an extent  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  unable to reply. It is hoped that a  true\r\n\r\naccount of what is actually happening can be given\r\n\r\nin  the broadcast of reports of proceedings in the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. I am afraid that  distortion\r\n\r\nof  facts  has taken place. This will be confusing\r\n\r\nand  misleading.  So  if we  return  home  at  ten\r\n\r\no'clock  and  hear  from the radio  an  inaccurate\r\n\r\nreport  about our being attacked in the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe next day when we come back to this House I  am\r\n\r\nsure  our faces will be red. Members of the public\r\n\r\nlisten  in  to  the wireless and I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also said that Government\r\n\r\nhas no money. I am not suggesting that the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  find ways and  means  of  raising\r\n\r\nmoney.  I  have  not yet received confirmation  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  big programmes. I do not  know  what\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  in mind about  creating  one\r\n\r\nculture. We have no liking for yellow culture, and\r\n\r\ntherefore we kill it.

Today, I have not  yet\r\n\r\nreceived a reply to such questions. Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition will co-operate with the Government  if\r\n\r\nprogrammes are carried out to put into effect what\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister has explained  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  concerning  the  anti-Communist  policy  in\r\n\r\norder  to  help the Federation of Malaya.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has any such programmes, I hope  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  will be announced over the  radio.  To\r\n\r\ncreate  a culture which will be acceptable to  all\r\n\r\nwould   need  support;  and  if  we  are  invited,\r\n\r\nparticularly U.M.N.O., to give our support to such\r\n\r\na policy, we will co-operate. We know that this is\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the Government  and  it  has,  on\r\n\r\nseveral  occasions, been explained in this  House.\r\n\r\nThat  is what I tried to bring home to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson who alleged that I have never tuned  in\r\n\r\nto   Radio  Singapore  broadcasts  in  all   other\r\n\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Tan Kia Gan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the National Loyalty  Week  lasting\r\n\r\nbetween 3rd December, 1959 and 9th December,  1959\r\n\r\nhas   ended  triumphantly.

We are  now\r\n\r\nhaving  self-rule. First and foremost, we have  to\r\n\r\ninstil  a  national  feeling and  a  love  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  into the people to enable them to realise\r\n\r\nthe importance of active participation in national\r\n\r\nconstruction work.

All  these\r\n\r\nsteps  have been taken with a view to freeing  our\r\n\r\npeople from Colonial ways and thoughts, and with a\r\n\r\nhope that we will produce thousands upon thousands\r\n\r\nof  right-thinking political workers to serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry.

The Member for Anson said that the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members have no culture or do not  know\r\n\r\nabout culture. So, perhaps, such a remark is meant\r\n\r\nto  indicate  that only the individual  who  talks\r\n\r\nabout  culture is able to understand it.  When  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about  culture, it is  not  meant  only  for\r\n\r\npeople  who  are up to date with ideas.  Even  the\r\n\r\naborigines have their own culture. I would like to\r\n\r\nsay that we from U.M.N.O., as an organisation, are\r\n\r\nanti-Communist.  As far as we  are  concerned,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not hesitate to say, in all frankness,  that\r\n\r\nour  stand  is anti-Communist. Therefore,  towards\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of  a  common culture,  it  is  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to know and understand exactly what\r\n\r\nis the kind of culture that we are going to create\r\n\r\nin  the  future. I do not wish to talk  about  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of  a  Communist  form  of  culture.  The\r\n\r\nreasons why we oppose Communism is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  their  tactics and  ideology  have  scant\r\n\r\nregard  for  humanitarian feelings and principles.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary things why we cannot\r\n\r\naccept  it is that the Communist ideology  has  no\r\n\r\nconsideration for self-respect for those  who  are\r\n\r\nagainst  them. This is all I wish to add  to  what\r\n\r\nhas  been  mentioned  by the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  on  the  subject commented  on  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture was created after the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntook  office.  In  my opinion to  talk  about  the\r\n\r\npeople's  culture in Singapore or good culture  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult.  Why is there  no  such  culture?\r\n\r\nBecause  during  the past 100  years  of  Colonial\r\n\r\nrule, there was no good culture for Singapore. The\r\n\r\nculture was colonial culture and communal culture.\r\n\r\nYou  can see for yourself, Mr Speaker, that after\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. took office we have had to try to turn\r\n\r\nthis  bad culture into good culture. That is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult. In Singapore it is desirable to have  a\r\n\r\ngood  culture.  In  our  Five-Year  Plan  we  have\r\n\r\nclearly  shown  to  the  people,  especially   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  that  what  we  want  is  a  people's\r\n\r\nculture and a non-communal culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we cannot say the expenditure on the Ministry of Culture is either too much or too\r\n\r\nlittle.  We  do not know. The Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  says that it is too much. There  is  no\r\n\r\nfoundation for this statement because, during this\r\n\r\ntransitional period, we do not know what  we  want\r\n\r\nto expand, especially on educating the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the Communist ideology\r\n\r\nor culture. Our Prime Minister has said many times\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. is a non-Communist,  democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist Government. Since we are a non-Communist\r\n\r\nGovernment  we  do not foster Communist  ideas  or\r\n\r\nculture,  because we have already told the  people\r\n\r\nthat  we do not want a Communist culture. When  we\r\n\r\nsay non-Communist, it does not mean that we cannot\r\n\r\nimport  Communist books. We mean that we will  not\r\n\r\nhave Communist propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel\r\n\r\nit  is  my  responsibility to answer  the  queries\r\n\r\nraised by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan and also  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Member for the Southern  Islands.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  I  would say that among  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers - not  all of them - certain Members  have  no\r\n\r\nculture.

Let me tell the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan and the Member for the Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nthat  what we wish to create is a Malayan culture.\r\n\r\nBut the basis for a Malayan culture has yet to  be\r\n\r\ngone into thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the question of a Communist culture,\r\n\r\ncommunist this and communist that. This  does  not\r\n\r\narise whatsoever. We should not be carried away by\r\n\r\nemotion  and sentiments. The question of Communism\r\n\r\nhas  been  explained by my colleague and now  does\r\n\r\nnot arise at all. I have heard just now the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kembangan say that the news broadcast\r\n\r\nis  different from the summary of reports  on  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Legislative Assembly. I say the\r\n\r\nnews and the summary of reports on the proceedings\r\n\r\nactually cover what happens here from 2.30 p.m. to\r\n\r\n8  p.m.  That is all, Mr Speaker, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nallegations levelled at me are not true.

As far as I  know,  in\r\n\r\nMalaya      there      are     many      political\r\n\r\nideologies - socialism, Islamism, democracy and many\r\n\r\nothers. If each of these political Parties has its\r\n\r\nown culture, it means that in Singapore and Malaya\r\n\r\nthere  will be many cultures. But in fact  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  culture  is the property of  the  nation - one\r\n\r\nnation  with  one  culture; it  is  not  based  on\r\n\r\npolitical  ideologies. Communism  is  a  political\r\n\r\nideology,  not a culture. Islamism is a  political\r\n\r\nideology,  not a culture. This has been  expressed\r\n\r\nby cultural experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would like to explain the meaning\r\n\r\nof  culture.  Perhaps the Opposition Members  will\r\n\r\nknow what is meant by culture. Culture, as defined\r\n\r\nby  the  Indonesian Cultural Congress in 1952,  is\r\n\r\nthe  result of a struggle fought for by  a  nation\r\n\r\nand  practised  every day. If this  definition  is\r\n\r\nacceptable,  then automatically  in  Malaya  today\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  practising  a  culture  that  we  call\r\n\r\nMalayan.  From the way the Opposition Members  and\r\n\r\nGovernment Members are dressed, perhaps we can say\r\n\r\nthat  we  already have a Malayan cultural outlook.\r\n\r\nThey  put  on  trousers and  coats  which  are  of\r\n\r\nWestern  origin  and songkok  which  is  Malay  in\r\n\r\norigin. Thus, as a result of assimilation, we have\r\n\r\na dress which is Malayan in outlook. If we enter a\r\n\r\nhouse  from  the front, we may find  furniture  of\r\n\r\nwestern  style  and origin, and we may  be  served\r\n\r\nwith  `Tauhu'  of  Chinese origin  or  curry  from\r\n\r\nIndia.  We  are  right  at the  moment  practising\r\n\r\nMalayan culture in our daily life, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker. There are many who have talked on culture\r\n\r\ntoday.  I am not an authority on culture.  Mention\r\n\r\nwas  made  just now about `Communist culture'  and\r\n\r\nlater  probably about `Liberal-Socialist culture.'\r\n\r\nIt  is possible that next time if another Party is\r\n\r\nin  power, there will be a new `culture' emerging.\r\n\r\nThis  is wrong, I think. Let me emphasise  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan who said that we  are\r\n\r\nagainst  `Western  culture'; we  are  not  against\r\n\r\n`Western  culture'.  What we are  opposed  to,  is\r\n\r\n`Yellow culture'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the summary of the reports of the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Legislative Assembly over Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  think  this  is  a  bit  difficult.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, the Opposition Members have accused it\r\n\r\nto  be  something  near  to distortion  of  facts.\r\n\r\nIndirectly  they say that only the Opposition  has\r\n\r\nbeen  attacked. If it is true and if such a  state\r\n\r\nof affairs exists here in the Assembly, then after\r\n\r\nthis sitting, if there is a commentary or a report\r\n\r\non  it  to the effect that the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  is attacked constantly, is  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kembangan going to move a  resolution\r\n\r\nin   the  Assembly,  condemning  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  for the report, and so on and  so  forth?\r\n\r\nThen  another  request that arises  is  for  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore to widen the scope of its work so that a\r\n\r\nspecial  programme  of broadcasts  that  is  anti-Communist  in nature is put on, just  because  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chairman of the P.A.P. has  announced  its\r\n\r\nanti-Communist  policy. If the  Member  wishes  to\r\n\r\nstudy  the policy of the P.A.P., I recommend  that\r\n\r\nhe reads the booklet issued by the P.A.P. entitled\r\n\r\nthe  \"Five-Year Plan\". The P.A.P. is  a  political\r\n\r\nParty  based on social democracy; it is  not  pro-Communist  but  is  non-Communist.  That  is   our\r\n\r\npolicy,  we  do not need to expound  it  over  the\r\n\r\nradio.  What we have always emphasised is that  we\r\n\r\nare  opposed  to  undesirable  elements,  but  our\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  undesirable  elements   does   not\r\n\r\nconcern  such elements from one bloc only.  It  is\r\n\r\nirrespective of Where they come from - East or West.\r\n\r\nSo long as such subversive elements are considered\r\n\r\nto  be `anti' this Government, then we are opposed\r\n\r\nto  them.  But we want all the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  strive for the interests of this country. This\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  stand  as  regards  undesirable  elements  or\r\n\r\nsubversives. If hon. Members of the Opposition say\r\n\r\nthat U.M.N.O. is prepared to study our theories, I\r\n\r\nthink  it is not necessary that it should be  over\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore. I can suggest to them a course on\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the P.A.P. merely by  reading  the\r\n\r\n\"Five-Year Plan\", a souvenir booklet of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nI  remember that previously at a sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, this booklet was produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, back to the question of culture; we\r\n\r\nare heading for and are practising Malayan culture\r\n\r\nright  at the moment. Ideal or otherwise, we  are,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, at the moment practising  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nform of culture whether from the point of view  of\r\n\r\ndress,  food or way of living. Therefore,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  from my brief resume, the Opposition Members\r\n\r\nwill  understand that we are in  the  midst  of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture  and, indeed,  are  practising  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish\r\n\r\nto  bring  home to the Member who has just  spoken\r\n\r\nthat  U.M.N.O. has its own policy in its struggle.\r\n\r\nWe  will not toe the policy of any other political\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we are embarking on\r\n\r\na debate on political policies. That is completely\r\n\r\nremote from culture, I should imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nam  especially  happy today that,  after  so  many\r\n\r\nmonths  of  effort  exerted  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  and  seeing the good  response  from  the\r\n\r\npeople,   the  Members  of  the  Opposition   feel\r\n\r\ninterested  in  culture. I remember  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  in its 1958 Budget made  provision  of\r\n\r\n$100,000 for the promotion of cultural activities.\r\n\r\nBut  that  was all in words and was not  put  into\r\n\r\npractice.  They did nothing. They  did  not  spend\r\n\r\neven  a  single  cent.  This  is  proof  that  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  had  no  concern   for   the\r\n\r\npromotion of culture of the various races. In  the\r\n\r\nBudget  they planned to engage cultural  officers,\r\n\r\nbut  there  were  no cultural officers  whatsoever\r\n\r\nuntil a leakage of examination papers in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education caused an  officer  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  be a temporary Cultural  Officer.\r\n\r\nThis $100,000 was put into the Treasury up to  the\r\n\r\ntime   the  P.A.P. took  office.  The  Government\r\n\r\ntransferred  a  portion  of  the  sum  to  promote\r\n\r\ncultural matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the previous Government not concern\r\n\r\nitself with culture? They were concerned only with\r\n\r\nthe  $250,000  over  the  Victoria  Memorial  Hall\r\n\r\nTheatre.  Therefore,  if you  want  to  understand\r\n\r\nculture, you must, according to the definition, go\r\n\r\nto  the Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre. Those  who\r\n\r\nare unable to understand healthy culture are those\r\n\r\nliving  in the tower ivory. Another point is  that\r\n\r\nthey   followed   the  policy  of   the   colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment,   that   is   they   followed   yellow\r\n\r\nculture - unhealthy culture to intoxicate our  young\r\n\r\npeople,  to make them forget their duty of nation-building.  All day long they encouraged the  young\r\n\r\npeople  to  dance rock `n roll. We have  seen  all\r\n\r\nthis ourselves. Furthermore they did not encourage\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of  healthy culture.  Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the people of the upper class  were\r\n\r\nliving  in  the  tower ivory.  When  there  was  a\r\n\r\nperformance in the Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre,\r\n\r\nthey rushed to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the P.A.P. Government took office, our\r\n\r\nfirst  task has been to introduce healthy  culture\r\n\r\nto  the masses of the people. The first purpose of\r\n\r\nour  open-air  concerts is  to  introduce  healthy\r\n\r\nculture  to  the masses of the people.  Under  140\r\n\r\nyears of colonial rule, we can ask ourselves,  was\r\n\r\nthere  any  opportunity to foster the cultures  of\r\n\r\nall races? Was there any secondary Malay school in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Was  there a music  teacher  in  Malay\r\n\r\nschools?  Is  that  not  proof  to  destroy  Malay\r\n\r\nculture? Since the P.A.P. Government took  office,\r\n\r\nwe  introduce the cultures of the various races in\r\n\r\nour open-air concerts and in the midst of them  we\r\n\r\nencourage the Chinese to appreciate Malay culture,\r\n\r\nand  the  Malays to appreciate Chinese culture  or\r\n\r\nIndian Culture. This is our first step. After  the\r\n\r\npeople  understand  one  another,  we  will   then\r\n\r\nintegrate all the good points of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  various cultures into a Malayan culture.  You\r\n\r\ncan  see for yourselves that during Loyalty  Week,\r\n\r\nthe  Chung  Cheng High School put up a performance\r\n\r\nentitled \"Unity\". This is an example. In the  past\r\n\r\nwe never saw a Peking Opera. The first time that a\r\n\r\nPeking  Opera  has been \"malayanised\"  was  during\r\n\r\nLoyalty Week. This is only the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, we must, first of all,\r\n\r\nunderstand one another. The next step is  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  discuss  through  mutual  studies  and  then\r\n\r\ncreate a Malayan culture. In the meantime, I  want\r\n\r\nto  thank the cultural institutions, including the\r\n\r\nMalay cultural institutions and the Tamil cultural\r\n\r\ninstitutions for offering their co-operation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  This is the first  time  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  Singapore that they meet one  another\r\n\r\nand  study  from one another to promote a  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture.  This is a good beginning. We  hope  that\r\n\r\nnext  year those people with artistic talents will\r\n\r\nwork  harder  with a new spirit, to  be  loyal  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so as to create a Malayan culture.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, circumstances did not allow such things\r\n\r\nto   happen,  because  mutual  study  and   mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the various races was detrimental\r\n\r\nto   the  policies  of  the  past  Government.  To\r\n\r\nstimulate and to cultivate the ideal of  a  nation\r\n\r\nwas to destroy the colonial rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government do not require $2.5 million\r\n\r\nto  build a Victoria Memorial Hall Theatre because\r\n\r\nwe  have confidence in the people. The people have\r\n\r\nresponded   well   to   our   open-air   concerts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we dare to encourage the people to make\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the National  Theatre.  Through\r\n\r\nthis  theatre  we  can build  a  culture  full  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  ideas.  The promotion of culture  is  not\r\n\r\nconfined to a small portion of the people.  It  is\r\n\r\ndirected to the masses. Therefore, we request  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition, if they  really  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in culture, to give up their  communal\r\n\r\nideas  and co-operate with us to create  a  bright\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, may I congratulate the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital  \"C\"  and  not  a  capital  \"K\",  as   was\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Farrer Park,  for  the\r\n\r\nunexpectedly   lengthy,  but   at   times   lively\r\n\r\ndiscussion  which has taken place as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on  the  policy of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that when we had to settle the\r\n\r\nnomenclature  of the various Ministries  which  we\r\n\r\nwere  setting  up,  the  natural  English-educated\r\n\r\nreluctance to accept the idea of culture as  other\r\n\r\nthan   that   which  is  abnormal,   the   natural\r\n\r\nreluctance  to  talk  of  a  Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\nbecause  of its association with ideas and  ideals\r\n\r\nwhich are supposed to be intolerant and illiberal,\r\n\r\nconflicted  with  the  basic  realities   of   our\r\n\r\nposition.  What was significant in this debate,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   is  that  the  whole  approach   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition is quite clearly different in that  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated middle class wing, as represented\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Farrer Park, was quite distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  the Malay-educated wing represented  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kembangan and the Member  for\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did right in facing the issue and calling a\r\n\r\nspade  a  spade. In the long run,  if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nsurvive,  we  must find some basis of the  highest\r\n\r\ncommon  denominator amongst all our races and  all\r\n\r\nour linguistic and cultural groups. If we fail  to\r\n\r\ndo  that,  then  whenever we talk  about  national\r\n\r\nunity,  we  are  in fact talking  about  temporary\r\n\r\ncompromises  and temporary balances of  power.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  foolish for us in Singapore to  pretend\r\n\r\nthat  the  difference  in  cultural  vitality  and\r\n\r\ncultural  patterns of conduct is not  a  political\r\n\r\nforce.  It would be stupid for us not to recognise\r\n\r\nthat language and culture is a stronger force that\r\n\r\nmotivates   human   beings   than   political   or\r\n\r\nideological ideals. That being so, it helps if  we\r\n\r\nopenly  bring  these issues to the  forefront,  so\r\n\r\nthat   people   can  get  away  from  hypocritical\r\n\r\nattitudes  which existed at a time  when  cultural\r\n\r\nand linguistic urges were muted as a result of the\r\n\r\nruling  hierarchy being the colonial  power  which\r\n\r\nnurtured  an English-educated middle class  to  be\r\n\r\nits assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the whole of South-East Asia, we have\r\n\r\nseen what has happened when the colonial power  is\r\n\r\nremoved  from  the  arena.  India  was  completely\r\n\r\nunited against the British. You remove the British\r\n\r\nand  you get the Dravidian Movement. You have  all\r\n\r\nother  kinds  of  separatist  movements  based  on\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  culture,  because  these  two   are\r\n\r\ninextricably  bound. And throughout the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia,  ranging from  Ceylon - where  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park's ancestors came - to Malaya,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Thailand,  the  Philippines,   Saigon,\r\n\r\nVietnam,  we  see manifestations of  what  happens\r\n\r\nwhen  races  moving at different cultural  momenta\r\n\r\nhave  to co-exist in one economic society.  If  we\r\n\r\nonly  thought of Singapore alone, then  I  say  we\r\n\r\ncould  well  afford it. If we only  calculated  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  immediate future,  we  could  well\r\n\r\nafford  to  ignore the explosive forces which  are\r\n\r\naround us and within us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to pay a tribute to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture for the enthusiasm with which he has  gone\r\n\r\ninto   his   job   of  building   up   a   Malayan\r\n\r\nconsciousness, and his belief that it is possible,\r\n\r\ndesirable and attainable. That faith has sustained\r\n\r\nhim where lesser souls might well have flagged  in\r\n\r\ntheir  enthusiasm. It is pressure-cooking. We  are\r\n\r\nthe first to admit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also the first to say that pressure-cooking, if we had other alternatives, would\r\n\r\nprobably not be the best way of doing it.
