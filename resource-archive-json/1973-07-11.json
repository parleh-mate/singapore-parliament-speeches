The decision  by\r\n\r\nthe  Australian Government has been  as  expected.\r\n\r\nThe  Australian  Government has  said  that  after\r\n\r\nApril  1975  the remaining 150 men would  help  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate programmes of combined exercises and to\r\n\r\nsupport those engaged in such projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian decision will affect the present\r\n\r\nFive-Power   Defence   Arrangements,    hut    the\r\n\r\nusefulness  of  the  defence arrangements  remains\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  contributions  which  the  other\r\n\r\npartners will continue to make.

A  coastal\r\n\r\nexpressway,  called  the East  Coast  Parkway,  is\r\n\r\nunder  construction  on the  reclaimed  land  from\r\n\r\nBedok to Tanjong Rhu. The Jurong Expressway on the\r\n\r\nwest  coast,  starting from the Anson  Road/Keppel\r\n\r\nRoad  junction, will be built to link the  central\r\n\r\narea  to Jurong. To join these two expressways  to\r\n\r\nform  a  freeway from east to west,  skirting  the\r\n\r\ncity  centre,  it  is planned to extend  the  East\r\n\r\nCoast Parkway across Kallang Basin out to the  sea\r\n\r\non to the existing detached stone mole, or break-water,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  then back to land through Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\nBasin  to  the  Jurong  Expressway  at  the  Anson\r\n\r\nRoad/Keppel   Road  junction.  This  system   will\r\n\r\nenclose a large span of water at the seafront  and\r\n\r\ncreate a 220-acre lagoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in November, 1967,\r\n\r\napproval   was  given  by  this  House   for   the\r\n\r\nreclamation of 165 acres of foreshore  and  seabed\r\n\r\noff  Nicoll Highway. It is now proposed  to  widen\r\n\r\nthe existing stone mole and extend the reclamation\r\n\r\nareas by another 370 acres, as shown edged in  red\r\n\r\non  the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN\r\n\r\nNO.  6/73\".  A  copy of this reclamation  plan  is\r\n\r\ndisplayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of hon. Members. Thus, together  with\r\n\r\nthe   165   acres  already  approved   and   under\r\n\r\nreclamation (shown edged in blue on the  plan),  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 535 acres of reclaimed land will  become\r\n\r\navailable. The project will enable some  66  acres\r\n\r\nto  be  set  aside  for the Expressway  and  local\r\n\r\nroads,  about  79  acres for  public,  social  and\r\n\r\ncultural amenities, including landscaped walkways,\r\n\r\ncar  parks, hospital and school sites and  even  a\r\n\r\ncentre   for  performing  arts,  105   acres   for\r\n\r\ncommercial usage and condominium housing, and  the\r\n\r\nremaining   285   acres  for   open   spaces   and\r\n\r\npromenades.

There is, therefore, a need to revise the\r\n\r\nreturns and the notes contained therein from  time\r\n\r\nto  time. This in turn would need prior amendments\r\n\r\nto  be made to the Rules.

Collection  of  statistics  under   the\r\n\r\nStatistics   Act   would   enable   administrative\r\n\r\nflexibility to vary the format, scope and coverage\r\n\r\nof   returns  as  and  when  circumstances  arise,\r\n\r\nwithout  having to resort to changes in subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament pursuant to subsection (3)\r\n\r\nof  section 7 of the Statistics Act (Chapter  299)\r\n\r\nresolves    that    the    Migration    Statistics\r\n\r\n(Revocation) Rules 1973, made on the  2nd  day  of\r\n\r\nMay, 1973, and published as Notification No. S 169\r\n\r\nin  the  Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement\r\n\r\nNo.  23  of 11th May, 1973 as contained  in  Paper\r\n\r\nS.L. 23 of 1973, he approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Wednesday, 25th July, 1973.\"-[Mr E.
