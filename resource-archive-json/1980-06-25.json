The Member's request for the use of CPF monies for the purchase of privately-built residential properties has been consistently turned down in the House since 1971. I am afraid the answer this time is the same. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing needs of the lower income workers are adequately taken care of by allowing them to use their CPF savings to buy HDB/JTC flats. In July last year the Housing and Development Board raised its \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> qualifying monthly family income ceiling to $2,500. In the case of middle income workers, they may use their CPF savings to buy HUDC flats and houses. The decision of HUDC in April this year to raise the monthly family income ceiling from $4,000 to $6,000 will also go a long way to meet the housing needs of the great majority of those in the middle income group. The housing needs of our workers have been largely met and there is, therefore, no compelling reason to reconsider the use of CPF contributions for the purchase of private residential flats and houses. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the Minister of State's justification for disallowing CPF members to withdraw their contributions?

But knowing the number of people who have the money to buy privately-built houses, I think the hon. Member will probably agree with me that the number is very small. The hon. Member surely knows the cost of a privately-built house these days, and even if they were to withdraw the full credit in their CPF account I do not think there are many people who can afford to buy them. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO PULAU UBIN</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for the Environment whether the Public Utilities Board will reconsider supplying electricity by means of generators to the residents of Pulau Ubin now that the contractor on whom the islanders had relied for their electricity supply has ceased such supply, thus affecting a community centre and about 150 families. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities Board's investigation shows that the residents of Pulau Ubin are unwilling to pay higher prices due to higher operating costs, thereby causing the contractor to cease operations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was explained to the hon. Member for Changi in March 1977 and again in March 1979 when the question on supply of electricity to Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong was raised that it would be too expensive for the PUB to provide electricity, whether through submarine cables from the mainland or by diesel generator sets installed on the islands.

The amendment has been introduced so that couples who do not have the capacity to contract a valid marriage in Singapore cannot circumvent the law by visiting another country for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the sole purpose of getting married, Such a marriage will in future be void if one of the parties to the marriage does not have the capacity to marry according to the Singapore law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(c) seeks to amend the first proviso of paragraph (b)(i) of section 16 of the Act to give persons under 21 years of age who have been married and are divorced or have had their marriages declared null and void, the capacity to re-marry. Under the existing law, a person who is under 21 years of age can re- marry if he or she is a widower or widow but is not permitted to re- marry if he or she is divorced or has had his or her marriage declared null and void. The amendment is to remove this inconsistency. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to add a new subsection (3) to section 46 of the Act to give a Conciliation Officer the power to require a party to a marriage to attend before him to settle the differences between the parties to the marriage and such person shall be legally bound to attend and answer questions truthfully. Conciliation Officers at present do not have such power. This new provision will enable Conciliation Officers to play a more effective role in settling differences between husband and wife. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to section 60 of the Act were criticised by a number of persons who submitted representations. Section 60 empowers the court to make orders for the maintenance of a wife and her children. Two new defences were introduced by the Bill to enable a husband to defeat an application by his wife for maintenance, namely, that the wife had committed adultery or that she had deserted him. It was pointed out that section 60 as amended by the Bill would be anomalous since the Bill sought to abolish the \"fault\" principle which is the basis of our existing divorce law. It was suggested that a wife should be entitled to apply for maintenance from her husband if her husband neglects or refuses to provide her with a reasonable maintenance. The Select Committee \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> accepted this view and consequently amended the provision of the Bill to enact a new section 60 to provide that a court may grant maintenance to the wife if the husband had neglected or refused to maintain her. This principle is similar to that laid down in sections 101 and 102 in the new Part IX of the Act regarding the grant of maintenance to a former wife or for a wife when divorce proceedings are pending. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New provisions which are similar to those of the UK Domestic Proceedings and Magistrate's Courts Act, 1978, which gives very wide powers to the Courts for the protection of wives and children from molestation and violence, have also been included in the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations were made that sections 80 and 127 of the Women's Charter should be amended along the lines of the UK Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, 1973. In Singapore, we do have cases of Singapore women marrying foreigners. Under the existing law, a woman acquires the domicile of her husband on marriage even though both parties may live here after their marriage. A woman will be unable to seek a divorce under the new Part IX of the Act even if her husband leaves her for good and returns to his country of domicile. The UK Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, 1973, abolished the wife's dependent domicile and at the same time gave the court jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage if either of the parties to the marriage was domiciled in England on the date when the proceedings were begun or was habitually resident in England throughout the period of one year ending with that date. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961 when the Women's Charter was enacted, married women were given equal rights. We should now consider giving a married woman the capacity to acquire her own domicile. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation has been accepted and clause 28 of the Bill amends section 80 to give a married woman the capacity to acquire her own domicile just like any person \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> of full capacity and to give our Courts the jurisdiction to entertain matrimonial proceedings if either of the parties to the marriage is domiciled in Singapore or is habitually resident in Singapore for a period of three years immediately preceding the commencement of the proceedings. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 82, which appeared in the Bill, permitted a couple to dissolve their marriage by mutual consent without any pre-conditions being fulfilled. This was at odds with the principles laid down in section 83(3)(d) which provides for one party to petition for a divorce when the couple have lived apart for three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and the respondent consents to the divorce. For this reason, section 82 has now been deleted. Furthermore, the Select Committee felt that our divorce law should not make it easy for a couple to terminate their marriage without first making an effort to overcome their difficulties. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions were also made that the Court should be given more powers in enforcing maintenance orders and the power to order maintenance to be paid in one lump sum. These suggestions have been accepted and amendments have been made to sections 102 and 103(1) to that effect. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has also raised the age limit from 18 years to 21 years for a child's entitlement to maintenance from his parents. This will take into account the fact that many male students have to serve national service first before they can go for their tertiary education. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here that the amendments have not affected the interests of Muslims in any way. Section 3(3) of the Women's Charter provides that where both parties to a marriage are Muslims, the marriage cannot be solemnized or registered under the Charter. In other words, the marriage cannot be solemnized or registered \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> in the Civil Registry. It does not matter if either of the parties is a convert. The marriage can only be solemnized or registered at the Registry of Muslim Marriages or by a kadi or naib kadi appointed by the President of Singapore under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 42). \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the changes recommended by the Select Committee are necessary and desirable. The Select Committee had taken a great deal of time to consider the written representations so as to provide a law which, whilst making divorce easier for those couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down, will help save those marriages which can be saved. The amendments to the Act also give wider powers to the Courts to grant maintenance for the wife and children so that there will be less hardship on the dependants of recalcitrant husbands. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADVANCE ACCOUNTS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br>3.29 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The motion reads as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 9 of the Financial Procedure Act (Chapter 68), resolves that the total amount of moneys which are approved to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund for the purpose of making advance is to be increased from $71 million to $188 million. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this resolution is to augment the total amount for the Advance Accounts to cope with present and future requirements.
