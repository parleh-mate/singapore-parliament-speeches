Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   have  had  sufficient  time  to   read   the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentations received on the Bill, and  which  were\r\n\r\ngiven careful consideration in Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only major amendment which has been made to the\r\n\r\nBill  is the deletion of the clause providing for  the\r\n\r\nrelaxation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  building  by-laws in connection with  the  Board's\r\n\r\noperations.  Similar clauses appear in legislation  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  and  elsewhere,  and  while  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  remains of the opinion that the  inclusion\r\n\r\nof  the original clause would not be unreasonable,  it\r\n\r\nconsiders   that  the  arrangements  with  the   local\r\n\r\nauthorities for waivers has worked reasonably well  in\r\n\r\nthe  past, and does not consider it necessary to press\r\n\r\nfor  its  inclusion  in the Bill. However,  Government\r\n\r\nwill  do  so by way of an amendment, if the operations\r\n\r\nof  the Board are found to be hampered as a result  of\r\n\r\nlocal  authority by-laws. The remaining amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill in Select Committee were mostly minor and  of\r\n\r\na  purely  technical  nature, and  were  intended  to\r\n\r\nimprove the drafting of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsure  this  House is at last happy to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nHousing Authority can be put into reality. But certain\r\n\r\ndetails  should still be patched up - especially  those\r\n\r\nthat raised consider, able debate in Select Committee.\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether the Minister was aware  that  those\r\n\r\npoints  had  been raised by the Opposition with  very,\r\n\r\nvery strong reasons behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quote an example? The automatic transfer\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  staff  without\r\n\r\nreference  back  to the Public Service Commission.  To\r\n\r\nme,  I  think  this is a most dangerous move.  We  are\r\n\r\naware that the determining of posts is in the hands of\r\n\r\na  few  persons. I just wonder what is the  merit  and\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the P.S.C., a body on which this  country\r\n\r\nrelies  so much. To ensure the stability of a  country\r\n\r\nthe  public  service is of vital importance.  This  is\r\n\r\nespecially true when we see the pocket-size government\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. in the City Council. How the City Council\r\n\r\nemploys its staff is seen in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe policy of the P.A.P. Now the Minister proposes that\r\n\r\nthe  present  staff  of  the  S.I.T. be  automatically\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Housing Authority. Sir,  maybe  the\r\n\r\npublic  or  this  House has confidence in  the  present\r\n\r\nMinister  and the present S.I.T. staff, but what  about\r\n\r\nthe  future?  Will filthy party politics play  a  great\r\n\r\npart  in  all  public appointments? I  wonder  if  this\r\n\r\nHousing   Authority  is  keen  to  serve  only  certain\r\n\r\nParties' interests, but not all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this point, I strongly urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider putting in the hands of the P.S.C.\r\n\r\nthe appointment of staff for the Housing Authority. Any\r\n\r\ngrievance  or any technical points of assurance  raised\r\n\r\nby  the  present S.I.T. staff should, I think, be  very\r\n\r\neasy  to  deal  with. But if this Bill  is  now  passed\r\n\r\nwithout  any amendment and we accept it as it is,  then\r\n\r\nlet these few persons hold the extraordinary powers  to\r\n\r\ndetermine any appointment in the new Housing Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, what is the use of changing its name? Why\r\n\r\nnot  let  us  continue to use the name \"S.I.T.\"  rather\r\n\r\nthan change it to the \"Housing Authority\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, Sir, through the P.S.C. and through the\r\n\r\nwisdom  of  our Minister we can try to do something  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  machinery of the S.I.T. - which undoubtedly\r\n\r\nhas  not  satisfied the public demand  for  housing - and\r\n\r\nthereby help it to solve the housing problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the pros and cons of this important\r\n\r\npoint,  I  hope the Minister will not only think  twice\r\n\r\nbut  three  times not to allow any political  Party  in\r\n\r\npower  in the near future to use this Housing Authority\r\n\r\nfor  their own ends. Sir, I strongly urge the  Minister\r\n\r\nto give me and this House a satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission having jurisdiction over\r\n\r\nthe  appointments of employees in the City Council  has\r\n\r\nbeen  debated in very great detail during  meetings  of\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee. The fact is that the Select\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  was of the opinion that, for the time  being\r\n\r\nat  least as regards the category of employees who  are\r\n\r\nalready  in appointments with the Board of Trustees  of\r\n\r\nthe  Improvement Trust, it would be unfair for them  to\r\n\r\nappear  before  the  Public Service  Commission  to  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed  in  appointments in  which  they  have  been\r\n\r\nacting  or  working for the past few years. However,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member for Changi that with the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  being  of  the  Housing  and  Development  Board,\r\n\r\nGovernment will do its best to see that politics should\r\n\r\nnot  be introduced into the workings of the Development\r\n\r\nBoard, because, in the first instance, appointments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board will be made by Government not on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  political affiliation but purely on the merits  and\r\n\r\nability of the member to serve on that Board.

I have already  quoted\r\n\r\none  practical  example and that is the  present  well-known  method of employment in the City Council - if  you\r\n\r\nwant  to seek a City Council job, you must be a  member\r\n\r\nof  a  political  Party, and you can then  be  sure  of\r\n\r\ngetting  a job.

Sir, let  them\r\n\r\ndetermine who should remain or who should be  asked  to\r\n\r\nresign;  or  who  should be humiliated  and  forced  to\r\n\r\nresign.  We  have  known that Mr Marcus  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  had to resign. Why should he resign  from  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department? It is evident that party  politics\r\n\r\nare being played in the public service and therefore  a\r\n\r\nprinciple is involved - should Singapore preserve a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclean  public  service  or  not?

Whether these\r\n\r\napplicants were really seeking jobs in the City Council\r\n\r\nor not, I have no right to question, but it is true, on\r\n\r\ntheir  own words, that if you are seeking a job in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, you must prove your political  leanings.\r\n\r\nAs  they  say, Sze Siang Tsen Chueh, which  means  that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith a right political mind, you have more chances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I strongly oppose the passing of this Bill\r\n\r\nwithout  any  amendments, particularly in view  of  the\r\n\r\ngreat danger of allowing this Government Department  to\r\n\r\nby-pass  the  P.S.C. and I am afraid  it  is  going  to\r\n\r\ncreate a very serious precedent which a political Party\r\n\r\nin  power  in the future might follow.

If I may remind  the\r\n\r\nformer  members of the Labour Front, this  was  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir key planks in their last election platform.  They\r\n\r\ntalked  about it for four years and now, when they  are\r\n\r\non  their way out, they present us with this Report  of\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not without significance that the senior\r\n\r\nstaff  of the Singapore Improvement Trust are concerned\r\n\r\nabout  their  future  and want to  entrench  themselves\r\n\r\nbefore this Government goes out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof office.

It is also a well-known  fact  that  they would like to build  themselves\r\n\r\ninto new jobs - unlike what happened to the City Council\r\n\r\nsenior  officers who were unable to get the old Council\r\n\r\nto  put  protective  amour-plating  around  their  jobs\r\n\r\nbefore  they,  the old councillors were  swept  out  of\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objections to this Bill being passed, but\r\n\r\nI  do ask the Minister to consider seriously whether he\r\n\r\nshould   embark  on  the  implementation  of  such   an\r\n\r\nimportant  task  when  he  knows  full  well  that  his\r\n\r\nGovernment has got only another eight weeks to go.  The\r\n\r\nnext  government may well have very different ideas  as\r\n\r\nto  how this Bill should be implemented, even though it\r\n\r\nmay  be  of  the  opinion  that  there  should  be   an\r\n\r\nindependent  or  separate Housing Authority.  The  next\r\n\r\ngovernment may well be of the opinion that this Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority should be under the direct control, direction\r\n\r\nand  drive of a Minister for Housing, and not under  an\r\n\r\nappointed Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore submit this view for the Government's\r\n\r\nconsideration - that the administrative apparatus of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not be strained to breaking point  by\r\n\r\nlast-minute switches in policy. If the Government  goes\r\n\r\non  with the implementation of this Bill, and the  next\r\n\r\ngovernment disagrees with it, in a matter of weeks  all\r\n\r\nthese gears will be thrown into reverse. That will  not\r\n\r\nbe good for the country - and they know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Minister to remember this.\r\n\r\nWhatever the views of permanent Civil Service  may  be,\r\n\r\nand  whatever  the views of the S.I.T. Senior  Officers\r\n\r\nare,  the  final decision has to be made by a political\r\n\r\nhead.  As  the  political head, he  must  assume  final\r\n\r\nresponsibility for what happens to the S.I.T. and  this\r\n\r\nHousing Bill. I would also ask the Minister, if he  has\r\n\r\nany  confidence at all in his programme and his  policy\r\n\r\nand  what  he  intends to do, to place  it  before  the\r\n\r\nelectorate and get a mandate to get on with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.28 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nhon.

Furthermore, Sir,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncomparison  at  all, in my opinion,  between  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the future Development Board. The  alleged\r\n\r\nhappenings  in  the  City  Council  could  probably  be\r\n\r\nbecause   that  body  is  a  fully  elected  one.   The\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, on the other hand, will have members\r\n\r\nwho will be nominated by Government and who will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  elected  members, as it is in the City  Council  or\r\n\r\neven  in  this  Assembly. So the  chances  of  politics\r\n\r\ngetting  into  the  Development  Board  would,  in   my\r\n\r\nopinion, be very remote. I still say, Sir, that  it  is\r\n\r\nunwise,  and  we  should not attempt to  introduce  the\r\n\r\npowers  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  into  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board, at least in the case  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  employees who have been with  the  Board,\r\n\r\nsome for twenty or thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has sat down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PLANNING BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Select Committee's Report)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Govermnent, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Govermnent, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Sir, I rise to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nPlanning Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper No. L.A.\r\n\r\n21 of 1958, be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Bill of some difficulty, and it is for\r\n\r\nthis  reason  that the Bill was committed to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee at the sitting of this Assembly held on  10th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1958.

If the Financial Secretary, who has\r\n\r\nnow   retired,  had  adopted  the  attitude  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing,\r\n\r\nperhaps  without proper consideration,  has  chosen  to\r\n\r\nstrike  in  this Assembly, then he would have  gone  on\r\n\r\nwith  those  development schemes and incurred  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry  a waste of public expenditure when the schemes\r\n\r\nare reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are prepared to face any criticism. And let me\r\n\r\ntell  the  Member for Paya Lebar this.  It  is  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  drive  and energy at the  top  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  that  the people are satisfied that  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil   has  never  functioned  so  efficiently   and\r\n\r\npolitely  on  behalf of the public and for the  public.\r\n\r\nLet  me  also tell him this. If the S.P.A. leaves  the\r\n\r\nCivil Service in a state of coma and the bureaucracy in\r\n\r\na  state  of paralysis, then he will get the  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the  City  Council  Pavilion  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution  Exposition  is  ready  on  time  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Pavilion is not. Everybody knows, and 20,000\r\n\r\npeople  who went to the opening on Saturday also  know,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  conspiracy of silence in the Press,  that\r\n\r\nthe  opening of the exhibition was delayed because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Pavilion was not ready, and not because  the\r\n\r\nroads were not suitable for pedestrian traffic. If  you\r\n\r\nwant results, then you must have drive and dynamism. If\r\n\r\nMinisters  just sit back and only bestir themselves  on\r\n\r\nthe  eve of an election, having slept for the last four\r\n\r\nyears,  then  I  say that those who awaken  from  their\r\n\r\nsleep  at such a late hour will find that the  bus  has\r\n\r\nalready left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two Bills - one we have already passed and\r\n\r\none  we  are about to pass - are the instruments  through\r\n\r\nwhich,  not the present Minister, but the next Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Housing  will  have to push  through  his  housing\r\n\r\npolicy,  and the question of policy is closely  related\r\n\r\nto  the question of personnel. Whilst we agreed in  the\r\n\r\nmain with the Housing Bill, I think the Minister did mc\r\n\r\nan  injustice  when  he  thinks that  my  Party  agreed\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly with every single detail in  that  Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, I had already indicated to  him  earlier\r\n\r\nthat  it  is my opinion, and the opinion of  my  Party,\r\n\r\nthat  the head of the Housing Authority should  be  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and not a Chairman appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  to propel itself with the drive with  which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister thinks it ought to be propelled, then the\r\n\r\nMinister  should  be present himself to  see  that  his\r\n\r\npolicies  are  pursued with vigour, and not  do  it  by\r\n\r\nproxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many amendments of that nature that we have\r\n\r\nin   mind.   All   that   will   necessitate   amending\r\n\r\nlegislation.  What  is  worse,  we  do  not  want   the\r\n\r\npersonnel  to be fixed beforehand. If he had done  this\r\n\r\nat, the beginning of the career of his Government, with\r\n\r\nthree years ahead of him to carry out and implement his\r\n\r\npolicy, then we would have no grounds for complaint. It\r\n\r\nis  no use to talk about \"We will do what is right  and\r\n\r\nwhat  we think is right in this respect.\" He knows full\r\n\r\nwell   that   he  has  got  only  eight  weeks   before\r\n\r\ndissolution  and that what is right for the  Government\r\n\r\nto  do  now  is  not to queer up the position  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry  by making it necessary for the next government\r\n\r\nto reverse gears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very seldom have\r\n\r\nI  been  able to agree with the hon.

Sir, that has been amply confirmed\r\n\r\nby the hon.

It is not proper to use a  local\r\n\r\ngovernment, like the City Council, which is part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   for  its  propaganda,  to  denounce   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for what it has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> For what it has not done!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> What he said is completely wrong.\r\n\r\nI  have been to the Constitution Exposition ground many\r\n\r\ntimes  during  the  week,  and  I  can  say  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and all the pavilions were ready\r\n\r\nand willing to start on that night at the same time  as\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, and their drive is no less than that\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P.'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir, I used to, but not now.\r\n\r\nThat shows their defiance of the rules of the game  and\r\n\r\nof  the law.

Therefore, they should abide by the  rules.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  say  that  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexhibition  has to be postponed, then the City  Council\r\n\r\nshould follow the rules; but instead of that, they  saw\r\n\r\nin  it  a  glorious opportunity to put on  a  blaze  of\r\n\r\nlights, and say: \"Here we are - ready, and everybody else\r\n\r\nis not!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, to my mind, definitely not fair, and that is\r\n\r\nwhy I want to see a fair game being played in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in  this  House.

I\r\n\r\nmust  say that many of us, particularly those who  have\r\n\r\nappeared  before the Select Committee, are not  at  all\r\n\r\nhappy about the Bill as it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented today. Many points have been brought up,  and\r\n\r\nmost   of   them  have  been  turned  down.  The   only\r\n\r\nsatisfaction we had was the amendment to clause 9 (11),\r\n\r\nas mentioned by the Hon. Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and Housing. Under that clause, anyone  who  now\r\n\r\nsubmits plans will get an answer - yes or no - within three\r\n\r\nmonths;  and if any condition is imposed upon the  plan\r\n\r\nthat  is  submitted,  or if the plan  is  refused,  the\r\n\r\nplanners must give the reasons for the refusal. That is\r\n\r\na step forward, Sir. At least those who want to develop\r\n\r\nor  take part in the development of Singapore will know\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  get  a definite answer  within  three\r\n\r\nmonths  instead of, as they had before, being  referred\r\n\r\nback  to  and  fro  by  the  Planning  Department,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes it took over a year to get the plans through.\r\n\r\nBut  changing of the law and giving a definite time for\r\n\r\nplans  to  be  passed are not enough. We have  now  the\r\n\r\nauthority of the planners decentralised by the creation\r\n\r\nof  the  District Councils. I do hope that the District\r\n\r\nCouncils  will  use all the powers and energy  to  push\r\n\r\nthrough as many plans and as soon as possible when they\r\n\r\nare sent to them for approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the duties of the District Councils,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Planning Department, are  very  onerous\r\n\r\ntoday. It has a backlog of plans to approve, and  I  do\r\n\r\nhope they will use the powers they now have to try  and\r\n\r\nhelp  the small man living in the area, so that he  can\r\n\r\nrepair   his   house   or  build   extensions   without\r\n\r\nencountering  a  great  deal of  difficulties,  as  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in the past. It is because of the  difficulty\r\n\r\nof  getting plans through that has encouraged or forced\r\n\r\nsome people to commit breaches of the law and carry out\r\n\r\nrepairs on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that by changing this law we will be able\r\n\r\nto  allow people who submit plans to build quickly,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can curb the number of illegal houses that  are\r\n\r\nbeing erected every day in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.53 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I just wonder how many hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree with me when I  say  that  when  a\r\n\r\nperson  is thirsting for power he can easily  be  lured\r\n\r\nand become a fanatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  wish  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister again whether he has any solution  to\r\n\r\nsuch a minor technical point about the present staff of\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. who should feel secure in their jobs and  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed  in  their appointments by the P.S.C.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant to preserve the integrity of the service  and\r\n\r\nthat  can only happen if appointments are made  by  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will recollect, the hon.

The  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  is,  in  the eyes of many people, still  a  myth,\r\n\r\nespecially  among  the  masses. The  peasants  and  the\r\n\r\nordinary  man-in-the-street do not know the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan.  They think it is  only  a  plan  to\r\n\r\nbeautify the City and to build skyscrapers, or even for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the wealthy class of the  population.\r\n\r\nThis  question has been constantly put  to  me  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  my constituency, the majority of  whom  are\r\n\r\nfishermen and farmers scattered around the rural  area.\r\n\r\nbecause  they feel that even up to now the Master  Plan\r\n\r\nhas not provided them with houses. They want Government\r\n\r\nto  provide some means to raise their living  standard.\r\n\r\nThey  want to know whether the Government has  anything\r\n\r\nin  the Master Plan to provide them with houses,  which\r\n\r\nthey badly need, or a place where they can settle down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned before his plan to build a Malay settlement. I remember I told him that he should\r\n\r\nenlarge  his  plan  for  attap dwellers  which  he  has\r\n\r\noutlined in his plan to include not only the Malays but\r\n\r\nalso  any person who is unable to rent a house provided\r\n\r\nby  the Government or, as present, the S.I.T., and  who\r\n\r\nhas  no  chance to buy a house of his own. The  farmers\r\n\r\nwill be happy and contented if only the Government will\r\n\r\ngive  them a piece of land and allow them to  build  an\r\n\r\nattap  house on it. Sir, I wish the Minister will  give\r\n\r\nan answer to these two points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit is with mixed feelings that I speak on the Bill. On\r\n\r\nthe one hand, I am very glad that at the end of four\r\n\r\nyears we have seen an attempt to abolish that notorious\r\n\r\norganisation called the Singapore Improvement Trust. On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, Sir, much as I would like to have\r\n\r\nimagined before my election, I could never have\r\n\r\nimagined that a Bill of this type could be made on this\r\n\r\nside of the House of which I am a Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken many times in the Select Committee on\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the Trust and the people are  tired  of\r\n\r\nwhat it has been doing all these years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My one and only hope is that this new Bill will be\r\n\r\nable to stop all this dictatorship and corruption,  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  else that goes with it. But I see nothing  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill that gives me encouragement on all the points\r\n\r\nI  have  raised. According to this Bill,  you  can  do\r\n\r\nnothing except with the approval of the Minister or his\r\n\r\nappointees.  There is nothing to say that you  can  get\r\n\r\nthe  plans passed or get a scheme approved except  with\r\n\r\nthe approval of the Minister or his officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance the question of design. Nowhere in\r\n\r\nthe  world has an architect been able to put in writing\r\n\r\nor in whatever form what is called good design. Yet the\r\n\r\nGovernment wishes to seek powers to control design.  If\r\n\r\nthe  authorities concerned cannot find any reasons good\r\n\r\nenough,  they can just turn it down and say,  \"No.  Bad\r\n\r\ndesign.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word \"design\" can mean planning and anything that\r\n\r\nthe  officer can think of. I have no objection  if  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  design is vested in the  Local  Authority.\r\n\r\nalthough  I  do  not agree that they should  have  such\r\n\r\npowers. That is not so bad. But I think it is too  much\r\n\r\nto  ask  for control of design at the initial stage  of\r\n\r\nplanning.  I  do not believe you can find  such  powers\r\n\r\nanywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, if you want to submit a scheme to the\r\n\r\nplanning   authority  of  the  Improvement  Trust   for\r\n\r\napproval, you just send in a site\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplan,  indicating the number of storeys you  intend  to\r\n\r\nbuild,  and  for what purpose the building will  serve,\r\n\r\nand  then leave it to the authority to say yes  or  no.\r\n\r\nBut  if design is one of the points of approval and  if\r\n\r\nthe officer concerned insists on it, then the architect\r\n\r\nwill  have to submit a sketch plan. A sketch plan is  a\r\n\r\nvery   expensive   item.  Take,   for   instance,   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.  It costs about $8 million.  According  to\r\n\r\nthe  scales for a sketch plan, an architect is entitled\r\n\r\nto  charge 2\u00bd per cent. If we know that the scheme  is\r\n\r\nsure  to go through, then that amount is worth spending\r\n\r\nbecause  ultimately, before you make a working drawing,\r\n\r\nyou  will have to submit a sketch plan to the owner for\r\n\r\napproval.  But to commit yourself to an expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$200,000 without any assurance whatsoever, I think that\r\n\r\nis most improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of appeal, Sir. As it is, you\r\n\r\nhave to appeal to the Minister. I have fought very hard\r\n\r\nin  the  Select Committee to make the point that before\r\n\r\nthe Minister makes his decision, this appeal should  go\r\n\r\nbefore the Committee appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say that, I do not mean that I have to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  follow whatever decision is made  by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I just ask that the Minister, before  he\r\n\r\nmakes  a decision, should at least hear the opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee which he appoints. I think that  is  not\r\n\r\ntoo  much  to  ask. I have never any doubt  as  to  the\r\n\r\nability  and  integrity of the Minister. But  we  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the Minister is a non-technical man. He  has\r\n\r\nto depend on the advice of his officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are no regulations to say what is right and\r\n\r\nwhat is wrong, so it is a matter of opinion in a lot of\r\n\r\ncases.  The Master Plan has already been submitted  and\r\n\r\napproved  by the Government. Yet I find in  many  cases\r\n\r\nthat  even  if a plan conforms entirely to  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan,  it  is  disapproved. So how can you  expect  the\r\n\r\npublic to support the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen they do not know what is right or wrong? As it is,\r\n\r\nSir,  the approval or disapproval of a plan, to a great\r\n\r\nextent, depends on the whims and fancies of the officer\r\n\r\nconcerned. We know, Sir, even in the Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\ntoday,  that  if  a certain officer is in  charge,  you\r\n\r\nmight get a disapproval, and when another officer is in\r\n\r\ncharge,  you might get an approval. The Bill  has  done\r\n\r\nnothing to alter or improve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning, Sir, is not a matter, as many imagine,\r\n\r\nwhich only concerns the architect, the contractors  and\r\n\r\nthe  estate  people.  It  concerns  everybody.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment makes it expensive for land to be developed,\r\n\r\nthe  cost  ultimately will be charged to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, Sir, on the question of controlling design\r\n\r\nand  having  to  submit a sketch plan, I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\narchitect would welcome clause 10. At least today, Sir,\r\n\r\nif we were asked to submit an application, we just type\r\n\r\nthe application, enclose the site plan and submit it to\r\n\r\nthe Improvement Trust. But if the Government insists on\r\n\r\nhaving a design first, as what the Bill provides,  then\r\n\r\nyou  have to submit a sketch plan with the application.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect, Sir, you can be sure  the  architect\r\n\r\nwill  not render a service free of charge. It goes back\r\n\r\nto - who else? Is it fair, Sir, that the public should be\r\n\r\nburdened  with  this  unnecessary expenditure?  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot tell the public what is  right,  how\r\n\r\ncan  they condemn what is wrong? That is why I objected\r\n\r\nvery  strongly to that clause in the Select  Committee,\r\n\r\nand I object very strongly to it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the administration of laws, Sir, there are two\r\n\r\nsides  to it. One is the law itself; the other  is  the\r\n\r\nofficer  who  administers it. I know very well  that  I\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  the support of this House  even  if  I\r\n\r\ndecide  to vote against the Bill. But I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthe  officer who will administer this law will make  it\r\n\r\nas  easy  as possible for the public to be granted  the\r\n\r\napproval  which  they  seek, if they  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.12 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nlike the remarks of the last speaker, especially at the\r\n\r\nend of it. I think that in all ventures that we\r\n\r\nundertake, everything must be based on practicability.\r\n\r\nI have seen the S.I.T. planning section working for the\r\n\r\nlast few years, and I have one or two observations to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly I know there is a Planning Department in the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust. I believe that the work of\r\n\r\nthis  Department  is to plan. I further  believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  many architects going to  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment, but the work of the architect must just  be\r\n\r\nto put up plans for houses. They should have nothing to\r\n\r\ndo  with the planning of an area. They should only plan\r\n\r\nas to how the houses should be built, and see that they\r\n\r\nconform  to all the requirements of safety and  so  on.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  have actually found, Sir, is of a very curious\r\n\r\nnature.  It seems to me that those who want to  put  up\r\n\r\nbuildings  have to go to the architects to  have  their\r\n\r\nplans drawn up. But the architects have also to put  up\r\n\r\na  site  plan  and an overall plan for the whole  area.\r\n\r\nThat I think intrudes upon the work of the planners. We\r\n\r\nhave  experts in planning. The experts are  now  asking\r\n\r\nthe architects, who should not be doing that job, to do\r\n\r\nthe job for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, a great deal of the heartburn felt by\r\n\r\nso  many  people could be removed if we could  ask  the\r\n\r\nplanning   section  of  the  S.I.T. - now  the   Planning\r\n\r\nAuthority - to put up tentative plans for the whole area,\r\n\r\nincluding  plans of where the roads should be situated,\r\n\r\nwhere  bungalow  lots  should be  situated,  and  other\r\n\r\nlittle   details.  Then  when  builders   go   to   the\r\n\r\narchitects, they have the area already planned out. The\r\n\r\narchitects  just draw to plan, and everything  will  be\r\n\r\nset in motion very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the answer may be that we have not enough\r\n\r\nplanners,  and if we do not have enough planners,  then\r\n\r\nfurther details should be given to assist those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are going to do the work of planners, and not just\r\n\r\nsay - this is a green belt, that is something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I find, Sir, is that not all people\r\n\r\nknow about the Master Plan. They only know very roughly\r\n\r\nwhat  they  can  do. They may not even know  what  they\r\n\r\ncannot  do. A man who wants to develop a piece of  land\r\n\r\nmay not even know that it is in the green belt and that\r\n\r\nnothing  can be done about it. I would suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister that further publicity be given to the overall\r\n\r\nplanning of Singapore. I know that we have already  one\r\n\r\nsuch publicity campaign whereby everybody is invited to\r\n\r\ngo  to the Victoria Memorial Hall and look at the whole\r\n\r\narea  of  Singapore. But I think that should be carried\r\n\r\nfurther. Every district should have a plan of it put up\r\n\r\nso  that  everybody in that district will know what  he\r\n\r\ncan  do and what he cannot do and the intention of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  regard to the future  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That  will dovetail all  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find also, Sir, that although this type of planning\r\n\r\nusually  applies to the rich people, yet  many  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who can only afford to build attap houses  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the scope of that authority. I have  known,  in\r\n\r\nmany  advanced  countries and also many not-so-advanced\r\n\r\ncountries,  that they have many types of plans  put  up\r\n\r\nfor  sale  to the people. I have recently gone  to  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board to ask for cheap plans for the  people.  I\r\n\r\nfind that these plans are out of stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the Minister that plans for houses\r\n\r\nshould  be freely made available to the people, and  if\r\n\r\nthe  people  know where to build and how to  build,  it\r\n\r\nwill  solve a lot of problems. We know that  there  are\r\n\r\nplenty  of unauthorised houses coming up, and that  may\r\n\r\nbe  due to the inconveniences caused to the people,  or\r\n\r\nto  their  ignorance  of  the plans  of  Government.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Minister look into this in more detail\r\n\r\nin order better to help the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.20 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are many sites on main roads in the rural areas\r\n\r\nwhere shop-houses could be built and yet they are not\r\n\r\nallowed to be built, just because these sites happen to\r\n\r\nbe in the green belt or belts. It is well known that\r\n\r\nthe housing shortage is very acute here, and if shop-houses could be built, at least the housing problem\r\n\r\ncould be solved to some extent if, say, two persons\r\n\r\nwere to live on the premises of a shop-house. There\r\n\r\nwould be many thousands who would go to the shop-houses\r\n\r\nand overcrowding in their own houses would be eased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope whenever any developer or planner applies for\r\n\r\npermission  to build shop-houses on the main  roads  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas, the Competent Authority will not  put\r\n\r\nup obstacles such as general layouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dato Abdul Hamid, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the points\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members  on both sides of  the  House  have\r\n\r\nalready been debated in the Select Committee and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think I will be called upon at this stage to reply\r\n\r\nto  them.

If he has read  the\r\n\r\nspeeches which I have made both in the Assembly and  in\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee, he should know by now  that  the\r\n\r\nPlanning    Department   of   the   present   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust will be a Government department in my\r\n\r\nMinistry - the  Ministry of Local Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing.  Because  it will be a Government  Department,\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service  Commission  will  naturally  have\r\n\r\njurisdiction  over all the appointments and  dismissals\r\n\r\nof the officers of that department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, about settlements.

I   never\r\n\r\nquestioned the merits or demerits of Malay settlements.\r\n\r\nWhat I want the Minister to do is to say whether he  is\r\n\r\nin  a  position  to  enlarge the  scope  for  an  attap\r\n\r\ndwellers settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> The hon.

But I would like to point  out  to  him\r\n\r\nthat  every  year  Government is spending  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars in buying up land and in resettling farmers  in\r\n\r\nvarious parts of the island. Most of these farmers  are\r\n\r\nfrom  the Chinese community. I do not think I  can,  at\r\n\r\nthis stage, agree with the proposal put forward by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Changi  that  I  should  open   up   more\r\n\r\nsettlements for the people of the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the Member for Tanjong Pagar. My\r\n\r\nreply  to  him will be the same as the one I  gave  him\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Housing  and Development Bill  was, debated\r\n\r\nearlier  this  morning. Again, Sir, he brought  up  the\r\n\r\npoint where he insisted that this Government should not\r\n\r\nimplement  the  policy embodied in the  Planning  Bill,\r\n\r\nbecause he said the present Government could only  last\r\n\r\na month or so. Again, he did say we on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse have been sleeping for the last four years. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know who has been sleeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He demands that we should not implement the policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government in the Planning Bill. If only the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar would read the Report of the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, he would certainly find that his  Party  was\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Select Committee. I believe  it  was\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang. Also, at no time during  the\r\n\r\ndeliberations  of the Select Committee  did  his  Party\r\n\r\nMember   put   forward   suggestions   regarding    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House have a responsibility to\r\n\r\nthe  people,  even though our responsibility  may  last\r\n\r\nonly  another month, six weeks or two months.

Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will note that of the total of $1,189,681 asked\r\n\r\nfor  in  the Schedule, about 91 per cent of it,  namely\r\n\r\n$1,143,973,  is  asked for in respect of grants-in-aid.\r\n\r\nThe  capitation  grant, as explained in  the  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper, was increased from 30 cents per head to 50 cents\r\n\r\nper  head  for  primary pupils, 75 cents per  head  for\r\n\r\nsecondary  pupils  and $1 per head  for  Higher  School\r\n\r\nCertificate  pupils. The former rate of  30  cents  per\r\n\r\nhead  had been in existence for about 30 years  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  felt that this rate should, be changed to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  especially the  Chinese  schools,  to\r\n\r\nbetter  their  equipment.  The  Government  decided  to\r\n\r\nincrease  this  grant so that these  schools  can  have\r\n\r\ntheir  equipment  and the buildings can  be  made  more\r\n\r\npresentable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item, as explained here, is the salaries of\r\n\r\nteachers. I believe that this question has been in  the\r\n\r\nmelting pot for many years. The salaries of teachers in\r\n\r\nChinese  aided  schools especially have been  neglected\r\n\r\nfor  a  long time and it has taken the Government quite\r\n\r\nsome  time  to  streamline and bring  the  salaries  of\r\n\r\nteachers  of  these  aided  schools  at  par  with  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  the  teachers  in  other  Government  and\r\n\r\nEnglish schools. The arrears amount to a big sum and we\r\n\r\nask  the Assembly to approve this amount in the  spirit\r\n\r\nin  which  the All Party Committee on Chinese Education\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the salaries of teachers  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  other vernacular schools should be brought to  the\r\n\r\nsame level as that of the teachers in English and other\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools.  As I said,  Application  No.  264\r\n\r\ncovers  two  points:  one, the increase  of  capitation\r\n\r\ngrants to Chinese schools and the other the arrears  of\r\n\r\nsalaries  to  be paid to the teachers of Chinese  aided\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,143,973 for Head 45 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,189,681 for the Heads of Expenditure\r\n\r\nand  for the services specified in the Schedule ordered\r\n\r\nto stand part of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion and Schedule reported, without amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the Motion put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of\r\n\r\n$1,189,681  shall  be supplied to the Government  under\r\n\r\nthe heads of expenditure and for the services specified\r\n\r\nin the Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 2\r\n\r\nof 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 3 of 1959)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.38 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation\r\n\r\nto proceed with the motion.

I  refer   to\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. L.A. 22 of 1958. Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nare  aware that the purpose of this amending  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  to implement the recommendations of the Elias\r\n\r\nCommission by embodying them in the law  with  the\r\n\r\nobject    of   eliminating   malpractices   during\r\n\r\nelections.  As  a  result  of  oral  and   written\r\n\r\nrepresentations as well as new proposals  made  in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, a number of amendments  to  the\r\n\r\noriginal Bill have been made. As hon. Members have\r\n\r\nhad  a  good  deal of time in which to  study  the\r\n\r\nReport, I feel it would be unnecessary for  me  to\r\n\r\ndo  any  more except draw attention to  the  major\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first major amendment is at clause 3. It\r\n\r\nhas nothing to do with the Elias Commission, being\r\n\r\nsolely  concerned with changing the franchise  for\r\n\r\nlocal  government  elections  by  permitting  only\r\n\r\nthose   persons   who  have  been  registered   as\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens to vote. The qualifications for\r\n\r\nvoting  at  local  government  elections  are  now\r\n\r\nidentical  with those required for the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  elections. In other words, the franchise\r\n\r\nis  confined to Singapore citizens. By  virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe   proviso  at  paragraph  (d),  the   existing\r\n\r\nqualifications  will  remain  unchanged  for   the\r\n\r\npurposes of any by-elections which may take  place\r\n\r\nbetween now and the completion of the revision  of\r\n\r\nthe  register of electors towards the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second major amendment is shown at clause\r\n\r\n16,  by  which  a  new Section 41A has  been  added  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for compulsory voting. Views on this amendment\r\n\r\nwere  not unanimous as the Hon. the Minister for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,   Lands  and  Housing  voted  against   its\r\n\r\ninclusion  in the Bill. The amendments made at  clauses\r\n\r\n2,  4, 11 and 14 are consequential on the provision for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting. The principle which is inherent  in\r\n\r\nthe  proposal for compulsory voting is that persons who\r\n\r\nare  now  privileged to become Singapore  citizens  are\r\n\r\nrequired as a duty to vote and not simply regard voting\r\n\r\nas a right which can be ignored without redress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our new Constitution, we have taken into our\r\n\r\nSingapore  family  a large number of  persons  who,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  only eight years' residence, are privileged\r\n\r\nto become Singapore citizens. By introducing compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting,  we  bring  all  these  citizens  into   active\r\n\r\nparticipation in elections. On the one hand, therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  have a proper status and a stake in this  country\r\n\r\nand have a voice in its affairs, and on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthey   are   expected  to  exercise  their   vote   and\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  tangibly  their interest  and  loyalty  by\r\n\r\ndischarging their duty by voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recollect that the Government had\r\n\r\nreceived  representations from many  organisations  and\r\n\r\nindividuals  urging  upon the Government  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting and in deference to their wishes  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   agreed   to   give   support   to    their\r\n\r\nrepresentations. My colleague, the Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and Housing, however,  is  under  a\r\n\r\nspecial  directive from his Party to oppose  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting and I have therefore given him and the Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister for Education permission to take their Party's\r\n\r\nstand on this issue. As this is a matter which concerns\r\n\r\nall  political Parties represented in the Assembly  and\r\n\r\nas Members of the Select Committee were drawn from such\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties, it was fully discussed at  informal\r\n\r\nmeetings  and,  apart  from  the  Minister  for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Lands and Housing there was no  opposition\r\n\r\nto compulsory voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also considered that compulsory voting will,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  other  measures  which  have  been\r\n\r\nwritten  into  the  Bill, reduce the opportunities  for\r\n\r\nmalpractices such as intimidation and coercion  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate. In fact, the Elias Commission  was  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that a system of compulsory voting would be the\r\n\r\nmost  important single measure that could lead  to  the\r\n\r\nelimination of corrupt practices. Another reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwas  on  account of the inaccuracies in the  registers,\r\n\r\nwhich,  for various reasons, are thought to be as  high\r\n\r\nas  20 per cent inaccurate. With compulsory voting  the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers can be corrected once and for  all.\r\n\r\nIt   is  for  these  several  important  reasons   that\r\n\r\nprovision has been made for compulsory voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noticed that in the event of persons\r\n\r\nfailing  to vote, mild sanctions are imposed. I  should\r\n\r\nmention  that  Members  of  the  Select  Committee  had\r\n\r\ninformal discussions on the sanctions proposed and  the\r\n\r\neffect  on the public. It was generally agreed that  as\r\n\r\nthis  would be the first time that many members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  will be visiting the polls, it was not intended\r\n\r\nthat the legal sanction should be harsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was necessary, however, to provide an inducement\r\n\r\nto  all voters, old and new, to discharge their duty on\r\n\r\npolling day. It was agreed to recommend as a Government\r\n\r\npolicy  to  confine State organised social benefits  to\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore and their families whose  names,\r\n\r\nif  their ages are 21 and above, should appear  on  the\r\n\r\nelectoral   roll.  Such  benefits  are   free   medical\r\n\r\ntreatment, unemployment and other relief, free  primary\r\n\r\neducation,  S.I.T. accommodation, etc.  The  issue  of\r\n\r\npassports and employment in the Civil Service are  also\r\n\r\npoints of Government policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of transport to the polling stations,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment at subclause (2) of clause  22  confines\r\n\r\nthe  use of motor vehicles to the owner and members  of\r\n\r\nhis  family. A definition of \"member of his family\"  is\r\n\r\ngiven at subclause (3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision to regulate the display of posters\r\n\r\nand  banners  has  been added at  clause  24.

We were told in 1957 that they would\r\n\r\nbe  held  at the beginning of 1958. After the  disaster\r\n\r\nthey  encountered  in the City Council  elections,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  tarried and dallied. In  the  middle  of\r\n\r\n1958, we were told that there might be elections at the\r\n\r\nend of 1958. Now in 1959 all pretence has been dropped,\r\n\r\nand  it  is openly acknowledged that there will  be  no\r\n\r\nelections  to the District Council during the  life  of\r\n\r\nthis  Government. So why are we debating  this  bit  of\r\n\r\nshadow legislation? What is the purpose of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a good thing that the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nelections  are  not  so much at the  disposal  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  the  Local Government  elections  were,\r\n\r\notherwise  it may well be that 1959 would not  see  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Elections. However, we were informed that  some\r\n\r\nof  the principles which we debated in Select Committee\r\n\r\nmight be embodied in the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections (Amendment) Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have had the Bill for a few days and when\r\n\r\nthat  Bill  comes up for Second Reading and  goes  into\r\n\r\nCommittee, we shall inform the Government of our views.\r\n\r\nIf  it  were  possible,  I would  like  to  inform  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment of our views before it comes up for Second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReading.  After all, we are all publicly  committed  to\r\n\r\nfree   elections - whatever  each  Member  may  privately\r\n\r\ndesire.  And  since we are all committed to  trying  to\r\n\r\nframe  rules  to  ensure  free  and  decent  and  clean\r\n\r\nelections,  it  should not be difficult  so  to  devise\r\n\r\nthings  that gangsters are nicely put out of  the  way.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  it hurts the Member for Serangoon,  who  is  a\r\n\r\nschoolmaster, to have schoolboys put out of the way;  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen  his own students working not for his  Party\r\n\r\nbut  for  some  other Party, and if the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthinks  that  compulsory  voting  might  yet  save  the\r\n\r\nsinking  S.P.A.,  ex-Labour Front, ex-Progressive,  ex-Liberal-Socialist - \r\n\r\nall the political  riff-raff  and flotsam and jetsam, then we will-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The voters will  judge  the\r\n\r\npersons whom they are going to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one would\r\n\r\nlike  to  comment  on compulsory voting.  Personally  I\r\n\r\nthink compulsory voting is rather undemocratic. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, compulsory voting would give the masses  a\r\n\r\nchance to give expression to their demands. I say  this\r\n\r\nbecause  I  want  to quote one incident which  happened\r\n\r\nduring  the by-election in Tanjong Pagar in  1956.  One\r\n\r\nwas  the  way the members or supporters of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party behaved themselves during that time. Their\r\n\r\nmethods  remind  me of violence and gangsterism.  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring to an incident which occurred after  the  by-election  result was known, that is, about midnight.  A\r\n\r\nfew  hundred  supporters of the People's  Action  Party\r\n\r\nwere  marching  in  regimental order along  Kreta  Ayer\r\n\r\nRoad. They then cut into Keong Siak Road and Sago Lane,\r\n\r\nwhere the death houses were. This band of people, while\r\n\r\nmarching  along the road, were shouting \"Oompa  Oompa,\r\n\r\nMerdeka!\"  I do not mind this expression at  all.  This\r\n\r\ngroup  of unruly ruffians or hooligans then arrived  at\r\n\r\nthe  Branch Office of the Liberal-Socialist  Party.  In\r\n\r\nfront of the Branch Office was a coffee\r\n\r\nstall, and across the road there was a banner put up by\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialist. Party candidate, Mr Chong  Wee\r\n\r\nLing.  When this group of people came to the  front  of\r\n\r\nthis  Branch Office, they behaved in a violent  manner.\r\n\r\nThis  reminded  me  of  the Hock Lee  Bus  riots.  They\r\n\r\nclimbed  on to one another's shoulders and pulled  down\r\n\r\nthe banner, and tore it into strips\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  they then tied together. They then marched along\r\n\r\nthe  road like a funeral procession. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthey  tore down the posters of Mr Chong Wee Ling  from\r\n\r\nthe coffee stall, which were pasted by the sympathisers\r\n\r\nof  our Party. The stall was then smashed by these same\r\n\r\nhooligans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is to allow expression by the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Do we want a party in  power  to\r\n\r\nadopt  such violent and gangster methods or not? I  for\r\n\r\none  would  advocate that the people who  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthese hooligans should be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon.

One can now see the force of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  show  how lamblike they  are  and  honestly\r\n\r\ntrusting  the Communists. They are men who  would  use,\r\n\r\nwithout compunction, the strong-arm and violent methods\r\n\r\nof gangsters to get into power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the House\r\n\r\nto  another fact, if compulsory voting is going  to  be\r\n\r\nadopted. In my area alone there are over 1,000  voters.\r\n\r\nThey  are  staying  in  huts and attap  houses  in  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  division  of  Tiong  Bahru.  The  Statistics\r\n\r\nDepartment   go  by  the  boundary  in  compiling   the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers. The even numbers in the  area  and\r\n\r\nthe  odd numbers in the other area along the main  road\r\n\r\nwill  be divided, so much so that the people living  in\r\n\r\nmy  kampong  have  had  their  names  compiled  in  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  register of Delta Division. If  the  polling\r\n\r\nstation for the same voter is in the Delta area,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  do you expect these people, most of whom are  old,\r\n\r\nto go from Tiong Bahru to Delta Road area to cast their\r\n\r\nvotes,  a  distance of about one mile? I  have  pointed\r\n\r\nthis  out  to  the  Commissioner of  Elections  and  he\r\n\r\nreplied  to  me  that he was unable to  transfer  these\r\n\r\npeople from the electoral register of Delta area to the\r\n\r\nelectoral  register of Tiong Bahru. Sir, I  would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  something about the compilation  of  the\r\n\r\nrecords. I should say that about 30 to 40 per  cent  on\r\n\r\nthe register are inaccurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I took part in the election at Tanjong Pagar, I\r\n\r\nfound  that  90  cards,  with  the  voters'  names  and\r\n\r\naddresses printed on them, were distributed to  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  houses there. In actual fact, there were  only  40\r\n\r\npeople  living in this house. Why cannot the Government\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to  rectify this mistake? Why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nGovernment see to it that the people who do not live in\r\n\r\nthese  houses  should be debarred  from  casting  their\r\n\r\nvotes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back now to the question of voters in my\r\n\r\narea - it is rather strange that Government expect  those\r\n\r\npeople  living in my area, that is, in Tiong Bahru, to\r\n\r\ncast  their votes in the Delta constituency to elect  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  to represent their interests in a  different\r\n\r\nconstituency,  that  is, electing a  representative  in\r\n\r\nDelta  to represent the people who live in Tiong Bahru.\r\n\r\nThis  is  most  ridiculous.  But  I  cannot  blame  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Statistics, Sir, because I found out that\r\n\r\nthey  compiled  the  registers by the  numbers  of  the\r\n\r\nhouses.  Take, for instance, people living alongside  a\r\n\r\nlong  road.  The  houses on one  side  will  have  even\r\n\r\nnumbers  and  the opposite side will have odd  numbers.\r\n\r\nThe even numbers will fall into one electoral register,\r\n\r\nand  the  odd numbers will fall into another  electoral\r\n\r\nregister.  For instance, the Tiong Bahru register  will\r\n\r\ninclude  all  houses with even numbers irrespective  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that some of the even numbers of houses  are\r\n\r\nsituated  in  another area, say Delta  area.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  Department take the road as  the  dividing\r\n\r\nline. I hope the Government will take steps to put  the\r\n\r\nvoters back in their respective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency.  That is, the voters who  live  in  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru, but whose names appear in the register of voters\r\n\r\nin  the Delta constituency, should be transferred  back\r\n\r\nto the Tiong Bahru register. I am sure that other areas\r\n\r\nhave  the  same  problem as my area  has.  I  took  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  of  looking into the question of voters  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  constituency and I found  that  the  figures\r\n\r\ncame  to  over  1,000  people - over  1,000  voters   are\r\n\r\ninvolved. I would urge the Government to see that  this\r\n\r\nmistake be rectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would support compulsory voting. As I said,\r\n\r\nit  would  give the people the opportunity  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir feelings, and to decide whether they want a Party\r\n\r\nwhich  adopts  the methods of gangsterism  or  a  Party\r\n\r\nwhich adopts a democratic method to run Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to talk on compulsory voting.

Sir, I was really\r\n\r\nimpressed by his enthusiasm at that time. He talked  in\r\n\r\na very business-like manner. He said that we must clean\r\n\r\nup  all  these things; we must prevent the  thugs  from\r\n\r\nrunning  the elections; we must prevent those  who  are\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  from participating in the elections,  and\r\n\r\nwe  must  sit down and seriously think what methods  we\r\n\r\nmust   adopt   to  make  our  elections   clean.   Very\r\n\r\ncommendable, Sir, I would like to commend him  further,\r\n\r\nSir,  because, after the discussion in the first Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  meeting,  and at his own  request,  we  were\r\n\r\ncalled  to an All-Party Committee meeting at the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office.  We put up proposals  and  counter-proposals.  Every detail was discussed, right  down  to\r\n\r\nposters,  compulsory voting, use of students, this  and\r\n\r\nthat.  He  was most enthusiastic. I think he should  be\r\n\r\ngiven a medal for showing such public spiritedness. But\r\n\r\nafter  hearing  him today saying: \"Look,  this  is  all\r\n\r\nuseless. Take the Bill away. We are wasting our  time\",\r\n\r\nI just cannot reconcile the action he showed previously\r\n\r\nwith his present action. What is all this about? Why is\r\n\r\nthe  change? Why should we have the change? Who  should\r\n\r\nhave the change? Should the change be initiated by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, or by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar?  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  if the change were initiated from the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthen  everything  should be all right.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should be very happy. But  if  anybody  else\r\n\r\nshould  initiate it, then it would be a waste  of  time\r\n\r\nfor  this  Assembly.  No,  Sir.

I think the hon. Member has gone\r\n\r\nvery,  very  far  from the Bill. Now  he  seems  to  be\r\n\r\nstraying  a  little further. Let us come  back  to  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I was just commenting on a few\r\n\r\npoints  which  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  had  said\r\n\r\nduring  the Third Reading and which had interested  me,\r\n\r\nand  I  thought we should also let him have our opinion\r\n\r\non  the  same subject! I was saying that talking  about\r\n\r\nall  these changes, it should not be just the  wish  of\r\n\r\none   Party   to  change  but  the  wish  of  everybody\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come back to the question of compulsory voting.\r\n\r\nI  think  it is a very good measure, because the  Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  wins  will know that it has the support  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people and not of a small  section  of\r\n\r\nthe people. Compulsory voting, Sir, will rule out to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent the use of thugs, as alleged  by  Members\r\n\r\nhere.  It  will tone down the use of schoolchildren  in\r\n\r\nthe electioneering campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been referred to as a school teacher. I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is,  after all, a very good thing  to  be  a\r\n\r\nschool  teacher  and  to  be able  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests of school children and not just to  make  use\r\n\r\nof  them. Today, school children stay at their work  to\r\n\r\nstudy  their lessons, and not influenced by  the  rebel\r\n\r\ntalks  of  those people, need not go to  principals  or\r\n\r\nteachers  to ask that they be promoted, or  plead  that\r\n\r\nthey  be found an extra school to go to. I have  always\r\n\r\nbeen of the opinion that the people who really have the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the children at heart should refrain  from\r\n\r\nusing  them.  They should ask them to  think  of  their\r\n\r\nstudies  first,  so that when they  grow  up  they  may\r\n\r\nbetter  be  able to serve Singapore, instead  of  their\r\n\r\nhaving ideas put in their heads, being sent on a  wild-goose  chase, neglecting their lessons and  failing  in\r\n\r\ntheir  examinations.  How  many  of  them  have  failed\r\n\r\nmiserably?  If you look at the list of failures,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  you  will find that those who are most active  in\r\n\r\nshouting  slogans and marching down Kreta  Ayer  Street\r\n\r\nwill be amongst them. Now, after they have failed, they\r\n\r\nask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government or public-spirited people to help them.\r\n\r\nI would say we have helped them. But those who make use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof them have no solution for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the idea of getting these children away from\r\n\r\nall electioneering is a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, back in the year\r\n\r\n1956  the  Branch Secretaries of the Labour Front  were\r\n\r\nmeeting regularly and were considering the work of  the\r\n\r\n1955 elections and the work that would be necessary for\r\n\r\nelections which were foreseen as possible in 1957,  and\r\n\r\nthey  produced the proposals which finally  took  fruit\r\n\r\njust  over  2\u00bd years later in this Bill. Substantially\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  embodies  the proposals  then  put  forward\r\n\r\nthrough  my  friend,  Gerald de  Cruz,  by  the  Branch\r\n\r\nSecretaries of the Labour Front - for compulsory  voting,\r\n\r\nholidays, control of transport, the use of transport by\r\n\r\ncandidates. The findings of the Elias Commission, which\r\n\r\nare  also related to this Bill, were substantially  the\r\n\r\nfindings of that group of Labour Front workers at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  The Elias Commission did it more thoroughly  and\r\n\r\nmore  judicially,  but the matters  discussed  and  the\r\n\r\nconclusions arrived at were the same. Sir, it makes  me\r\n\r\nhappy  to  think that the principles embodied  in  this\r\n\r\nBill  are  ones which find the general assent  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, however they may regard details of timing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one basic principle in politics, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhich I think this Bill protects and which is best  put\r\n\r\nin  the  words of Confucius. I can quote  them  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish version:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When a man's mind is ruled by passion, his conduct\r\n\r\nwill be incorrect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is already obvious, Mr Speaker, that in this\r\n\r\nAssembly you are most scrupulously watching to see that\r\n\r\nour  minds  do  not  become moved by  passion  and  our\r\n\r\nconduct  does  not err into indecorum.  You  have  been\r\n\r\npulling up speakers very frequently for verging on  the\r\n\r\nbounds of indecorous words from which they might go  on\r\n\r\nno doubt into undesirable actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the elections become closer, so politicians\r\n\r\nwill  allow themselves to be guided by their  feelings;\r\n\r\nand more than that I am afraid. From past experience, I\r\n\r\nconsider it a certainty that politicians will  seek  to\r\n\r\nget  the  people of Singapore guided by their feelings.\r\n\r\nThey will try to work them up, to make them feel, \"Away\r\n\r\nwith  this, and away with that!\" The still small  voice\r\n\r\nof  reason  will be less and less heard,  except  where\r\n\r\nreason  can  be used as a machine to produce  emotional\r\n\r\nresults.  It  is, to some extent, a necessary  part  of\r\n\r\npolitical  life  that politicians should  try  to  stir\r\n\r\nmen's  hearts and rouse their feelings, because a great\r\n\r\nmany  people  undoubtedly are not profoundly  moved  by\r\n\r\npolitical affairs. They go forward in their daily lives\r\n\r\nnot  interested  in the complicated courses  which  may\r\n\r\nmake  them in fact happy or unhappy. It is not for most\r\n\r\npeople  a matter of intellectual interest to study  the\r\n\r\ntrade figures of Singapore. They frequently appear  not\r\n\r\nto  realise  that  on the figures of  trade  and  on  a\r\n\r\nsensible  interpretation  of  them  depends  their  own\r\n\r\nexpectation   of  future  employment,  prosperity,   of\r\n\r\nadequate  hospital services and education services  and\r\n\r\nall  the other things that they get, which are  in  the\r\n\r\nend a share of the profits of Singapore's trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, if we are to interest people in\r\n\r\npolicies,  we have to try to bring those policies  down\r\n\r\ninto  their  daily lives and put them into words  which\r\n\r\nwill stir their minds and move them. It can be done  in\r\n\r\na good way. It can be done in a bad way, it is the part\r\n\r\nof the honest politician to present it truthfully, only\r\n\r\nillustrating it so as to make it understandable. If you\r\n\r\ncome  with  long academic words and profound scientific\r\n\r\nexplanations to an audience of people who  cannot  more\r\n\r\nthan  barely  read  and  write, with  a  vocabulary  of\r\n\r\nperhaps  1,000 or 1,500 words, you cannot  expect  they\r\n\r\nwill listen to you with attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem of the school master - and it\r\n\r\nrefers  to  my own profession - teaching in school  where\r\n\r\nyou  have to teach difficult subjects in simple  words.\r\n\r\nThe  same thing applies to politics. Consequently,  the\r\n\r\nhonest  and good politician will study his subject  and\r\n\r\nsee in what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway it can be presented so that it can be understood by\r\n\r\npeople who have not a great deal of time to spare,  and\r\n\r\nwho  have  already  done a heavy  day's  work  and  are\r\n\r\nsacrificing their own leisure time to come  and  listen\r\n\r\nto him talking. He will try to make his explanations of\r\n\r\npolitical affairs interesting and significant to  them.\r\n\r\nBut  because  things  have to be often  put  in  simple\r\n\r\npolitical  terms, there is a great temptation  for  the\r\n\r\ndishonest politician to misrepresent the facts or  even\r\n\r\nto  tell lies. It is this which provides a great danger\r\n\r\nto Singapore, and has provided it in the past, and will\r\n\r\nprovide  it  in the future, as it does in  any  country\r\n\r\nwhere  people  go  out and try to  win  for  themselves\r\n\r\npopular  support. It applies not only  to  politicians,\r\n\r\nbut  it  also applies to all attempts to secure popular\r\n\r\nsupport, whether in your trying to sell a soft drink or\r\n\r\na  patent  medicine or a newspaper or any  other  thing\r\n\r\nwhere your success depends on bringing in hundreds  and\r\n\r\nthousands  of people to say, \"That is very good.  I  am\r\n\r\nfor  that.\"  The  temptation to  dishonesty  is  always\r\n\r\nthere, and very often people yield more or less to that\r\n\r\ntemptation.  It  would not be hard to bring  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - in  fact  I  have one here - election  addresses\r\n\r\nsent  out  to the voters of Singapore in which  blatant\r\n\r\nlies  were  told  and  things were misrepresented.  The\r\n\r\ntruth   was   shirked   and   intentionally   dishonest\r\n\r\nstatements were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee which sat on this Bill, there\r\n\r\nwas  one  point which I noticed. There was the question\r\n\r\nof the interpretation of a Malay word. Whether it meant\r\n\r\nthat  the minds of the public were disturbed or whether\r\n\r\nit  meant that the minds of the public were - I  forgot\r\n\r\nwhat  the  other  interpretation was.  Anyhow,  it  was\r\n\r\ndiscussed in the Select Committee and the witness  said\r\n\r\nhe  did not mean that people's minds were disturbed  in\r\n\r\nany bad way. But, nevertheless, they were disturbed  by\r\n\r\nthe  two or three months of intensive shouting and  the\r\n\r\nrudeness  and  so on which goes on between  politicians\r\n\r\nbefore elections start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness in the Select Committee suggested that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be two or three days before  the  actual\r\n\r\npolling day during which political activity must  stop,\r\n\r\nso that the voters would have a chance to cool down and\r\n\r\nconsider  soberly what had been said,  what  the  facts\r\n\r\nreally were and then cast their votes in sober judgment\r\n\r\nand  not  in  the  excitement of a mind  inflamed  with\r\n\r\nelectoral oratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that has not been provided, but at least it has\r\n\r\nbeen  provided that on polling day itself the  mind  of\r\n\r\nthe elector shall be left free, and there shall not  be\r\n\r\nattempts  to  control  or  intimidate  or  persuade  or\r\n\r\ninfluence  him  as he prepares himself  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\npolls.  As he goes there, the parades of all kinds  and\r\n\r\ndescriptions of men - some of rather menacing aspect - whom\r\n\r\nwe  have seen standing outside polling stations in  the\r\n\r\npast,  will I hope not be seen again. If they start  to\r\n\r\nhang around 200 yards from the polling station - that  is\r\n\r\nthe  distance fixed in the Ordinance - then  I  hope  the\r\n\r\npolice will stand a few hundred yards away as well  and\r\n\r\nwill say, \"Will you please move along the street, which\r\n\r\nis  for  people  to pass along, and not for  people  to\r\n\r\nloiter in?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in the Kallang by-election there was an\r\n\r\ninformal agreement between the Parties not to put these\r\n\r\nwatchers or supervisors outside the polling stations to\r\n\r\nwatch the people coming to the polls. But it had little\r\n\r\neffect.  In  fact,  the  day  ended  with  very   large\r\n\r\naccumulations  of people wearing all  sorts  of  little\r\n\r\nfunny hats lining up outside. I myself observed elderly\r\n\r\nand  quiet looking people coming, as it were, with  the\r\n\r\nintention of voting and then looking rather dismayed. I\r\n\r\nsaw  two elderly Chinese ladies, for example. They came\r\n\r\nalong,  talking,  with their bits  of  paper  in  their\r\n\r\nhands,  and  then they suddenly looked  up  from  their\r\n\r\ntalk.  They  saw the accumulated crowd  and  then  they\r\n\r\nlooked  at  each  other and had a short  conference  or\r\n\r\nconsultation. Then they turned round and went away.  At\r\n\r\nleast  two  people did not cast their votes  that  day,\r\n\r\nbecause  they saw a crowd of people there.  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquiet  people;  we  do not want to  walk  through  this\r\n\r\nbattery of staring eyes, all trying to wonder which way\r\n\r\nwe are going to vote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I very much welcome the provisions in this law\r\n\r\nthat  on polling day the political Parties should  keep\r\n\r\nquiet  and  stay at home and let the voters go  to  the\r\n\r\npolling  stations, with their minds made up  not  under\r\n\r\nthe  influence of passion - whether anger or fear or  any\r\n\r\nother  passion.  Let the voters go to  the  polls  with\r\n\r\ntheir minds free to think and judge wisely. That  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat step forward, I think, among the things which are\r\n\r\nworth achieving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also personally welcome the introduction of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  polling  or  voting,  whichever  word   you\r\n\r\nprefer.   I  suppose  the  point  has  been  thoroughly\r\n\r\nstudied,  but  the  effect, of course,  is  that  in  a\r\n\r\ncompulsory poll, a voter has to turn up and go  through\r\n\r\nthe  motions of voting; and if he likes to  write  some\r\n\r\nrude remarks on his paper or draw pictures of somebody,\r\n\r\nor  do  any other action, it should not be possible  to\r\n\r\nfind  out what he has done since he has voted secretly,\r\n\r\nbecause  this compulsory polling is, I feel, a  further\r\n\r\nsafeguard for the peace of mind of the voters.  If  all\r\n\r\nmust  vote,  then it is harder to say of any individual\r\n\r\nwhether he has voted this way or he has voted that way,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  just one small drop in  a  very  large\r\n\r\nocean.  The smaller the po1i, the easier will  a  voter\r\n\r\nfeel  it  for  an unsuccessful candidate afterwards  to\r\n\r\nsay, \"I believe you voted for the other man, and now  I\r\n\r\nam going to pay you out for it.\" That is a danger which\r\n\r\nwill certainly be feared by voters sometimes, and it is\r\n\r\nmost  important that they should not feel  that.  Under\r\n\r\nthese  proposals, the crowd will be greater, the number\r\n\r\nof votes will be greater, and the chance of identifying\r\n\r\nthe feelings of any particular voter will therefore  be\r\n\r\nless.  For  that  reason alone,  compulsory  voting  or\r\n\r\npolling is a very desirable thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable on other grounds as well, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  We  have  seen  a  number  of  elections   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  My  mind  goes back to 1955.  Approximately\r\n\r\n156,000  voted then, if I remember rightly.  Officially\r\n\r\nthat  was  about  53  per cent  of  the  poll.  If  the\r\n\r\nregisters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  20 per cent inaccurate, as they usually are,\r\n\r\nthen  it was more like 66 per cent of the possible\r\n\r\npoll.  Anyhow, it was a fair vote,  though  not  a\r\n\r\nvery  heavy  one. Now in that poll,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthere were 25 Members elected to this Assembly. Of\r\n\r\nthose  25,  the great majority were elected  by  a\r\n\r\nminority vote. They may not like to have  it  said\r\n\r\nof them but, nevertheless, it is certainly true. I\r\n\r\nremember  the  indignation with which  the  former\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, Mr D. S. Marshall,  received  my\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the election results, when  I  quite\r\n\r\ninnocently remarked that the Labour Front won five\r\n\r\nof its ten seats on a minority poll, including the\r\n\r\nCairnhill  Division where the Labour Front  polled\r\n\r\n3,500  votes  and  the  Opposition  Parties -   the\r\n\r\nProgressives  and  the  Democrats  - polled   3,630\r\n\r\nvotes;  so  that what was a fairly  nice  majority\r\n\r\nover  the  next candidate was, in fact, a minority\r\n\r\nvote  for  the Socialist side and a majority  vote\r\n\r\nfor the capitalist side. That was completely shown\r\n\r\nin  the Cairnhill by-election thereafter, when the\r\n\r\ncapitalist vote undoubtedly carried the day.  That\r\n\r\ncase, I think, applied to about 14 or 15 of those\r\n\r\nelected to this Assembly and if there had  been  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  method of voting they  would  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  here.  They  are here because  there  was  a\r\n\r\nsingle vote and the man had got, say, 1,100  votes\r\n\r\nand his two opponents got 1,000 votes each. He has\r\n\r\ndefinitely  only got about a third  of  the  total\r\n\r\nvotes  cast, but as he has got the largest  single\r\n\r\nnumber of votes he becomes an Assemblyman and says\r\n\r\nvery   proudly,  \"I  speak  for  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore!\"  What he speaks for is a few  thousand\r\n\r\npeople   who  voted  for  him,  and  in  his   own\r\n\r\nconstituency the majority of the people would have\r\n\r\nvoted  against  him if they could.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthey  could not agree whom to vote for, and he  is\r\n\r\nnow   sitting  in  the  Assembly.  These  are  the\r\n\r\ninevitable  results of our electoral system  which\r\n\r\nis  modelled  on  the electoral  system  of  Great\r\n\r\nBritain; and the justification for it - if it  is  a\r\n\r\njustification - is not so much that it gives  effect\r\n\r\nto  the  wishes  of the people, as that,  it  does\r\n\r\nsecure  that  a government comes into power  which\r\n\r\nhas a useful majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn  the  whole, the tendency is to  give  a  small\r\n\r\nminority of voters the decisive word which  throws\r\n\r\nthe   majority  in  the  Assembly.  If   I   might\r\n\r\nillustrate that, Mr Speaker, by referring to one\r\n\r\ncase in this little textbook. In Great Britain  in\r\n\r\n1931,  the  Conservative Party  polled  12,730,000\r\n\r\nvotes  and got 460 seats in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe   Liberal  and  Labour  Parties  polled   over\r\n\r\n9,500,00  votes and got 250 seats in the House  of\r\n\r\nCommons. The Conservative Party got 120 more seats\r\n\r\nthan  their votes would have justified.  In  other\r\n\r\ncases,  the  additional seats achieved  have  been\r\n\r\nstill higher sometimes. It may go to any Party. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter much to which Party it goes.  The\r\n\r\ntendency  possibly will be in the future  for  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Party in Britain to get advantage of  that\r\n\r\nsystem of voting for single members where you have\r\n\r\nto make a choice, and if your choice is not one of\r\n\r\nthe majority, your voice is not heard at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, as we bring in compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting,   we   shall  I  think  do  something   to\r\n\r\nensure - not necessarily that every man or woman  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  has the unanimous  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  constituency  where  he  or   she\r\n\r\nstands - because it is most unlikely that he or  she\r\n\r\nwill - and  I  shall expect myself that  any  future\r\n\r\nAssembly will contain a great many Members who  do\r\n\r\nnot  represent the majority of the voters in their\r\n\r\nconstituencies but who represent a  minority,  but\r\n\r\nthe  largest  minority that has managed  to  agree\r\n\r\ntogether...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to look back to 1955, if I may\r\n\r\nlook  back to it. Had the Liberal-Socialist  Party\r\n\r\nbeen   formed, say,  in  1954  and  fought   the\r\n\r\nelections  and  had the Member for Telok  Ayer  at\r\n\r\nthat  time been a member of the Party and  not  an\r\n\r\nIndependent,  then  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party\r\n\r\nwould have had the seats to form the Government if\r\n\r\nthey  had  been  able to get the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.-M,C.A. Alliance. They would  have  had  a\r\n\r\nclear  majority  and  they  would  not  even  have\r\n\r\nneeded,  I  think, Members nominated to  fill  up\r\n\r\ntheir  Benches. The nominated Members  could  have\r\n\r\nsat  on the other side if they had wanted to. They\r\n\r\nwould have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainly not needed a nominated Minister like  myself.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Serangoon, as the leader of the Liberal-Socialists, might \r\n\r\nwell have been the Chief Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the last four years had  there  been  a\r\n\r\nunited  Right or Liberal-Socialist Party at that  time.\r\n\r\nAlthough,  in fact, the votes as cast showed  a  slight\r\n\r\nmajority - a  few thousand votes-for what you might  call\r\n\r\nthe Left Parties, nevertheless, the Right votes were so\r\n\r\ndistributed  that  had  there been  unity  between  the\r\n\r\nDemocrats and the Progressives at that time, they would\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to form the Government, although  they\r\n\r\nwould not have represented more than 50 per cent of the\r\n\r\nvotes actually cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rather lengthy excursion into an analysis of\r\n\r\nelectoral results, Mr Speaker, is only to reinforce my\r\n\r\npoint  that  compulsory voting will give the  1959-1964\r\n\r\nAssembly a better chance of knowing what the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  want. What the people of Singapore  want  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  the  whole programme  of  any  Party.\r\n\r\nCertainly when we say \"the people of Singapore\", it  is\r\n\r\na loose expression which usually means \"my supporters\",\r\n\r\nbut  not any Party in Singapore is going to command all\r\n\r\nthe  support  of  all  the voters.  But  one  thing  is\r\n\r\ncertain - that  a  very large number of the  voters  will\r\n\r\ndisapprove  of whatever Party comes into power  at  the\r\n\r\nnext elections. How vigorous that disapproval may be it\r\n\r\nis hard to say, but it is very much to be hoped that as\r\n\r\nthe  struggle for votes develops, only fair and  proper\r\n\r\nmeans will be used and feelings of hatred and emotional\r\n\r\nexcitement will not be encouraged. There should  be  no\r\n\r\nneed  for a competent party which knows its party work,\r\n\r\nhas  proper policies, and has taken the trouble to  get\r\n\r\nto   see  the  people,  to  play  on  emotions  in  any\r\n\r\nunreasonable and undesirable way. It should be able  to\r\n\r\nget their votes by clean, honest and truthful politics.\r\n\r\nIt  is  to be hoped that we shall be able to get  that,\r\n\r\nbecause if we do conduct our party politics over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  next  two  or three months on a basis  of  vicious\r\n\r\nattacks  on each other and irresponsible statements  or\r\n\r\nlies  to  the voters, we can then expect that the  next\r\n\r\nGovernment - whatever Government it may be - will come into\r\n\r\npower  against  a wave of bitterness and an  opposition\r\n\r\nwhich   has   committed  itself   to   all   sorts   of\r\n\r\nunjustifiable positions of attack, and then the affairs\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  will  not  be  ruled  by   wisdom   and\r\n\r\nforethought. They will be ruled by emotion and, in  the\r\n\r\nwords of Confucius: \"A mind ruled by passion or emotion\r\n\r\nis a mind which will not be correct in its actions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So compulsory voting will give to the incoming\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  hope, a weight of public opinion  which\r\n\r\nmight otherwise be lacking. They will see that although\r\n\r\nthey  are forming the Government, nevertheless, a large\r\n\r\npercentage  of the people did not vote for  them.  They\r\n\r\ncame to the polis but they did not pass their votes for\r\n\r\nMr  X or Mr Y of Party X or of Party Y. They cast for\r\n\r\nanother  party  and  that in itself should  exercise  a\r\n\r\nmoderating restraint on those who might otherwise  seek\r\n\r\nto  carry  their  personal political  excitements  into\r\n\r\nextremes. In political affairs, the people who make the\r\n\r\ndecisions   are  seldom  those  who  suffer   for   the\r\n\r\ndecisions. The politician makes a mistake but it is the\r\n\r\npoor  people  who  pay for it. He  puts  the  blame  on\r\n\r\nsomebody else and says, \"Well, it was not my fault.  It\r\n\r\nwas  the other chap who did the thing wrongly,\" and  he\r\n\r\nattacks the other Party. But if a factory has gone  out\r\n\r\nof  production and men have lost their jobs;  if  trade\r\n\r\nhas  fallen off and there is less milk for the children\r\n\r\nto  drink so that their bones are not so strong, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  fault  of  the politician. He put himself  into  a\r\n\r\nposition  of  responsibility.  He  made  a  mistake  in\r\n\r\ndecision.  He  got  into  a  muddle;  he  got  into  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary  fight - whatever it is - and he does  not  pay\r\n\r\nthe  price. No, it is the poor people at the bottom who\r\n\r\npay the price - the 370,000 or so people in Singapore who\r\n\r\nlive  on  less  than $1 a day. They are  the  ones  who\r\n\r\nsuffer first - and they will be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nones who will suffer first if the political Parties  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  misconduct themselves in  the  next  general\r\n\r\nelections or in the District Council elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru made one point on which I\r\n\r\nwould  like to express my profound agreement with  him,\r\n\r\nand that is on the difficulties which are presented for\r\n\r\nthe  electorate and indeed for political Parties by the\r\n\r\nregisters which are still far from satisfactory. It  is\r\n\r\na  matter  in  which I personally have been  interested\r\n\r\nsince 1955, I think it was. I received a letter from  a\r\n\r\nman with the correct postal address. He lived somewhere\r\n\r\nin  the area between Braddell Road and Serangoon Garden\r\n\r\nEstate  and  I  had to say \"somewhere  in  that  area\",\r\n\r\nbecause   there  is  no  other  recognisable   way   of\r\n\r\ndescribing it. On the map, it is called \"Ang  Moh  Kio\"\r\n\r\nbut Ang Moh Kio runs for about seven or eight miles and\r\n\r\nyou  cannot identify the words \"Ang Moh Kio\". And  this\r\n\r\nman  wrote  to me a very reasonable letter  asking  for\r\n\r\nsomething or other - I have forgotten what it is  now - and\r\n\r\nI  wrote to him a very reasonable reply. Within about a\r\n\r\nfortnight,  my  letter came back to me in  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nmarked  \"Not delivered - Address not known\", or  whatever\r\n\r\nthe  wording was. I then got on to the Post Office  and\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Can you try and find this man, please? He  has\r\n\r\nwritten  me  a letter. I want to send him a  letter  in\r\n\r\nreply,\";  and  in the end they had to  put  two  postal\r\n\r\ninspectors  on  and they spent two days. Finally,  they\r\n\r\nfound  the  man  who had a proper house with  a  proper\r\n\r\nRural  Board  number on it. Everything was correct;  it\r\n\r\nwas  the correct postal address, but it had never  been\r\n\r\nheard  of by anybody in Singapore, because that is  the\r\n\r\nway  the  local authorities had dealt with their  legal\r\n\r\nduty of fixing street names and house numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was an early example to me of the very serious\r\n\r\nneglect of the rural areas which had taken place in the\r\n\r\npast.   I  do  not  necessarily  blame  the  old  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard - they  worked  within  their  terms  of  what  was\r\n\r\npossible - but there has been very great neglect  in  the\r\n\r\npast of rural and often urban areas as well. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill, I am afraid, true today that as I go through the\r\n\r\nelectoral  register of the rural areas and try  to  see\r\n\r\nwhere the people are living and what they are doing, it\r\n\r\nis almost impossible to say, \"Ah, this man is living at\r\n\r\nsuch a number, and I shall find him at such a place  on\r\n\r\nthe road.\" You will find No. 47, let us say, at the 5th\r\n\r\nmile;  you will find No. 47 at the 7th mile;  they  are\r\n\r\nboth proper numbers and they are both on the same road;\r\n\r\nthey  both have the same numbers and they are two miles\r\n\r\napart. You will also find No. 47 very likely not on the\r\n\r\nroad at all - it is a mile and a half away, at the end of\r\n\r\na  track, a path, over a river and a bridge, and  there\r\n\r\nis  No. 47 as well - still with the same address. It does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily mean getting off the  main  road;  the\r\n\r\nfact is, if you go along some of the roads like Yio Chu\r\n\r\nKang  Road, you will find the house numbering is almost\r\n\r\nincredible in its confusion. It may jump from, say, No.\r\n\r\n30,  to  No. 100 or No. 1000 to No. 30 and back to  No.\r\n\r\n143,  and back to No. 30 again! There is just no system\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those defects have been accumulated over a long time\r\n\r\nand  I  was  interested primarily because  they  caused\r\n\r\ndifficulties for the postal authorities, and because  I\r\n\r\nheld that any man in a civilized country has a right to\r\n\r\nhave  his letters delivered to his door. It is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  point  for the production of  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters. It is not now possible, but I hope  it  will\r\n\r\nbe  done,  to  provide  a renumbering  and  road-naming\r\n\r\nexercise  for the whole of Singapore. I hope  the  work\r\n\r\nwill  go on and be done so that in a year's time anyhow\r\n\r\nit  will be possible to produce correct registers,  and\r\n\r\nevery man, woman or child living in Singapore will have\r\n\r\na  proper  address; and every political party  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  look  into the registers and reasonably  know\r\n\r\nthat  such  an  address  means such  a  place  and  not\r\n\r\nsomewhere  five  miles  off. It is,  however,  a  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  responsibility, although  it  is  one  with\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government is also concerned, at  least  my\r\n\r\nMinistry is concerned, because my Ministry is concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  delivery of letters or telegrams,  and  that\r\n\r\nkind of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have spoken at rather great length, I am afraid, but I do want to make clear to the House my\r\n\r\nstrong  support  for the principles  embodied  in  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  of government of any country has the  right  in\r\n\r\nconferring   rights  on  its  citizens  to   expect   a\r\n\r\ncorresponding  duty from its citizens. I  am  proud  to\r\n\r\nsay,  Sir,  that  this Government  has  given  to  some\r\n\r\n300,000 aliens resident in Singapore the right to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the first time. It is, therefore, not too much for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to ask these citizens to  show  whether\r\n\r\nthey  want  these  rights or not. If  they  want  these\r\n\r\nrights,  they  should vote. If they do not  vote,  then\r\n\r\ntheir rights will be taken away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has been accused of doing many\r\n\r\nwrong things, but no one can accuse this Government  of\r\n\r\nhaving  done wrong in giving these 300,000  people  the\r\n\r\nright  to  vote for the first time. For over a  hundred\r\n\r\nyears,  Sir, however long resident you might have  been\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, you have had no right to have a  say  in\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  But  now  these  rights  have   been\r\n\r\nconferred by this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have boasted that they had an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  success  in the City  Council  elections,\r\n\r\nforgetting  that at that election there was a  suicidal\r\n\r\nalliance  between  the  Labour  Front  and  the  P.A.P. \r\n\r\n- suicide  for the Labour Front! We were given Divisions\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Right-wing was strong; we were  taken  away\r\n\r\nfrom  Divisions  where the Left-wing  was  strong.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. won and the Labour Front lost! Sir,  this  time\r\n\r\nthings may be different. This time we have 300,000  new\r\n\r\nvoters. No one can forecast how they are going to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must support compulsory voting. I, on my\r\n\r\nside,  feel  certain that the Government  will  provide\r\n\r\nbooths for the people, bringing the voting stations  to\r\n\r\nthe  people, and not asking people to go to the  voting\r\n\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar's tactics recently have  been\r\n\r\nto  declare  that all measures that the Government  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  since last month are futile - that  they  are\r\n\r\njust  written  words  with  no  meaning - and  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot carry out the essence  of  the  law.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  he  said that this Bill would  just  remain\r\n\r\n\"certain  words\",  I was wondering whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s intention to try to break what is contained in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill by manoeuvring in such a way that they  will\r\n\r\nescape  the written words of the law and yet in essence\r\n\r\nstill do what they like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is important for certain\r\n\r\nreasons. After the achievement of the status under  the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution, there was a clamour by hundreds of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  people,  who have made  Singapore  their\r\n\r\nhome,  to acquire citizenship rights so that they could\r\n\r\nbelong  to  this place. That clamour meant,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  the rights of citizenship, the  right  to\r\n\r\nbelong  to Singapore, the right to participate  in  the\r\n\r\nshaping  of their destiny, the right to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  running  of  government at  all  levels - local  and\r\n\r\nlegislative levels. Sir, since they clamored for  these\r\n\r\nrights,  they must exercise the most fundamental  right\r\n\r\nof   all  these  rights,  and  that  is  the  right  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in electing representatives of  their  own\r\n\r\nchoice -  compulsory voting will ensure that the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore get the government they really  want.  In\r\n\r\nthis way, they cannot afterwards complain that, as  far\r\n\r\nas  the  total voting strength is concerned, they  have\r\n\r\ngot  a  government  which  does  not  have  an  overall\r\n\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is, Sir, a much deeper significance in this\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting,  and that is this.  The  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  on  the British pattern has in England  evolved\r\n\r\nover  a  period of centuries into what it is today.  We\r\n\r\ncan see that it is by evolution, because even up to now\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom has no written Constitution. It  is\r\n\r\na Constitution which has been evolved through practice.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  system is being handed over to  most  Asian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the form of written Constitutions, which they adopt\r\n\r\non their attaining independence from a colonial status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the history of most of the Asian\r\n\r\nnations.  We  find, Sir, in the history of  many  Asian\r\n\r\nnations  that  before the imposition of  colonial  rule\r\n\r\nduring the last century or the century before, they had\r\n\r\na   pattern  of  one-man  rule  and  that  the  British\r\n\r\ndemocratic system did not obtain in many of these Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.  Therefore,  it  is  an  experiment  on  the\r\n\r\nBritish democratic pattern that we are playing with  in\r\n\r\nAsia today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Western countries, fears have been expressed\r\n\r\nrecently   at   the  coming  into  power  of   military\r\n\r\ngovernments in some of the Asian countries.  I  do  not\r\n\r\ndeny,  Sir, that some of the military governments  that\r\n\r\nhave   taken  over  the  charge  of  affairs  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries  have been more beneficial than the  previous\r\n\r\nelected governments. But the point is that the workings\r\n\r\nof  the democratic system are being questioned in these\r\n\r\ncountries  today, because if the democratic system  had\r\n\r\nfunctioned well, then it would not have been  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the military governments to take over. Originally,\r\n\r\nSir,  the democratic system, and in fact in law  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  so today, is a system where an individual stands\r\n\r\nfor  election in a defined area and is returned  as  an\r\n\r\nindividual. The party system does not exist in law. But\r\n\r\nit  is  unfortunate, Sir, that in the British  pattern,\r\n\r\nafter evolution, it came about that cliques began to be\r\n\r\nformed.  These  cliques were officially  recognized  as\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties, and therefore,  what  you  can  get\r\n\r\ntoday   is   either  dictatorship  by   one   man,   or\r\n\r\ndictatorship  by a military commander, or  dictatorship\r\n\r\nby  a  military government, or even dictatorship  by  a\r\n\r\nParty,  which can then ignore the democratic system  if\r\n\r\nit has got sufficient strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant manner in which the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  has  expressed his belief that whatever  we  do,\r\n\r\nthey will win the elections and that everything that we\r\n\r\ndo  is  futile, Sir, gives me a little bit of  fear - \"Is\r\n\r\nSingapore  going to be handed over to persons  who  are\r\n\r\nnot democratically inclined?\" I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis fear because I recently read a book by one of  the\r\n\r\ngreat personalities of today, a Prime Minister (I  will\r\n\r\nnot  mention  his name), and he said,  \"A  small  elite\r\n\r\nusing  the  masses  as a battering ram  can  control  a\r\n\r\ncountry\", or words to that effect. Sir, if you can  get\r\n\r\nhold  of determined persons, a clique of, say, four  or\r\n\r\nfive  persons,  and  if they can follow  the  technique\r\n\r\nproperly,  they  can fool thousands of people  and  use\r\n\r\nthem  to  their advantage to set up a government  by  a\r\n\r\nclique; legally they would be recognised as a political\r\n\r\nParty, but in effect they could ignore the process  of\r\n\r\nthe democratic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked why I could not make up my mind on\r\n\r\ncertain  Bills; why I had to speak for two hours.  That\r\n\r\nis  exactly the difference in the way of thinking, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  follow the democratic procedure-, where I found that\r\n\r\nthe   fears  expressed  by  the  Opposition  were  well\r\n\r\nfounded,  I  gave way, I made alterations, so  long  as\r\n\r\nthese alterations did not affect what I aimed at.  But,\r\n\r\nSir, there are people who will say, \"Just because I  am\r\n\r\nintroducing this, all opposition should be  ignored;  I\r\n\r\nam  in the right, and you are in the wrong.\" That  sort\r\n\r\nof  person. Sir, is a person to be feared. That is  why\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting  is  very necessary  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere are persons who limit the controlling power in  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  to a cadre of 500 or  so - which  means\r\n\r\nthat  they would then cause - not even all these 500  but\r\n\r\nonly  a handful - the hierarchy of the Party - to set up  a\r\n\r\ndictatorship.  Let the people of Singapore  go  to  the\r\n\r\npolls  and  decide whether they want such a government.\r\n\r\nIf  they  decide  to have such a government,  they  are\r\n\r\nwelcome  to it, and they cannot blame anybody for  what\r\n\r\nfollows then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee on this Bill, I feel  more  than\r\n\r\npleased  and happy to support this Bill. Sir, before  I\r\n\r\ngo further into the debate on the merits or demerits of\r\n\r\nthis Bill, I wish to extend my congratulations to a few\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House. My first congratulation  is  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Ulu Bedok who showed much courage and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade   personal   sacrifices,   despite   the   strong\r\n\r\nopposition from the Party U.M.N.O. Without him,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid this Bill cannot carry on so smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second congratulation I wish to extend to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar. Sir, I am honoured  to  be\r\n\r\nassociated  with him so closely on this  Bill  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee. He was very understanding  and  co-operative - not  only  as  what  the  hon.  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon has said, highly enthusiastic. Many of us in\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee were surprised that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar was so understanding and cooperative\r\n\r\nin  the  discussion, even on certain aspects of  vital\r\n\r\nimportance  to his Party policy. For example,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the limitation of age of those  who  can\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  election activity, I for one  strongly\r\n\r\nadvocate  that we must set an age limit to  those  who\r\n\r\ncan  participate  in elections. In view  of  the  past\r\n\r\nelection experiences, we must bar anyone below the age\r\n\r\nof 21 from actively engaging in any election campaign.\r\n\r\nWe  are  more  than happy to have the support  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar when he said, \"Let  us  not\r\n\r\nbother with the time or the age limit. Let us agree to\r\n\r\nbar  all  the registered students from taking part  in\r\n\r\nthe  election.\" I am sure this vital point  shows  how\r\n\r\nkeen  and generous the Member for Tanjong Pagar is  on\r\n\r\nthis aspect of the election. It is the first time that\r\n\r\nI  discover  that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  really\r\n\r\nhas  the interest of the people of Singapore at heart.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the first time that I discover that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar has a genuine nationalist  spirit,\r\n\r\nand has the national interest at heart, and that he is\r\n\r\nnot  merely working for the interest of his Party.  It\r\n\r\nis  the first time that I discover that the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  is really prepared to make  sacrifices\r\n\r\nand  to  bury party differences and work for the  best\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people of Singapore in order  to  let\r\n\r\nthis Bill be passed, as it appears today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have learnt just now from the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nthat he is going to bring up new clauses as amendments\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill, and the implementation of one  of  them\r\n\r\nwill restrict, as I have already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned,  registered students from  taking  part  in\r\n\r\nfuture  elections.  I  am sure  this  will  avoid  the\r\n\r\nincidents  just now mentioned by the Member for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru when students or hooligans marched in regimental\r\n\r\nfashion   along  the  roads  to  support  a  political\r\n\r\ncampaign.  A  very  important  clause  also   is   the\r\n\r\nprohibition  of canvassing on election day,  and  also\r\n\r\nthe  limitation  to  the putting  up  of  banners  and\r\n\r\nposters  and even the use of transportation.  We  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  a great deal from past elections, and many  of\r\n\r\nus have experienced how much corruption has been going\r\n\r\non because the candidates can supply transport and put\r\n\r\nup  numerous  posters.  Some candidates  also  paid  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of money to seek to protect the banners\r\n\r\nthey put up. In other words, as mentioned in the Elias\r\n\r\nCommission  Report, the candidates  engaged  gangsters\r\n\r\nnot  only to paste the posters but also to protect the\r\n\r\nbanners. All these things do influence the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, you still remember that I am an\r\n\r\nordinary Member who moved a motion in this House  last\r\n\r\nyear  that compulsory voting should be introduced.  It\r\n\r\nwas    only   due   to   many   unexpected   political\r\n\r\nrepercussions  that I had to drop the  motion.  I  beg\r\n\r\nyour  indulgence, Sir, but first let  me  congratulate\r\n\r\nmyself! I congratulate myself because today I  see  my\r\n\r\ndream  come  true.  Sir,  the reason  why  I  advocate\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting is because I believe that  one  who\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  democracy  must  accept  the  fact  that\r\n\r\npopular   voting  is  of  vital  importance   to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process, because it is only  through  this\r\n\r\nvehicle  that  the  true will of  the  people  can  be\r\n\r\nimplemented through the authority of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, Sir, because of the colonial nature\r\n\r\nof  the Government, and because of the commercial port\r\n\r\nstatus,  the majority of the people always think  that\r\n\r\npolitics is not important and some have even  come  to\r\n\r\nthink that it is filthy. They therefore refuse to have\r\n\r\nanything  to  do  with politics.  This  has  naturally\r\n\r\ncreated  a  most unfortunate and undesirable situation\r\n\r\nof political apathy. This has created a vacuum for the\r\n\r\nmanoeuvrings of ambitious and selfish politicians  and\r\n\r\nunscrupulous gangsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace back to the last City Council elections\r\n\r\nin 1957. We notice that the number of qualified voters\r\n\r\nwho  failed to go to the poll was very high. If  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken, the average voting strength on  polling\r\n\r\nday  in the 1957 City Council elections was just  only\r\n\r\nslightly  over 30 per cent. Only 30 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters  turned  out on polling day. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nbring to the notice of this House that even among this\r\n\r\nsmall figure, the majority of them were illiterates or\r\n\r\nstudents  or  hooligans. They went to the poll  either\r\n\r\nbecause   they  had  received  money   or   had   been\r\n\r\nintimidated  or  because they had been  influenced  by\r\n\r\nfantastic  and  irresponsible political  promises  and\r\n\r\npolitical propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every responsible person in Singapore as\r\n\r\nconfronted with this question. Did all the voters  who\r\n\r\nturned  out and voted for the present City Councillors\r\n\r\nreally  represent the wishes of the people? These  two\r\n\r\npoints   are   of  vital  importance.  Firstly,   must\r\n\r\nSingapore  fall into the hands of the young extremists\r\n\r\nand  the  young gangsters? Secondly, if it is not  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the people (and it should be so)  by  what\r\n\r\nmethods can we encourage the people to go to the  poll\r\n\r\nin order to redress the grave situation that is facing\r\n\r\nus  today? It is only the youngsters who are  keen  on\r\n\r\ntaking part in election either because they have  been\r\n\r\nlured   by   irresponsible  and  fantastic   political\r\n\r\npromises  and  propaganda, or because they  have  been\r\n\r\nlured by corruption, or they have been intimidated  by\r\n\r\ngangsters.  Therefore, I firmly believe that  only  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  compulsory  voting  can  we  solve   this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken a little trouble to study the history of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting. Sir, compulsory voting  was  first\r\n\r\nintroduced  in the early 19th century. In  Switzerland\r\n\r\nit  is  not  called compulsory voting  but  obligatory\r\n\r\nvoting.  But  later  on it proved  very  popular  and\r\n\r\nsuccessful  even in Belgium, and other countries  soon\r\n\r\nfollowed  suit,  and up to date there  are  nearly  30\r\n\r\ncountries in the world which adopt compulsory voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason why I am in favour of compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting   is   that  I  believe  that,  by  introducing\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting, it would be possible to rectify the\r\n\r\nerror  of  not having a truly representative  form  of\r\n\r\ngovernment which might arise from optional voting.  We\r\n\r\nhave  just listened to the speech by the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and Works when he touched  on  the\r\n\r\nanalysis  of the last general elections. He said  that\r\n\r\nif  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  had  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ngetting  together  during the time of  the  elections,\r\n\r\nmaybe  the hon. Member for Serangoon would have become\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister for the past  three  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears.  This is exactly the point on which I am  going\r\n\r\nto  touch. If a candidate is elected by only  a  small\r\n\r\nsection of the eligible voters, he will represent only\r\n\r\nthose  who  voted for him. Therefore, any  legislation\r\n\r\nthat  is passed would not represent the wishes of  the\r\n\r\nnation as a whole. As the Hon. Mr Francis Thomas  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  anybody can shout: \"Ah, I represent the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore!\" But can he really claim  to  represent\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to my second point why I believe in\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting. It will bring to  the  polls  many\r\n\r\nvoters  who are in favour of a stable government.  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot deny that the political scene of today  is\r\n\r\nnot  as hopeful as we think. In last year's debate  on\r\n\r\nthe Budget I said that 1959 would be unstable from the\r\n\r\npolitical  point  of  view and a more  difficult  time\r\n\r\nwould lie ahead, and we people-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
