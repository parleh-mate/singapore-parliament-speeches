Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore's policy - it has been repeatedly said  -is\r\n\r\nto  be friends with all countries regardless of their\r\n\r\npolitical ideologies or their system of government so\r\n\r\nlong  as they respect our sovereignty and territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  refrain  from  interfering   in   our\r\n\r\ninternal affairs. Singapore is therefore prepared  to\r\n\r\nestablish diplomatic relations with all countries who\r\n\r\nwant  to  be  friends  in  Asia  and  elsewhere  too.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  establishment of Singapore  diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions abroad is a different matter. This  will  be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  financial considerations, personnel  re\r\n\r\nsources and the degree of our interest in the various\r\n\r\ncountries.  So  friendly contacts with  countries  in\r\n\r\nAsia  will  be maintained and consolidated,  in  some\r\n\r\ncases,   by   the  establishment  of  our  diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions and, in other cases, by official visits  and\r\n\r\nby  working together with them in the United  Nations\r\n\r\nand other organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in speaking about the establishment of\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  ties,  one  feature  which  is   somewhat\r\n\r\nunusual  in  the  world today  is  the  existence  of\r\n\r\ndivided  countries. In the case of divided countries,\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  relations  with one  part  of  a  divided\r\n\r\ncountry  to the exclusion of the other can only  mean\r\n\r\nlending  support to one against the other.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason, we have since independence maintained, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  divided countries, that we  would  be  most\r\n\r\nhappy to have trade and consular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelations  with either of them on an equal basis  and\r\n\r\nthat we would do nothing that would give an advantage\r\n\r\nto one side over the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House how\r\n\r\nmany   independent  Asian  countries   have   already\r\n\r\nestablished diplomatic relations with Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I cannot recollect the precise\r\n\r\nnumber.

At the ministerial meeting  held  in\r\n\r\nJakarta  last  August,  reports  by  ASEAN   ad   hoc\r\n\r\ncommittees  on food production and supply,  including\r\n\r\nfisheries,       shipping,       transport        and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, civil aviation and  tourism  were\r\n\r\napproved  and adopted. The Ministers further  decided\r\n\r\nthat  these  recommendations should  be  examined  in\r\n\r\ngreater  detail by the ASEAN National Secretariat  to\r\n\r\ndecide  which  could be implemented  immediately  and\r\n\r\nwhich would require further study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has already given effect to some of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations made at the last ministerial meeting,\r\n\r\nthough all these related to tourism. Firstly, we have\r\n\r\nintroduced seven-day visa free facilities to  persons\r\n\r\narriving  in  Singapore provided they  possess  valid\r\n\r\npassports,  firm  bookings and  entry  facilities  to\r\n\r\ntheir  destinations and continue their journey within\r\n\r\nseven days of arrival in Singapore. Secondly, we have\r\n\r\nagreed  to  accept  collective passports  and  travel\r\n\r\ndocuments  issued to parties of between five  and  25\r\n\r\npersons, all of whom should be nationals of a country\r\n\r\nand  travelling  on  package or  chartered  tours  to\r\n\r\ncountries within the ASEAN region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, together with Indonesia, has also been\r\n\r\npursuing the possibility of joint development of Bali\r\n\r\nas an international tourist resort. Last April, a ten-\r\n\r\nman  technical  fact-finding mission  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nvisited  Indonesia  to  make recommendations  on  the\r\n\r\nproject to the two Governments. The mission's  report\r\n\r\nhas  been presented and accepted in principle by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Indonesia  pending  a  more  detailed\r\n\r\nassessment to be undertaken by the Stamford  Research\r\n\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the future plans of ASEAN, the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nguess  will  be  as  good as mine.  Like  many  other\r\n\r\nefforts  at  regional  co-operation,  ASEAN  too   is\r\n\r\nrunning into a spot of bother at the moment. I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to minimise these difficulties, but all  I  can\r\n\r\nsay  is  that  the present difficulties would  appear\r\n\r\ntrivial and irrelevant to what ASEAN countries  would\r\n\r\nface were they to abandon altogether their belief  in\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  regional  co-operation.  As  far   as\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  concerned, its attitude towards  ASEAN\r\n\r\nhas  never been one of starry-eyed optimism. Progress\r\n\r\ntowards  regional co-operation will be,  particularly\r\n\r\nin the early stages, slow, painful and interrupted by\r\n\r\nsetbacks.  But  we  are equally convinced  that  hard\r\n\r\neconomic   and  political  facts  will   push   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  in the direction of regional co-operation.\r\n\r\nHowever  much we the members may drag our feet,  each\r\n\r\npassing  year  will make clearer to  ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoice for them ultimately is one of hanging together\r\n\r\nor hanging separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, to put it succinctly, at the\r\n\r\nmoment as of today, I will describe ASEAN as a  state\r\n\r\nof mind rather than a fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Can the Minister\r\n\r\nstate  whether  the  present  deadlock  between  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Malaysia over the Sabah  claim  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  dissolution of ASEAN,  or,  at  best,\r\n\r\nadversely affect the future of ASEAN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the hon.

The scale of operations\r\n\r\nof  the  E.D.B, has expanded greatly since 1961,  and\r\n\r\nthis  has magnified the basic conflict of the various\r\n\r\nfunctions which the E.D.B, was originally called upon\r\n\r\nto    perform.   Investment   promotion, industrial\r\n\r\nfinancing  and  development  and  management  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates are functions  each  incompatible\r\n\r\nwith  the  other and are best performed  by  separate\r\n\r\norganisations.  Accordingly, on 1st June,  1968,  the\r\n\r\nJurong Town Corporation was Set up under an Act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Parliament   and   commenced   operations.

The\r\n\r\nBank   has   taken  over  the  industrial   financing\r\n\r\nfunctions of the E.D.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the E.D.B, is not now concerned with\r\n\r\nindustrial financing but is concentrating on its main\r\n\r\nfunction of industrial promotion, clauses 2 and 3  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill provide respectively for the transfer  back\r\n\r\nto  the Government of loans and debentures made,  and\r\n\r\nstocks  and  shares  subscribed,  by  the  E.D.B, in\r\n\r\nindustrial enterprises. Clause 4 provides for  moneys\r\n\r\ninvested in securities or deposited by E.D.B, to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred back to the Government according  to  the\r\n\r\ndirections of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.D.B, loan portfolio, when returned to the\r\n\r\nGovernment, will be assigned by the Government to the\r\n\r\nBank.  The  equity investments and all  other  assets\r\n\r\nwill  be retained by the Government. The transfer  to\r\n\r\nthe Bank of the E.D.B, loan portfolio is made via the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  so  that the total value  of  this  loan\r\n\r\nportfolio  can  be  treated  as  a  loan   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the Bank on which a reasonable rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest will be charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the assets of the E.D.B, to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is made in the name of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  who  is a corporation sole, a legal  entity\r\n\r\nestablished  by  law  to  hold  investments  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted from clause I of the Bill that the\r\n\r\noperation of the Bill is with retrospective effect as\r\n\r\nfrom  1st  September.  1968, which  is  the  date  of\r\n\r\ncommencement of operations of the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  and the Development Bank  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe rationalisation of the structure of the E.D.B, is\r\n\r\nnow  complete.

This  development\r\n\r\nnecessitates the reclamation of certain areas in  the\r\n\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the area of Pulau Ayer Chawan is about 511\r\n\r\nacres, only 179 acres are above the high-water  mark.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining  332  acres are technically  foreshore\r\n\r\nrequiring  to be reclaimed by filling.

Although   the\r\n\r\nRepublic  had been building its Defence forces  since\r\n\r\n1965,  the  first announcement of British  withdrawal\r\n\r\nplan  called for no change in the Republic's  Defence\r\n\r\nProgramme  as  the assumptions on which  these  plans\r\n\r\nwere based took into account the probability of total\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the British presence by 1975.  It  was\r\n\r\nthen  proposed  to expand our Army to seven  Infantry\r\n\r\nBattalions.  These  with their  supporting  arms  and\r\n\r\nservices  will provide the elements of  two  Infantry\r\n\r\nBrigades.  Last year I was able to make the following\r\n\r\nstatement in my Budget address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Provided there are no further changes of mind on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of Her Majesty's Government, the build-up\r\n\r\nof  our  Defence  Forces on land  will  continue  as\r\n\r\nplanned.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservations contained in the proviso struck an\r\n\r\nominous  note at that time and unhappily for  us  the\r\n\r\nfears  on  which  they rested were realised.  The  ac\r\n\r\ncelerated  withdrawal  plan  had  totally  upset  the\r\n\r\nassumptions  on  which the first Defence  plans  were\r\n\r\nmade  and  it was therefore necessary to  revise  and\r\n\r\ndraw  up  an  entirely new plan. From time  to  time,\r\n\r\nMinisters   of   the  Government  had   made   public\r\n\r\nstatements about the buildup of this or that  element\r\n\r\nof  the armed services. I myself made a forecast last\r\n\r\nSeptember  that  there would be  a  very  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the Defence Budget for the  forthcoming\r\n\r\nyear.  I  mentioned  a figure of Defence  expenditure\r\n\r\nreaching  some  10  per cent of  our  gross  national\r\n\r\nproduct,  as  a  result of which tax  increases  were\r\n\r\nhardly avoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that this very large and rapid increase\r\n\r\nin our Defence expenditure sets the dominant theme in\r\n\r\nthis  Budget. In a closed totalitarian system, it  is\r\n\r\npossible to incur expenditure of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  size  in secret without any need for  a  public\r\n\r\nexplanation as to how the money is being spent. In an\r\n\r\nopen  Parliamentary system such as ours,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to conceal increases of expenditure of  this\r\n\r\nmagnitude.  Nor is it desirable to do so.  Our  young\r\n\r\nmen  are being conscripted by the thousands into  the\r\n\r\nDefence forces. Soon taxpayers will be asked  to  pay\r\n\r\nmore.  Obviously the public has a right to know  what\r\n\r\nwe are spending the money on, what they can expect to\r\n\r\nget  in  return for it and whether they  are  getting\r\n\r\nvalue for their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore deal with the Defence build-up over\r\n\r\nthe  next few years taking each of the three services\r\n\r\nin  turn.  I  will start with the Navy. Our  original\r\n\r\nplans  made no provisions for naval expansion  (until\r\n\r\nthe early 1970's) nor was there any provision for the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  an  Air  Force  this   year.   But\r\n\r\nobviously with the end of British protection in three\r\n\r\nyears'  time,  we  should waste no time  in  creating\r\n\r\nthese services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Navy, the first phase of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  envisaged  to  take  the   form   of\r\n\r\nestablishing a force of six patrol craft. Orders  for\r\n\r\nthese  craft  have been placed in June of  this  year\r\n\r\nwith Vosper's. Two will be constructed in Britain and\r\n\r\nfour  in  Singapore. Delivery will  commence  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of 1970 and will be completed before the  end\r\n\r\nof 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the arrival of these craft the present naval\r\n\r\neffort  is  confined to training of  personnel.  Four\r\n\r\nnaval  officers  are now undergoing training  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom with the Royal Navy and another  four\r\n\r\nare  in  Australia training with the Royal Australian\r\n\r\nNavy.  A school of naval training was established  on\r\n\r\nthe  15th November this year and the first intake  of\r\n\r\nrecruits  will  commence training  in  February  next\r\n\r\nyear. This will be concerned purely with training  of\r\n\r\nseamen,  navigation, care of ships and so  on.  Naval\r\n\r\ncrew  who  will  take charge of radar, or  mechanical\r\n\r\nequipment, will receive their basic training in other\r\n\r\ntraining  institutions of the  Armed  Forces  dealing\r\n\r\nwith these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the Air Force the establishment of\r\n\r\nwhich is proceeding apace. Fifteen young men selected\r\n\r\nby  a rigorous procedure out of several hundred,  are\r\n\r\nnow  undergoing training with the Royal Air Force  in\r\n\r\nBritain.  Another four are doing helicopter  training\r\n\r\nin  France. This month another five pilots are  going\r\n\r\nfor  training in the United Kingdom and more will  be\r\n\r\nsent  there next year. On their return they  will  be\r\n\r\nattached  to the Flying Training School in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich will turn out the additional pilots required by\r\n\r\nour Air Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Force requires not only pilots but also\r\n\r\nground crew to service the aircraft and technical and\r\n\r\noperational  teams to operate radar and  air  defence\r\n\r\nsystems.   A  Technical  Training  School   will   be\r\n\r\nestablished to train such personnel and the staff  of\r\n\r\nthis   school  is  now  being  trained  overseas   in\r\n\r\nmechanical, electrical, electronic and other trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic's Air Force will be operational before\r\n\r\nthe  end of 1971 and it will consist of squadrons  of\r\n\r\nCessnas. Jet Provosts, Aloutte Helicopters and Hawker\r\n\r\nHunters.  The Cessna serves as a primary trainer.  It\r\n\r\ncan  also  perform the role of spotter aircraft.  The\r\n\r\nJet  Provost is the basic jet trainer. It can double-\r\n\r\nup  for  counter-insurgency operations and for ground\r\n\r\nattack. Aloutte Helicopters are capable of performing\r\n\r\na  variety of useful duties. The Hawker Hunter is  an\r\n\r\ninterceptor aircraft which can be used also in ground\r\n\r\nattack   operations.  It  is  a  fine  and  versatile\r\n\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders for these aircraft together with the\r\n\r\nelectronic gear and weapons systems have been  placed\r\n\r\nand delivery will be effected over the next two-and-a-\r\n\r\nhalf  years. The task of building an Air  Force  from\r\n\r\nscratch  is an exacting one. We are indeed  fortunate\r\n\r\nto have the whole-hearted assistance of the Royal Air\r\n\r\nForce. The Singapore Government is also fortunath  to\r\n\r\nbe able to secure after his retirement from the Royal\r\n\r\nAir  Force in February next year the services of  Air\r\n\r\nMarshal  Sir  Rochford Hughes. Sir  Rochford  Hughes,\r\n\r\ncurrently  the  Air Commander of  the  Far  East  Air\r\n\r\nForce,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  a  long and distinguished career as an Air Force\r\n\r\nOfficer  and we can have every confidence  that  with\r\n\r\nhis advice and guidance the Republic's Air Force will\r\n\r\nbe one of high quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the expansion of the Army. This was\r\n\r\nthe  first  arm  of the service to be expanded  after\r\n\r\nindependence.   The  build-up  is  proceeding   satis\r\n\r\nfactorily.  The  present state  of  the  Army  is  as\r\n\r\nfollows.  We  have increased the number  of  Infantry\r\n\r\nBattalions  from two in 1965 to five  today.  Two  of\r\n\r\nthese  Battalions are fully operational. Another  two\r\n\r\nare  in  an  advanced stage of training and  will  be\r\n\r\nfully  operational by the middle of  next  year.  The\r\n\r\nfifth Battalion will be operational in December  next\r\n\r\nyear. Next March the sixth Battalion of the Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry Regiment will be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say here that the two Battalions we\r\n\r\ninherited in 1965 are not just being retained in  the\r\n\r\ncondition  that  we  found  them.  The  1st  and  2nd\r\n\r\nBattalions  of  the Singapore Infantry  Regiment  are\r\n\r\nbeing  reconverted  into the new battalion  structure\r\n\r\nusing  new weapons and manned by National Servicemen.\r\n\r\nRegular  soldiers  of  the two Battalions  have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed to other units of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and command of the Battalions are vested\r\n\r\nin a Brigade Headquarters established in October this\r\n\r\nyear.  It  is  now  fully operational  and  a  second\r\n\r\nBrigade  Headquarters  will  be  established  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infantry Battalions have to be served and supported\r\n\r\nby  other  combat and technical units.  An  Artillery\r\n\r\nBattalion  has  been established and has  reached  an\r\n\r\nadvanced  stage  of training. It is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nfully  operational by the middle of  1969.  A  second\r\n\r\nArtillery  Battalion  will  then  be  raised.   These\r\n\r\nBattalions use the 120 mm mortars which provide close\r\n\r\nfire support for front line troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Battalion of Combat Field Engineers raised this\r\n\r\nyear  will be fully operational by the middle of next\r\n\r\nyear.  The  Engineers will perform  the  conventional\r\n\r\nroles expected of such units, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis,  to  help  in infantry assault by  breaching  all\r\n\r\ntypes of obstacles, including mine-fields. They  will\r\n\r\nalso  have other capabilities, such as providing  for\r\n\r\nriver  crossing, carrying out all types of demolition\r\n\r\nmissions, constructing fortifications, and so on. The\r\n\r\nSignals  Battalion has been formed and is functioning\r\n\r\nto   provide   communications  between   the   higher\r\n\r\nformations  and  headquarters.  All  units   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed Forces are equipped  with  the  most\r\n\r\nmodern signals equipment available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Battalions which are performing\r\n\r\nfull-time  military  duties, we  have  units  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Defence Force. The P.D.F., as hon.  Members\r\n\r\nknow, consists of civilians who give up part of their\r\n\r\ntime  after  work  or  during periods  of  leave  for\r\n\r\nmilitary   training.  At  present,  the   P.D.F, is\r\n\r\norganised  into  three  Infantry  Battalions  with  a\r\n\r\nfourth  to  be raised early next year. Their  present\r\n\r\nfunctions are confined to internal security duties. A\r\n\r\nP.D.F.  Engineer Battalion also exists and is trained\r\n\r\nin  the running of essential civilian services during\r\n\r\nan emergency. The command and control of P.D.F, units\r\n\r\nis  vested in the Brigade Headquarters which has been\r\n\r\nset up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units which I have described have been raised in\r\n\r\naccordance with the original expansion plan  for  the\r\n\r\nArmy  and  according to the same time-table. However,\r\n\r\nas a result of the accelerated British withdrawal, it\r\n\r\nhas  been  found  necessary  to  increase  the  force\r\n\r\nstrength of the Army in 1971. In addition to the  two\r\n\r\nInfantry  Brigades,  it  is  proposed  to  raise   an\r\n\r\nArmoured unit consisting of tanks and armoured  cars.\r\n\r\nThe  preparations for raising this Armoured unit  are\r\n\r\nat  an  advanced stage. Orders for the vehicles  have\r\n\r\nbeen  placed and a nucleus of officers and  technical\r\n\r\ncrew for the unit is now being trained in the Israeli\r\n\r\nSchool of Armour. The main strength of the unit  will\r\n\r\nbe  drawn from officers and men to be trained in  the\r\n\r\nSchool   of  Armour  which  we  shall  establish   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Armoured unit is expected to be  fully\r\n\r\noperational by 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One noteworthy feature of the expansion of the Army\r\n\r\nwhich has not drawn public comment is that the entire\r\n\r\nbody  of  Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers  are\r\n\r\nstaffed by our own citizens. It may look to us  as  a\r\n\r\nnatural  occurrence. But if we compare our Army  with\r\n\r\nthose  recently raised in many developing  countries,\r\n\r\nwe  will notice that many of their defence units  are\r\n\r\nstaffed by a substantial force of expatriate officers\r\n\r\nand  technicians. In our case, apart from 23  members\r\n\r\nof   the   Israeli   Defence  Mission,   serving   as\r\n\r\ninstructors  and advisers, and, at the  end  of  next\r\n\r\nyear,   Sir  Rochford  Hughes,  the  entire   Defence\r\n\r\nestablishment is staffed by our own officers  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This satisfactory outcome is the result of a sound\r\n\r\nsystem  of  training  institutions  which  has   been\r\n\r\nestablished  and  which  is even  now  being  rapidly\r\n\r\nexpanded.   The   Singapore  Armed  Forces   Training\r\n\r\nInstitute,  or  SAFTI, provides  the  major  training\r\n\r\neffort.  In  addition  to  infantry  training  up  to\r\n\r\nplatoon level, it is now giving advanced training  to\r\n\r\nofficers at company and battalion levels as  well  as\r\n\r\nspecialised training in support weapons and  military\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to SAFTI, a School of Artillery has been\r\n\r\nestablished  as well as a School of Field  Engineers.\r\n\r\nThese  are  attached  to  the respective  battalions.\r\n\r\nTraining  activities are also carried out to  provide\r\n\r\nvarious  technical  personnel required  in  an  armed\r\n\r\nforce.  A  School of Electronics will  be  formed  in\r\n\r\n1969.  Already in existence are a School of Catering,\r\n\r\na School of Drivers, a School of Provost and, believe\r\n\r\nit  or  not,  a  School of Military  Accounting.  The\r\n\r\nP.D.F, training centre has been established  and  it\r\n\r\nruns  courses  throughout the year to upgrade  P.D.F.\r\n\r\nofficers and N.C.O, cadres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above account outlines the expansion of our\r\n\r\ndefence  forces  up  to 1971. It  will  be  a  costly\r\n\r\nundertaking,  the annual cost in cash terms  reaching\r\n\r\nsome  10  per  cent  of  our current  gross  national\r\n\r\nproduct,  that  is, rather more than $300  million  a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come across two kinds of reaction to our\r\n\r\ndefence  build-up programme. As they seem  widespread\r\n\r\nand  further  appear to me to rest on  an  incomplete\r\n\r\nunderstanding of our defence effort, it may be  worth\r\n\r\nwhile  to  dwell  at some length on them.  The  first\r\n\r\ntakes  the  position that Singapore, being  small  in\r\n\r\npopulation   and  in  land  area,  is  incapable   of\r\n\r\ndefending  herself against armed attack by  countries\r\n\r\nbigger in size. The other point of view accuses us of\r\n\r\narming  ourselves in a precipitate manner and  to  an\r\n\r\nextravagant degree. I believe neither of these  views\r\n\r\nis correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first view regards the building of defence\r\n\r\nforces  principally  in terms of its  nation-building\r\n\r\nvalue.  Young men are conscripted into  the  army  by\r\n\r\nnational  service  and  are  brought  together  in  a\r\n\r\ncollective  life.  They  have  instilled  into   them\r\n\r\ncertain values of discipline, loyalty, leadership and\r\n\r\nother  useful qualities. While in no way denying  the\r\n\r\nreal  worth of the nation-building functions  of  the\r\n\r\ndefence  build-up,  I would like to  say  that  these\r\n\r\npeople  overlook two important points. The  first  is\r\n\r\nthat we are not creating a large body of enthusiastic\r\n\r\namateurs. On the contrary, we expect our soldiers  in\r\n\r\nall  units  and at all levels to attain  the  highest\r\n\r\nprofessional standards. The rigorous training systems\r\n\r\ncreated with the advice of the Israeli Defence  Force\r\n\r\nMission  ensure  that  they  get  the  best  training\r\n\r\npossible.  Further, members of the armed  forces  are\r\n\r\nequipped with the best weapons money can buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same holds true of communications equipment,\r\n\r\ntransport and other logistic requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these preparations will ensure that we have\r\n\r\nadequate fire-power, mobility and professional skill.\r\n\r\nThe  second  point which the pessimist  overlooks  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  full-time units of the army in this  case,\r\n\r\ntwo   infantry   brigades  and  one   armoured   unit\r\n\r\noperational as from 1971 do not represent  the  total\r\n\r\npotential  of our army force strength, or  \"Order  of\r\n\r\nBattle\" as the professionals call it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of National Service which allows\r\n\r\nus to have a comparatively small full-time army while\r\n\r\nbuilding up a reserve army of increasing size in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of time. It works out this way. The  national\r\n\r\nserviceman,  after  serving two years  in  the  army,\r\n\r\nleaves  the  full-time army and takes on  a  civilian\r\n\r\noccupation.  He  is,  however,  liable  for   reserve\r\n\r\nservice  for  ten years. During this period  of  ten-\r\n\r\nyears' reserve service, he will be called up for full-\r\n\r\ntime training one whole month each year. This enables\r\n\r\nus   to  build  up  reserve  battalions  as  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  leave the active battalions on completion\r\n\r\nof their two years' service. All that is necessary to\r\n\r\nestablish  these reserve battalions is  to  store  up\r\n\r\nweapons,  ammunition,  equipment  and  transport  for\r\n\r\nthese battalions, as well as to maintain a nucleus of\r\n\r\nregular   officers  and  men.  The  bulk  of  trained\r\n\r\npersonnel  is  provided  by reservists.  An  infantry\r\n\r\nbattalion in full-time service would reproduce itself\r\n\r\nevery  two years into a reserve battalion. Similarly,\r\n\r\nelements  from the armoured unit, artillery, engineer\r\n\r\nbattalions and other units will also be released into\r\n\r\nthe  reserves,  thereby creating  a  complete  infra-\r\n\r\nstructure of fighting units in the reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete cycle is 12 years, with national\r\n\r\nservicemen doing full-time service for two years  and\r\n\r\nten  years as reservists. At the end of 12 years from\r\n\r\nthe beginning of national service, that is to say, in\r\n\r\n1979,  30  to 35 infantry battalions would have  been\r\n\r\nformed  as  reserves. In other words, by 1979,  under\r\n\r\nthe   present  rate  of  enlistment,  we  would  have\r\n\r\navailable  on  immediate mobilisation,  45,000  well-\r\n\r\ntrained troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a substantial force by any standard. It\r\n\r\nshould  be adequate to protect Singapore against  any\r\n\r\nforeseeable military threat. To give some idea of the\r\n\r\nscale  of  operations which our army  can  eventually\r\n\r\nundertake,  let us consider the Japanese  assault  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the Pacific War.  The  assault  was\r\n\r\ncarried out by three Japanese Divisions. The 5th  and\r\n\r\n18th Divisions landed at Pasir Laba and Lim Chu Kang,\r\n\r\nwhilst the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImperial Guard Division landed to the left of the 5th\r\n\r\nDivision,   the  front  extending  to  the  causeway.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately  for  us,  the  troops  then  defending\r\n\r\nSingapore,   consisting  mostly  of  conscripts   and\r\n\r\nregulars  of  other  countries,  did  not  put  up  a\r\n\r\ndistinguished performance for reasons which need  not\r\n\r\ndetain  us  here. But if at that time, we  had  forty\r\n\r\nbattalions  of our own men, I have little doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese army would have found the going a great\r\n\r\ndeal harder. Of course, the sensible thing to do,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is today a repetition of an offensive of  this\r\n\r\nnature against Malaysia and Singapore, is to send our\r\n\r\ntroops  to fight on the beaches of Kota Bahru and  by\r\n\r\nthe Slim River alongside Malaysian forces rather than\r\n\r\nwait for the invading army to reach the causeway This\r\n\r\nrather fanciful illustration from past history serves\r\n\r\nto   underline  what  has  often  been  said  of  the\r\n\r\nindivisibility  of the defence of the  Peninsula  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the other criticism, namely, that we\r\n\r\nare  arming ourselves at too rapid a rate. This point\r\n\r\nof  view can be quite easily disposed of. At present,\r\n\r\nonly  20 per cent of national servicemen are selected\r\n\r\nto  do  full-time service in the Armed  Forces.  Even\r\n\r\nwith  the  expanded Defence programme it is  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  the percentage of intake into full-time service\r\n\r\nwill substantially increase. Further, the build-up of\r\n\r\nthe  army  strength takes the form  of  increases  in\r\n\r\nreserve  battalions. These increases  take  place  in\r\n\r\ngradual measured steps, and are quite the reverse  of\r\n\r\nthe hasty action we are alleged to be taking, it will\r\n\r\nnot  be  until  1979, that is, the end  of  the  next\r\n\r\ndecade, that we would reach the full potential of the\r\n\r\norder  of  battle. This assumes, of course,  that  we\r\n\r\nwill   continue   to  provide  weapons, ammunition,\r\n\r\nequipment  and  transport for each and every  reserve\r\n\r\nbattalion.  We shall certainly do this for  the  next\r\n\r\nfew years, but whether we should accumulate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvast  stores of military hardware right up till  1979\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  that can be decided in  the  light  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances prevailing. By the same token,  we  are\r\n\r\nalso  keeping our options open for a faster  build-up\r\n\r\nshould this prove necessary. With the training  units\r\n\r\nand  the know-how that is being rapidly acquired,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  the capacity before the end of  1971  to\r\n\r\nvary  the rate of expansion to such levels as may  be\r\n\r\njudged    appropriate,    taking    all    prevailing\r\n\r\ncircumstances into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a short while ago the kind of attack\r\n\r\nwhich  our  Armed  Forces in  co-operation  with  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Forces  would be in a position  to  repel.\r\n\r\nThis  would  be  approximately  the  kind  of  effort\r\n\r\nmounted  against us by the Japanese  in  the  Pacific\r\n\r\nWar, that is an invasion force consisting of three to\r\n\r\nfour  divisions which in itself required a tremendous\r\n\r\nlogistical effort. However, if a really major  threat\r\n\r\ndevelops, say an invasion by 50 divisions or a threat\r\n\r\nto  deliver a nuclear attack, then a situation arises\r\n\r\nwhich  concerns not only ourselves but all the  major\r\n\r\nworld powers. An assault by 50 divisions or a nuclear\r\n\r\nthreat  can  only  be mounted by a superpower  or  by\r\n\r\ncountries acting with the connivance and support of a\r\n\r\nsuperpower. As such, other super-powers will be drawn\r\n\r\nin  and  the  resolution of a conflict of this  scale\r\n\r\nwill rest with the giants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to turn our thoughts away from the\r\n\r\nhorrendous  possibilities of super-power conflict  to\r\n\r\nmore mundane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatters, and that is the second consequence which  we\r\n\r\nhave  to face as the result of the withdrawal of  the\r\n\r\nBritish military presence. This is the decline in our\r\n\r\ngross national product and the loss of employment  of\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of people. I want to go at some length\r\n\r\ninto  the  number of locally employed  civilians  and\r\n\r\nenlisted  personnel  who  will  be  laid  off  as   a\r\n\r\nconsequence of the closing down of the British bases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have circulated a Table* for the information of\r\n\r\nhon.

For instance, the number of civilians employed in\r\n\r\nthe Armed services and the number of locally enlisted\r\n\r\npersonnel are derived from accurate records.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, the number of domestic servants employed\r\n\r\nby  British service families is very approximate,  as\r\n\r\nno  central  registers are maintained in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Following is the Table:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                  BRITISH WITHDRAWAL\r\n\r\n                      Locally employed civilians and personnel\r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\n                         Apr.

Of  this\r\n\r\n10,000,  3.000 have been re-engaged by the  Sembawang\r\n\r\nShipyard  on  the  transfer of assets  of  the  Naval\r\n\r\nDockyard  to  this enterprise. Therefore,  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber retrenched so far is only 7,000. Next year  we\r\n\r\nshall   see  a  further  retrenchment,  but  not   in\r\n\r\nsubstantial  numbers some 5,000. The  following  year\r\n\r\nwill see a larger decline in employment another 8,000\r\n\r\nor  so.  But the real crunch will come in  1971  when\r\n\r\n19,500  persons  of all categories  would  have  been\r\n\r\ndeclared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nredundant    on   the   closure   of   all    Service\r\n\r\nestablishments. The annual redundancies, as  recorded\r\n\r\nhere,  differ  from the figures I gave  earlier  this\r\n\r\nyear  when,  in the absence of accurate data,  I  had\r\n\r\nassumed a constant rate of rundown. The British time-\r\n\r\ntable  is  now made up, and the rundown begins  at  a\r\n\r\nslow  pace until the very last year. Accordingly  the\r\n\r\ncounter-recession programme outlined earlier needs to\r\n\r\nbe revised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the year 1971 from all accounts will be a\r\n\r\ndifficult one, and it is well that we lay up a  store\r\n\r\nof fat to meet that lean year. We have taken a number\r\n\r\nof measures which are intended to help redundant base\r\n\r\nworkers.  They  include  the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nscheme  into  which all gratuities are deposited  and\r\n\r\nfrom which regular amounts can be drawn, so that  the\r\n\r\nredundant  worker  can  have a longer  period  during\r\n\r\nwhich  to  find work and adjust to the new situation.\r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a training scheme to fit them\r\n\r\nfor  new occupations in industry. It is obviously not\r\n\r\npossible  to  ensure  that each and  every  redundant\r\n\r\nworker  finds  a  job congenial to  him.  Nor  is  it\r\n\r\npossible to deal with redundant workers individually.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  is  too large for an approach  of  this\r\n\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best guarantee that adjustment to new conditions\r\n\r\nwill be relatively prompt and painless is to ensure a\r\n\r\nsufficiently fast growth of the economy.  With  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, there will be a rising  demand  for\r\n\r\nall  categories  of workers, and within  this  rising\r\n\r\ndemand there will be more opportunities for redundant\r\n\r\nworkers  to  find new jobs. This leads me to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe general economic conditions now facing us and the\r\n\r\nimmediate prospects ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>State of the economy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the economy has had another good year.\r\n\r\nTrade continues to expand. Port activities remain  at\r\n\r\na  high level. Manufacturing output and sales are  up\r\n\r\nbecause the productive capacity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   industrial  sector  has   been   enlarged.\r\n\r\nConstruction, too, shows good progress  and,  all  in\r\n\r\nall, there has been satisfactory all-round growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates of the gross domestic\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  1968  indicate  that  despite   the\r\n\r\nBritish military rundown the economy has grown by 7.7\r\n\r\nper  cent since last year. Gross domestic expenditure\r\n\r\nis  estimated  at  $3,850  million.  With  population\r\n\r\ngrowth  now  at less than two per cent  a  year,  per\r\n\r\ncapita  gross, domestic expenditure has increased  by\r\n\r\nnearly six per cent to a level of $1,940.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth is associated with the rate of\r\n\r\ninvestment in fixed assets undertaken by the economy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  particularly gratifying, therefore,  to  note\r\n\r\nthat this year, gross domestic capital formation  or,\r\n\r\nto  use  a  more familiar term, total investment  has\r\n\r\nincreased  by 17 per cent over 1967. Total investment\r\n\r\nthis  year  is  estimated  to  be  $606  million,  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with $518 million last year. The  share  of\r\n\r\ninvestment   in   gross  domestic   expenditure   has\r\n\r\nincreased  to  15.7 per cent from 14.5  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good performance of the economy is reflected in\r\n\r\nno  small measure in the upward surge of trade. Total\r\n\r\ntrade  for  the  first nine months of this  year  was\r\n\r\nvalued  at $6,720 million, up 14.5 per cent from  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  period  last  year.  Exports  totalled\r\n\r\n$2,880  million  and  imports $3,840  million.  Cargo\r\n\r\nhandled  at  the harbours reflected this increase  in\r\n\r\ntrade  activities.  From January  to  September  this\r\n\r\nyear,  a  total  of  26.5 million freight  tons  were\r\n\r\ndischarged  and loaded at the ports as compared  with\r\n\r\n22.6  million freight tons for the same  period  last\r\n\r\nyear.  This represents an increase of 17.4 per  cent.\r\n\r\nReflecting this, increase, more ships called  at  our\r\n\r\nports.  Up  to  September this year, 11,600  vessels.\r\n\r\nwith a total tonnage of 47 million tons had called at\r\n\r\nSingapore, an increase of 15.0 per cent and 11.5  per\r\n\r\ncent respectively over 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion in trade is partly the result of\r\n\r\ncontinued growth in the manufacturing sector. As  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector grows, it requires more raw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials,  plant  and  machinery  to  be   imported.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, as industries go into production, they too\r\n\r\nexport more and more of their products. The quarterly\r\n\r\nindex  of industrial production for the first quarter\r\n\r\nof  this  year stood at 121.3; for the second quarter\r\n\r\nat  129.4;  for  the  third quarter,  at  131.4.  The\r\n\r\naverage  for  the whole of 1967 was 111.1;  the  base\r\n\r\nyear  for  the index is 1966. As at the end  of  June\r\n\r\nthis   year,   there  were  174  pioneer   firms   in\r\n\r\nproduction, an increase of 47 firms over  last  year.\r\n\r\nThese  have a total fixed investment of $436  million\r\n\r\nand a combined output of $472 million. Investment and\r\n\r\noutput  increased by no less than 19.0 per  cent  and\r\n\r\n64.0  per  cent respectively from the previous  year.\r\n\r\nPioneer  industries  now employ  18,780  workers,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 5,380 over last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indicator of increased commercial and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing activities is the volume of electricity\r\n\r\nconsumed  by  industrial and commercial  enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis has gone up from 521 million kilowatt hours  for\r\n\r\nthe first nine months of 1967 to 659 million kilowatt\r\n\r\nhours up to September this year, an increase of  26.5\r\n\r\nper   cent.   To  meet  this  increased  demand   for\r\n\r\nelectricity, a new power station is being constructed\r\n\r\nin Jurong with an eventual capacity of 480 megawatts,\r\n\r\nor  slightly larger than the present total  installed\r\n\r\ncapacity  of 464 megawatts. The first phase  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  June  next year when  a  120  megawatt\r\n\r\ngenerator will be commissioned. A second 120 megawatt\r\n\r\ngenerator will go on stream in April 1971.  By  1974,\r\n\r\nthe total installed capacity in Singapore will be 944\r\n\r\nmegawatts, more than four times the 202 megawatts  we\r\n\r\nhad in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building and construction, too, are making good\r\n\r\nprogress. Commencement of new buildings, however, has\r\n\r\nslowed down somewhat. In the first half of this year,\r\n\r\n6,140 units were commenced as against 8,320 units for\r\n\r\nthe same period last year. The decline was mostly  in\r\n\r\nthe  public sector. In terms of floor area,  however,\r\n\r\nthere  was  only  a  3.0 per cent decline,  from  6.7\r\n\r\nmillion  square feet to 6.5 million square feet.  But\r\n\r\nin terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue, which is really what counts, there has been an\r\n\r\nactual  increase of 8.8 per cent. The  value  of  the\r\n\r\nbuildings commenced in the first six months  of  1967\r\n\r\nwas $72 million as against $78.3 million for the same\r\n\r\nperiod this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism, too, is having its day though the rate of\r\n\r\nincrease  in arrivals is only a shade of the previous\r\n\r\nyear's  spectacular increase of 70.5 per cent.  Never\r\n\r\ntheless, total arrivals of passengers by air and  sea\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  numbered 181,570  up  to  the  end  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  this year, an increase of  25.3  per  cent\r\n\r\nfrom  the  corresponding period last  year.  This  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  the normal rate of growth  in  future\r\n\r\nyears rather than the spectacular figure achieved  in\r\n\r\n1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 58 tourist hotels with 2,570 rooms.\r\n\r\nThe occupancy rate is 83 per cent. Eighteen new first-\r\n\r\nclass  hotels are being built. These, when completed,\r\n\r\nwill  add some 6,000 rooms to the current stock.  Six\r\n\r\nof the hotels are expected to be completed by the end\r\n\r\nof  1969,  increasing the number of  hotel  rooms  by\r\n\r\n1,610. With all these facilities, accommodation  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  bottleneck constricting the  inflow  of\r\n\r\nvisitors to Singapore in coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptomatic of the well-being of the economy is the\r\n\r\nrise  in  the level of bank deposits. At a time  when\r\n\r\nthe  international  economy is  beset  with  monetary\r\n\r\ncrises, when sterling, the U.S, dollar and the French\r\n\r\nfranc   are  being  attacked  by  speculators,   bank\r\n\r\ndeposits  in  Singapore continue  to  increase,  from\r\n\r\n$1,650  million at the end of September last year  to\r\n\r\n$2,105 million at the end of September this year,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  27.3 per cent. The large  increases  in\r\n\r\nbank deposits month after month since June 1967 could\r\n\r\nnot  possibly be due to the expanding economy  alone.\r\n\r\nInflow  of funds from abroad is possibly an important\r\n\r\ncontributory factor. If this is so, it  is  a  cogent\r\n\r\nreflection of the confidence that people have in  the\r\n\r\ncurrency of Singapore, and, in the final analysis, it\r\n\r\nis a vote of confidence in the stability and strength\r\n\r\nof the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our economy was considerably boosted by\r\n\r\npanic capital from Hong Kong and a good proportion of\r\n\r\nthis  year's  crop of new industries  represents  the\r\n\r\nfruition of this capital inflow in 1967. But  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  two  years, the main impetus to our  growth  of\r\n\r\nindustry  will come not from Hong Kong  capital,  but\r\n\r\nfrom American capital. As Hong Kong recovers from its\r\n\r\npolitical troubles of last year, the number of  panic\r\n\r\nenquiries has tailed off. However, Hong Kong interest\r\n\r\nin  Singapore remains at a gratifying level. Projects\r\n\r\nin  the  pipeline  represent  genuine  investment  in\r\n\r\nsearch  of profit opportunities. Investment  of  this\r\n\r\nkind  is  likely  to  be  more  productive  and  more\r\n\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our investment promotion programme in the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  and Europe is still  in  its  initial\r\n\r\nstages  of development, the results achieved  so  far\r\n\r\nare   encouraging.  Large  international   companies,\r\n\r\nmostly  American, are increasingly becoming aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  advantages that Singapore offers  to  investors.\r\n\r\nAmongst the factors that they find attractive are our\r\n\r\npolitical  stability, the national  determination  to\r\n\r\nwork  and  overcome  problems as  manifested  in  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  acceptance  of the new Employment  Act,  our\r\n\r\nprice  and  wage  stability,  a  sound  currency,   a\r\n\r\nstrategic  location,  an  honest  administration,  an\r\n\r\nabundance of hardworking and adaptable workers,  high\r\n\r\nlabour    productivity   and   excellent    transport\r\n\r\nfacilities. No less important are the investment  and\r\n\r\nexport  incentives provided in the Economic Expansion\r\n\r\nAct.  Also capital is available in abundance  and  on\r\n\r\ngood  terms. These ingredients for success have  been\r\n\r\nconfirmed  by  the  well-known  American  independent\r\n\r\nbusiness consultants, Business International, who  in\r\n\r\ntheir  \"Report to Managers of World Wide  Operations\"\r\n\r\nin February this year rated Singapore as an excellent\r\n\r\nplace to do business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American companies are particularly interested\r\n\r\nin  two  fields  of  activities in Singapore.  First,\r\n\r\nthere is a group of companies like Caterpillar, Allis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChalmers,   and  International  Minerals  Corporation\r\n\r\nwhich  are  keen on using Singapore as a distribution\r\n\r\ncentre  and  an assembling base for South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nOther   American  companies  like  Santa  Fe-Pomeroy,\r\n\r\nDillingham Corporation, McDermott and Procon are also\r\n\r\ninterested  in  using  Singapore  as  a  supply   and\r\n\r\nfabrication  base  for  oil  and  mineral   resources\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects in this region.  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nprovide  all the necessary engineering and supporting\r\n\r\nservices efficiently. This would not only benefit the\r\n\r\nlarge   international   companies   but   also    the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries,  as  the  provision  of   an\r\n\r\nefficient  supporting  base  could  accelerate  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a group of companies interested\r\n\r\nin   manufacturing   a  wide  range   of   electronic\r\n\r\ncomponents,  electrical appliances and  other  instru\r\n\r\nments.     These    companies    include     National\r\n\r\nSemiconductors  Corporation,  Texas  Instruments  and\r\n\r\nContinental  Devices.  All  three  are  American  com\r\n\r\npanies.  These  are very substantial investments  and\r\n\r\nthey will employ large labour forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to what has been mentioned, there are\r\n\r\nother  projects  involving international  consortiums\r\n\r\nfor  the development of petrochemicals, steel,  paper\r\n\r\nand pulp, fertilisers, watch-making, construction  of\r\n\r\nfishery  vessels  and  other  specialised  ships  and\r\n\r\nmarine  structures,  prefabricated  houses,  internal\r\n\r\ncombustion  engines,  farm  implements  and   machine\r\n\r\ntools.  Most  of these projects should  get  off  the\r\n\r\nground in the next two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, there are enough industrial investment\r\n\r\nprojects in the pipeline to keep the economy going at\r\n\r\na  brisk rate the next two years. All this will  make\r\n\r\nit   easier  for  redundant  workers  to   find   new\r\n\r\nemployment  than would otherwise be the case.  In  my\r\n\r\nprevious Budget Statement I commented on the need  to\r\n\r\nestablish   new   institutions  to   strengthen   the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation effort. In my series  of  broadcast\r\n\r\ntalks last April, I elaborated upon the theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal was to set up three new institutions.\r\n\r\nTwo  grew out of the Economic Development Board;  the\r\n\r\nthird  is  an  entirely new project, an international\r\n\r\ntrading  company.  All these three institutions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  launched and it seems appropriate on this  occa\r\n\r\nsion  to report on progress achieved. The Development\r\n\r\nBank of Singapore, which was formed to take over  the\r\n\r\nfinancing   functions  of  the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard,   has  been  successfully  launched.  It   was\r\n\r\nformally   incorporated  on  July  16th,  1968,   and\r\n\r\ncommenced operations on the 1st September. The  staff\r\n\r\nof the Bank was drawn initially from the E.D.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financing purely manufacturing\r\n\r\nundertakings, the Bank's financial scope  extends  to\r\n\r\ninclude  tourist  and  estate  projects,  the  latter\r\n\r\nrelating  mainly  to projects established  under  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  programme. The Development  Bank  has\r\n\r\ntaken  over from the Economic Development  Board  its\r\n\r\nentire  loan portfolio. This includes loans to  small\r\n\r\nindustries advanced by the Light Industries  Services\r\n\r\nas   well   as   special  loans   for   ship-breaking\r\n\r\noperations.  The amount of loans transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank comes to $48.9 million. In addition,\r\n\r\nsome  $30 million worth of loan committed by the  Eco\r\n\r\nnomic  Development Board has been taken over  by  the\r\n\r\nBank.  The transfer of loans from the E.D.B, to  the\r\n\r\nBank is a comparatively simple operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in regard to equities, that is, shares\r\n\r\nin   industrial  ventures  owned  by   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  is  more  complex   because   of\r\n\r\nproblems  of valuation. Where the share is listed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Stock  Exchange, a clear-cut basis for valuation\r\n\r\nexists, though the trouble here is that stock  prices\r\n\r\nfluctuate  from  time to time. Where shares  are  not\r\n\r\nlisted,  it is not easy to find a mutually acceptable\r\n\r\nprice.  In the event, it was decided that the  entire\r\n\r\nequity holding of the E.D.B, should be taken over  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  The  Government   will   similarly\r\n\r\nundertake to pay up the balance of equities which had\r\n\r\nnot been fully paid up. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue  at  cost  of  these equities  comes  to  $25.2\r\n\r\nmillion  with  a further $3.4 million equity  capital\r\n\r\nremaining to be paid up. In addition to these,  there\r\n\r\nare  a  number  of  equity commitments  made  by  the\r\n\r\nE.D.B., paid-up capital of which has not been called.\r\n\r\nSuch equities will be taken over by the Bank and  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  these equities comes to $8.5  million.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the Bank has taken over guarantees made  by\r\n\r\nthe   E.D.B, on  behalf  of  manufacturers   making\r\n\r\npurchases  of  plant  and  equipment.  The  value  of\r\n\r\noutstanding guarantees as on 26th November this  year\r\n\r\nis $14.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank has a total paid-up capital of $100\r\n\r\nmillion.  An invitation to subscribe to this  capital\r\n\r\nby   providing  subscription  to  local   banks   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions as well as by  public  invita\r\n\r\ntion  was well received. In the allocation of  shares\r\n\r\nto  the  public, special consideration was  given  to\r\n\r\nsmall  investors and all applications  of  $2,000  or\r\n\r\nless were accepted in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Bank's future operations the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will extend to the bank credit  lines  of\r\n\r\n$30  million  in the first instance and  another  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  on  exhaustion of the first line of  credit.\r\n\r\nInterest  will be at a rate of 4 per cent per  annum.\r\n\r\nThese  funds will be used by the Bank to extend loans\r\n\r\nto  industries at a rate of interest not exceeding  7\r\n\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank will also raise additional funds from\r\n\r\nlocal, foreign and international institutions.  These\r\n\r\noperations  of  the Bank will be governed  purely  by\r\n\r\ncommercial  considerations. A  high  level  technical\r\n\r\nteam  from the Investment Bank of the German  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Kreditanstalt fuer  Weideraufbau  (KFW),\r\n\r\narrived in Singapore last month to advise the Bank on\r\n\r\ninternal organisation and in the formulation  of  its\r\n\r\noperating  policy. The KFW team stayed  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  three  weeks  and  has submitted  a  preliminary\r\n\r\nreport.  The  German Investment Bank  has  also  been\r\n\r\nasked  to  assist  our Bank in the initial  years  by\r\n\r\nseconding  a number of senior staff. The Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Bank is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Hon  Sui Sen who has rendered such distinguished service  as\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Economic Development Board. I have little  doubt\r\n\r\nthat under his leadership and guidance, the Bank will grow into a\r\n\r\npowerful  institution  for  promoting  economic  development   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the second institution, the International Trading\r\n\r\nCompany, or INTRACO, to use its registered name. The Company  was\r\n\r\nincorporated  on  the  5th  November, 1968.  With  an  authorised\r\n\r\ncapital  of  50 million shares of one dollar each,  of  which  20\r\n\r\nmillion shares are being issued, only 50 cents per share is being\r\n\r\ncalled up immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRACO will be jointly owned by the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  six  million shares, the Development Bank with 3.8  million\r\n\r\nshares  and  the  private sector with 10.2  million  shares.  The\r\n\r\nprivate sector allocation has been substantially over-subscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three institutions, INTRACO, in my opinion, is the most\r\n\r\ncomplex,   difficult  and  challenging  undertaking.  While   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank and the Jurong Town Corporation were  built  on\r\n\r\nthe  foundation of solid achievement ol the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard, INTRACO has to blaze its own trail not in Singapore but in\r\n\r\nthe  outside  world.  It  has to meet  fierce  international  com\r\n\r\npetition from all quarters in promoting the export of Singapore's\r\n\r\ngoods. This is not a task that can be accomplished over-night and\r\n\r\nthe  directors  of  INTRACO have wisely  decided  upon  a  phased\r\n\r\nprogramme.  The  Company is still in its infant  stages  and  its\r\n\r\nfuture progress will no doubt be watched with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third institution, the Jurong Town Corporation, takes over\r\n\r\nfrom  the  E.D.B, the ownership and management of the  industrial\r\n\r\nestate  in  Jurong and six other places in Kallang, Tiong  Bahru,\r\n\r\nKampong Ampat, Tanglin Halt, Kallang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPark  and  Tanjong Rhu. The number of factories in production  on\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation's land totals 293 at the last count  in  October\r\n\r\nthis  year. They gave employment to more than 21,000 persons  and\r\n\r\ninvolved  a capital investment of $588 million. In addition,  the\r\n\r\nCorporation  runs a number of other enterprises.  It  owns  4,450\r\n\r\nflats and 150 shophouses in Jurong. The flats are virtually  full\r\n\r\nup.  There is, in fact, a shortage of housing in Jurong and  some\r\n\r\n1.384  flats are under construction, some of which will be  ready\r\n\r\nfor  occupation  in  the middle of next  year.  As  a  result  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  investment  reaching a rate which  exceeded  planning\r\n\r\nexpectations, there is currently a severe shortage  of  available\r\n\r\nfactory space. To meet this excess demand, nine blocks of flatted\r\n\r\nfactories are under construction with a total floor area of  more\r\n\r\nthan a million square feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major enterprises undertaken in Jurong is the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  a  new port there. More than  $25  million  was\r\n\r\nspent, with 3,000 feet of wharves and various facilities for  the\r\n\r\nmechanical handling of bulk cargo. The increase of cargo  handled\r\n\r\nin Jurong since the completion of the port has been satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn  1967 the volume of cargo handled was 342,000 tons. In the  11\r\n\r\nmonths of this year the volume of cargo handled was increased  to\r\n\r\n478,000  tons;  in addition some 121,000 heads of livestock  were\r\n\r\nalso  handled. This latter is a direct result of the construction\r\n\r\nof the abattoir in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some problems still remain to be resolved in Jurong in addition\r\n\r\nto  the preparation of more factory sites and dwelling houses. It\r\n\r\nis  necessary to improve social amenities there. The  Corporation\r\n\r\nis   taking  action  on  this.  One  pleasing  outcome   of   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the  Corporation has  been  the  comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  undertaken of their accounting system. The new system  of\r\n\r\naccounts  enables  a  separate assessment  to  be  made  of  each\r\n\r\nseparate operation of the Corporation to assess its profitability\r\n\r\nas  determined  on  commercial  principles.  It  was  a  pleasant\r\n\r\nsurprise for me to discover that after allowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  an adequate rate of depreciation of assets,  the\r\n\r\noverall  return on capital invested by the Government\r\n\r\nin  Jurong's  social  and industrial  infra-structure\r\n\r\ncomes  to  three  per cent. I had  expected  a  lower\r\n\r\nfigure and was even prepared for a loss. This outcome\r\n\r\nreflects credit on the land and lease policy  of  the\r\n\r\nE.D.B.  In  future years, we can expect  the  revenue\r\n\r\naccruing  to the Jurong Town Corporation to  increase\r\n\r\nboth with the increasing number of industries as well\r\n\r\nas  increases in lease payments. Eventually,  we  can\r\n\r\nhope to get a return of seven or eight per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates, 1969</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the Estimates before Parliament. Last year I promised that I would circulate a Treasury Paper each on the Ordinary and Development Estimates setting out in detail, under each Head and Subhead, changes in such expenditures and the reasons therefor. These two Treasury Papers\r\n\r\nare  now before the House and provide all the details\r\n\r\nrequired.  This arrangement will allow me to  comment\r\n\r\non  the Estimates in broad terms and thus to avoid  a\r\n\r\ntedious  enumeration  of  figures.  Those  who   want\r\n\r\nparticular   details  can  refer  to   the   Treasury\r\n\r\nmemoranda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major change in the presentation of the\r\n\r\nEstimates is the change in the basis of the financial\r\n\r\nyear.  Since living recollection, the financial  year\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore Government accounts has  been  the\r\n\r\ncalendar  year.  It  is  now  proposed  to  take  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year as the period 1st April of one year to\r\n\r\n31st  March  of  the  following  year.  There  is  an\r\n\r\nadvantage in so doing. It will be possible under  the\r\n\r\nnew  arrangement  to  give a proper  account  of  the\r\n\r\nfunctioning  of  the  economy  during  the  preceding\r\n\r\ncalendar year. At present Members would have  noticed\r\n\r\nthe  rather  sketchy  manner in  which  the  economic\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the Republic has  been  reported  in\r\n\r\nannual  budget  statements.  Statistical  records  of\r\n\r\nforeign   trade  and  calculations  .of  balance   of\r\n\r\npayments and national income aggregates are  made  in\r\n\r\nperiods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof calendar years. Putting the start of the financial\r\n\r\nyear  forward  by three months should  enable  us  to\r\n\r\nobtain  a  proper account of these useful statistical\r\n\r\naggregates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effect of this change in the Estimates\r\n\r\nof  this  year  is to complicate the presentation  of\r\n\r\nthis  and  the  next  budget.  The  figures  in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates before Parliament relate to a period of  15\r\n\r\nmonths,  whereas  the figures with which  comparisons\r\n\r\nare made, that is for the calendar year 1968, cover a\r\n\r\nperiod   of   12   months.  This  complication   will\r\n\r\neventually  be  eliminated  in  the  financial   year\r\n\r\ncommencing April 1971 and thereafter. For purposes of\r\n\r\ncomparison in my address, I will not take the amounts\r\n\r\nas  entered in the Estimates, that is to say the  15-\r\n\r\nmonth   totals,  but  the  annual  rate  so  that   a\r\n\r\nmeaningful comparison can be made with 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial increase in Defence expenditure has\r\n\r\naffected   the   entire  financial  policy   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. In order to finance expenditure  of  this\r\n\r\nmagnitude, the Government has to adopt the  following\r\n\r\npolicy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As far as possible, advantage is to be taken\r\n\r\nof  deferred  credit payments  from  suppliers  of\r\n\r\nequipment and weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Full advantage is to be taken of the British\r\n\r\ndefence  aid proposal which offers a total  amount\r\n\r\nof \ufffd50  million sterling in soft loans and grants\r\n\r\nfor  the  purchase  of  goods  and  services  from\r\n\r\nBritain,  both for defence and for non-defence  ex-\r\n\r\npenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) As far as possible, non-defence expenditure\r\n\r\nis  to  be retained at existing levels, increases\r\n\r\nbeing  allowed  only  for  normal  annual  salary\r\n\r\nincrements  and  for  new  proposals  which  have\r\n\r\nexceptional\r\n\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In spite of savings produced by stringent\r\n\r\neconomy  and  by recourse to credit payments  and\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British aid, it has been proved necessary to\r\n\r\nintroduce new taxes and to increase the  rates  of\r\n\r\nsome existing taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Ministries and departments which provide\r\n\r\neconomic     services,     for     instance,      the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department and the Civil  Aviation\r\n\r\nDepartment, are not to be starved of funds and are to\r\n\r\nbe  given  normal additional expenditure required  to\r\n\r\nmeet the demands of normal growth. Similarly revenue-\r\n\r\nproducing    departments   are   allowed   reasonable\r\n\r\nincreases in staff. Apart from this, any increase  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will only be sanctioned if the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned can offer offset reductions in other  items\r\n\r\nof expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total Defence budget to be incurred in the\r\n\r\ncalendar  year  1969 were to be paid  on  the  normal\r\n\r\nGovernment basis, that is, on a cash basis, a sum  of\r\n\r\n$337.5 million would need to be provided. This refers\r\n\r\nto the expenditure of the Armed Forces alone and does\r\n\r\nnot  include  Police  and other  expenditure  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Defence. This is a substantial  increase\r\n\r\non the $47.6 million provided for the Armed Forces in\r\n\r\nthe  1968 Estimates. I should, however, mention  that\r\n\r\nthe expenditure actually incurred on the Armed Forces\r\n\r\nin 1968 is considerably larger than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sum of $337.5 million, a part must be paid in\r\n\r\ncash.  For instance, the pay of soldiers and payments\r\n\r\nof contractors' bills can hardly be settled on credit\r\n\r\nterms. The amount of such expenditure comes to $117.3\r\n\r\nmillion.  A further sum of $156.3 million relates  to\r\n\r\npurchases of weapons and equipment for which recourse\r\n\r\nto  credit is available. Finally there is  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$63.9  million  which could be  paid  out  of  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Defence  Aid  funds.  These  are  the  three\r\n\r\ncomponents adding up lo $337.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial provision required in the calendar\r\n\r\nyear  1969  to meet such expenditure comes to  $205.1\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  made up of inescapable cash expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$117.3 million and a further sum representing advance\r\n\r\npayment  on credit purchases that have to be made  in\r\n\r\nthe  calendar  year.  This sum includes  payments  on\r\n\r\ncredits incurred in previous years. The total  amount\r\n\r\nof  such payments on credit purchases comes to  $87.8\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total of $205.1 million, a cash liability,\r\n\r\nthat  is, the total cash liability, for 1969,  $157.2\r\n\r\nmillion  is  incurred  in respect  of  items  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Estimates and $47.9 million is  expenditure\r\n\r\non  development projects appearing in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  In addition to these cash outlays,  there\r\n\r\nis  of course the item I referred to earlier of $63.9\r\n\r\nmillion,  being  purchases of British  equipment  and\r\n\r\nweapons paid out of the United Kingdom aid fund. This\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  not  entered  under  the   head   of\r\n\r\n\"Ministry  of  Interior and Defence\", but  under  the\r\n\r\n\"Ministry of Finance\". As a contra item the same  sum\r\n\r\nhas  been  entered as a revenue item. The reason  for\r\n\r\nputting  this  under the heading of the \"Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance\"  is that payments for these items will  have\r\n\r\nto   be  made  in  the  first  instance  out  of  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund and subsequently recouped from  the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Aid  account.  To keep the accounting  of  such\r\n\r\ntransactions  under direct supervision,  the  unusual\r\n\r\ndevice of entering the Defence expenditure under  the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry has been resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary for me to discuss non-defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure at any length a~ the Treasury Papers give\r\n\r\nall  the  numerical  details.  The  broad  policy  of\r\n\r\nkeeping  non-defence expenditure, especially that  on\r\n\r\neducation and social services, on a standstill  basis\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  most  of the substantial  increases  in\r\n\r\nDefence cash expenditure to be met out of the  normal\r\n\r\ngrowth of revenue. The revenue for the calendar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nyear  1969 is estimated at $759.2 million as compared\r\n\r\nwith  the 1968 Estimates of $646.7 million, in  other\r\n\r\nwords, there is an estimated revenue increase  of  no\r\n\r\nless  than  $112.5  million.  This  increase  results\r\n\r\npartly  from increased revenue yields due to economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and partly because the 1968 revenue estimates\r\n\r\nappear to have been substantially underestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curbing of non-defence expenditure together with\r\n\r\nthe  increases in revenue yields has enabled us  very\r\n\r\nnearly to secure a balance on revenue and expenditure\r\n\r\non  the  current cash account. Taking  the  financial\r\n\r\nyear of 15 months, that is to say, 1st January, 1969,\r\n\r\nto  31st  March.  1970, expenditure is  estimated  at\r\n\r\n$1,024.9  million. Total revenue almost comes  up  to\r\n\r\nthis amount, the shortfall being a mere $9.2 million.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not take into account the need  to\r\n\r\ntransfer   money   from  current   account   to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  fund,  a  practice which  has  continued\r\n\r\nwithout fail since my first Budget of 1959. In recent\r\n\r\nyears,  the annual transfer is $30 million, and  over\r\n\r\nthe  15-month  period this would mean $37.5  million.\r\n\r\nTaking the shortfall of\r\n\r\n$9.2 million and $37.5 million, there is a total  sum\r\n\r\nof $46.7 million to be met. I propose to meet this by\r\n\r\nraising additional taxes to yield $35 million for the\r\n\r\n15-month period. The balance of $11.7 million can  be\r\n\r\nmet by transfers from our reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Taxes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject which everybody is waiting\r\n\r\nfor  -  and in most instances wrongly guessed namely,\r\n\r\nthe  new  taxes.  There  has  been  a  good  deal  of\r\n\r\nspeculation about this and it had been necessary  for\r\n\r\nme  to  issue  a clarification to dispel  unwarranted\r\n\r\ngloom and to reassure people that the new taxes would\r\n\r\nnot   have   any   damaging  effect   on   investment\r\n\r\nincentives. This, of course, is a sine qua non of our\r\n\r\neconomic  strategy.  We try to get  increased  yields\r\n\r\nmostly by fast growth of the economy. Even for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoming year, as I have explained, the greater cost of\r\n\r\nDefence  expenditure will be paid  for  more  out  of\r\n\r\nincreased revenue yields due to economic growth  than\r\n\r\nby new taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind seven new tax proposals: three of\r\n\r\nthem  involve increases or changes in existing  rates\r\n\r\nof  taxes, four of them are completely new taxes.  By\r\n\r\nspreading the load over seven tax measures, we reduce\r\n\r\nthe  risk of adverse effect either on the economy  or\r\n\r\non  the  revenue  itself which might  come  about  by\r\n\r\nconcentrating  on one or two items. These  new  taxes\r\n\r\nwill  not have the effect of impairing incentives  to\r\n\r\neconomic   development   or   of   discouraging   and\r\n\r\ndisrupting the flow of foreign investment. They  have\r\n\r\nalso been so selected that the least burden will fall\r\n\r\non the poorer sections of the community. The four new\r\n\r\ntaxes are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A 10 per cent levy on monthly charges of\r\n\r\nthe Public Utilities Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A small duty on liquid petroleum gas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A 15 per cent levy on telephone bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) A 15 per cent import duty on made-up\r\n\r\ngarments, excluding furs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards old taxes, there will be a change in the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  valuation  of motor  vehicles,  a  general\r\n\r\nrevision  of  stamp duties, and an  increase  in  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  fee of motor vehicles. Let me discuss  each\r\n\r\nof these new tax measures in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on public utility services supplied to\r\n\r\nconsumers will take effect by legislation which  will\r\n\r\nbe introduced in Parliament shortly. The levy will be\r\n\r\ncollected by the Public Utilities Board on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe Government. The advantage of this arrangement  is\r\n\r\nthat  110  new  machinery of tax collection  need  be\r\n\r\nestablished,   and  the  additional   cost   of   tax\r\n\r\ncollection is virtually nil. The rates have  been  so\r\n\r\ncalculated  that families in the lowest income  group\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot be affected. Large numbers of these families live\r\n\r\nin  Housing  Board  flats  and  elsewhere  and  their\r\n\r\nmonthly bill does not exceed $10. No rate of tax will\r\n\r\nbe imposed on those whose monthly bills do not exceed\r\n\r\n$10. No less than 58,000 consumers, or 25 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  total,  fall in this category. For  those  whose\r\n\r\nbills fall between $10 and $20 a month, a lower  rate\r\n\r\nof  five  per cent is levied. The number of consumers\r\n\r\nfalling  in  this  category amounts to  approximately\r\n\r\n73,000,  that is, 32 per cent of the total. The  full\r\n\r\n10  per  cent  rate  will apply to  households  whose\r\n\r\nmonthly  bills  exceed $20 a month. This  means  that\r\n\r\nonly  the wealthier 43 per cent of consumers pay  the\r\n\r\nfull rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax will apply to all consumers of public\r\n\r\nutilities  with  two exceptions. The  first  are  the\r\n\r\npoorer   families  I  referred  to.  The   next   are\r\n\r\nindustries  which  depend  on  power  supply   to   a\r\n\r\nsignificant extent. They already qualify for  special\r\n\r\nindustrial power rates. In order not to reduce  their\r\n\r\ncompetitive  position, I intend to exempt  them  from\r\n\r\nthis levy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield of this tax is expected to amount to $11\r\n\r\nmillion for the coming financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to protect P.U.B, gas and electric\r\n\r\nsupply  as  a  means of fuel supply for  cooking  and\r\n\r\ntherefore a compensating tax on liquid petroleum  gas\r\n\r\nis  necessary.  A rate of three cents  a  pound  will\r\n\r\nmaintain  the comparative advantages of the different\r\n\r\nsources  of cooking fuel at their present level,  and\r\n\r\nthis  tax  is  expected  to yield  $800,000  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st January, 1969, subscribers to the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board will pay a tax of  15  per\r\n\r\ncent  on  their bills. This amounts to an  additional\r\n\r\npayment of $27 a year by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach domestic subscriber and $37.50 per line per year\r\n\r\nfor each business line. Collection will be undertaken\r\n\r\nby the Singapore Telephone Board. The yield of tax is\r\n\r\nestimated at $3.8 million for the financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Import duties are to be introduced on made-up\r\n\r\ngarments  for the first time. It is quite amazing  to\r\n\r\nme that while we are exporting substantial quantities\r\n\r\nof garments to the United States, Britain and Western\r\n\r\nEurope, we continue to import vast quantities of made-\r\n\r\nup  garments.  The value of annual imports  comes  to\r\n\r\nmore than $50 million. The receipts from these duties\r\n\r\nare estimated at $12 million for the financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, no reason why local consumers\r\n\r\ncannot  buy  our locally-manufactured  garments  when\r\n\r\nAmericans,   Swiss,  Englishmen  and  Europeans   are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  their quality. If,  however,  people\r\n\r\nstill prefer imported clothes as against locally-made\r\n\r\nclothes, it is not unfair to require them to  make  a\r\n\r\nspecial contribution to the Defence effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to revise the present system of assessing\r\n\r\nthe  value  of motor vehicles on which the additional\r\n\r\nregistration  fee  is levied. The  present  basis  of\r\n\r\nassessment  for imported vehicles is a  C.I.F, value\r\n\r\nand for locally-assembled vehicles the equivalent  of\r\n\r\nC.I.F, value.  This  latter  figure  is  a  notional\r\n\r\nquantity   and   is  likely  to  become  increasingly\r\n\r\nfictitious  as an increasing proportion  of  vehicles\r\n\r\nregistered  come from our local assembly  plants.  It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  necessary to revise the  system  and\r\n\r\nadopt a more realistic basis. With effect from today,\r\n\r\nthe  additional  registration fee which  will  remain\r\n\r\nunchanged will be based on \"open market value\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the \"open market value\" system, the assessment\r\n\r\nis  based  not only on the C.I.F, value but  also  on\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincidental   costs,   such   as   handling   charges,\r\n\r\nadvertisement costs and agency commission. Generally,\r\n\r\nthe \"open market value\" will be between 10 and 15 per\r\n\r\ncent higher than the C.I.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances of under declaration of\r\n\r\nC.I.F, values   by  importers  in  collusion   with\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  which  has  resulted  in  an  evasion  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  collected by the Registry of  Vehicles.  The\r\n\r\nnew  basis of assessment is in line with the practice\r\n\r\nin Malaysia and in the Customs Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this change to a more realistic\r\n\r\nvaluation is to increase slightly the additional  tax\r\n\r\npayable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases are likely to range from $20 in the\r\n\r\ncase  of a cheap car to $180 in the case of the  more\r\n\r\nexpensive models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, locally-assembled commercial vehicles and\r\n\r\nomnibuses  have  not been subject to  tax.  This  was\r\n\r\nbecause  until  recently there  have  been  no  local\r\n\r\nassemblies,  it is proposed, with effect from  today,\r\n\r\nto  impose  an  ad valorem tax of five  per  cent  on\r\n\r\ncommercial  vehicles  and  omnibuses.  This  levy  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to the existing levy that has been payable on\r\n\r\ncommercial  vehicles  and  omnibuses  imported   from\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries. The  yield  from  these  two\r\n\r\nmeasures for the financial year is estimated at  $1.6\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also propose to levy a transfer fee of two per\r\n\r\ncent on the value of vehicles ~ transfer of ownership\r\n\r\nsubject to a minimum fee of $5 for a motor-cycle  and\r\n\r\n$20  for a motor car. The yield is expected to be  $2\r\n\r\nmillion for the financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be a revision of stamp duties At\r\n\r\npresent,  the annual yield from stamp duties  amounts\r\n\r\nto $9 million. As hon. Members know, stamp duties are\r\n\r\npayable   on   a  large  variety  of  documents   and\r\n\r\ninstruments - on receipts, cheques, transfer of title\r\n\r\ndeeds, and so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non.  The last revision was done in 1952. Previous  to\r\n\r\nthat,  the last major revision was way back in  1931.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, nearly half the rates applicable today were\r\n\r\nlevied  in  1931, and the present revision  does  not\r\n\r\nintroduce  any drastic changes in rates and  charges,\r\n\r\nbut  is  more in keeping with present-day conditions.\r\n\r\nThe  revisions  in stamp duty rates are  expected  to\r\n\r\nyield  an  additional  $3.8  million  in  the  coming\r\n\r\nfinancial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I began my address with Defence expenditure and\r\n\r\nI  will  conclude on the same theme.  The  new  taxes\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have just announced will help  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nrather   less  than  10  per  cent  of  our   Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure incurred next year calculated on a, cash\r\n\r\nbasis. We are fortunate in being able to offset  part\r\n\r\nof the expenditure with British aid while, in respect\r\n\r\nof  another substantial amount, we can take advantage\r\n\r\nof  credit  terms offered by suppliers.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nmain, the additional expenditure has been financed by\r\n\r\nsiphoning  off  the major part of additional  revenue\r\n\r\naway  from  non-defence expenditure towards  Defence.\r\n\r\nThis   is   achieved   by   maintaining   non-defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure on a virtually standstill basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same pattern of expenditure is expected to\r\n\r\ncontinue over the next three years, that is  to  say,\r\n\r\nby placing a ceiling available for the development of\r\n\r\nthe  social services and on health and education.  We\r\n\r\nallow most of the additional revenues resulting  from\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  to  be channelled  towards  Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the price that we are paying. The cost is\r\n\r\nnot  so  much the additional burdens which  taxpayers\r\n\r\nhave to meet by the new measures. The cost is in  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of expenditure on non-defence  items.  We\r\n\r\nget  a bigger armed force by spending that much  less\r\n\r\nmoney  on  schools and on universities and on  better\r\n\r\nhealth and social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that nobody regards this with\r\n\r\nany  great pleasure. But there would be few who would\r\n\r\nbe  bold  enough  to say that what we  are  doing  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary and wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British military withdrawal is completed in\r\n\r\n1971, a new era will dawn on us. This event is likely\r\n\r\nto  he no less significant than our departure in 1965\r\n\r\nfrom  the Federation of Malaysia. Since 1965, we have\r\n\r\nproved  that as a separate economic entity  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  far  greater  survival  potential  than  many\r\n\r\npeople,  here  and elsewhere, had believed  possible.\r\n\r\nAfter  1971,  we  have  to go through  another  test,\r\n\r\nperhaps  a more exacting and rigorous test, and  that\r\n\r\nis  our  survival  potential as a separate  political\r\n\r\nentity  in  a  difficult and turbulent  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  If  in the intervening years we have  put  to\r\n\r\ngood account our resources in money, manpower, skills\r\n\r\nand organisation, I believe we shall pass the test of\r\n\r\npolitical  survival  as  adequately  as  we  are  now\r\n\r\npassing the test of economic survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As there are now approximately\r\n\r\n320,000  driving  licence holders and  254,000  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles,  the congestion at the Registry, especially\r\n\r\nduring the first ten days of each month, is very  bad\r\n\r\nindeed,  thus causing great inconvenience to  members\r\n\r\nof  the public and to the over-worked staff, as well.\r\n\r\nThese  numbers are increasing steadily,  so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat the situation has become untenable and should be\r\n\r\nrectified early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of last year, the problem was\r\n\r\nstudied  jointly  by  a team of  officials  from  the\r\n\r\nOrganisation and Methods Branch, the Electronic  Data\r\n\r\nProcessing  Unit and the Registry of  Vehicles.  They\r\n\r\ncame quickly to the conclusion that the congestion at\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  of Vehicles can only  be  relieved  if\r\n\r\nrenewal of licences is decentralised, In other words,\r\n\r\nlicences  should not be renewed at one central  place\r\n\r\nonly,  but should instead be renewed at post  offices\r\n\r\nthroughout  the island, as in the case of  television\r\n\r\nand  radio licences. However, at the start,  only  15\r\n\r\nselected  post offices will be used out of a possible\r\n\r\n42.  This  team also recommended that the  scheme  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  two  stages. For  the  first  stage,\r\n\r\ndriving  licences are to be renewed at post  offices,\r\n\r\nleaving  the  renewal  of  vehicle  licences  to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  at  the second stage. The  scheme  recom\r\n\r\nmended by them also includes the use of computers  to\r\n\r\nrecord  and check the particulars on driving licences\r\n\r\nto enable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Vehicles to send reminders to licence\r\n\r\nholders before the expiry of their licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to implement\r\n\r\nthese proposals, i.e., to decentralise the renewal of\r\n\r\ndriving  licences  and for the use  of  computers  to\r\n\r\nrecord and check particulars on driving licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now. Sir, elaborate further on the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance at present requires applicants for\r\n\r\ndriving licences to furnish photographs and,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of paid drivers, to permit fingerprints  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.  Since photographs and fingerprints cannot  be\r\n\r\nrecorded  by  the computer, the existing requirements\r\n\r\nare  to  be  dispensed with and this is  effected  by\r\n\r\namending section 13 of the Ordinance in clause  3  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. However, the necessary identification  can\r\n\r\nstill  be maintained by the fact that the new driving\r\n\r\nlicence  will bear the holder's identity card  number\r\n\r\nand, in the case of foreigners, a special number will\r\n\r\nbe  allotted.  As for fingerprints, the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  still has powers under section  18  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to take fingerprints, if he so desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also amends section 13 (8) of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance which provides that a driving  licence\r\n\r\nshall  remain valid for one year or three years  from\r\n\r\nthe date on which it was granted as the applicant may\r\n\r\nelect  at the time of application. Since the computer\r\n\r\nis  programmed to work in monthly cycles, it will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide that licences expire on the last\r\n\r\nday  of  each  month.  For instance,  under  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem, a licence taken out on 12th August, 1968, for\r\n\r\none  year  will expire on 31st August, 1969, (instead\r\n\r\nof 12-8-69). Eventually, therefore, all licences will\r\n\r\nexpire  on  the last day of the month, and will  then\r\n\r\nbecome  renewable on the first day of  the  following\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 (1) of the existing Ordinance provides\r\n\r\nthat  a  driving licence shall not be granted  unless\r\n\r\nthe  applicant  satisfies the Registrar  of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nthat he has at some time passed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprescribed tests. The operating words \"at some  time\"\r\n\r\nmean  that a licence may have lapsed for an unlimited\r\n\r\nperiod  and  can  still  be renewed.  Under  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem,  as provided for in clauses 4 and  5  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  computer will maintain records for  three\r\n\r\nyears  only,  so  a licence which has  lapsed  for  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous   period   of   three   years   will    be\r\n\r\nautomatically  cancelled, and  the  person  concerned\r\n\r\nwill have to apply for a fresh licence and to undergo\r\n\r\nand pass the usual tests. However, provision will  be\r\n\r\nmade  under  the  rules  for  persons  to  apply  for\r\n\r\ndeferment  of  renewal  for, various  reasons,  like\r\n\r\nextended  illness,  travel  abroad,  etc.,  and  thus\r\n\r\n\"preserve\" the licence for subsequent renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 of the Ordinance contains provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  endorsements on driving licences.  This\r\n\r\nsection  has  to  be  repealed  on  account  of   the\r\n\r\nlimitations  of  the  computer  system  which  cannot\r\n\r\nrecord the endorsements on driving licences, and also\r\n\r\nin  view  of the fact that such endorsements do  not,\r\n\r\neven  at present, serve much useful purpose. Instead,\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Vehicles will now record particulars\r\n\r\nof   convictions  of  certain  offences  and  of  any\r\n\r\ndisqualification and will maintain such records for a\r\n\r\nperiod of three years from the date of the conviction\r\n\r\nof  expiry of such disqualification, as the case  may\r\n\r\nbe.  The amendment to section 21 of the Ordinance  is\r\n\r\ncontained in clause 7 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is taken in clause 8 of the Bill to\r\n\r\namend  section 41 of the Ordinance so as  to  empower\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Vehicles, or any officer authorised\r\n\r\nby  him,  to  seize a vehicle found  to  be  used  in\r\n\r\ncontravention of any provision of the Ordinance or of\r\n\r\nany rule, order or prohibition made thereunder or  of\r\n\r\nany term of the licence for such vehicle. At present,\r\n\r\nthe  power to seize a vehicle is vested solely in the\r\n\r\nhands of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add, Sir, that as the computerised driving\r\n\r\nlicence  renewal scheme represents a  radical  change\r\n\r\nfrom  the  present system, adequate  notice  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven to present licence holders;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  particular, drivers whose driving  licences  have\r\n\r\nlapsed  for  more  than three  years  will  be  given\r\n\r\nsufficient  time to renew their licences  before  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating to automatic  cancellations  are\r\n\r\nbrought  into force.

And the sale  of  medicines  is\r\n\r\nspecifically controlled under the provi\r\n\r\nsion  of clause 7 which requires the disclosure\r\n\r\nof  the  active ingredients of the medicine  on\r\n\r\nthe  label. The label to be written in  English\r\n\r\nas  well as the language of the origin  of  the\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The prohibition of advertisements relating to\r\n\r\na person's medical skills or services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prohibition of self-advertisement and\r\n\r\nadvertisements   for   the   treatment   of   certain\r\n\r\nconditions  forms  the core of  the  Bill.  They  are\r\n\r\nnecessary for the effective control of the more  flag\r\n\r\nrant and exaggerated claims which mislead and exploit\r\n\r\nthe  sufferings  and  anxieties  of  our  people   by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two provisions were not seriously challenged\r\n\r\nand  have  generally been accepted in  principle.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  was  one  written representation  which\r\n\r\nstated  that the ban on advertisements should  extend\r\n\r\nto  all  diseases or medical conditions. The purpose,\r\n\r\nhowever,  of  the Bill is to control effectively  the\r\n\r\nmore  flagrant  and exaggerated advertisements  which\r\n\r\nare  commonly  published and which purport  to  offer\r\n\r\ncures  and  effective treatment of  conditions  which\r\n\r\nwould  probably be best left to trained  professional\r\n\r\npersons or be undertaken in medical institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Physicians' Association have declared\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  support of the prohibition  of  self-\r\n\r\nadvertisements  and advertisements for  services.  In\r\n\r\ntheir  case, they are handicapoed by the  lack  of  a\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  board. The amendment  will,  therefore,\r\n\r\nreinforce  the  hand  of physicians  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool  which  will  now be able to  reinforce  their\r\n\r\nstand by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some reservations were expressed on the banning of\r\n\r\nadvertisements  entirely.  A  suggestion   was   that\r\n\r\n\"exaggerated\" advertisements only should be  prohibit\r\n\r\ned,  but advertisements might be allowed if they  are\r\n\r\nnot more than 10 square\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninches and limited to giving the practitioner's  name\r\n\r\nand  address.  Another suggested that only  \"genuine\"\r\n\r\npractitioners,  in contra-distinction  to  the  bogus\r\n\r\npractitioners, may be allowed to advertise. These, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  are unrealistic. It is impossible to  define\r\n\r\nwhen  an  advertisement is exaggerated or  otherwise,\r\n\r\nand  there is no real way of distinguishing  the  so-\r\n\r\ncalled   \"genuine\"   from  the  \"bogus\"   physicians,\r\n\r\nespecially  those who claim to practise  the  various\r\n\r\nsystems  of  Eastern medicine which are  traditional,\r\n\r\nwithout  set standards of training, examinations,  or\r\n\r\ndisciplinary bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minor amendments have been made to the Bill in\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee. Clause 2 adds to the definition\r\n\r\nof  an  advertisement  with the expression  \"and  any\r\n\r\nother form of advertising\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment was made following the representation\r\n\r\nof the Pharmacists' Association. The Secretary of the\r\n\r\nPharmacists'  Association had drawn attention  to  an\r\n\r\nambiguity  in  the definition of \"advertisement\".  In\r\n\r\nthe  original Ordinance the definition of  \"advertise\r\n\r\nment\" was adequate to control advertisements for  the\r\n\r\nlisted conditions. As the amendment Bill extends  the\r\n\r\ncontrol   of  advertisements  to  prohibit   personal\r\n\r\nadvertisements, that is, advertisements referring  to\r\n\r\na person's ability or skills, or services offered, it\r\n\r\nis    necessary   to   extend   the   definition   of\r\n\r\n\"advertisement\" accordingly. However, by doing so, it\r\n\r\nwould  mean that the control of advertisements  would\r\n\r\nextend  to prohibiting certain legitimate name-plates\r\n\r\nused  by  medical  and dental practitioners  or  sign\r\n\r\nboards   of   clinics  or  dispensaries  where   such\r\n\r\nprofessional practitioners work. Obviously, it is not\r\n\r\nthe intention to prohibit such legitimate sign-boards\r\n\r\nor   name-plates.  Therefore,  an  exemption   c1ause\r\n\r\n(clause 8) has been added in order to give the  power\r\n\r\nto the Minister to determine which advertisements may\r\n\r\nbe exempted from the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously impossible to define the limits of\r\n\r\nadvertisements  when they would come  under  control,\r\n\r\nand when they do not. Rather than making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrequent  amendments to the law, which  will  require\r\n\r\nthe  complex  procedure of introduction  and  passage\r\n\r\nthrough Parliament, the Minister is given the  discre\r\n\r\ntion to determine the classes of advertisements which\r\n\r\nare  exempted  from  time to time.  A  body  of  case\r\n\r\npractice will eventually be formed which will help to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  application  of  the  law   and   its\r\n\r\nregulations  and  define what may be  advertised  and\r\n\r\nwhat may not be advertised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of this Bill will provide for more\r\n\r\neffective  control  over  advertisements  on  medical\r\n\r\nmatters  which  have  not  been  possible  under  the\r\n\r\noriginal Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DAY MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That at its rising this day Parliament do\r\n\r\nstand adjourned to 9th December, 1968.\"-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DISCONTINUATION OF TOTO</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, several month\r\n\r\nhave  elapsed  since  the Government  in  this  House\r\n\r\napproved  the  introduction of Toto.  After  a  close\r\n\r\nanalysis  and  observation of Toto  and  the  various\r\n\r\nreactions towards it, we have discovered one  feature\r\n\r\nwhich is quite contradictory lo the purpose for which\r\n\r\nToto  was  introduced  by  Government.  This  was  to\r\n\r\nprovide some kind of game for the public in order  to\r\n\r\nraise funds from them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  use  in the construction of the National  Sports\r\n\r\nComplex.  Briefly,  that  was  the  original  aim  in\r\n\r\nintroducing Toto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everybody knows, the main aim of the construction\r\n\r\nof  the  National  Sports Complex  is  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  place  and  adequate  facilities  for   the\r\n\r\ntraining of our youths in the field of sports,  which\r\n\r\nis  in  line  with our national slogan of building  a\r\n\r\nrobust  society. However, from the operation of  Toto\r\n\r\nat  the  present juncture, we can see  for  ourselves\r\n\r\nthat the trend is that we will finally end up with  a\r\n\r\nloss  instead of a gain. This is because Toto, as  it\r\n\r\nis  now,  has become a form of gambling open  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Irrespective of their age, they  indulge  in\r\n\r\nthis  game. We can see that they come from the public\r\n\r\nservice and other walks of life. Members of the civil\r\n\r\nservice are so preoccupied with Toto that they do not\r\n\r\npay  much attention to their work. I have come across\r\n\r\none case like this. A member of the civil service was\r\n\r\non  the  phone  and  was asking what  were  the  best\r\n\r\nnumbers  for the day. As a result of this,  he  might\r\n\r\nhave neglected his duties. This was only a chance dis\r\n\r\ncovery  on my part. There are many other cases  which\r\n\r\nmay not have been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are other more serious\r\n\r\nproblems  arising  out  of Toto.  For  instance,  our\r\n\r\ninnocent  students  are  involved.  As  Toto   is   a\r\n\r\nlegalised  and  open form of gambling, many  students\r\n\r\ntake  an interest in it with the idea of having  some\r\n\r\nfun. So they make use of their pocket money, which is\r\n\r\nmeant  for  better purposes, to bet on Toto.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  several  letters in which  the  parents  of\r\n\r\nthese  students complain about Toto.  They  say  that\r\n\r\ntheir children take part in the game and they express\r\n\r\nanxiety  for  their children if Toto  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if the opinion  is  that\r\n\r\nToto  is  not  harmful  to students,  then  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  why I have received such complaints  from\r\n\r\nthe  parents.  If we go further into the  problem  of\r\n\r\nToto,  we  find ourselves faced with these questions.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen if a student strikes the first prize\r\n\r\nin  Toto and what use will he make of the money? Does\r\n\r\nit mean that he will discontinue his studies and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy  life on the prize money, or will he invest  it\r\n\r\nin the Jurong Industrial Estate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have sufficient safeguards for our\r\n\r\nsecurity. We know that in the past few months someone\r\n\r\nwho was said to have won the first prize was followed\r\n\r\nclosely  by  would-be  extortioners,  kidnappers   or\r\n\r\nblackmailers.  He received several ransom  notes  and\r\n\r\nbefore  he got his prize money he kicked the  bucket.\r\n\r\nThese  are  some of the problems arising out  of  the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of  Toto  to  which  we   should   pay\r\n\r\nattention. Must we encourage our people to gain money\r\n\r\nby  unhealthy means? Singapore is a young country. We\r\n\r\ncan  say  that it is like a three-year old child  who\r\n\r\nneeds  a great deal of nutrition and healthy thinking\r\n\r\nto  enrich  his mind in order that he may  tread  the\r\n\r\npath to a great future when he grows up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we feel that the National Sports Complex is so\r\n\r\nimportant  in building a rugged society,  then  there\r\n\r\nshould  be adequate provision in the Budget  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of this sports complex. But  why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not adequately provided in the  Budget?\r\n\r\nThis  is  rather  ridiculous.  If  our  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  is  unable  to make adequate  provision  and\r\n\r\ncalculate  the cost of construction of  the  National\r\n\r\nSports  Complex, then we should try  to  raise  funds\r\n\r\nfrom sports enthusiasts and rich businessmen who  are\r\n\r\ninterested in sports. We can persuade them and  other\r\n\r\nphilanthropists to donate money for the  construction\r\n\r\nof the National Sports Complex, or alternatively, our\r\n\r\nMinister can set up a National Sports Fund Committee,\r\n\r\nalong  the same lines as the National Theatre  Trust,\r\n\r\nto raise funds for this purpose. This National Sports\r\n\r\nFund  Committee will be empowered to raise funds  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  constructing  the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nComplex.  This  will be a better way than  trying  to\r\n\r\nobtain money through Toto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, 85 per cent of the money comes from the\r\n\r\npoor people who bet on Toto. This means that the  con\r\n\r\nstruction  of  the National Sports  Complex  will  be\r\n\r\nfinanced by the poor people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  extent of 85 per cent. That being so, cannot\r\n\r\nwe raise funds from some other sources? Why should we\r\n\r\ntry  to'  fleece  the  poor at  the  expense  of  our\r\n\r\ninnocent youths who will be open to the temptation of\r\n\r\ngambling,  with all its dangers and ill  effects?  We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  gambling is a sign  of  decay  in  a\r\n\r\nnation.  We  should  not allow our  young  people  to\r\n\r\nindulge   in  this  most  undesirable  and   decadent\r\n\r\npractice. We must abolish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel that Toto should not be\r\n\r\nallowed to continue in Singapore. This is because the\r\n\r\nbenefits and profits derived from Toto are not entire\r\n\r\nly  used for the construction of the National  Sports\r\n\r\nComplex.   Some  of  the  benefits  are  enjoyed   by\r\n\r\nSingapore  Pools (Private) Limited.  Why  should  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  allow this organisation  to  continue  in\r\n\r\nexistence?  Finally, I submit once  again  that  Toto\r\n\r\nshould be discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\ndecades  and decades, there have been many  forms  of\r\n\r\nillegal  gambling in Singapore. Millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nchange  hands  every month in such forms  of  illegal\r\n\r\ngambling  as chapji-kee, chee-fah, mahjong,  pai-kow,\r\n\r\nfan-tan,  1,000  characters,  10,000  characters,  3-\r\n\r\ndigits,  4-digits,  punting  and  illegal  off-course\r\n\r\nbookmaking.  The monies involved in  these  forms  of\r\n\r\ngambling  only  go  towards enriching  a  handful  of\r\n\r\nbookmakers and operators but are of no direct benefit\r\n\r\nto society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to moral teachings and to the\r\n\r\nanxiety  of  religious leaders to  uphold  the  moral\r\n\r\nstandards  of  our  nation, it appears  to  me  that,\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking, gambling is in the blood. Even in\r\n\r\nlegitimate businesses like trading in tin and  rubber\r\n\r\nand on the Stock Exchange, the element of gambling is\r\n\r\nvery marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of allowing the numerous forms of\r\n\r\nillegal   gambling  to  go  on  in   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  thought of a simple game  of  chance\r\n\r\ncalled \"Toto\" a game which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta is so very much against -  to  help\r\n\r\nraise funds for a cause that will benefit society and\r\n\r\nthe  nation  as  a whole, namely, the building  of  a\r\n\r\nsports  complex costing $60 million to promote sports\r\n\r\nand  thereby help to build a rugged society in  which\r\n\r\nthere  will be less and less of what I call the sissy\r\n\r\ntype  of  citizens but more and more  of  the  virile\r\n\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some idealists might argue against Toto because\r\n\r\nit  is  a  form of gambling, but let them  suggest  a\r\n\r\nbetter  way  of raising the money needed for  such  a\r\n\r\nworthy  cause as a sports complex. They might suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Government should appeal to the goodwill and\r\n\r\npatriotism of the people to donate to the fund,  just\r\n\r\nas  they have done so splendidly in donating  to  the\r\n\r\nNational  Defence Fund. This might be a  better  way,\r\n\r\nbut it is not a sure way or an effective way. It will\r\n\r\ntake  a  long,  long  time to raise  the  needed  $60\r\n\r\nmillion, and we must have the money by 1971  or  1972\r\n\r\nwhen the sports complex will be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, in running public business,\r\n\r\ncannot  be  blind to reality. It has to be  pragmatic\r\n\r\nand face realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be borne in mind that without a Government-\r\n\r\nsponsored  game of chance such as Toto, the  illegal\r\n\r\nforms of gambling that have plagued Singapore will go\r\n\r\non  despite  the tightening of the law against  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even if Toto is regarded as an  evil,  let\r\n\r\nus  choose the lesser evil of the two and channel the\r\n\r\nproceeds  of  this  non-profit  corporation  to   the\r\n\r\ngeneral good of society and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British Museum was built with the proceeds\r\n\r\nof   lotteries.  So  was  the  National  Theatre   of\r\n\r\nAustralia. Let The sports complex of Singapore  stand\r\n\r\nas  a  monument  to the co-ordinated efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people of Singapore in  returning\r\n\r\nto  the  people what has been received from  them  in\r\n\r\nthis  painless, effective and almost effortless  game\r\n\r\nof chance called \"Toto\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am in agreement with the views\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Member for Delta on Toto. I have\r\n\r\ndiscussed the subject of Toto with many people and\r\n\r\nthey think that its evils outweigh its advantages.\r\n\r\nThere are four reasons why I support the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Toto will affect many families, especially\r\n\r\nhousewives, in the lower income group. They may  make\r\n\r\nuse  of their market-money and pocket-money and  even\r\n\r\nthe  savings  of their children to indulge  in  Toto.\r\n\r\nThis  will result in a lack of nutritional  food  for\r\n\r\nthe  children, and this is tantamount to  maltreating\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the workers will be affected as they will\r\n\r\nthrow  away  their money on Toto and their  take-home\r\n\r\npay  will  be  less. They will not be  able  to  make\r\n\r\nproper use of their wages to help their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Toto is a bad influence on children and\r\n\r\nstudents.   Whole   families  gather   before   their\r\n\r\ntelevision sets to see whether the numbers  that  are\r\n\r\ndrawn  have been correctly guessed by them. To  teach\r\n\r\nthe  people to get something for nothing is wrong and\r\n\r\nthis  is  very  damaging to the spiritual  and  moral\r\n\r\nvalues of the people. Therefore, this is contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe policy of building a rugged nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Toto will encourage the cultivation of bad\r\n\r\ntraits   in   our  society.  It  may   even   pervade\r\n\r\ninstitutions of learning. I remember the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  passed a circular forbidding  teachers  to\r\n\r\nindulge  in  Toto.  If  this  trend  is  allowed   to\r\n\r\ncontinue,  more  and more people will  not  stick  to\r\n\r\ntheir jobs and they will become gamblers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir,I am not in any way exaggerating what I have said, because an evil thing, starting in a small way, can grow bigger and bigger. Even cancer starts from the clotting of a tiny cell. The Minister in charge of Toto may argue that the purpose of Toto is to raise funds for the building\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a  national sports complex. That, I agree, is  a\r\n\r\ngood  and  proper objective, but the necessary  funds\r\n\r\nshould not be raised by means of gambling. I am  sure\r\n\r\nthere are better ways of raising the money needed for\r\n\r\nthe  building  of  this national sports  complex.  If\r\n\r\ndonations  for  this worthy cause are allowed  to  be\r\n\r\ndeductible from income tax, I am sure wealthy people,\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and commercial firms will donate.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should rely on other means  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  funds for the completion of  the  national\r\n\r\nsports  complex, it is improper to rely on  Toto  for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the view of the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta that Toto should be discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs  and as Toto is a  subject  under  my\r\n\r\ncharge, I have to say a few words on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that a person who does not want to gamble\r\n\r\ncannot  be coerced into gambling. For instance,  even\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament who want to gamble can  do  so.\r\n\r\nEven prisoners gamble among themselves, although they\r\n\r\nare prohibited from doing so. I have learnt that they\r\n\r\nuse  match-sticks to gamble, if a fly alights on  the\r\n\r\nmatch-stick  belonging to a prisoner, he is  declared\r\n\r\nthe  winner. In other words, if a person is  inclined\r\n\r\nto  gamble,  he  will do so under any conditions.  If\r\n\r\nToto is discontinued, the gamblers will turn to other\r\n\r\nforms of gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi spoke about various forms of\r\n\r\ngambling,  such  as  chap-ji-kee,  1,000  characters,\r\n\r\n10,000  characters, and so on. It is  very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  prohibit gambling. We are all  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the welfare of the people of this country.  We\r\n\r\nwant to make sure that they can go through trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations,  if we tell them only  about  the  good\r\n\r\nside of things and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  not  tell  them  about the bad  side, they  will\r\n\r\ncollapse  when they are faced with it. This will  not\r\n\r\nbe  good  for our people. Ours is a newly independent\r\n\r\ncountry  and the people should be able to endure  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  trials  and  tribulations.  For  instance,\r\n\r\ndonations have been made for various purposes. My con\r\n\r\nstituents have been asked to donate towards  a  road-\r\n\r\nbuilding fund and they have been urged to donate more\r\n\r\nmoney  to  build  better facilities and  improve  the\r\n\r\nappearance of their constituency. They will then have\r\n\r\na  good  impression of us and we will be able to  win\r\n\r\nthem over again at the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said earlier that the raising of certain taxes is inevitable because of an increase in the Defence expenditure. Some people are against any increase in taxes. If we do not impose additional taxes, we will not be able to meet our increased expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to introduce Toto into Singapore was\r\n\r\narrived   at   after   consultations   with   various\r\n\r\ncommittees. Toto is not the best means to raise funds\r\n\r\nto  build  a sports complex. But then we do not  have\r\n\r\nenough  funds  without  recourse  to  Toto  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose.  Members of Parliament and  all  the  people\r\n\r\ncannot  donate enough to the fund, although they  pay\r\n\r\nlip service to this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have enough funds to pay the necessary\r\n\r\npersonnel  required to run the sports  complex,  what\r\n\r\nthen is the way open to us? There is a need today for\r\n\r\nToto  in order to raise funds for our national sports\r\n\r\ncomplex.  All  along we have been talking  about  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of a rugged, brave and healthy society.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  easier said than done. Whatever we intend  to\r\n\r\ndo,  we  must  have the means to accomplish  it.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  must have nourishment to  sustain  our\r\n\r\npeople. But what are we going to do if we do not have\r\n\r\nany  funds? Every day we can see people indulging  in\r\n\r\nmany forms of gambling, not just chap-ji-kee and chee-\r\n\r\nfah.  Why should we not divert the money being  spent\r\n\r\non these illegal forms of gambling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a legal form like Toto, the proceeds of which can\r\n\r\nbe  used to build a sports complex? if there  is  any\r\n\r\nsurplus from the proceeds, we can also make use of it\r\n\r\nto  promote  various  forms of  sports  and  athletic\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny that some of the remarks made by some\r\n\r\nMembers  just  now are quite correct.  But  I  cannot\r\n\r\nagree  when they say that Toto will cause the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore to have bad habits, that it will have  a\r\n\r\nbad  effect on the family, that it will break up  the\r\n\r\nfamily, with evil consequences. I think the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are wise enough to be able  to  avoid  all\r\n\r\nthis. They know what they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I\r\n\r\nthink  the  case  for  Toto has been  eloquently  put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the Members for Changi and Jalan  Besar.\r\n\r\nWhat I now intend to do is to answer the points which\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised  by  the  Members  for  Delta  and\r\n\r\nSembawang.  They have based their case  on  the  very\r\n\r\nwrong  assumption that Toto is the root of all  evil;\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no gambling in Singapore  until  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of Toto, and that Toto  is  responsible\r\n\r\nfor a host of sins that are so general and unspecific\r\n\r\nthat  it  is difficult either to substantiate  or  re\r\n\r\npudiate  them, it is just the feeling  of  these  two\r\n\r\nMembers.  They appeal to the emotion rather  than  to\r\n\r\nthe intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that gambling is as old as the hills. Ever since Singapore was founded, there has been gambling. When the immigrant population came to settle here, gambling came with them too. The Member for Changi has given us a long list of the various forms of gambling, like chap-ji-\r\n\r\nkee,  pai-kow and all the rest of them. In fact, they\r\n\r\nwere so prevalent in Singapore that the police had  a\r\n\r\nhard time trying to control illegal gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of introducing Toto is not only to channel\r\n\r\npart  of  the  proceeds  to  a  worthy  cause,  which\r\n\r\notherwise would have gone to line the pockets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  illegal  operators, but also to  control  illegal\r\n\r\ngambling. Part of the reason for the introduction  of\r\n\r\nToto  is  therefore the very cogent one of trying  to\r\n\r\ncontrol illegal gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, may i quote from\r\n\r\nthe  Report of the Royal Commission on Gambling which\r\n\r\nwas   appointed  by  the  United  Kingdom  Government\r\n\r\nsometime  towards  the end of the 1940's  to  inquire\r\n\r\ninto  gambling  in the United Kingdom.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nReport  of the Royal Commission on Betting. Lotteries\r\n\r\nand Gambling, 1949/ 5/, and the passage I am going to\r\n\r\nquote is at page 61. The Report is dated 1951. It has\r\n\r\nthis to say about private gambling:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So long as these [meaning gambling facilities] are\r\n\r\nin  private hands, it would be impossible entirely to\r\n\r\nprevent   fraud,  exploitation  and  inducements   to\r\n\r\ngambling.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, if that is the case, so  long  as there   is  private  illegal  gambling  it  is   very difficult  to  control the exploitations,  fraud  and inducenients  to  gambling. To that  extent,  placing gambling  under  control  could  prevent  fraud   and explcitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Toto is doing just that. If you want to\r\n\r\ngamble, you gamble. If you do not want to gamble, the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot force you to gamble. What Toto does\r\n\r\nis  to  legalise a form of lottery so as  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthose  who have the habit of gambling and who gambled\r\n\r\neven  when  it was illegal ---- from being  exploited\r\n\r\nand  defrauded by illegal gambling operators. So  the\r\n\r\nbasic  assumption  that  Toto  is  the  root  of  the\r\n\r\ngambling habit in Singapore is wrong. Therefore, the\r\n\r\nMembers for Delta and Sembawang have not made  out  a\r\n\r\ncase  against Toto. In fact, gambling is so prevalent\r\n\r\nthat  it  is something, as the Member for Changi  has\r\n\r\nsaid, which is in the blood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now proceed to answer some of the very\r\n\r\ngeneral  allegations  made by the  two  Members.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta said that she had received  letters\r\n\r\nwritten  by  parents saying that their  children  had\r\n\r\nacquired the habit of gambling on Toto. As I see  it,\r\n\r\nif a parent cannot prevent his children from gambling\r\n\r\non Toto, there is nothing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  can  do  about  it.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has done these children a  good  turn  by\r\n\r\nlegalising Toto, because had Toto not been legalised,\r\n\r\nthey  would  in fact be infringing the law  and  they\r\n\r\ncould, when caught in the act of gambling, be brought\r\n\r\nto court. This is a case of loss of parental control,\r\n\r\nand I think it does not speak well of the writers  of\r\n\r\nthose letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegation by the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nthat  because of gambling people use their  money  on\r\n\r\nToto  which they would otherwise have spent on  food,\r\n\r\nthis  again is unsubstantiated. The allegation is  so\r\n\r\ngeneral that it is, in fact, quite difficult  for  me\r\n\r\nto  repudiate it. I think it is equally difficult for\r\n\r\nhim to substantiate the allegation. The point is that\r\n\r\nif a person has lost control over himself and prefers\r\n\r\nto spend the money on Toto rather than on food, then,\r\n\r\nfrom  the economic theory point of view, it could  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he gets more satisfaction out of  playing\r\n\r\nToto than spending money on food, in which case, good\r\n\r\nluck to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these arguments against Toto, I must\r\n\r\nrepeat,  Sir, are based on the basic assumption  that\r\n\r\nToto  is  the  only  form  of gambling  available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that  there  is  no  other  form   of\r\n\r\ngambling.  What  happened before the introduction  of\r\n\r\nToto?  Thousands of dollars, as the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nhas said, went into other forms of gambling like chap-\r\n\r\nji-kee, chee-fah and all the rest of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good thing has come out of Toto, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  At least part of the proceeds of gambling which\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise  have  gone to  enrich  the  illegal\r\n\r\noperators  is now channelled to a very good  cause  -\r\n\r\nthe  building  of a sports complex.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta  has  asked  why we should  use  this  form  of\r\n\r\ncollection  - why not ask the Government  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  it in the Budget or ask for donations from well-\r\n\r\nwishers and sports fans? The reason, and it is a very\r\n\r\ncogent  reason, why the Government cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\nmake provision for a sports complex in the Budget has\r\n\r\nbeen given by the Finance Minister in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  House  this  very  afternoon.  So  I  need  not\r\n\r\nelaborate on it. With regard to donations from  well-\r\n\r\nwishers,  hon. Members will realise that in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  tremendous  fervour shown towards  our  National\r\n\r\nDefence  Fund, - mind you, contributions towards  the\r\n\r\nNational  Defence  Fund get income  tax  rebate  -yet\r\n\r\nafter  nearly a year's efforts to date, we  have  got\r\n\r\nonly  $8  million. The sports complex costs some  $60\r\n\r\nmillion.  Just  the  other  day,  on  12th  November.\r\n\r\nSingapore  Pools (Private) Limited (the operators  of\r\n\r\nToto)  handed over to the Minister for Social Affairs\r\n\r\na  cheque for $2 million towards the building of  the\r\n\r\nsports complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of legalised lottery is very common all\r\n\r\nover  the world - both in socialist countries and  in\r\n\r\ncapitalist  countries. I have here a  research  paper\r\n\r\nprepared for the international Monetary Fund. (But it\r\n\r\nis expressly stated that the opinion expressed in the\r\n\r\npaper  need not necessarily reflect the views of  the\r\n\r\nFund.) This is a very authoritative paper prepared by\r\n\r\none Juanita D. Amatong for the international Monetary\r\n\r\nFund  and it is dated 16th April. 1968. The title  of\r\n\r\nthis  research  paper  is The Revenue  importance  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  Lotteries.  I  would  like  to  read  the\r\n\r\nconclusion of this research paper to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Barring social and moral objections to lottery, it\r\n\r\nseems  worthwhile for developing countries to explore\r\n\r\nfurther this particular source of revenue. Government\r\n\r\noperation of a lottery tends to shift gambling  gains\r\n\r\nfrom  private  hands  to  the  government,  and   may\r\n\r\nminimize its possible regressive effects by using the\r\n\r\nproceeds for general welfare purposes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two studies done independently -the Royal Commission\r\n\r\nReport  which I just quoted as well as this  paper  -\r\n\r\ncome  out  in  favour  of public lotteries.  In  this\r\n\r\nstudy, a  list  of 66 countries are  shown  to  have\r\n\r\ngovernment  lotteries and they range  from  socialist\r\n\r\ncountries  to capitalist countries both in  the  East\r\n\r\nand  in  the West. May II just quote a few  of  these\r\n\r\ncountries  -  the  ones  in  Asia.  They  are  Burma,\r\n\r\nCambodia.    Ceylon,   Malaysia, the   Philippines.\r\n\r\nThailand. Indonesia. Japan and Nepal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.
