I have an announcement to make on a matter concerning the conduct of an honourable Member of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th November 1995, I received a written complaint dated 3rd November 1995 from the Member for Potong Pasir, Mr Chiam See Tong, stating that the Member for Bukit Gombak, Mr Ling How Doong, had uttered certain unparliamentary words at him during the sitting on 3rd November 1995 and asking that the matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges. In another letter dated 7th November 1995, Mr Chiam also mentioned the names of Members who heard these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> words uttered by Mr Ling. Mr Chiam's letter (Cols. 407 - 408) to me dated 3rd November 1995 has been circulated to Members. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650407.htm\">Mr Chiam's letter (Cols. 407 - 408)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not hear these remarks contained in the complaint of Mr Chiam though I saw Mr Ling engaging in conversation with somebody else. At that moment, I called Mr Ling to order and asked him to resume his seat and reminded Mr Ling to refrain from engaging in conversation with others in the House as that was not the proper way to participate in a debate of the House, whereupon Mr Ling remarked \"When he is unparliamentary, why should I be parliamentary to him?\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On receipt of the complaint by Mr Chiam, I wrote to Mr Ling on 14th November 1995, asking for his response to Mr Chiam's complaint. Mr Ling, in his written explanation on 17th November 1995, said that other than certain words, he could not recall the rest and that he had uttered those words because he was provoked by remarks made by Mr Chiam. Mr Ling's letter (Cols. 409 - 410) to me has also been circulated to Members. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650409.htm\">Mr Ling's letter (Cols. 409 - 410)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have perused the Official Report of the Parliamentary Debates where it was recorded that Mr Ling had uttered the words that he had admitted to in his letter of 17th November 1995, which language I find to be unparliamentary and, as such, it is a breach of Standing Order 48(4). I am also of the opinion that the words \"When he is unparliamentary, why should I be parliamentary to him?\", in response to my order to refrain from engaging in conversation with others in the House and to resume his seat, are contemptuous of the Chair and undermine the dignity of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting with Mr Ling on 30th November 1995 in my chambers I informed Mr Ling that no matter what the provocation was, he had no excuse to use unparliamentary language in the House. Mr Ling agreed unreservedly to withdraw his unparliamentary remarks contained in the Official Report and to apologise to the House. He will also apologise for being \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contemptuous of, and disregarding the authority of the Chair when he continued to remark \"When he is unparliamentary, why should I be parliamentary to him?\" when called to resume his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now call upon Mr Ling to make his statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I unreservedly withdraw the words directed at the Member for Potong Pasir which were recorded in the Official Report. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I apologise to the House for having affronted its dignity in uttering those words and also for disregarding the authority of the Chair when asked to resume my seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I make it clear to hon. Members that the use of unparliamentary language by Members undermines the dignity and decorum of the House. Under no circumstances should a Member indulge in language that would lower the standing of this House. If a Member has heard unparliamentary language used against him, the proper procedure is for the Member to draw the Speaker's attention to the matter and not to aggravate the situation by using unparliamentary language. The Chair will not hesitate to enforce discipline and order in the House to uphold its good name. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my years in the House I cannot recall any similar instance of such unparliamentary language having been used by a Member. I hope that this incident will be the last of its sort. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Complaint by Member for Bukit Gombak)</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is due to strong global demand for electronic products like personal computers, disk drives and semiconductors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all segments did well. The consumer electronics segment declined by 4.6% in the first nine months of this year after expanding by 26% in 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to forecast growth accurately as the electronics industry is fast-moving and volatile. However, based on available information, the outlook appears good. Most analysts expect strong growth to continue up to the first half of 1996 because of the boom in personal computers and the present global shortage of components such as semiconductors. The latest survey of business expectations also shows that a net balance of 39% of electronics firms expect business to improve in the last quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996, compared with 27% in the same period last year. We can expect double-digit growth for 1995 and 1996, though not as high as in 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the longer-term, the prospects for the global electronics industry are good. Dataquest predicts that the global electronics demand will hit US$1.3 trillion by the year 2000. This represents an average annual growth rate of 8.7% over the period 1995-2000, compared to 7.4% over the period 1989-94. In addition, the Asia-Pacific's share of the global electronics demand will also grow from 19% in 1994 to 27% in the year 2000. By continuing to upgrade their core capabilities and moving into high value-added products, our electronics companies will be in a good position to benefit from this world-wide boom. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CHILD CARE CENTRES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Review of grants)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

By the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> end of FY 95, the target is to provide 402 centres with a total capacity of 30,562 places. The target set for FY 96 is 434 centres to provide for 32,642 places. The Ministry continually monitors the demand for child care services and sets up centres in tandem with demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for grants, Sir, child care centres set up by voluntary welfare organisations, non-profit organisations and workplaces receive capital grants for equipment and furnishings and for conversion costs. Grants are adequate and MCD will review them periodically as the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a child care subsidy for working mothers which was increased from $130 to $150 for full day care and from $65 to $75 for half day care with effect from April this year. This amounts to a $6.24 million increase in the budget for child care subsidy bringing the total to $40.82 million. Child care subsidies are reviewed on a regular basis in order to keep child care fees affordable and to make them attractive for working mothers to use child care centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

Much of the cost of installing the cable network in HDB estates is shared between HDB as lessor and SCV. Residents are also required to pay a small installation fee if they wish to subscribe to cable TV and additional TV services. Under the agreement between SCV and HDB, SCV takes over and upgrades the existing central antenna system in all HDB estates and is responsible for their maintenance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV will apply the same principle of cost-sharing for private housing estates. It is prepared to meet the owners, developers or management corporations of such estates to discuss equitable cost-sharing formulas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB-SCV cost sharing formula is probably not appropriate as a model for private estates. HDB estates are a special group. They have a common lessor, are generally consistent in design and have high unit concentrations. There are therefore economies of scale in installation. Private estates are less straightforward. SCV will have to customize installation for each of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it is true that cable TV will also be a platform for IT2000 and whether the Singapore Broadcasting Authority has the intention to link it to every home so that every household can take part in the national programme? May I ask what the Government will do in cases where the private households just cannot afford the link-up? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> For new developments, we will require the installation to be done. For existing developments, this will have to be phased in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> gradually and I do not see a problem for most private estates because the cost involved is not huge. If management corporations find it difficult to foot out a high upfront cost, SCV is prepared to negotiate a low upfront installation cost but recover the cost back later in higher subscription costs. But the objective is eventually to have all the households in Singapore wired onto the information highway. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, my point is what if some private households cannot afford or will not do it on the principle that the Government is paying for HDB households? So why should it not pay for private houses since HDB actually shares the cost with Singapore CableVision? When HDB has a deficit, the Government actually gives HDB a grant for covering the deficit which means that in actual fact, in the end, the cable links to HDB flats are being paid for by the Government. In such a case, why should the Government not pay for private houses? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in general, HDB is not paying more than it would have to pay to maintain the existing cable system, which we call the MATV system, as opposed to the new cable ready central antennae system which we call the CATV system. For new flats which are already wired for cable television, the full cost is recovered from the buyers. For old flats where MATV systems are due for replacement, HDB will pay what it would have to pay anyway for the MATV system and the rest will be topped up by SCV. For flats which already have the MATV system and are not yet due for replacement, HDB will cough up an amount roughly in between zero and what it would have cost them to completely replace the system. So it is not as if the laying of IT infrastructure for HDB estates requires additional funding by HDB. In general, they are paying what they would have to pay anyway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Heng's question concerns what happens if private housing estates voluntarily opt out from the cable TV system and whether we would require \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> them by law to install such a system. I think this is a bridge we will cross when we come to it. Let us try it out on a voluntary basis first, find out the extent of their problem before deciding whether legislation is necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has missed my point. My point is that the HDB's link-up is being paid for by the Government because, although HDB pays for it as a landlord, one must remember that HDB's yearly operating deficit is being funded by the Government through a grant to HDB. If HDB had not paid for this cost, HDB's deficit would be smaller and the Government therefore grants a smaller amount. In this sense, although it is being paid by HDB, it is actually being paid by the Government. And I am saying that if it is being paid for by the Government, then the people of Singapore living in private estates should also get the same benefit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I do not think that logic applies. HDB estates are generally subsidised. They are not being additionally subsidised for cable television. HDB is paying what it would have to pay anyway for the MATV system. In fact, HDB would have to pay less in the future because the future maintenance of the CATV system would be undertaken by SCV, and not by HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, does the Minister deny that the HDB actually gets a grant from the Government to cover its operating deficit on an annual basis? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, of course, HDB does get such a grant. And it would require less when SCV takes over the central antennae system because the maintenance of that system would then be done by SCV instead of HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, therefore, in such cases, if the HDB dwellers co-pay for the linking up of this cable television network, then the HDB's deficit would be much smaller and the grant would also be smaller. But because HDB now pays the share of the cost and the residents do not have to pay, the grant is bigger. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Those living in housing estates and who subscribe to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> SCV would have to pay an installation charge and, in addition, they have to pay a monthly subscription charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONVERSION OF ZEBRA CROSSINGS INTO PUSH-BUTTON PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether the Land Transport Authority will convert zebra crossings into push-button pedestrian crossings for greater road safety. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Goh Chee Wee) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Zebra crossings and push- button crossings are designed to suit different types of roads and traffic and pedestrian volumes. For roads with heavy traffic and pedestrian volumes, push-button pedestrian crossings are more appropriate. At such crossings, push buttons enable pedestrian demand to be recorded, and pedestrians can only cross when a \"green man\" is displayed. This arrangement enables pedestrians to cross safely while minimising delays to motorists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For local access roads with light traffic, zebra crossings are more suitable as they cause minimum inconvenience to both pedestrians and motorists. Pedestrians cross when they see it is safe to do so, while motorists are given advance warning to slow down by road signs. Transverse stripes along the approaches to the crossings slow down traffic and light beacons are installed to make the crossings more conspicuous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So both types of crossings are safe when installed and used as designed. The Land Transport Authority will monitor the usage of such crossings and make conversions where appropriate, eg, where traffic and pedestrian volumes have increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State whether, as an immediate measure, certain prominent pre-warning signs like \"Stop\", \"Look\", \"Walk\", could be installed at the zebra crossings as a guide to pedestrians using these crossings? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> We will certainly take into consideration the suggestion by the Member to help the pedestrians.

The libraries organise many outreach programmes like talks, library visits for schools, and workshops for members of the public on a regular basis using the auditoriums in the libraries. If we allow only students to use the auditoriums for study at examination times, the libraries would not be able to hold outreach programmes for members of the public during those months. This would deprive library users of such services. Most community centres provide facilities for students to study.

Every teacher eligible for promotion was considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two exercises carried out, about 7,500 teachers were promoted, the largest ever in the Education Service. The system to evaluate and recommend teachers for promotion is a fair and rigorous one, relying closely on the intimate knowledge of school supervisors serving on the panels. I am satisfied that teachers have been given fair consideration with regard to their promotion. In every promotion exercise, there will be a number who are unhappy at not being promoted. However, not all teachers can be promoted during this year's exercises given the large number of officers in the service. Teachers who were not promoted to the GEO IA and IIA grades this year will be eligible for consideration in next year's exercise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are in any way aggrieved have an avenue of appeal.

There had to be a cut-off point for every school. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Since there was ranking, was it also the guideline of the Ministry that a school could also distribute the ranking positions based on individual departments? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I am not aware of such detailed guidelines.

Were the criteria on how they were being ranked made known to the teachers of the schools concerned? Thirdly, were these teachers informed of their ranking and why they were ranked in that manner? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I think all teachers know that they were being evaluated by the supervisors, who are the principals, the principals and the heads of department. The teachers would know that they were being evaluated according to their performance, including the length of service and so on. These criteria are commonly accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's question on whether the school informed each and every teacher of the position of their ranking, I do not know the exact answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, how does the Ministry of Education ensure that the promotion exercise is fair and equitable across all schools? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I think Members of the House should look at the promotion exercise in perspective. In the last two exercises, as I said, 19,000 teachers were involved, and 26% were promoted in the October exercise alone. And if they did not get promoted this time, they would again be considered next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NORTH-EAST MRT LINE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Construction)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether the Government has decided to proceed with the construction of the North-East MRT line forthwith. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision to build the North-East line has been taken in principle. The decision on when to start work is now under active consideration. The Government will pay for the capital cost of the North-East line including the first set of trains if the operator can recover the operating cost including the cost of replacing the trains from fare revenues. Such a principle is a fair and prudent one. It ensures that any MRT extension, both now and in the future, is valued and is well used. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our financial analysis, we can start building the North-East line in about four years' time when there will be enough ridership to meet the operating cost based on the current fare structure. The Land Transport Authority has been asked to review and recommend ways, including having commuters pay a slightly higher fare, if necessary, to enable earlier expansion of the MRT network and to help us achieve a world-class transport system for Singaporeans. A White Paper on Land Transport will be released later this month. Singaporeans will be invited to give their views and their comments on this and other proposals in the White Paper. After Parliament has debated the White Paper, the Government will decide on the timing for the North-East Line. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EVIDENCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Evidence Act (Chapter 97 of the 1990 Revised Edition) and to make consequential amendment to the Computer Misuse Act (Chapter 50A of the 1994 Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for Law (Prof. S.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main amendment in this Bill relates to contempt of court. The provisions in the Subordinate Courts Act \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> concerning contempt of court are unsatisfactory because contempt of court includes contempt in the face of the court and contempt not in its face. Contempt in the face of the court essentially relates to activities within the court where the court has personal knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to the contempt. Examples would be interrupting court proceedings or refusing to answer questions before a court without lawful excuse. Contempt of court not in its face is wider in that it renders activities both in and outside of the court punishable. This is regardless of whether it is within the court's personal knowledge. Examples would be scandalising the court or refusing to comply with a court order. Under the amendments, the Subordinate Courts presently have the power to punish a person for contempt of court only where contempt is committed in the face of the court. Under the present provisions, the Subordinate Courts are unable to deal with matters which give rise to contempt not in its face. This is clearly inadequate. This lacuna will be remedied by an amendment which seeks to amend section 8 of the Subordinate Courts Act. In other words, Sir, with the amendments proposed, the Courts will be able to punish for contempt both in the face as well as not in the face of the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill and the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill are to give effect to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recommendations of the Rules of the Supreme Court Working Committee. The objectives of the amendments are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to empower the Subordinate Courts to punish any person who commits a contempt of court in connection with any proceedings in the Subordinate Courts; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to allow a Judge or Judicial Commissioner who reserves judgment in any proceedings to deliver his judgment even though his appointment as a Judge or Judicial Commissioner might have expired or has been terminated; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to establish a new Rules Committee under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to make a new set of Rules which will govern civil proceedings in both the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first point, I have already dealt with the matter when I took the Second Reading of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second proposed amendment, clause 3 of the Bill amends section 10 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to allow a Judge who has reserved judgment in any proceedings to deliver his judgment even though his appointment as a Judge might have expired or terminated. In addition, clause 3 of the same Bill amends the definition of a \"Judge\" in section 2 of the same Act to clarify that this word also includes a Judicial Commissioner being a person appointed to exercise the powers of a Judge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the third proposed amendment, the Rules of the Supreme Court Working Committee has proposed that there should be a single set of rules of court governing civil proceedings in both the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. This new set of Rules will be made by a single Rules Committee to be appointed under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. Clause 4 which amends section 80, together with clause 3 of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill which amends section 69 of the Subordinate Courts Act, both give effect to this proposal. The present Rules Committee \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> appointed under the Subordinate Courts Act will be replaced by the Rules Committee appointed under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential amendments will also be made to the Interpretation Act, the Small Claims Tribunals Act and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. The amendment to the Interpretation Act changes the reference of the Rules to the new Rules of Court and not the Rules of the Supreme Court/Supreme Court Rules or the Rules of the Subordinate Courts/Subordinate Courts Rules. The Small Claims Tribunals Act is also amended to enable future rules governing the proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunals to be made by the new Rules Committee to be appointed, and not the present Rules Committee under the Subordinate Courts Act. Finally, the consequential amendment to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act will change the composition of the new Rules Committee constituted under section 80(3) to include members of the subordinate judiciary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments are necessary to make the Courts even more effective and efficient in the administration of justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I wish to get some clarifications from the Minister. I wonder why is it necessary to have clause 3 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill. Have there been cases where a Judge has failed to deliver his reserved judgment at a later date after his appointment had expired or terminated? Following on that, is the Judge also required to prepare his notes of evidence and grounds of decision if there were an appeal on his judgment after he has left the service? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of \"Judge\", it includes a Judicial Commissioner being a person appointed to exercise the powers of a Judge. Just a clarification. Do Judicial Commissioners get the same salary although they are not Judges? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, in answer to his first question, as far as I can recall, there were at least one or two instances where a situation did occur that a Judge did not finally render his judgment before his termination or expiry of his term of appointment. I think such instances will be very rare. But to provide for that eventuality, this amendment is necessary. I am sure that in the present-day context, it is unlikely that this situation will arise. But if it does arise, I think we must provide that in that case, it will be permissible for the Judge to give his judgment, which has been reserved, at a later date. I understand that in one or two instances which happened previously, an option was given to the parties concerned that they could either agree to another Judge arriving at a decision based on the transcripts of the notes or to have the matter tried de novo, all over again. So it is to save time and effort that this provision is included. As to whether there will be provision for appeal on the reserved judgment, I am sure that the judiciary will provide for that kind of situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a Judicial Commissioner sitting as a Judge, this is also for avoidance of any doubt and you will find similar provisions elsewhere. I think there is such a provision even in the Constitution which clarifies the matter. The question of pay, of course, is not addressed here and that has to be dealt with separately elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, a further clarification. I think the Minister has not clarified the point where a Judge's appointment has already expired or terminated. He delivers the judgment after he has left the service. Then there is an appeal on his judgment. By this time, he is already out of the service. Has he got to come back and write his grounds of decision for the purposes of appeal? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> My understanding is that, and I stand corrected if other Members have any other information, if he has reserved judgment and he gives the judgment later, it will be a written judgment, which will therefore contain the grounds of his decision.

Singapore can no longer rely on growth achieved through increases in labour and capital resources. As Singapore moves towards the status of a developed country, a key challenge is to generate growth through more efficient and effective use of labour and capital. The qualitative improvements in the use of resources are known as Total Factor Productivity (TFP). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most developed countries at the same stage of development as Singapore is in now, TFP growth averaged 2% to 4% a year. However, for the period from 1980 to 1992, annual TFP growth in Singapore only averaged 0.4%. There is scope for our economy to be strengthened through improved TFP performance. Singapore should therefore aim to achieve annual TFP growth similar to that of the developed countries of at least 2%. This will help to sustain a productivity growth of 4% and GDP growth of 7%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate, the Minister also announced that a multi-agency task force had been set up to look into the strategic reorganisation of productivity and quality efforts currently undertaken by NPB, SISIR and EDB. The task force had completed its deliberations. The task force noted that while there are different agencies \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> addressing the various determinants of TFP separately, there is at the moment no single agency that is primarily responsible for TFP. The key recommendation that arose from the task force's deliberations was the setting up of a statutory board to be responsible for promoting TFP. The Bill before the House today is to establish the legislative framework for this new Board which will be called the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board (SPSB). We are targeting to establish the SPSB on 1st April 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SPSB will absorb the functions of NPB and SISIR and integrate EDB's small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development function. Its primary mission is to promote TFP growth and, through it, help to enhance our economic competitiveness. SPSB will adopt a holistic management of the main factors that have direct bearings on TFP growth. The three factors have been identified to be manpower development, economic restructuring and technical progress. These factors are very much inter-related and their overall impact on TFP growth depends very much on how well they are integrated and managed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the executive body responsible for TFP, SPSB will develop an overall plan, formulate policies and strategies, develop programmes, and manage incentive schemes related to manpower development, economic restructuring and technical progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To constitute SPSB, we need to enact the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board Bill and repeal the National Productivity Board Act and the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the key aspects of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the constitution of the SPSB's Board. An amendment to the Bill will be moved so that the Board of Directors will have between 8 and 18 members, including the Chairman and the Chief Executive. The constitution of the Board is tripartite, which is a feature retained from the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> existing constitution of NPB's Board. However, the restriction on the number of members that can represent Government, employers, trade unions, and professionals and academia are removed for added flexibility. The number of Board members has also been increased for greater flexibility too. The Minister will appoint the Chairman and members of the Board. As for the appointment of the Chief Executive, clause 12 requires that Minister's approval be sought by the Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the functions of the Board. The key function of SPSB is to raise productivity and improve competitiveness through manpower development, economic restructuring and technical progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of manpower development, SPSB will promote, facilitate, and assist in the development and upgrading of skills and expertise of persons preparing to join the workforce, persons in the workforce and persons rejoining the workforce. It will also take over the administration of the Skills Development Fund from the NPB. These functions are set out in clause 6(1)(b) and (c). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On industry development, its efforts will be in the development and upgrading of industry and enterprises and the support of the growth of small and medium enterprises. Clause 6(1)(d) of the Bill sets out this function. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of technical progress, clause 6(1)(e) provides that SPSB will take over SISIR's role as the national standards body and serve to promote and facilitate the national standardisation programme and the participation of Singapore in international standardisation activities. It will also encourage the development, application and diffusion of technology in industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPSB is empowered, inter alia, via clause 7 of the Bill, to establish and operate schemes considered necessary for furthering its functions. It will have powers to form and participate in any joint ventures and form companies. Clause \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 7(1)(r) allows SPSB to take over the administration of the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) from the EDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPSB is also allowed to invest its funds. Clause 19 of the Bill provides for this power. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPSB's operations and programmes will be funded by the Government and revenues from SPSB's activities. Clause 21 enables Government grants to be made to SPSB while clause 22 allows for SPSB to raise loans from the Government or, with the approval of the Minister, from banks and other financial institutions, if such a need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions have been made in clauses 24 to 29 of the Bill for assets, interests, rights, privileges, liabilities and obligations of NPB and SISIR to be transferred to SPSB. Staff in the two organisations will also be transferred to SPSB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of SPSB is a significant milestone in the Government's efforts to promote productivity growth. The adoption of a holistic approach to the management of TFP will bring about more efficient use of our labour and capital resources which, in turn, will contribute towards sustained productivity growth, competitiveness and economic progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House sets out the legislative framework to enable SPSB to carry out its mission. Total Factor Productivity growth is an imperative for Singapore's future economic development. The establishment of SPSB will put us in a favourable position to meet global competition, through an integrated approach of improving the quality of our workforce and capability of our industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. I would like to seek some clarification and ask some questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill sets out the functions of the proposed Singapore Productivity and Standards Board (SPSB) in clause 6 and its powers in clause 7. The objective and mission of this new Board are not stated \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the Bill. However, from the report of the Task Force on Institutional Reform for Productivity and Quality Improvements, which was released on 1st November 1995, it is obvious that the SPSB's mission is to increase Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth; and through increase in TFP, help to enhance Singapore's economic competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at this Bill in a wider context. Here we need to address two issues: why and how to increase TFP growth? Specifically, how would the institutional reform contribute to TFP growth? On the first issue, our economic growth in the past 35 years has been input-driven by injecting into the economy more labour, and subsequently, more capital. This has brought about rapid economic growth. However, this pattern of growth cannot be sustained in the future because of labour shortage, keener competition for foreign investments, and diminishing returns on larger capital investments. From now on, our economic growth will have to increasingly depend on the increase in TFP, a performance indicator of how effective and how efficient we use our human and capital resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past performance of the TFP growth has been poor, as the Minister of State has just mentioned. From 1980 to 1992, TFP grew by only 0.4%, and, if I may add, it contributed only 10% of Singapore's overall productivity growth; the other 90% came from increase in capital-labour ratio. If we break this period into two sub-periods: from 1980 to 1986, the average growth rate of TFP was negative (-0.8%); the increase in capital intensity (by 10%) made up for this poor performance of TFP to increase the overall productivity growth by 4.7%. However, from 1986 to 1992, the TFP grew by 1.7% while capital intensity by 3.6%. Now the target for TFP growth is set at 2% per annum in order to sustain a 7% GDP growth, up to the year 2000. Whether this is achievable depends on the improvements made on the determinants of TFP growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the second issue on how to raise TFP. The Task Force report listed five determinants of TFP growth: (a) \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> education and training; (b) economic restructuring; (c) technical progress; (d) changes in capital structure; and (e) intensity of demand. The report emphasized on the first three factors and recommended \"a holistic approach to manpower development, economic restructuring and technical progress\". Sir, conceptually, TFP growth is determined by productivity changes of the factors of production (ie, labour and capital) and technical change. `Education and training' increase TFP through labour, `changes in capital structure' raise TFP through capital, and `technical progress' increases TFP by shifting the entire production function, ie, increasing value-added or output for a given bundle of resources, that is, labour and capital combined. Hence, `economic restructuring' and `intensity of demand' cannot be treated pari passu with the other three determinants of TFP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Task Force report correctly observed \"there is a limit to which we can realistically influence demand intensity because of our heavy reliance on international market\", it nonetheless places much emphasis on `economic restructuring' as one of the three key factors which has direct bearing on TFP growth in the future. Economic restructuring involves reallocation of resources from low value-added, low-technology economic activities to high value-added, high-technology activities. But such reallocation of resources is conceptually different from the improvements of the quality of labour and capital, and technical progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more important than the conceptual difference is that the scope and strategy of economic restructuring are well beyond the powers and functions set out for this new agency. Although the Task Force Report indicated that the SPSB will focus on `economic restructuring', `in-employment training' and `technical progress' to achieve its mission, the scope of SPSB's work under `economic restructuring' is in fact confined to development of small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a function taken over from EDB. Similarly, the scope of SPSB's work under `technical progress' will be limited to technology development, application and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> commercialization, and also standardization and quality infrastructure, and other functions under the current SISIR. R&amp;D activities and technological infrastructure will remain in the domain of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) and its related research institutes and centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings out some specific questions concerning the institutional reform. Both the National Productivity Board and SISIR grew out of EDB, and developed into two separate statutory boards in 1972 and 1973 respectively. There was a need to carve out some functions hitherto under EDB to create these two new Boards in the early 1970s. So my first question is: What is the compelling reason for merging these two Boards now? Specifically, in what way will the merger of these two statutory boards contribute to a faster TFP growth than if the two agencies were to continue to function separately? After all, the SPSB will still have to work and coordinate its efforts with other agencies such as EDB, NTSB, and so on, to raise TFP. Second question: Should the functions of SISIR be merged with NTSB instead of NPB as both agencies have been dealing with different aspects of technical progress? Third question: Should a separate new agency be established to take over the development and upgrading of local enterprises, instead of submerging this important role under SPSB? If we intend to develop a strong domestic sector, there should be a holistic approach to help local enterprises grow. Lower productivity is but one of the problems faced by local enterprises. Will a separate agency, focusing on the local enterprises, be more effective in helping local enterprises grow? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a final question: Why was the Task Force Report not given to my GPC members and me on or before 1st November 1995 when it was released to the press? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the creation of the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board. The merger of NPB, SISIR and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> SME's development function of EDB into one organisation with a comprehensive mandate to improve productivity and quality standards will bring about positive synergies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight three areas for the Board's consideration when it is formed. First, its role in the development of SMEs; second, the use of Total Factor Productivity growth measures as a policy objective; and third, the need for good institutional relationships. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, SME development. The Bill states that one of the functions of the Board is \"to promote, facilitate and assist in the development and upgrading of industry and enterprises and support the growth of small and medium enterprises\". The Task Force Report on Institutional Reform for Productivity and Quality Improvements explains that the Board will have a local enterprise upgrading centre which will be a first-stop centre for SMEs and which will implement a number of schemes currently under the EDB. However, SME development is only one of the 10 functions of the Board, as stated in the Bill. My concern is whether SMEs will be given sufficient attention. Would SME development be lost in the multiplicity of functions of the Board? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the proposed Board is to deliver development support to SMEs more expeditiously, effectively and graciously. With the new synergies arising from the merger of NPB and SISIR, it has more inherent capabilities under one roof to do so. Since it is a new institutional set-up, the Board might want to come up with a new statement on SME policy and what it will do as a first-stop centre for SMEs. In this regard, I believe that SME policy in Singapore has to strike a balance between two extremes. The first extreme is that of a hands-off attitude on the part of the Government where SMEs are left to fend for themselves. In the Darwinian world of business competition, if they survive and grow, good for them. If they are unable to compete, too bad. The Government would take care of overall macro-economic stability but would not be involved in any specific programmes to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> assist SMEs. This is a policy of benign neglect. You swim, or you sink, at your own peril. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other extreme is that of molly-coddling SMEs to the point of heavily subsidising them in the form of preferential credit, generous investment allowances, and so on. This situation is entirely possible as SMEs often elicit much public sympathy. They are often perceived in some countries, and in Singapore as well, who need help because they are competing against the \"big boys\" and that the playing field is not level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Productivity and Standards Board in achieving its stated function of promoting SMEs should neither neglect nor molly-coddle them. Instead, the purpose of the Board should be to facilitate SME development in such a way as to promote healthy and viable SMEs. Its basic orientation should be to help SMEs become competitive by skills training, technology development or other means of upgrading their productivity. After all, the SME of today could well be the local MNC of tomorrow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the transfer of SME development functions to the proposed Board would result in greater effectiveness in SME development, not less. While the Board would, of course, not devote all its resources exclusively to SME development as it has other responsibilities, I also hope that, since SME development is only one of the 10 functions of the Board, it would not devote only one-tenth of its resources to SME development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point concerns the approach to TFP and the use of TFP growth targets. The concept of TFP is a good one, that is, output growth comes not just from the bootstraps approach of the growth of inputs alone, but by increases in the productivity of all factors. As a productivity concept, it is superior to that of labour productivity which emphasises the productivity of one input alone - labour. While I support the promotion of TFP as a concept, I would caution against the use of short-term TFP growth targets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note in the most recent NPB's Annual Report that with the revised GDP growth \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> estimate of 7%, up to the year 2000, labour productivity growth is expected to be at least 4% annually. NPB's objective is that a 2% average growth in TFP is needed to sustain the 4% labour productivity growth. The use of such TFP growth targets causes some concern. First, TFP growth is a black box. Nobody knows for sure why TFP growth is high or why it is low, although one can generally say that innovation and technological developments, as well as economic restructuring, from low to high-value added sectors, such as from agriculture to manufacturing, are positive contributors to TFP growth. Exactly what the relationship is. For example, that an X% increase in R&amp;D spending would lead to a Y% increase in TFP, nobody can quite say. While policy too, such as technology development and in-employment training, would have positive effects on TFP growth, we do not know what the time lag is, if any, and what the exact relationships are. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in growth accounting methodology, TFP growth is often computed as a residual, that is, output growth minus the sum of input growth. As such, TFP growth is often sensitive to the business cycle. More specifically, TFP growth figures are often pro-cyclical, rising on the upturn of the business cycle and falling on the downturn when companies tend to engage in labour hoarding in expectation of an upturn in their business activities. This is also the same with labour productivity growth figures. What this means is that in a good year, TFP growth is high, the Board at MTI can breathe a sigh of relief. In a bad year, TFP growth is low, alarm bells ring and there is a rush to find out what the causes for this are. In actual fact, this would be what one would expect because of the business cycle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, TFP growth measurement is fraught with difficulties and inaccuracies. To name but one, Singapore does not have a capital stock benchmark because we do not have a wealth survey. I doubt if we will ever have one. I shall not elaborate on the other difficulties here. But having computed these numbers for both the manufacturing industry and the Singapore economy, I fully realise what heroic assumptions have to be made to compute \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> TFP growth in Singapore. While I support the move to measure TFP on an annual basis, I suggest that TFP growth figures should not be used as an annual target but as a medium term one, say, average over five years or so. It should be used as a record of productivity performance in the medium or long term, not in the short term, or from year to year. For example, it is useful to know that Singapore's TFP growth performance in the 1960s, 1970s and the first half of the 1980s was poor but has been better since then. Unlike GDP growth figures, it is less useful for me to know what the TFP growth was in 1994 or what the forecasted TFP growth will be in 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point concerns the continued need for good institutional relationships. For example, the Board, as a first-stop centre for SME schemes, would administer some schemes itself but it would also refer SMEs to other agencies, such as the promising local enterprises scheme of the EDB. It is therefore important for the Board to maintain good working relationships with other agencies, particularly those whose sanctions overlap as in the area of SMEs and technology. This is to ensure that companies do not get caught up in any inter-agency rivalries that could occur in the future. In addition, the Board's mindset should be one where companies are regarded like clients to be treated with respect and to be helped. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, I have made three comments regarding the function of the proposed SPSB, ie, SME development, TFP growth and the need for good institutional relationships. I support the Board's establishment and the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the GPC Chairman, Dr Ow Chin Hock, and NMP Dr Lee Tsao Yuan who spoke in support of the Bill. Both Members have asked a number of questions and I will try to respond to the questions raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow asked what is the compelling reason for the merging of NPB and SISIR \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> now and in what way will the merger contribute to a faster TFP growth. Sir, I have already explained in my speech the rationale for the creation of a new agency, SPSB. There is a need to make strategic reorganisation of our productivity and quality improvement efforts to meet global competition. We have to improve our TFP growth and we are attempting to achieve this by integrating the functions of NPB, SISIR and SME development function of EDB. In this way, we can take a holistic approach in promoting TFP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example of how the synergy between SISIR and NPB could be developed by having a single institution. A primary role of SISIR is to promote the application of technology in industry, and the NPB's role is to provide and promote workers' training. The new Board, SPSB, will coordinate the two functions to ensure that the level of technology promoted to industry could be supported by the skills level of the workforce. So this is just one example. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also asked whether the functions of SISIR should be merged with NSTB instead of NPB. My answer is that merging SISIR and NSTB will not address the primary need of creating a single institution or agency to promote TFP. It is only by merging SISIR and NPB that we can bring the key components of TFP which are manpower development, economic restructuring and technical progress under the purview of a single institution. But I can assure the Member that SPSB will maintain close links with NSTB and other technology providers to secure access of the appropriate technology to the industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow expressed concern that SPSB may not be able to pay sufficient attention to the development of SMEs and asked if a separate agency responsible for local enterprises could be set up. Sir, I can assure the Member that upgrading the local enterprises will be a key function of SPSB and it is for this reason that we are setting up a Local Enterprise Upgrading Centre within SPSB. It will serve as the first-stop centre for SMEs. The Centre will tap on the resources of not only SPSB itself but also those of the other competent agencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Ow asked why the Task Force Report was not given to members of the GPC earlier. Sir, the Task Force Report was released to the public during the press conference and the public can actually ask for a copy of the Report from the Ministry. This Report was subsequently given to Members of the GPC. But I think the point made by Dr Ow is why was the Report not given to members of the GPC at the time of the press conference. This point is noted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the questions raised by Dr Lee Tsao Yuan. Dr Lee has also expressed concern whether SMEs would be given sufficient attention in the new organisation in view of the multiplicity of functions of the Board. I have already given the assurance that the development of SMEs will be one of the key functions of SPSB and the needs of SME will not be neglected. The Board will not devote only one-tenth of its resources to SME development, as Dr Lee feels that that could be the case. I must explain that although only one of the 10 functions listed in the Bill is expressly to develop SMEs, other functions listed in the Bill, like manpower development and technology application, will also benefit SMEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also spoke of the need for SPSB to maintain good working relationships with other agencies. I fully agree with her. Without close coordination and cooperation with other agencies which have the required expertise, SPSB will not be able to perform its functions effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also touched on the subject of TFP and suggested that TFP growth figures should not be used as an annual target but as a medium term one. I would like to clarify that the TFP growth target of 2% mentioned in my speech is meant to be a longer term target and not an annual one. We recognise that the measurements of TFP growth are sensitive to the business cycle, as rightly pointed out by the Member. SPSB's focus on TFP, including the publication of the estimates, will bring attention to the factors that determine TFP and set our efforts in the right direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions raised by Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Goh Chee Wee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 23, to leave out \"12\" and insert \"16\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SPSB Bill originally provides for the Board to have between 6 and 12 members, excluding the Chairman and the Chief Executive. This is the same number as that allowed in the National Productivity Board Act. In view of the wide-ranging functions of SPSB, it is proposed that the size of the Board be expanded to have a maximum of 16 Board members, excluding the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Increasing the size of SPSB Board will allow it to have adequate representation from the various bodies who have an interest in and who can contribute to the work of SPSB. This would include the Government, unions, professionals, training institutions, local enterprises and foreign multi-national companies. Maintaining a good network and receiving multi-angle inputs from members of different background will benefit the work of SPSB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 44 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First to Third Schedules ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Health (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly advancing medical technology presents human societies with new moral challenges. Today, modern medical technology is able to sustain essential physiological functions and technically prolong life in the final stages of terminal illness. Sometimes, it does no more than prolong the process of dying. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of treatment alternatives to doctors and patients will widen in the future. But we must all still die. Whatever new technology may bring forth, we will still have to make difficult choices either on our own behalf or on behalf of others in the last days of life. Medical technology is after all only our servant, and not our master. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the patient is of sound mind, when he is compos mentis, he decides for himself. He may consult, he may be advised, but the decision is his. Under common law, he is autonomous. The problem arises when the patient is no longer able to decide for himself. Today, when this happens, the doctor will consult with the family who will be asked to make a decision on behalf of the patient. When the decision involves withholding or withdrawing extraordinary life-sustaining treatment, it places a heavy burden on family members. The experience varies. Some families will decide firmly one way or another. Many families become divided. Sometimes to avoid making such a decision, the family may leave the decision to the doctor who then decides according to his professional judgment and personal conscience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate some of the dilemmas with the example of a person dying from terminal cancer with no reasonable hope of recovery. Because the patient's body is weak, his heart may stop beating. Should the doctor try to resuscitate? And if so, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> how often? Or if the dying cancer patient is suffering from pneumonia which in fact is the way death naturally takes its course, should the doctor prescribe expensive antibiotics which may clear the immediate infection but leave the underlying condition unchanged? Of if the patient is in severe pain, should morphine be given when that morphine may itself reduce the body's will to live? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are difficult decisions to make. They are not only medical decisions, they are also moral decisions. Doctors may not be prepared to make such decisions on behalf of families, especially when they are liable to be sued. As Singaporeans become more educated and aware of the medical alternatives available, civil suits will become more common and doctors may become more inclined to do the safe thing from a legal point of view, than to do the right thing from a professional or a moral standpoint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the patient, while he is compos mentis, has clearly made known his wishes in full knowledge of the alternatives, the decision becomes much easier on both family members and doctors. And this is the purpose of the Advance Medical Directive (AMD) - to allow the patient to make his wishes known in advance clearly and unambiguously. The AMD will remove any doubt as to the patient's own preferences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AMD is based on the principle of patient autonomy. Under common law, every patient has the right to decide whether to accept or reject the treatment that is offered to him by a doctor, and this is also the position of all the major religions. The AMD allows him to make and register that decision in advance so that his wish can guide his treatment when he is unconscious or no longer of sound mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the AMD touches on life and death, we must take into account the views of all segments of our multi-cultural and multi-religious society. It is for this reason that the National Medical Ethics Committee (NMEC) conducted wide-ranging consultations with all the major religious groups in Singapore before submitting its report. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> After consultations with 24 religious and professional organisations, the NMEC has published a report recommending the legislation of AMDs. The Ministry of Health has accepted the report and taken all their recommendations into consideration when drafting the Advance Medical Directive Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the main features of the Bill. The Bill allows a person of sound mind who has attained the age of 21 years and who desires not to be subjected to extraordinary life-sustaining treatment when he is suffering from a terminal illness to make an AMD on a prescribed form. The making of an AMD is entirely voluntary. Any person who by deception, fraud or undue influence causes a person to make an AMD will be guilty of an offence under the Act. The penalty for such an offence is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The making of an AMD must be witnessed by two persons of at least 21 years old, one of whom must be a doctor, preferably the patient's family or regular doctor. To prevent coercion and conflict of interests, witnesses must not be persons who stand to benefit from the death of the patient. While this will exclude immediate family members as witnesses, we will encourage every person making an AMD to discuss his decision with his family so that they are aware of his wishes. The doctor who is a witness will be required to explain to the patient on the medical implications of making an AMD, and preferably in the presence of family members. The making of an AMD should not be kept a secret from immediate family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AMD only applies to the specific clinical condition of \"terminal illness\" as defined in the Bill. \"Terminal illness\" is defined as a condition that is incurable, with no reasonable prospect of recovery and where death is imminent, whether or not extraordinary life-sustaining treatment is provided, and where such treatment will only postpone the moment of death. Certification of \"terminal illness\" is strictly controlled by a process requiring unanimous agreement by three doctors, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> two of whom must be specialists. If there is no unanimity, a committee of three specialists drawn from an independent panel of specialists established by the Ministry of Health for this purpose will be consulted. Unless the decision of this committee is unanimous, the patient will not be certified to be terminally ill and the AMD will not take effect. This comprehensive procedure will ensure that an AMD will only take effect after due professional consideration has been given to the clinical condition, the diagnosis and the prognosis. Where there is any doubt, this procedure will ensure that we err on the side of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for a central register of AMDs to be established and maintained by the Ministry. All AMDs must be registered in the register which shall be kept confidential. Access to the register will be strictly controlled. This is to ensure that the existence of an AMD is never allowed to influence medical treatment decisions before the patient is certified to be terminally ill. Under the Bill, it will be an offence for any person to require or prohibit the making of an AMD as a condition for receiving medical services or for being insured. It will also be an offence for a doctor or hospital to ask a patient about the existence of an AMD or about his intention to make an AMD. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have made AMDs must of course be allowed to change their minds. The Bill therefore provides for easy revocation made orally, in writing or in any other way. The revocation can be made at any time so long as it is witnessed by two persons. In other words, we deliberately make it easier for an AMD to be revoked than for it to be made. This is better than the alternative of making the directive valid for only a fixed period of time and requiring it to be renewed periodically. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the NMEC's dialogue with professional medical bodies, the need for a conscientious objector clause was raised. The Bill provides for doctors and those who work for them to register their conscientious objections to the AMD. Doctors who are conscientious objectors \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are excluded from participating as witnesses to the making of AMDs and from the certification of terminal illnesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address three specific concerns that have been raised. The first concern has been that legislation for AMDs is the first step down the \"slippery slope of euthanasia\". Let me state clearly and categorically that the Ministry of Health, the NMEC and the medical profession in general are all opposed to euthanasia. And this position is fully reflected in the Bill. Clause 17(1) of the Bill states that nothing in the Act \"shall authorise an act that causes or accelerates death as distinct from an act that permits the dying process to take its natural course\". To remove any doubt whatsoever, clause 17(2) of the Bill declares that \"nothing in this Act shall condone, authorise or approve abetment of suicide, mercy killing or euthanasia\". Abetment of suicide, mercy killing and euthanasia will thus remain as criminal offences punishable under our Penal Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill also ensure that the AMD cannot be used indirectly to allow an act of mercy killing or euthanasia. The definitions of \"terminal illness\" and \"extraordinary life-sustaining treatment\" are specific and do not allow any flexibility of interpretation to include mercy killing. The Bill also ensures that even when an AMD has taken effect, palliative care including the provision of food and water must still continue. In fact, we have deliberately discarded the term \"Living Will\" because of its association with the euthanasia movement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who argue that the very act of legislating AMDs makes legal euthanasia more likely in the future. I do not agree. Legislation is the prerogative of Parliament. We cannot predetermine what the Parliament of tomorrow will legislate. In our democratic system, we have the right and the responsibility to elect those who will protect our best interests. Reflecting the majority view of Singaporeans today, the Advance Medical Directive Bill is unambiguous about our opposition to euthanasia. By itself, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Bill does not make legal euthanasia more or less likely in the future. Indeed, it could well be argued that once AMD legislation is in place, legal euthanasia will become less likely because a major area of ambiguity has been removed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is that we are introducing AMDs to reduce healthcare costs. The two are not directly related. Whether or not we have AMDs, the decision whether or not to make use of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment must still be made either by the patient himself, his family members or by doctors. No individual, no family, no society can escape having to weigh the competing claims of young and old, or the healthy versus the sick, and of the living versus the dying. We do not want healthcare costs to become a crushing burden on our society regardless of how that burden is apportioned among the State, employers, families and individuals. We do this by striking a good balance between market pricing and subsidies, and by controlling the introduction of medical technologies that are not proven to be cost-effective. AMDs are an entirely separate matter. No one can be forced to make an AMD. If an individual chooses to make an AMD, it is his own decision. AMDs may well have the effect of lowering healthcare costs to the individual and his family, and even the State too if the patient is subsidised, but that is not the purpose of introducing it. AMDs will, however, reduce the need and the cost of medical litigation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third concern that has been expressed is that while the principle of the AMD is acceptable, there is no need for legislation at this point in time. In fact, the legal position concerning the withholding or withdrawing of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment is not clear in Singapore today. In the absence of legislation, we make the assumption that the broad principles of common law will apply, including English common law. In an area that is culturally sensitive, this uncertainty is not desirable. Having Parliament legislate will remove any ambiguity as to the scope and legal effect of AMDs. More importantly, legislation ensures that what is acceptable to us is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consistent with our own social consensus and beliefs and not dependent on decisions made in other jurisdictions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the UK, the thinking on the need for legislation has changed. The British Medical Association which earlier opposed separate legislation for advance medical directives has since recommended in January 1994 that it favours the concept of limited legislation. More recently, the Law Commission of the United Kingdom in its publication Mental Incapacity released in March 1995 endorsed the principle of \"advance statements about health\" which are in fact advance medical directives and recommends supporting legislation to remove any ambiguity in the law. In Singapore, the need for legislation has been supported by both the Academy of Law and the Law Society. Legislation for AMDs is not new and already exists in one form or another in Australia, Canada and the USA. We have studied carefully the legislation in these jurisdictions and have used their experiences to guide us in the drafting of our Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have also argued that there is no need for legislation today because the clinical situations for which AMDs apply are not many. That is not an argument against legislation because the need already exists. It is a facility which should be made available to those who wish to take on the moral burden of making their own decisions. We must also prepare for the future. With the speed at which medical technology is advancing, there will be more ways for the dying process to be prolonged by extraordinary life-sustaining means. Our population is also ageing rapidly. The incidence of cancers, strokes and other chronic degenerative diseases will rise. We can therefore expect more Singaporeans wanting to make AMDs in the next 20 to 30 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree that we should not rush to legislate. Indeed, the NMEC was meticulous in its study and consultations, and took over a year to submit its report. Even so, I propose to refer this Bill to a Select Committee to ensure that all views are taken into account in the final legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to commend the Minister and his Health Ministry officials for their painstaking and unhurried approach in introducing the Advance Medical Directive legislation to Singapore. The Minister has just confirmed that this Bill will be sent to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of work on the Advance Medical Directive has been done by the National Medical Ethics Committee. The Committee has put up an excellent report reflecting the views and incorporating the suggestions of various professional bodies and religious organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advance Medical Directive Bill before Parliament contains provisions that no right thinking Singaporean can reject outright. This is because no Singaporean is compelled to sign the AMD if he does not wish to do so. It is voluntary and not compulsory. It is an enabling Act, when passed, made available to anyone who wishes to take advantage of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the Minister has alluded to earlier, questions are still being asked as to whether we are too hasty in wanting to pass the law on Advance Medical Directive in Singapore. It has been said that there is no conclusive evidence to show that AMD provides real value and benefits to society. We should instead find improved ways to deal with the problems associated with the care and treatment of terminally ill patients without having to resort to passing the Advance Medical Directive law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some feel that the present arrangement where the doctor, patient and family members make the decision collectively is better and more helpful in dealing with terminally ill patients. Our doctors are competent and altruistic enough to help decide for the good of the patients and their families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main argument for wanting to have legislation on Advance Medical Directive is to remove the uncertainty and to clarify what are permissible and what \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are not permissible in achieving the high standards of medical practice and to incorporate safeguards against abuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this may introduce rigidity and take away the flexibility and discretion available to doctors in dealing with matters relating to their specialty. As much as the Minister has argued that in fact it has allowed the doctors to handle the situation better, I wish to suggest that there is also the other side because of the very wide spectrum of age group and the diseases and injuries involved. So there is that much you can legislate. There may be other conditions that discretion and flexibility may still be permitted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principle of personal autonomy is the basis for advance medical directive. I am afraid that the over-emphasis on this aspect of personal autonomy is something that I am uncomfortable about. It is questioned whether personal autonomy is really a good thing for someone deciding in advance an unknown future medical condition. In the future, there may be the advancement in technology and discovery of new drugs to treat the medical condition which today is deemed to be terminal. I think experience shows that some of the conditions are curable today but 10 to 20 years ago it was not possible. But I am very happy that the Minister has clarified just now that though the personal autonomy allows a person to sign the AMD, he should openly discuss and consult with the family members. This is because on reading the Bill, I have the impression that the person can actually hide the AMD from the next-of-kins and he is not obliged to discuss it with his family members. I think the remark made by the Minister that a person should not keep it a secret from his family members is a very important point, because on reading the Bill, it actually allows a person to keep mum and not tell anyone. It is the family members who are likely to be affected most when one of its members is afflicted with a critical medical condition and he needs urgent medical attention and treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important because in Singapore we stress the family to be the building \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> block of our society and nation, and we should not allow the principle of self-determination to be over-exerted. If that is the case, we run the risk of members of the family pulling themselves apart. This would not be healthy because it would upset family cohesion and kinship ties and it may lead to a less united and less strong country. This is something that I hope we will want to emphasise. As much as possible, we should encourage family consultation. Though we are allowed personal autonomy to sign the AMD, family consultation should be encouraged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing good that comes out from the AMD legislation would be that it has already created sufficient awareness and our people will be prepared for the eventuality if they have to decide when confronted with a terminally ill condition. It will also help those who may not have made up their minds earlier to decide at the critical stage whether to proceed with extraordinary life-sustaining treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal illness not only strikes with a bout of sickness but comes suddenly when met with an unexpected nasty accident. It is tricky for doctors who have to deal with accidents and emergencies. Quick decisions have to be made by the doctors who sometimes have no time or opportunity to consult the family members but to attend to the emergency out of necessity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the patient who has signed the advance medical directive without informing the parents or spouse, one can imagine the shock of the aggrieved parents or spouse who might want to override the AMD already signed. There must be avenues and mechanism available to deal with conflicts of this nature. We know clearly that the law does not allow overriding, but when confronted with a situation of an emergency, it is going to be very difficult for the doctors to handle. I think some mechanism and avenues must be found to anticipate this difficulty in the hospital setting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Minister has explained that revalidation of the AMD is not as good as the provision for revocation, my concern \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is that we have allowed young adults above the age of 21 years to sign the advance medical directive and they go through different phases of life. They may not remember whether they have signed one or not. I think this question of validity ought to be considered again at the Select Committee and whether a revocation is still a preferred method to revalidation. I am more concerned about the younger adults than anybody else. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill defines quite clearly the nature of terminal illness. But it does not provide the time frame to specify how imminent is imminent. Is it a month, a few days, when? I know it is not easy, but it is difficult for an ordinary person to understand that you are terminally ill but you do not know how long the patient would last and what constitutes terminal illness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other difficulty that I have is that though we have taken the trouble to define terminal illness, we should also try to define what is meant by \"mental incompetence\". We presume that it is easy to define mental incompetence, but it is important because here the assessment of mental incompetence really triggers the operation of the advance medical directive. So I would suggest that this assessment of mental incompetence be considered carefully because it is only when the two conditions of terminal illness and mental incompetence must come together before the AMD can come into effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is really the larger question on the long term effect of AMD on our society and whether this will inevitably evolve a new mindset on our people. For example, what would be our attitude towards the elderly in our society, and even what our own elderly will think about themselves? That growing old is being useless and it is better to die than be a burden to the children and grandchildren. If our people lack the will to live on and endure pain and suffering, will it lead us to become a soft people? We know that for us to excel, we often need to overcome the pain threshold to test our limits. I know that we would not allow that to happen, but we must make sure that it will not be allowed to happen. Because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> without pain and suffering, how are we to know and appreciate the joys and pleasures of the good and healthy lives that we are having? I mean you need the contrast. Without the contrast, it is always difficult to compare. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other question is, once the Bill is passed, how would the Government measure the success of implementing such a law. Does the Government measure its success by having the majority of adult Singaporeans signing the AMD? Do our civil servants embark on an intensive campaign to bring in the numbers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form and manner of public education programmes should be handled sensitively with the view to prepare our people and facilitating the process in decision-making. We only need to help Singaporeans make up their minds to decide with confidence and be comfortable in the decision that will be best for themselves and their families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to support the Bill and for it to be committed to a Select Committee. I support the principle and spirit behind the AMD, but I hope that we would recognise the possible pitfalls and find ways to overcome the negative effects, if any, of AMD. \n  <br>2.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. However, Sir, the concerns of the medical practitioners and other Singaporeans must be well addressed in the AMD. To do this, I would like to draw yourself, Mr Speaker, Sir, and Members of this House into the actual working of a hospital set-up and how this Bill will apply to those who have to execute the directive and the safeguards in the Bill to prevent abuse. I would illustrate through three case scenarios. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case scenario: a man with terminal cancer enters the hospital; he is conscious, extremely weak; he needs a Ryle's tube for feeding, a drip for intravenous feeding and medication. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> doctor assesses his condition and concludes that he is terminally ill. This man has a registered directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scenario: a young man of 38 years old is brought in unconscious. His family informs the doctor he has hypertension or high blood pressure. He is put into intensive care unit with all the life-support systems in place. His consciousness lapses further and the doctor thinks he has no chance of surviving. The patient takes a turn for the worse. His brain tracing is flat but continues breathing through a ventilator. His heart stops but is revived by a heart machine. He is fed by a tube, the Ryle's tube. His relative wants the tubes to be removed, but he has no registered directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third scenario: an accident victim, a young man of 20 years old, rushed into the hospital following a road traffic accident. He has sustained serious head injuries and stays in the intensive care unit. His condition deteriorates and he becomes brain dead. The doctor continues to keep him alive, in spite of his brain tracing being flat. His parents want to donate his organs for transplant. He is a minor and he cannot sign a directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, Mr Speaker, the three cases illustrate three different scenarios for the executors of the advance medical directive. The Bill has laid down a set of procedures for them, especially the doctors on the case, to follow. And a doctor, for example, cannot ask if the patient has a directive. It is stated clearly in the Bill. He must provide good medical care to all, including life-support systems, if necessary. However, if the condition of the patient deteriorates to an extent he cannot survive with all the life-support systems, he must carefully assess if that patient is terminally ill before invoking the AMD. And to do this, again he follows a set of procedures spelt out in the Bill, and this is important, to assure all those who have signed up. The doctor in charge, for example, checks with the Registrar of the Advance Medical Directive Board as to whether the patient has registered under the AMD. And if informed that he has, he \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> discusses with two other specialists to confirm his findings. And if they agree, he then gets a written confirmation from the Registrar of AMD and then proceeds to execute the registered directive. He need not provide the patient with extraordinary health support systems, like the ventilator or the heart machine. However, in case of doubt, he and the two colleagues of his have to seek a third opinion of an independent panel of three specialists who must unanimously agree that the patient is terminally ill with no prospects of recovering. The safeguards are more than adequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me come back to the three scenarios I painted. I want to try to apply the AMD Bill, as it stands, on the three cases in more detail. Case one, the terminally ill cancer patient with a AMD. This scenario is straightforward and where procedures are adhered to, there should be no problem. Case two, the young hypertensive with a stroke, who is brought into the hospital in a coma, but his condition later deteriorates and he is brain dead. He has no registered directive. The relatives request to pull the plug, but the doctor will not, because he cannot do so. No new directive can be entertained, and this is stated very clearly in clause 5 of the Bill. In the present situation, as mentioned by the Minister earlier, in the absence of this AMD Bill, relatives, upon the advice of the doctors, can request for the plug to be pulled and the doctors can oblige. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when a person is brain dead, he can be kept alive for weeks, months, or even for years. I recall the case of Karen Quinlan who was kept alive for years. Eventually her father sought a court order to have the life-support systems removed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is sad to cite money as one of the reasons for having to pull the plug on those who are brain dead. But I do not want to pretend that this will not be the reason for some cases. Having said that, the irony here is that we are actually forced to artificially prolong the dying process in the second and the third case scenarios, contrary to the aims of this Bill. The rigidity of the rule in clause 5 which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> forbids anyone to act without a registered directive must be tempered by giving parents or next-of-kin some say. I will come to clause 5 again when I discuss in more detail the third scenario. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case three, as I mentioned earlier, is of a young man, 20 years old, who develops terminal illness as a result of his head injuries. He has no directive and, in fact, he cannot sign a directive - he is a minor. The problem arises when his parents want to will his organs for transplant. I could have gone along with this Bill without much reservation, had I not read of the death of Wah Liang, the comedian who died tragically in a road traffic accident. His parents gave consent to allow his organs for transplant. It suddenly dawned on me that had Wah Liang not given a registered directive, his life-support systems could not be switched off. Under the AMD Bill, his parents could not be in a position to permit the donation of his organs to save several other human lives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer you again to this clause of the Bill which states in no uncertain terms that no one can act on an unregistered directive. This very clause has made the Bill very restrictive. It excludes those below 21 years old and those who are of unsound mind. Sir, you must keep in mind that AMD is an opt-in legislation. You must ensure that should you desire to be caught by the AMD Bill, that means, you want to be in this Bill, you have to take steps to register your directive with the Registrar before any doctor or doctors would act on your directive. And this is where I cannot reconcile the AMD with the Human Organ Transplant Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. The Human Organ Transplant Act is an opt-out legislation. In other words, no active steps need to be taken to be caught by the Act. Unless otherwise indicated by default, one is caught by the Act. Its coverage is therefore very extensive. Many may fall under this Act because they are either unaware of this or they may be indifferent or may even find it too troublesome to take the time to sign the release form. For these and other reasons, many Singaporeans may also not register \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> under the AMD and thus not come under its umbrella, having not opted in. The AMD thus lacks the extensive coverage of the Human Organ Transplant Act, because the AMD excludes a large section of the population, namely, the under-21s, and precludes their parents, guardians, from making any decision on their behalf. And because no directive can be made, no doctor can act. Therein lies the conflict between the AMD and the Human Organ Transplant Act. To me, this is an example of how a good piece of well-written, well-intentioned legislation can be done in by another equally well-written, well-intentioned piece of legislation, that is, the new Advance Medical Directive Act has rendered the Human Organ Transplant Act inoperational for this group of people. This will affect organ donations as most of such organs are obtained from young accident victims. Furthermore, Singapore parents have no choice but to continue to provide the life-support systems to those young terminally injured accident patients who cannot sign up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, may I request the Minister to review this clause carefully to allow parents to have a say in the event of those not having registered under the AMD as they will be responsible for the health bill eventually. If, however, there is difficulty in amending this clause, may I suggest that we amend the Human Organ Transplant Act to make the Human Organ Transplant Act operational for those who have not or cannot sign on the AMD. This way, we tidy the two Acts to operate together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the three cases that I have mentioned show that the Bill has set out clear guidelines and procedures for the doctor and his colleagues to follow when confirming terminal illness. I am satisfied with the assurances given to those who sign up and their relatives that due diligence will be practised when confirming terminal illness. However, the Bill is not so clear in the definition of \"extraordinary life-sustaining treatment\" which the Bill defines, and I quote, \"any medical procedure or measure which, when administered to a terminally ill patient, will only prolong the process of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dying when death is imminent, but excludes palliative care\". What is \"any medical procedure or measure\"? This is the question that many doctors, and even lay people, ask. Does tube feeding at the first case of a cancer patient or intravenous feeding in the second case of a hypertensive patient fall into this definition? I think the medical profession needs further guidelines on this. Having said that, no doctor will stop providing palliative care to the terminally ill in order to alleviate his pain and suffering. Clause 11 of the Bill is very clear on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is also clear that treatment must be given first and that it is an offence to enquire whether a directive has been made. This is again reassuring for Singaporeans who sign up and is again spelt out clearly in clause 15. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all my years of experience in medical practice, the doctor has always been most reluctant to pull the plug. Times, unfortunately, have changed. Doctors are no longer in charge of hospital administration and policy. Hospital culture and hospital philosophy have changed. Medicine has been called an industry. I am thus glad that clause 15 was inserted because there is a temptation for hospitals to prolong those who have no directives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must assure our people that the Advance Medical Directive Bill does not force Singaporeans to sign. It is voluntary. It is not mercy killing. It is not euthanasia. In fact, it is to safeguard against this. It is very clearly spelt out in the Bill. However, it gives the legal framework for doctors and Singaporeans to operate. To make sure the Bill is fully understood and accepted, I am sure the Ministry of Health must have plans to embark on a big public education exercise after the passage of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill which, I think, must be referred to a Select Committee for fine-tuning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate on the Advance Medical Directive Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the Report of the National Medical Ethics Committee which studied the issues pertaining to this Bill, I am happy with the Report and I fully support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Fatwa Committee of the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore had discussed this matter on 25th August 1994 and they had agreed with the following matters, and I quote, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Islam allows anyone with sound mind to make a will or advance medical directive stating that he does not want or refuse to accept any treatment to prolong his life when his illness is incurable and terminal and that there is no hope of him to continue living. This is allowed because a patient who is terminally ill cannot live longer and is prepared to endure the suffering and wants to die peacefully and calmly. This is because he believes that his destiny is in the hands of God and the time has come for him to go and that he will die.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it can be said that all Muslims want to be at the bedside of their loved ones who are dying. They believe that they can teach the dying loved ones to repeat the two Islamic declarations of faith. Therefore, many Malays or Muslims prefer to bring home their terminally ill loved ones who have no hope of living as they prefer that they die at home rather than in hospital. At home, he will be at the bedside with members of his family who will say prayers for him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, this Bill is proactive, that is, it is aimed at underlining the action that can be taken or done by an individual to overcome the critical moment when facing death, and also to make arrangement with his next-of-kin to face with his critical situation. This will erase any misunderstanding which may arise when he is facing the final moment of his life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the advance medical directive is not euthanasia, or mercy killing, or determining one's death on the ground of mercy. Euthanasia is an action carried out deliberately on a person who is terminally ill so as to cause death immediately. Euthanasia is just like committing suicide \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which is prohibited by most religions. I oppose euthanasia because it is against the principles of my religion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advance medical directive actually allows an individual to leave a will to his next-of-kin to let him die peacefully. His next-of-kin does not have to do anything or take any action merely to prolong his life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill because an individual is given the freedom and the right to determine his own destiny while he is in a critical moment of death. The individual is free to make the said advance medical directive at the time of his good health and after having all the information about his own self and his family condition. No other person can force him to make an advance medical directive. In fact, if there is an element of force or fraud, the said advance medical directive can be abrogated and the offender can be charged and sentenced according to the provisions in the Bill. Although the said individual has made his advance medical directive, he is still free to withdraw and cancel the said medical directive at any time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of individual freedom, which is the essence of this Bill, indicates that the Government has no intention to force anyone to be subservient in all the decisions that have been made by the Government. Therefore, in my opinion, this Bill is not contrary to any religious belief even though there are still some feelings of doubt about the real interpretation of the advance medical directive which is almost equivalent to euthanasia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to call upon the Government to ensure that all provisions of the law are made to prevent any mischief or misuse by persons responsible for the implementation of the advance medical directive. In this matter, I support the move to have a certification which should be signed by three medical experts. These experts should confirm that the patient is suffering from a terminal illness and cannot be cured with modern medicine according to the current knowledge of the medical experts. Only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> then, the life supporting machine or equipment can be dismantled. But I would like to call upon the authorities that efforts to give medical care to the patient in an appropriate way should continue until he draws his last breath. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for those who are not yet convinced, I would like to call upon the Government to educate them about the benefits of this Bill. What I mean is that the Ministry of Health should provide more information through the mass media, including video tapes, and if this is still inadequate, then I agree with the proposal by the Minister for Health who has proposed that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee so that more organisations, especially individuals who are familiar with their own religious beliefs, would come forward to give their views because this is a sensitive matter. To me, the more information and inputs we get from them, the better it is for us so that those who have understood the latest development in the medical field will understand and realise the importance of introducing this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Advance Medical Directive Bill is a pragmatic response to a very difficult and sensitive issue. There are a number of advantages to the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not only entirely voluntary but it is also an opt-in system, not an opt-out system. If a person wants to make a directive, then he or she has to make the effort to do so. This is much better than an opt-out system when AMDs are presumed to be in effect unless a person chooses otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the legislation provides the individual with a choice, the choice of not wanting to prolong his or her life when he or she is terminally ill and incapable of making such a decision. The current practice is that this decision is made by the doctor and the family members who may or may not make a decision in line with the patient's wishes. The patient may not have wanted to have his life artificially prolonged, thus causing more physical, emotional and financial stress on his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> family. However, his family members may not be able to make the decision to switch off the life support system and thus the treatment continues. Some people, especially older ones, live in fear of being a burden on their family in precisely such instances. The availability of an AMD would reduce this fear. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are powerful and valid arguments for the enactment of AMD legislation. I can see that there is a point at which life need not be artificially prolonged. Life need not be preserved at all costs and in all circumstances and, in particular, there are advantages of not prolonging a living death by artificial means. However, there are a number of issues which the Bill, in its present form, leaves unresolved. In my view, the nub of the issue is not whether there should or should not be legislation but whether the legislation provides for sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse of the AMD. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the need for more safeguards where three issues are concerned. The first issue is the determination of terminal illness. As far as I understand, no medical practitioner, no matter how expert, can determine for sure with 100% certainty that an illness is incurable and will shortly result in death. There are enough documented cases of what can be called miraculous healing, that not even a panel of experts can definitively say that there is no prospect of recovery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of terminal illness in the Bill, therefore, is that of no reasonable prospect of recovery and that death would, within reasonable medical judgment, be imminent. What is reasonable in this case? What if a wrong prognosis is made? And why is it that the three medical practitioners or the Committee of three specialists are absolved not only from civil and criminal liability but even from discipline for professional misconduct in making this literally life or death decision? And, similarly, for a person who gives effect to the directive in the absence of knowledge of revocation or intended revocation of the directive when such care is taken to maintain the registry. Knowing the pain and suffering which the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> patient and his family members have to go through, do these provisions build in an unconscious bias to broaden the definition of terminal illness? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand the need for protection for medical practitioners, as no one can definitively pronounce illness as terminal, a distinction surely can be made between civil and criminal censure on the one hand and professional review and discipline on the other. Instead of blanket immunity, isn't there room for the professional body to deal with cases of gross misconduct in this case? A related question is: suppose a patient has made an AMD and has been diagnosed as terminally ill, when should the treatment be withdrawn - three months, a week, a day? Is there a time limit? Who makes the decision as to timing? The Bill is silent on this issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue concerns whether the existence of AMD legislation changes doctors' behaviour for patients who have not made AMDs. At present, without legislation, decisions are already being made whether to artificially prolong life or not for terminally ill patients. Doctors and family members exercise considerable flexibility on a discretionary case-by-case basis. Life support systems are being switched off for some terminally ill patients. Would AMD legislation actually limit doctors' choices, in the sense that the decision becomes: for patients with AMDs, withdraw treatment; for patients with no AMDs, therefore, continue treatment? In other words, does the very existence of legislation alter the basis of decision making for patients without AMDs? Similarly, for society as a whole, would AMD legislation change attitudes towards a greater intolerance of terminal illness? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See has raised concerns regarding the long-term effects on society and I share his concerns. Pressures could arise in favour of making AMDs, especially since life-sustaining treatment could be very expensive, not to mention the emotional stress borne by the family. I recall that there was a time when eyebrows were raised when a couple had more than two children because it was not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> socially correct. Similarly, will there come a time when it would not be socially correct not to have an AMD? I believe that this choice is an entirely individual matter to be made after much thought and consideration. Legislation is only the beginning of the process. I would suggest that special attention be given to extensive public education as to what an AMD is and the benefits and cost of making one. This suggestion has already been made previously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third issue is whether the AMD Bill could eventually lead to the legalisation of euthanasia. I must state here that I am against euthanasia. At present, euthanasia is an offence under the law. I must also emphasise that the Bill per se has nothing to do with euthanasia. However, if individual self-determination forms the basis for the AMD, then it is not that difficult to take this principle one step further to allow an individual the right to die. In 10 or 20 years' time, when the proportion of the aged rises in Singapore, pressures might mount for the logical progression from not wanting life-sustaining treatment to wanting to die rather than face suffering and pain. These pressures are already present in some developed countries today. The Minister has just given the assurance that the Ministry is against euthanasia and that the Bill itself does not permit euthanasia. I would be more assured if I knew for sure that the Minister would still be the Minister for Health in 20-30 years' time. As such, my concern is that there are insufficient safeguards to prevent a slide from an AMD into the legalisation of euthanasia, perhaps not now, not this generation, but in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by saying that I support the broad thrust and direction of the Bill. There are instances where life need not be artificially prolonged and the Advance Medical Directive Bill makes that personal choice legal. However, I think that the Bill in its present form allows for too many questions and loopholes to be satisfactory. In particular, there need to be more safeguards built in to prevent abuse and to address the three issues that I have outlined. I would further suggest that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there be a review of the AMD scheme after one year to fine-tune its efficacy in actual practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill provided that it goes to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.30 pm. Sitting accordingly suspended at 3.05 pm until 3.30 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 3.30 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Loh Meng See, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Encik Harun Ghani and Dr Lee Tsao Yuan for their support of the Bill. I would also like to thank them for their very thoughtful comments and for making helpful suggestions on how the Bill could be tightened in the Select Committee to ensure that the safeguards are effective. As the Bill will be committed to a Select Committee, I should not talk about the details but concentrate on the main principles which were raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See made a very good point that for the Bill to allow the individual to be autonomous and to make his own decision, family members should be consulted. Indeed, the position of the Health Ministry is that the making of an AMD should be an occasion and an opportunity for the person to discuss what may happen when he is dying with his doctor and immediate relatives. I do not think we are legislating for AMD in order to promote it and encourage its widespread use. In fact, Mr Loh Meng See was concerned that civil servants might become over-enthusiastic and take it upon themselves to push the AMD. There is no such intention. There is a need and the need is likely to grow. The facility should be provided for those who wish to make use of it, and for those who are prepared to take this burden upon themselves. I think they may save their own families from feelings of guilt and recrimination for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years after they have gone, for it is very rare that whole families agree, especially when the families are big, on what the decision should be at the point of terminal illness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us would have grandparents or parents, people we know well, people whom we love, who died in the intensive care unit and where a decision had to be taken. Some are strong, but not all of us are strong. I think it is for each and everyone of us as individuals to make an assessment of ourselves, our spouses, our children and say, \"Okay, I think in my case, I better make an AMD. It will remove what can be a very heavy burden on them.\" But for some other individuals, they may say, \"Look, I will leave it to my wife to decide because she knows exactly what my wishes are and I trust her entirely and I know she would not flinch from making a decision.\" So it is not a facility which we encourage everyone to resort to and certainly it would not be the objective of the Health Ministry to promote it as something good for everyone. But it is a serious decision made by an individual and we will conduct a programme of education for members of the medical profession, for medical staff in hospitals and for members of the public. This was a proposal which was made by Mr Loh Meng See, Encik Harun Ghani, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Dr Tan Cheng Bock. This is something that we will do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some terms appear loose. Dr Lee Tsao Yuan mentioned that what is \"reasonable\" is unclear. It can never be clear because the decisions made are very judgmental. If it were so simple, we could have reduced it into a computer algorithm and the computer would spit out the answer \"Yes\" or \"No\". If it were so simple, there will be no need to put it to Parliament. It is because such matters require human judgment and human beings sitting in judgment that we say, \"Look, let a panel of three doctors decide in consultation on the basis of knowledge, on the basis of an understanding of the practical problems involved and if they cannot agree, that itself is cause for concern. So refer up to another panel and if they still cannot \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> agree, then no AMD takes effect.\" In other words, six persons are involved. I think that ensures with more than reasonable confidence that the intent of Parliament is scrupulously observed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that doctors may rush to switch off life-sustaining machines. There should be no undue haste because in any case, we have to convene a panel and people must sit down in solemn deliberation to decide. There will be no undue haste. But there should also be no undue delay. What is reasonable, I would say, leave it to the medical profession to decide. They have a lot of experience in such matters and they confront such problems daily. We should not tie their hands by laying down specifically in Parliament what the acceptable time frame should be because it must vary from case to case. But it surely would not be the situation where they are rushing in an ambulance and the doctors decide immediately, \"No, we must switch it off.\" No such case will arise. But, of course, when we sit down in the Select Committee, we should take a closer look and see whether the language can be tightened. But, however tight the language is, we must leave a lot of room for human judgment and for the wisdom of doctors, the wisdom of people solemnly appointed to make decisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See asked whether we should not have a fixed validity period for the directive. I do not think it is necessary. I think it is better to make it easy for it to be revoked. I do not believe anyone who has made a directive will forget he has made a directive, because it is not something which we enter into lightly. To make a directive, you need to fill in a form, you need to consult your doctor, you need two witnesses, you need to register, you need to receive an acknowledgment. It is something so devised that you will remember it for as long as you live that you have made a directive, any more than we forget that we have made a will, however young we might have made it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether there is doubt on what constitutes \"mental incompetence\", I am not too worried because this is something which affects not just the AMD Bill but it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> affects the whole corpus of law. It is something which human society has had to grapple with from the beginning of civilisation. There is an extensive common law governing what constitutes mental incompetence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See and Dr Lee Tsao Yuan raised longer term issues: how the AMD will affect our attitudes towards the family, towards old people and towards our own lives. These are questions which I am not really able to answer because they go beyond the AMD. They are the result of an ageing population, of young people having a different set of values, of medical technologies racing ahead at breakneck speed and often in ways that we ourselves do not fully comprehend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are different from our grandparents' generation and the values that we hold are very different from the values they held. In the same way, the values which our grandchildren hold would be different from us, but it does not mean that they will all be bad. I think they will have their own wisdom, they will have their own sense of what is right and wrong and they will have to respond to a different set of technological and other social circumstances. I do not think that we should jump to the conclusion that making an AMD will automatically steer us in a different direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the way we are doing it acknowledges the importance of the individual and the family. What we do not want is a situation where because we are tied in a legal lock, doctors are forced to treat even when parents and children object, because the doctors would tell the relatives, \"Look, you may not sue me but someone else may sue me. And because I do not want to be sued, I would rather continue treatment.\" In other words, when a tendency to litigate on such matters puts tremendous pressures on doctors to err on the side of safety, to go beyond what they themselves and what immediate relatives know to be sound from a moral and professional standpoint. It is precisely what this Bill is for. It is not as if once you have the Bill, those who do not make the directive are treated differently. It is because we are afraid that with growing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> litigation, doctors would behave in a certain way that we need this Bill to forestall the trend which we worry about. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is the reason why I think there is an argument to be made that this Bill will make the legalisation of euthanasia less likely. We remove an important area of ambiguity. What we do not want is a situation where large members of the public are so angry that an unreasonable situation persists that they push for something even more unreasonable. Of course, Dr Lee suggested that I would not be here in 20 to 30 years' time as the Health Minister. I think she is absolutely right there. We cannot foreclose what Parliament 20-30 years from now will legislate. It may legalise euthanasia. It may revoke the AMD Bill. We do not know. That is for a future electorate, deciding what is in their best interest, voting in a new group of Members of Parliament, and they will in this solemn chamber decide what is the social consensus and what is good for the people of Singapore. But you can be sure that if I am still an MP at that time, I would oppose the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock painted three hypothetical cases, which I thought were very helpful because they focus our minds on the practical realities. It is one thing to talk about it theoretically but, say, in the tragic case of Wah Liang, suddenly the reality was brought home in a very stark and, I think, painful way for many of us. But Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect, I think Dr Tan misunderstood the Bill. It does not mean that if you have not made a directive that doctors are then under an obligation to continue treatment and that parents would have no say thereafter. That is not the position at all. If you have not made the directive, then the present situation continues, which means, ambiguous, doctors talking to parents, talking to spouses, talking to siblings, and saying, \"Look, this is what we think is right. What do you think?\" Then in that grey muddle, a decision is made and is accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the case of Wah Liang. According to the press, he was brain dead. I am not sure if the reporters use the term accurately because being in vegetative \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> coma does not mean you are brain dead. People can be in vegetative coma for years and still wake up one day. Such a case is not classified as terminal illness at all. It does not come within the ambit of the AMD Bill. To be brain dead requires a whole series of tests to be conducted - the checking of the eyes, pouring of cold water into the ear canal - to be very sure that the brain is dead and that if your blood is still circulating and your heart is still beating, it is because of machines keeping your heart beating, keeping your lungs pumping. If Wah Liang was indeed brain dead, as medically defined, and he had not opted out of the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) - under HOTA, brain death is death - we would have been able to harvest his organs. If he had opted out of HOTA, then his parents' consent would have been required, and in this particular case, his parents did give consent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan is also worried about the donation of organs of young people below the age of 21 years old. In fact, for all cases, whether under HOTA or under the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA), parental consent is required for all below the age of 21, and the making of AMD does not change that position. Whether or not you have made an AMD, if you are dead, and the parents are prepared for your organs to be harvested, they can be harvested. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight ambiguity right now because brain death is only defined legally as \"death\" under HOTA but not for other laws. And this is something that the Health Ministry is looking at. We are not rushing. We will take a few years to think about it. And if we think it is necessary to clarify the position, not just for AMD or HOTA but for all our laws, we may then come back to Parliament to say, \"Look. Let's formalise the definition of \"death\" to include brain death.\" And indeed, a number of countries have already done so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also mentioned the case of the young man who is kept alive under feed and he asked whether, under the AMD, we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will continue to feed the patient, whether by the Ryle's tube or intravenously. In the Bill, it is made quite clear that palliative care includes the provision of food and water, however administered. But let us look at the language again in the Select Committee to make sure that there is no doubt as to what is our intent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun Ghani explained the Muslim position. I thank him particularly for the support of this Bill and for clarifying the stand of the Fatwa Committee of MUIS on the AMD Bill. It is very good that MUIS has confirmed unequivocally that the Advance Medical Directive Bill does not in any way contradict the teachings of Islam, and this should remove any concern that Muslims in Singapore may have. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan expressed three concerns. She asked how can we be 100% sure that the patient is terminally ill. My answer is we cannot be absolutely sure. Miracles are always possible. All we can do as mortals is to do what is reasonable. And if divine providence wills a miracle, a miracle will occur regardless of what we do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee was also concerned that we give too blanket wide and too unconditional a protection of medical practitioners from civil and criminal liability. In fact, this is not so. If you read clause 19(1), it makes clear that a doctor is only so absolved if the doctor has acted in good faith and without negligence. In other words, there is due diligence, he sits down, he applies his knowledge, his wisdom, and he comes to a decision. And if he does so, then he is protected. But if he was negligent, or he had acted in bad faith, or was guilty of gross misconduct, and this could be proven, then, of course, he can be sued in court for negligence and he will also be subject to disciplinary action for professional misconduct by the professional bodies. And if the circumstances so warrant it, he can be prosecuted in court for a criminal offence such as criminal negligence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also expressed concern that once we have AMDs, then imperceptibly doctors will shift position, ie, if they check \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that you have got no AMD, then they will continue treatment. We will make it clear in our education programme that this is not going to be the position, that the present situation will apply - that parents, siblings, children will be consulted and a decision made in consultation with them. But as I said earlier, my fear is, despite these consultations, because of the fear of medical litigation, doctors may act differently. And, indeed, a few months ago I spoke to a doctor from a private hospital, he treats rich patients, and he told me very frankly, \"Look. As it stands now, I will always treat. They can pay. And I do not want to run into any legal trouble. So when in doubt, treat.\" And it was clear to me from the way he expressed his support of the Bill that there were cases where he treated when his professional training told him inside that he should stop treatment. This is not the position that we want and this is precisely the position that the AMD Bill is intended to correct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have covered the broad issues that have been raised by Members of the House. Let me thank Members again for their thoughtful comments and very helpful suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, may I just seek a clarification. I am still not clear about the interpretation of this particular clause. I do not read it that way. If I am a doctor and I find this patient is terminally ill, I will adhere to all the procedures. I will check with the Registrar and let us say he has not registered his directive. By law, as I read it here, it is quite clear that I cannot proceed with what is required in this Bill. If you say that a minor, for example, cannot make a directive because he is a minor, we can still go back to our present status of removing the tubes should the parents agree. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is precisely the legal position. That is our intent and that is the legal position, and that is what is expressed in the Bill. If the AMD does not apply, then what applies is the present ambiguous situation. Of course, it is not ambiguous for things like organ transplant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.51 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans today enjoy a very high standard of public health. The incidence of communicable diseases is low and under control, despite the fact that Singapore is situated in a region where many tropical diseases are endemic. Refuse is collected daily; food is safe; and our streets are swept regularly. We have come a long way from the days when our streets were polluted with rubbish, our waterways exuded the odour of decomposed wastes and our air was polluted and dusty. Much hard work has gone into making our city clean and green: careful planning, many years of public education and cooperation from civic-minded members of the public, and strict enforcement of environmental legislation have all helped to achieve the present high quality of our environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep up with the rising public demand for a better environment and the need to address emerging concerns, my Ministry has from time to time amended the Environmental Public Health Act which was first enacted in 1969. The Act was last amended in 1992. We are now, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> once again, proposing that the Environmental Public Health Act be amended to prepare us for the challenges of the next century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key issue we need to address is solid waste or refuse management. We have two factors working against us - a tight labour situation and a scarcity of land. Both of these make it costly for us to deal with increasing quantities of solid waste. And the quantity of solid waste that is being generated as Singapore becomes more affluent is growing. The quantity of refuse that has to be collected and disposed of has increased from 2,138 tonnes per day in 1975 to 4,105 tonnes per day in 1985 and 7,268 tonnes per day in 1995, almost doubling every 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective system for refuse collection and disposal is critical to the standard of public health and the quality of the environment in any country. A poorly managed system will result in a rapid deterioration of public health standards, giving rise to all sorts of health hazards. This is especially so in countries located in the tropics where the heat and humidity accelerates the decomposition of wastes; and particularly so in countries that are highly urbanised and densely populated, as in the case of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of maintaining an efficient system of solid waste management in Singapore will be very difficult in the future unless we make changes now to deal with the problems ahead. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Corporatising Solid Waste Collection and Introducing Competition</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refuse collection service provided by my Ministry to domestic and trade premises today will be faced with a manpower shortage problem in the near future. About 45% of our workmen are over the age of 50. We are also facing difficulties recruiting new workers to work as refuse collectors. We need to make changes now to solve this problem. We need to restructure the work content, improve productivity and implement more responsive and market oriented \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> schemes for remuneration and service conditions which will reward higher productivity. But flexible shifts and remuneration structures cannot be implemented in the current system without civil service-wide implications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry is always searching for new ways to manage solid waste more efficiently and thereby keep costs down, in the longer term, the better way to encourage greater efficiency at the system level is to introduce competition into the area of refuse management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve the objectives of higher efficiency and keeping costs down, my Ministry will be taking a number of steps. We will corporatise the Ministry's refuse collection unit on 1st April 1996 so that it can operate as a company and function with greater flexibility. In three years, by the year 1999, we will allow private waste collectors to come into the market to compete for the collection of refuse from domestic and trade premises. The Act will be amended to allow for this change in system and to include provisions to ensure that the collection of refuse from domestic and trade premises will be done in an orderly and organised manner. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Dangerous Waste and Illegal Dumping</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law will also be amended to make those who generate or are in possession of wastes that are dangerous fully responsible for the proper disposal of such wastes. Those who behave irresponsibly or those who dispose of such wastes illegally will be dealt with severely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Act already regulates the disposal of toxic wastes. The Bill seeks to regulate the disposal of a new group of dangerous substances, such as petroleum products and explosives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generators of these dangerous substances will be required to treat these wastes before sending them for disposal. If they contract out the collection and treatment of these wastes, they are responsible to ensure that the contractors are fully aware of the nature of the wastes. The contractors who receive these wastes for treatment will also be responsible to ensure that these wastes are properly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> treated and disposed of. The appropriate Regulations and Code of Practice will be drafted to spell out the details. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also provide for stiffer penalties for those convicted of illegal dumping. The number of cases of illegal dumping detected has increased from 59 in 1993 to 105 in the first nine months of 1995. Of these, we managed to prosecute 34 cases in 1994 and 35 so far in 1995. These unscrupulous people who dump their wastes illegally often do so to avoid paying disposal fees. Their actions are totally irresponsible and they can do very serious harm to our environment and endanger the health of our people. 41.2% of our land area is used as water catchments for drinking water and, if left unchecked, illegal dumping can pollute our very precious water resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy to catch those who dump waste illegally in the act; but when we do, we want to come down hard on them. The existing penalty is clearly not effective enough to deter them. We will, therefore, increase the maximum fine and include a jail sentence which can be imposed on a first-time offender. For a repeat offender, we will introduce a mandatory jail sentence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Private Waste Disposal Facilities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment that will be made to the Environmental Public Health Act will be a provision to allow for the setting up of private waste disposal facilities some time in the future. This will allow the Government to privatise the provision of such facilities in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Littering</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and final major amendment will deal with the problem of littering. To assist my Ministry in the enforcement against littering, we will amend the Act to allow bus drivers, conductors and ticket inspectors to enforce against those who litter in public service buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, even after decades of education, enforcement action is still required to deter and remind the minority of Singaporeans who still litter that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> littering is an anti-social act. My Ministry does not have the manpower to deploy officers everywhere, nor should we be spending so much public funds to employ large numbers of enforcement officers to stamp out littering. We are grateful that the public bus companies are willing to assist us in our endeavours. This is the right spirit. Keeping Singapore clean is everyone's responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my Ministry's commitment to protecting the environment and ensuring that the public continues to enjoy a high standard of public health. The amendments proposed in the Environmental Public Health Bill are necessary to prepare us to meet the future challenges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, privatisation of refuse collection service has its pros and cons. With privatisation, it is hoped that service can be provided more efficiently because of competition. But at the same time, there is also a danger that the private contractor may default and fail to perform the required level of service. This is possible because even a large contractor may find it difficult to hire workers to do this kind of job. It happens in the construction industry and some contractors in that industry resort to hiring of illegal workers. And when Government clamped down on them, they simply defaulted and could not proceed with the job. We should not let this happen when we privatise refuse collection service because it is an essential service. The Commissioner of Public Health should ensure that the licensed waste collector must have enough workers and that these workers are all legitimate workers. He should also have a contingency plan to take over the job should any contractor default. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the service is privatised, collection charges would have to reflect market conditions. Whether or not they will be higher than the current fees would depend on whether there is presently a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> subsidy in the fees that Government charges. Perhaps the Minister should let us know what the current situation is. Does he foresee an increase in the fees and how is he going to control the increases? I assume that he is not going to leave it entirely to market forces because in clause 13 of the Bill, it has provided that the Commissioner can regulate the charge to be levied by the licensee. I propose that when a public tender is called, a cap should be specified so that no tender should exceed this maximum charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the cost of collection reflects more and more the market condition, there should be a shift towards charging according to the actual quantities of refuse collected. This means that those who throw away more refuse should pay more. It is a fair principle. As the Ministry is corporatising its refuse collection department, may I know whether it plans to implement this principle of charging. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the problem of employing workers to do refuse collection, there is a need to increase mechanization. The Government should therefore take a national approach and see if the design of our housing flats, buildings, compounds and even our streets can be improved to facilitate more and newer forms of mechanization to cut down our reliance on manpower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the amendment to section 110A to empower the Commissioner to authorise any operator of a public service vehicle to enforce the Act. I would even ask the Minister to go further and empower the Commissioner to authorise any responsible residents to enforce the littering law within the estate they live in. Since the remark by the Prime Minister in February this year exhorting Singaporeans not to litter and negate the HDB upgrading effort, and the subsequent debates in this House on littering, a lot of campaigns and publicity have been generated by the Environment Ministry and the media on the problems of littering. I sense that more and more Singaporeans are now prepared to speak up against littering when they see \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> someone doing it. I have some residents coming to my meet-the-people session and requesting that they be empowered by the Environment Ministry to take enforcement action against littering. This is heartening and I think the Minister should give this proposition his serious thought. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to comment on the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill. The focus of the Bill is on the preparation for the privatisation of waste and refuse collection and disposal services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose privatisation is an inevitable trend. My concern is that householders may have to pay needlessly more for their rubbish to be collected. It is clear from the Bill that the Government has no intention of corporatising the Environmental Public Health Division in the Ministry. Clauses 3, 9 and 13 of the Bill envisage a more likely situation of a number of private waste collectors taking over the Ministry's waste and refuse collection and disposal services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is that the private waste collectors would incur an extra cost that the Ministry presently does not bear in rendering the same services. The proposed new section 23(4) in clause 9 and the proposed new section 31(5) in clause 13 state that the Ministry may impose a payment or payments on waste facility operators and waste collectors. If these payments are imposed and are substantial, the householders and other end-users of these services would be footing the bill. If these payments are extraneous, they seem to be a new form of indirect taxation. Clarification of the purpose of these payments is badly needed here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another alarming feature of the Bill is that it does away with the present nation-wide scale of fees for waste collection or disposal. Under the proposed new section 23(3) and (5)(c) in clause 9 and the proposed new section 31(4) and (6)(d) in clause 13, the licensees may have to obtain their licences by public tender \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and will fix the fees payable by the end-users. In the light of the recent Government statement that the public must pay a realistic price for the services they use, householders will most likely pay different rates of charges for refuse collection services, depending on where they live. When two householders occupying comparable premises within a shouting distance of each other may have to pay different rates for the same services, it would be an anomalous, if not invidious, situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill delete the reference to \"nightsoil\" in the principal Act. I am not sure how this deletion affects the portable toilets that are conveniently available at the Padang during National Day parades, Chinese funeral wakes and other outdoor functions. I am sure these portable toilets must from time to time contain a bit of nightsoil. I am also equally sure that the Government does not intend to let this occasional bit of nightsoil be transported about without any control. Regardless of whatever statutory provision governs these portable toilets, my point is that the explanation given for the repeal of section 13 of the Act, ie, \"nightsoil collection is no longer carried out\", completely ignores the importunate call of nature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another provision of the Bill, ie, clause 17 amending section 110A of the Act, also needs to be clarified, as far as I am concerned. The intention to empower an operator of a public service vehicle to enforce the law against littering is commendable. But I am not too sure how this commendable operator is expected to enforce the law? \"Operator\" here must usually mean the driver, as practically all public service buses are operated by drivers alone. Buses with conductors normally ferry kindergarten school children. I do not think the Government intends to throw the law book at these toddlers even before they know how to read it. Ticket inspectors are random birds of passage on buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that it will be difficult, if not impossible, for bus drivers to prevent littering. It would be scary if the bus drivers are to keep one eye on the road \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and the other eye on the passengers behind them all the time they are driving. Even assuming some bus drivers have superhuman vision to see through the peak-hour crush of passengers and catch a passenger littering in their bus, what are the drivers to do about it? Bring the bus to an emergency stop wherever it is, and quickly rush to the back of the bus to apprehend the culprit? Or drive the bus with all the passengers to the nearest neighbourhood police post? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not being negative or frivolous about this particular amendment. I know littering is a perennial problem, as the other Members in this House can vouch from their own town council experience. But I do not think an impractical solution will help to deal with the problem. It may be more effective, though costly, to employ more professional litterbug-catchers. It may also be more effective, if administratively inconvenient, to make the Corrective Work Orders fit the crime, eg, by making litterbugs in buses clean the buses during the graveyard shift in bus depots. Alternatively, the convicted litterbugs may be made to sweep bus terminuses or bus stops at peak periods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than the comments I have just made, I am in favour of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me thank Dr John Chen and Mr Chin Harn Tong for the great interest they have shown on this subject, in particular, specific aspects of the subject which I did not expect would attract so much interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr John Chen and Mr Chin have expressed concern about costs and whether there are subsidies in the system today, and whether corporatisation will result in an increase in costs. Currently, my Ministry charges rates which are sufficient to cover our operating cost and the capital cost based on the Government's system of accounting. So I do not expect that as a result of corporatisation alone that costs will rise. But I would like to bring to the attention of this House that costs for managing solid waste will be expected to rise in the future for a number of reasons. The first reason is simply that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> households are generating more waste year by year and therefore the cost of disposing and collecting this waste from each household can be expected to increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the cost of managing the waste will increase. There are basically two components. One is the operating cost and the other is the infrastructural cost. The operating cost depends very critically on the availability of manpower and how much we have to pay for labour. And this, as Members know, is in short supply in Singapore and is becoming more expensive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect is the infrastructural cost. Members are aware that we are building in Pulau Semakau an offshore landfill and this will incur a cost of $1.2 billion to be spent over the next five years. This will replace the current landfill site in Lorong Halus which is being priced on an historical basis. For $1.2 billion, this site will last us perhaps 30-40 years if we keep the waste low but it still has to be paid for. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the rate at which we continue to increase the amount of waste being generated in Singapore, we will also have to build one new incinerator plant in approximately every five years. An incinerator plant to deal with 3,000 tonnes of rubbish per day costs about $1 billion to build. Currently, we are operating three plants which are slightly smaller in scale but we will soon be investing in our fourth plant. So costs like these have to be covered when we are talking about managing solid waste and costs will rise if we do not minimise the waste and if we do not carry out waste management efficiently. Corporatisation will help us to do this efficiently. Competition will give the extra edge, the extra pressure, to keep costs low. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen also raised the question of mechanisation for collecting solid waste. We have done this. In our new public housing estates, for example, there are centralised refuse chutes and we no longer require workers to take the refuse \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from the refuse chutes to the central bin centres. In fact, what happens now is that my Ministry's collection vehicles can drive right to the central refuse chutes and there is an automatic transfer from the central refuse chutes to the waste collection vehicles. And this has helped to reduce the amount of manpower. We will continue to explore other such possibilities. But, of course, we also need public cooperation, especially in the private housing estates, the landed properties, where if each household does a little bit more to help either package or place the waste in a convenient way, it will help my Ministry's public service workers to collect the waste more quickly and more efficiently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chen also asked about empowering residents to enforce anti-littering laws. I would encourage residents to take an interest in the cleanliness of their neighbourhoods and to advise those who are living there and who continue to litter to stop doing so. But my Ministry will have to look very carefully before we go on a widespread scheme of empowering residents to enforce anti-littering laws, and this is something which I think we will do rather slowly. We will do it step by step. We will empower those who are already in some position of authority, eg, bus drivers, conductors and ticket inspectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin Harn Tong raised a concern on the same subject about how the driver of a one-man operated bus can be expected to enforce the anti-littering laws. Sir, I would expect that the bus drivers must continue to concentrate on their primary duty which is to drive the bus safely. However, the fact that the bus driver can book a littering offender will be a strong deterrent for anyone who thinks about littering in a bus. And I am sure that the bus driver will have no difficulty in picking out blatant cases of littering and this alone will help to reduce the amount of littering in buses. We cannot, of course, expect a complete solution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin Harn Tong also raised some concerns about licence fees which may be charged to those companies which bid for waste management. I can assure Mr Chin \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that we will consider his proposals. His concerns are valid ones. And when we devise the scheme, we will make sure that we do not load unnecessary extra costs into the system. We are going to corporatise my Ministry's solid waste management department in 1996 and we will take about three years to work through the system before we go for open competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin was also concerned about different charges being levied on households which may be in shouting distance of each other, as he put it. Yes, when competition is introduced in 1999 or the year 2000, the possibility will arise that different areas adjacent to each other may well be charged slightly different rates. But we do not expect that there will be wide variations. For example, town councils today have differential rates for service and conservancy charges but they do not vary very widely. The key point is that if the rates are different, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Because the competitive pressures will help to keep the cost down. It will allow us to select the most cost-effective, the most cost-efficient, operator to provide the service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin also expressed some concern about nightsoil collection. The reason for deleting this from the Act is that my Ministry has stopped collecting nightsoil since the mid-80s. We stopped when the service was terminated. We did so, I am told, with some fanfare. There was a small ceremony and the last bucket is on display in my Ministry. Members are welcome to inspect it if they wish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, we are no longer providing the service. The provisions in the Act are no longer necessary. And those who provide portable toilets on the Padang and elsewhere provide a total service, and that includes bringing the waste to the proper treatment facility. So there is no longer any requirement for this provision in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered the main points that have been brought up by both Dr Chen and Mr Chin. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Minister has not addressed my concern about the possibility of private refuse collectors defaulting. It is a distinct possibility and we see it happening in other industries. So we cannot afford this sort of thing to happen in this service. The other matter is about charging according to the quantities collected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> My apologies to Dr John Chen for not having addressed these two issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today 47% of the solid waste generated in Singapore is collected by private operators. I think Members may not be aware of this. My Ministry collects 53% of the solid waste generated and this comes mainly from domestic and trade premises. Private collectors collect 47% of the solid waste generated from industrial and commercial premises. So there are already private operators who have the skill and ability to operate at quite a large scale. We have the confidence that given two or three years' lead time these larger private collectors in particular would be able to gear themselves up to provide the service. Because there are quite a number of large private collectors, we believe that when we do open this up for competition and privatise it, there will be sufficient alternatives available in the event that a private collector is unable to provide the level of service required or he defaults. We will also provide sufficient guidelines, measurement of quality, service standards and so forth when we put up the operation for tender. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen has raised a very valid point, which is collecting by volume. This is something which my Ministry fully supports. Today, we charge a flat fee for collecting refuse from households and apartments - $20 per month for households and $8 per month for apartments regardless of the volume of refuse that is generated. What Dr John Chen has proposed is a good idea. My Ministry is, in fact, studying this to see how we can move from a flat fee system to a system where those who generate more waste bear the responsibility for paying a higher cost for that greater amount of waste to be managed and treated. This may include a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> charging and rebate system for town councils and a paid bag system for private housing. My Ministry is studying this and at the appropriate time we will put forward this proposal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of cost of waste management, I would also like to make a point that we have to charge the correct economic cost for waste disposal. Otherwise, that will be tantamount to subsidising waste generation. If we charge too low for waste disposal, what it actually means is that it costs you very little to throw something away. In fact, this might well encourage people to throw more things away which they might otherwise re-use or re-cycle. So it is important to charge the appropriate economic cost for waste disposal, otherwise we will be inadvertently subsidising waste disposal and disadvantaging those who are setting up recycling plants or those who are carrying out waste minimisation efforts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEPARTMENTAL TITLES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The Motion reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 77), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively the following: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Old Title or Name of Office     New Title or Name of Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Head of Administration and      Head of Support and Services\r\n\r\n     Specialist Division,            Division, Criminal\r\n\r\n     Criminal Investigation          Investigation Department\r\n\r\n     Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Officer-in-Charge of the        Head of Investigations of\r\n\r\n     Traffic Investigation           the Traffic Investigation\r\n\r\n     Branch                          Branch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Officers-in-Charge of the       Commanders of the Land\r\n\r\n     Land Divisions                  Divisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Officer-in-Charge of the        Commander of the Police Coast\r\n\r\n     Marine Police Division          Guard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Assistant Officer-in-Charge     Deputy Commander of the\r\n\r\n     of the Marine Police            Police Coast Guard.\r\n\r\n     Division\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, officers holding the five titles exercise some of the Public Prosecutors' powers by virtue of the Gazette Notification No. 2 to the Criminal Procedure Code - the Public Prosecutor - Deputies and Assistants.

The Board also closely monitors employers who are habitually late in their CPF payment. These measures enable the Board to protect CPF members' interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Should an employer succeed to avoid CPF contribution for a long period, he will be required to back-pay the CPF contributions due, with heavy penalty interest of 18% per annum imposed. In addition, the employer will not be allowed to claim from the employee the employee's share of the contributions, ie the employer has to bear the full 40% CPF contribution. If he fails to pay up, he will be brought to Court. If he fails to comply with the Court Order, his business assets may be seized or his business wound up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Arrears in payment)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr John De Payva</b> asked the Minister for Labour how many companies were in arrears of paying Central Provident Fund contributions in 1993 and 1994 and if he will provide the information on a quarterly basis, stating the amounts owing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board keeps records on arrears by employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The number of employers with CPF contribution arrears in 1993 and 1994 and the estimated amount owing are as shown below:- \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         No. of employers    Estimated amount\r\n\r\n                                     1\r\n\r\n       Period              in arrears            owing ($)\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1993                                                       2\r\n\r\n     1st Quarter             13,816           not available\r\n\r\n     2nd Quarter             12,129               - do -\r\n\r\n     3rd Quarter             13,127               - do -\r\n\r\n     4th Quarter             14,441               70.09m\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1994\r\n\r\n     1st Quarter             16,154               78.57m\r\n\r\n     2nd Quarter             15,096               70.14m\r\n\r\n     3rd Quarter             14,785               62.22m\r\n\r\n     4th Quarter             15,222               72.88m\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Employers in arrears refer to those who are late in paying the\r\n\r\n  CPF due by 1 month or more.\r\n\r\n2 The amount of arrears for the first three quarters of 1993 is\r\n\r\n  not readily available because CPF Board has re-vamped its\r\n\r\n  computer system for tracking the amount owing around the 3rd\r\n\r\n  quarter of 1993.\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650403.htm\">Annex 1 - SINGAPORE TOTALISATOR BOARD DONATIONS TO ORGANISATIONS SINCE 1991 (Cols. 403 - 406)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650407.htm\">Mr Chiam's letter (Cols. 407 - 408)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650409.htm\">Mr Ling's letter (Cols. 409 - 410)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19951205/19951205-HA-0650411.htm\">Mr Ling's complaint (Cols. 411 - 412)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
