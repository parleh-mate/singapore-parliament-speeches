However,  it  has  been  provided  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  the State of Singapore  that  our\r\n\r\nLegislature can elect as Speaker either a Member of\r\n\r\nthis  House  itself, or a person from  outside  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Your election, Mr Speaker, is  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith our constitutional procedure and parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice   prevailing   in  many   countries.   You\r\n\r\nyourself, Mr Speaker, have indicated that you will\r\n\r\noccupy the Chair for only a temporary period. It is\r\n\r\nour  intention at a future date to elect  a  Puisne\r\n\r\nJudge  to  the  Chair. The consent of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,   who  is  now  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\njudiciary, must of course be sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it has been an honour to have proposed you as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. I have no doubt that the experience you have acquired as a respected member of the Bar will stand you in good stead in your present office. You have had a distinguished academic record in your\r\n\r\nstudent  days  and, if I can recollect  accurately,\r\n\r\nyou  were,  besides  being  a  scholar,  a  skilled\r\n\r\nsportsman.  I  am told cricket was  your  favourite\r\n\r\ngame - a very fair game indeed compared to the hurly\r\n\r\nburly  of  soccer  and  rugby  football,  in  which\r\n\r\nsometimes   the  referee  becomes  the  object   of\r\n\r\nuncomplimentary remarks and the target of  missiles\r\n\r\nfrom the players and the gallery. You yourself, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, must have umpired many a cricket  game  in\r\n\r\nyour  time,  and just as you have fairly  acted  as\r\n\r\numpire on the cricket pitch, we have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nyou  will also be an able umpire in this House, and\r\n\r\nthat  you  will observe that the rules of the  game\r\n\r\nare played as indicated in the Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\none who has known you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  many years, I have no doubt, as you have  said\r\n\r\njust  now, that you will chair the sittings of this\r\n\r\nAssembly, during the time when you are the  Speaker\r\n\r\nor  later on when you are the Deputy Speaker,  with\r\n\r\nfairness,  patience  and  impartiality  that   will\r\n\r\ntranscend party politics despite the fact that  you\r\n\r\nare  a  Member  of  the Government  Party,  as  the\r\n\r\nprevious Deputy Speaker of this House who was  also\r\n\r\na Member of the Government had done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we in the Opposition do mourn the loss\r\n\r\nof  Mr  George Oehlers - the great Speaker who  has\r\n\r\nestablished parliamentary democracy in  this  State \r\n\r\n- and  we do not hesitate to say that we would  like\r\n\r\nto  see  him  here  with  us  again,  but  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  about which we in the Opposition  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  very  much.

For the enlightenment of Members  who\r\n\r\nwere not present at the last Assembly when this Act\r\n\r\nwas  adopted, if I may read section 95 (1)   of  the\r\n\r\nAct. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to subsection (2), Part VIII of the\r\n\r\nConstitution shall not have effect for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof elections of members of the House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Representatives from Singapore until the second\r\n\r\ngeneral  election to that House held after Malaysia\r\n\r\nDay,  and  so long as this subsection  applies  to\r\n\r\nthose  elections  those members shall,  subject  to\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2), be elected as may be  provided  by\r\n\r\nany law passed by the Legislature of Singapore with\r\n\r\nthe   concurrence  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong\r\n\r\n(including any law so passed before Malaysia  Day),\r\n\r\nand the period for which they are elected should be\r\n\r\nthe   period   until  the  second  dissolution   of\r\n\r\nParliament after Malaysia Day.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, Members on the Opposition side, even those who\r\n\r\nwere  not  Members  of  this Chamber  in  the  last\r\n\r\nsession, will know that the Government introduced a\r\n\r\nBill for the election of 15 Members direct from  15\r\n\r\nconstituencies in Singapore, such constituencies to\r\n\r\nbe  formed  by  grouping in threes  and  fours  the\r\n\r\nexisting   51   constituencies  to  form   15.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  then Minister  for  Home  Affairs,\r\n\r\ninvited  all leaders of the Opposition  Parties  to\r\n\r\nput   up   their   proposals  as   to   how   these\r\n\r\nconstituencies  were  to  be  formed.  For   diverse\r\n\r\nreasons,  each Party having a separate reason,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition teamed up to defeat or, if I may be more\r\n\r\naccurate, to prevent the passage of the Bill,  with\r\n\r\nthe votes tying on the Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the eve of nomination on the 11th of\r\n\r\nSeptember, I made a broadcast in which I stated  as\r\n\r\na  main  plank  of the Government's  platform,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. platform, that the election was to  be  one\r\n\r\nfor  51 seats and also for 15 seats, the 15  to  be\r\n\r\nelected  from the 51. I do not recall, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  having read any contrary platform  being  put\r\n\r\nforward  by  any Opposition Party. I did,  however,\r\n\r\nsubsequently  read, when the election  results  had\r\n\r\nbeen declared for the 51 seats, that the leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, who is no  longer  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber, would now prefer to go back to 15 seats in\r\n\r\na direct election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to labour this point. But it\r\n\r\ndoes  not require much ingenuity, now that we  know\r\n\r\nthe  results  of  the elections on a  party  basis,\r\n\r\nconstituency by constituency, to so re-arrange  the\r\n\r\n51 constituencies in such a way as to give a parity\r\n\r\nof  total  votes in 15 in which the  Barisan  would\r\n\r\nprobably not win even a single seat. But that would\r\n\r\nbe   an  exercise  in  ingenuity  which  would  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be in the interest of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry. We could even, by this collegiate election\r\n\r\nwhich we have done and which we made an issue of at\r\n\r\nthe  elections,  like the Borneo territories,  take\r\n\r\nall the 15 seats to ourselves. But again that would\r\n\r\nnot be in the interest of the country. It is useful\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia and its 10 million inhabitants  to  be\r\n\r\nconstantly reminded of the presence of people  who,\r\n\r\nwhatever  they now piously say about defending  the\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of  Malaysia, have  as  their  primary\r\n\r\nobject  the  destruction  of  the  nation  we  have\r\n\r\nfounded. I would not wish to arrogate to Members of\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  generally the right to nominate  and\r\n\r\nvote  for  three  Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is  a  matter for  them  to  decide.\r\n\r\nWhether they would wish to send three of their most\r\n\r\naffable  and amiable colleagues in order to  smooth\r\n\r\nthe  way  with the other 159 Members in Parliament,\r\n\r\nor  whether  they would choose to send their  three\r\n\r\nfiercest  ones  is a matter I leave  completely  in\r\n\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say to them that they should bear\r\n\r\nthis  in mind - that all the great issues which have\r\n\r\nagitated  this  Chamber over the  last  nine  years\r\n\r\nsince  1955  - anti-colonialism,  abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nPreservation   of   Public   Security    Ordinance,\r\n\r\ndenunciation  and  condemnation  of   arrests   and\r\n\r\ndetention  without  trial,  brutality  of   Fascist\r\n\r\npolice  force  - all  these burning  issues  of  the\r\n\r\nmoment  unfortunately  are  no  longer  within  the\r\n\r\npreserve  of the jurisdiction of this Chamber.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we meet now, as I hope from time  to  time\r\n\r\nwe will, for the more constructive if less exciting\r\n\r\npurpose  of getting on with the job of building  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  base in Singapore, rebuilding  the  old\r\n\r\nCity  and producing the things for which the people\r\n\r\nhave elected us. There will not be the great issues\r\n\r\nof     foreign    policy,    defence,     security,\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  all  the things  that  filled  this\r\n\r\nChamber with so many long hours of debate. I do not\r\n\r\nknow whether the Central Parliament will concede to\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  followed in this Chamber,  allowing\r\n\r\nthem  on one occasion, if I remember correctly,  no\r\n\r\nless  than eight continuous hours of filibustering.\r\n\r\nI would say it is for them to decide how they would\r\n\r\nwish to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the three seats that they  will  have\r\n\r\nout of the 159 seats in the Central Parliament.

The  basic   spirit   and\r\n\r\nprinciples  of this Bill, he says, are  founded  on\r\n\r\nthe  results of the State election according to the\r\n\r\nproportion of representation of the Party in  power\r\n\r\nand  the  Opposition to elect  15  Members  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament. We must  point  out  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. conducted  a very unfair  and  undemocratic\r\n\r\ngeneral   election,  and  after  this  unfair   and\r\n\r\nundemocratic  election,  the  P.A.P. is   tabling\r\n\r\nanother  unreasonable Bill in this House.  We  must\r\n\r\npoint  out,  in  the first place,  that  the  State\r\n\r\nelection  was  meant  for  the  election  of  State\r\n\r\nAssemblymen. Before the election and  even  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the  election in all  the  Government's\r\n\r\nstatements  and circulars and in the  platforms  of\r\n\r\nthe   various  political  Parties,  there  was   no\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of the intention to elect Members  from\r\n\r\nthe State Assembly --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I on a point of\r\n\r\ninformation, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Section\r\n\r\n95  of  the Malaysia Act, which is adopted in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,   provides   that   legislation   shall   be\r\n\r\nintroduced either before or after Malaysia  Day  in\r\n\r\nthis  Legislative Assembly for the election  of  15\r\n\r\nMembers.  We  introduced direct  elections  for  15\r\n\r\nMembers. The Bill was blocked. We then had  general\r\n\r\nelections of 51 seats, and on the eve of nomination\r\n\r\nwe, the Government Party, made it an issue that  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  returned, a Bill would be  introduced  in\r\n\r\norder to select 15 representatives from Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House. The normal principle underlining  such\r\n\r\nan  issue  is quite simple. A matter has been  made\r\n\r\nthe main plank in an election issue. The votes have\r\n\r\nbeen  given,  the matter is resolved.  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nhappy to hear the Member out and answer him. But he\r\n\r\nshould  bear in mind that these points have already\r\n\r\nbeen taken up in this Chamber and he has to pick up\r\n\r\nthe  argument from the fact that his own Party  had\r\n\r\nblocked the election of 15 seats, brought about the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections in which we said that we  had  no\r\n\r\nintention of repeating another general election for\r\n\r\n15  seats  at  the expense of three-quarters  of  a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Jurong please\r\n\r\nproceed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar has just now said that we  prevented\r\n\r\nthe passage of the Bill to elect 15 representatives\r\n\r\nto  the Central Parliament. That is why this matter\r\n\r\nwas  made  an  election issue in the State  general\r\n\r\nelection.  That is why it is the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to elect from among the Members in  this\r\n\r\nHouse 15 persons to the Central Parliament. I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  in the last Assembly,  our  Party\r\n\r\nopposed  the Bill known as the Singapore (Elections\r\n\r\nto the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. That\r\n\r\nwas  a  matter  of  chronological order  which  has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the principles of this Bill. Our\r\n\r\nopposition then was one matter and this Bill now is\r\n\r\nanother  matter. We must point out that  the  State\r\n\r\ngeneral  election was intended for  the  people  to\r\n\r\nelect State Assemblymen. In the minds of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople, after the general election, there would  be\r\n\r\nanother    election    for    the    election    of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament. That was\r\n\r\nthe  impression the people got. It was very simple.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of the people, in the general election\r\n\r\nthey  only  had  to elect representatives  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse   and  not  representatives  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament  as  well. So, if one  is  to  base  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation on the results of the State  general\r\n\r\nelection  and  elect  15  Members  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament,  then that will not be a true  election\r\n\r\nmade  by  the people, because some people who  have\r\n\r\nelected Members to this House may not agree to  the\r\n\r\nsame  representatives  to the  Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThen  some people who have not been elected to this\r\n\r\nHouse   might  be  agreed  to  as  being   suitable\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to  the  Central  Parliament.   So\r\n\r\nshortly  before  the general election,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndeclared that the State general election would also\r\n\r\nbe  an  election for representatives to the Central\r\n\r\nParliament.  But  there  was  no  mention  of   the\r\n\r\nnomination  of representatives by the  Assembly  in\r\n\r\nthe State to the Central Parliament --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if the Member will allow\r\n\r\nme,  I  will  produce a copy of my broadcast  which\r\n\r\nwill  set out the issues that I placed on the  11th\r\n\r\nof September --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

So according to\r\n\r\nthe proportion represented by both sides, the Party in  \r\n\r\npower is getting an advantage. That is why  the Party  \r\n\r\nin power has chosen to discard the Singapore \r\n\r\n(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill.  \r\n\r\nInstead,  it  is now tabling  the  Singapore \r\n\r\n(Election to the House of Representatives) Bill. \r\n\r\nIn fact, before the House was convened, the Government \r\n\r\ndeclared  that it would choose 12 out of  15  seats from \r\n\r\nthe Party in power, thus giving three  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseats  to  the Opposition only. This is a means  to\r\n\r\ndeprive the democratic rights of the Opposition. So\r\n\r\nwe say that the Government intends to get more from\r\n\r\nits  own  side by taking advantage of  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation  to  have  more  representatives  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral House of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right thing to do now is to have another\r\n\r\nelection before the people, so that the people will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to elect their own representatives  truly\r\n\r\nrepresenting  them in the Central Parliament.  That\r\n\r\nis why we are rising to oppose this Bill, which has\r\n\r\nnot obtained the consent of the people, to nominate\r\n\r\nMembers  from this House to the Central Parliament,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  view of the undemocratic  general\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to oppose this Bill all the more. We must\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  in  the  course  of  the  general\r\n\r\nelection  held  last September, the  conditions  of\r\n\r\ncompetition were very disadvantageous and unfair to\r\n\r\nthe Opposition because the P.A.P. itself was making\r\n\r\nuse  of public funds to carry out propaganda  work.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Prime  Minister was  touring  all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies on public funds. The P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nsaid that there is democracy in Singapore, but when\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition applied for permits  to  hold  mass\r\n\r\nrallies,  such applications were invariably  turned\r\n\r\ndown.  After  this,  the P.A.P. all  of  a  sudden\r\n\r\ndeclared  that a general election was to  be  held.\r\n\r\nThat  was to catch the Opposition unawares. So  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  put  on a more advantageous  level  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  Opposition.  This  last  general\r\n\r\nelection allowed only nine days --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I do not wish to prevent the  Member\r\n\r\nfrom raising anything about the last election,  but\r\n\r\nwe  are talking about the Bill for the election  of 15  Members from this Assembly. As I understand the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders, the debate is one  on  principle,\r\n\r\nand  if he is against it on principle, let us  hear\r\n\r\nwhy not about the last election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I must point out\r\n\r\nthat  in  the course of the last general  election,\r\n\r\nthere was unfairness all around and there was no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecific  mention that the State election was  also\r\n\r\nan    election    of   the   Central   Parliament's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last general elections, the political\r\n\r\nParties  were  given only nine days  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir propaganda work. In spite of that, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas  not  quite  assured. So it  also  resorted  to\r\n\r\nfurther  means.  It  made  use  of  all  the  State\r\n\r\nmachinery,  the  radio,  television  and  all   the\r\n\r\npropaganda and publicity machinery to propagate for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  In  the last few days of  the  general\r\n\r\nelection, it even went to the extent of threatening\r\n\r\nthe  people into believing that in the event of the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   being  elected   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  send troops to Singapore.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  worked  for  the Barisan Sosialis  by  pasting\r\n\r\nposters  at  different places were also  threatened\r\n\r\nwith   arrest.  Some  of  our  workers  were   even\r\n\r\nassaulted during the election campaign.  If  it  is\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we had a fair and democratic  election,\r\n\r\nwhy  is it that the P.A.P. was not prepared to give\r\n\r\nup its dictatorial means? We must stress again that\r\n\r\nbefore  the last State general election, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  the  colonial  Government  together  with  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  arrested some 100 progressive  elements\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  on the 2nd February this  year.  The\r\n\r\nreason  for the arrests was that these people  were\r\n\r\nagitating   for  violence  and  were   engaged   in\r\n\r\nsubversive activities. But up to the present  date,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has not been able to  produce  any\r\n\r\nconcrete  evidence  to  prove  their  guilt.

So if one  is  to\r\n\r\nbase the election of representatives to the Central\r\n\r\nParliament  on  the  results of  the  last  general\r\n\r\nelection, then I say that such an election  is  not\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the views of the people  because\r\n\r\nthe  general election was not conducted in  a  fair\r\n\r\nand just manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to point out again that this Bill is\r\n\r\nunreasonable by itself, it is unfair again to elect\r\n\r\nMembers   in   proportion   to   the   number    of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in this House. We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nParty in power has 37 seats in this House and  that\r\n\r\nit  has  some  70 per cent of the total  number  of\r\n\r\nseats in this House, but the Government was able to\r\n\r\npool only about 40 per cent of the total number  of\r\n\r\nvotes  cast  in the general election;  whereas  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, which has only  seven  seats  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, was able to pool more than 30 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the total number of votes cast. That is to say,\r\n\r\neach P.A.P. Assemblyman represents only about 7,000\r\n\r\npeople, whereas each Barisan Assemblyman represents\r\n\r\nabout  15,000 people. Therefore, it is most  unfair\r\n\r\nif we are to elect the representatives according to\r\n\r\nthe present number of Members in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that the State elections were meant to return a political Party to form the Government. In other words, the political Party should elect its own representatives to the Central Parliament according to the party stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to point out is that\r\n\r\nthree  Barisan Members have been arrested  and  two\r\n\r\nhave been --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andrew Fong (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Andrew Fong):</b> I think the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong is going out of his way again.

It seems  to  me  that  the\r\n\r\nimpression  I got from him just now was that  every\r\n\r\nMember  elected  to  this House through  democratic\r\n\r\nvoting  cannot  represent the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  in  any  case the Communists never believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocratic  voting.

But if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Jurong or other  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis believe that they were not elected\r\n\r\nby the people, that is their own funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was also concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  number  of representatives to be elected  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government  benches that  is  to  say,  as  he\r\n\r\nstated,  12 from the Government and three from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  I  think  this  percentage   is\r\n\r\nstrictly  in  order because, as  we  can  see,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition consist of only a handful of sour  faces\r\n\r\nand  I  doubt very much whether they can  represent\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore. Frankly speaking,  they\r\n\r\nwere elected on threats and violence, and they  say\r\n\r\nin  this  House  that  they  are  the  only  people\r\n\r\nreturned to this House under democratic voting  and\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  on  the  Government benches were elected  under\r\n\r\nundemocratic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we were given\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  which has tremendous repercussions  on\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the Slate of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Parliament, at 11.25 a.m., and  at  11.26\r\n\r\na.m. the Prime Minister delivered his policy speech\r\n\r\non  the  Second Reading of the Bill.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a Bill which is very important, which  is\r\n\r\nsupposed   to  elect  or  appoint  15  Members   to\r\n\r\nrepresent  Singapore in the Central Parliament  for\r\n\r\nnearly six years. The Opposition Members were given\r\n\r\na few minutes to consider such an important Bill. I\r\n\r\nmust strongly protest against the highhanded method\r\n\r\nof  Government by not giving a fair opportunity  to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members to  study  the  merits  or\r\n\r\ndemerits of this important Bill. I must put  it  on\r\n\r\nrecord  that we hope this will not be the beginning\r\n\r\nof  a series of acts of undemocratic suppression of\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the Opposition, however we might  be\r\n\r\nin  the  minority, because once we are elected,  we\r\n\r\nare  here to voice whatever grievances and feelings\r\n\r\nthere are on behalf of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as for the merits or demerits of the Bill, I must admit that the Prime Minister had, before nomination, made a statement that the first Parliament would be appointed by this Assembly. But you will see that in those circumstances the people were quite confused because of the short period of\r\n\r\nthe election campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Why\r\n\r\ndid you not say then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There were only 9 days given\r\n\r\nto the Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We are sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  when the people voted for representatives  to\r\n\r\nthe  State  Assembly, they believed that they  were\r\n\r\nvoting  for  a  State Government which  would  look\r\n\r\nafter  public housing, public utilities,  education\r\n\r\nand  various other aspects of local government. But\r\n\r\nthis Bill is going to appoint Members who are going\r\n\r\nto  represent different aspects of the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. It is going  to  appoint\r\n\r\nMembers to represent Singapore's' interests in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament. And there, whether one  is  for\r\n\r\nor  against,  Malaysia looms huge on  the  horizon.\r\n\r\nWhereas  in the State Assembly election, the  issue\r\n\r\nof Malaysia is not of so much importance. I am sure\r\n\r\nmany  voters who voted for the P.A.P. in  the  last\r\n\r\nelection,  and  during  the last  four  weeks  have\r\n\r\nexperienced this so-called \"New York of  Malaysia\",\r\n\r\nwould not have voted for the P.A.P. in the election\r\n\r\nto the Central Parliament. I believe there are many\r\n\r\nvoters  who voted for the P.A.P. because they  want\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., who believe that the P.A.P. can provide\r\n\r\nbetter housing and better public utilities, but who\r\n\r\ndo  not believe that the P.A.P.'s stand on Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  the  correct  stand. For instance,  because  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's incorporation into Malaysia,  Indonesia\r\n\r\nhas  staged  an economic boycott against Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  I  understand that at least over 20,000 people\r\n\r\nare  unemployed  because of this boycott.  Business\r\n\r\nand factories are on the verge of collapse and many\r\n\r\nof  them  are closing down. These people who  voted\r\n\r\nfor  the P.A.P. in the last election would not have\r\n\r\nvoted P.A.P. if the P.A.P. stands for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the situation in Sabah and Sarawak is different because in Sahah and Sarawak there is direct appointment from the Assembly to the Central Parliament. The situation there is different because that was the first time election was held. Whereas in Singapore we have long years of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  elections. So what applies  in  Sarawak\r\n\r\nand Sabah should not apply to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister made his statement, he\r\n\r\ndid  not  make it clear to the public of  Singapore\r\n\r\n- and even this Bill did not make it clear - that the\r\n\r\nappointment   of  15  Members  to  the   House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives would be for a term of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnearly  six years. Many thought that these  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament would only serve until the  term  of\r\n\r\nthe  present Malaysia Parliament expires, which  is\r\n\r\nabout  March or June next year. Therefore, I  feel,\r\n\r\nSir, since the appointment of these Members will be\r\n\r\nfor  a  long period of six years, we will agree  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government appointing 15 Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  the  period  until  this  Malaysia  Parliament\r\n\r\nexpires,  that  is,  March or June  1964.  But  for\r\n\r\nsubsequent periods we propose that there should  be\r\n\r\npan-Malaysian   Federal  elections   which   should\r\n\r\ninclude the State of Singapore, that is, after  the\r\n\r\nfirst Malaysian Parliament has expired sometime  in\r\n\r\nthe middle of next year, we should have election of\r\n\r\nthe 15 representatives to the Malaysian Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I consider what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong  has said as irrelevant.  What  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about now is the Singapore (Election to the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representives) Bill. Yet he was  talking\r\n\r\nabout the general election held about a month  ago.\r\n\r\nTo  discuss  the  last election  at  this  time  is\r\n\r\nirrelevant. I rather gather the impression that  he\r\n\r\nhas  nothing  to  say but to talk  on  the  general\r\n\r\nelection.  During the election the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  to the whole nation that if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwere  returned  to power the 15 representatives  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central Parliament would be chosen  from  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We  have  now got a new  mandate  from  the\r\n\r\npeople.  So  we now propose this Bill. Our  aim  is\r\n\r\njust  to fulfil an election pledge. The people will\r\n\r\nfeel  proud because the Government which they  have\r\n\r\nchosen  has  fulfilled  its  election  pledge.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis has not proposed this Bill. Is  it\r\n\r\nits  intention to ask us not to fulfil our  pledge?\r\n\r\nWe  will  fulfil our pledge. In every  election  we\r\n\r\nhave  to spend $700,000. We have made preparations,\r\n\r\nand  we know that if this money is not spent we can\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  it  in other useful  ways,  such  as\r\n\r\nbuilding community centres, constructing roads  and\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  it. If there were any  election,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be based on the democratic system and  this\r\n\r\nmoney should be used for a good cause, otherwise we\r\n\r\nwould  just be squandering away the people's  money\r\n\r\nwhich are public funds. Do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis mean that we should waste this\r\n\r\nsum  of  public  money in order  to  satisfy  their\r\n\r\npersonal wishes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no need to talk about what\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Jurong has termed the undemocratic\r\n\r\nand  unjust general election. If he does  not  want\r\n\r\nthe  15  representatives to be  elected  from  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  why is it that in August when we wanted  to\r\n\r\npass  a  Bill in this House so that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  could  elect  15  representatives,  they\r\n\r\nprevented its passage? It is because at that  time,\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of party politics, they collaborated\r\n\r\nwith  Lim  Yew Hock's clique in their own interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the so-called democracy to  them  means\r\n\r\nnothing. It is not worth more than a cent to  them.\r\n\r\nThey  will try to achieve their aims by any  means,\r\n\r\nas  long as the means justify the end. Our original\r\n\r\nintention    was   to   have   popularly    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament. If  they\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  do it, the Barisan Sosialis  should\r\n\r\nhave supported the Bill which we then proposed  and\r\n\r\nthey  could well have been in a position,  as  they\r\n\r\nthought, to be elected. But they were so scared and\r\n\r\nthey  dared not see the Bill passed. Now they  have\r\n\r\nturned  round  and said that the  number  of  three\r\n\r\nseats  for them is not enough and they have boasted\r\n\r\nthat  they have the support of the masses. If  that\r\n\r\nis  true, why did they not dare have elections held\r\n\r\nin  August to elect the 15 representatives? If they\r\n\r\ndid not want these elections in the past, what more\r\n\r\ndo they have to say now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for their so-called terms \"undemocratic\" and\r\n\r\n\"dictatorial\", we in the P.A.P. know that  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  unreasonably attacked and criticised  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  for more than  two  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears.  Every day these people have been  attacking\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Even our P.A.P. branch property, such as\r\n\r\nchairs, tables and daily utensils, has been removed\r\n\r\nby  these  people - by their party executives.  They\r\n\r\nwent  among the rural people spreading the  rumours\r\n\r\nthat  after merger the Chinese would no  longer  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  eat  pork; there would  not  be  any\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  Chinese to live  according  to\r\n\r\ntheir   customs;   all  Chinese  males   would   be\r\n\r\ncircumcised,  and all that rubbish  talk.  We  have\r\n\r\nendured this rubbish talk for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  two  and  a half years and in  the  end  the\r\n\r\npeople  have proved that they have not listened  to\r\n\r\nthem. What more do they have to say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that he wants to\r\n\r\nprotest against the Government's high-handed action\r\n\r\nin   arresting  their  Members  and  their   fellow\r\n\r\ntravellers. But I would like to tell him that  they\r\n\r\nshould not shirk their responsibilities and put the\r\n\r\nblame on the Government. If they want to play  with\r\n\r\nfire,  that  is  their own business.  Long  ago  we\r\n\r\nwarned them about this, if they were to carry on in\r\n\r\nsuch a manner, it would not pay. They should return\r\n\r\nto  our  fold. Even on the eve of their  break-away\r\n\r\nfrom  us, I had talks with the Member for Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nfor  several days and nights. I told him, \"Your way\r\n\r\nwill  not  be profitable. It is useless.\"  Now  the\r\n\r\npeople have proved that they have no trust in these\r\n\r\npeople. They have shown that these people's rumours\r\n\r\nare useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also said that the present\r\n\r\ndemocracy belongs only to the Party in power. But I\r\n\r\nwould say that democracy belongs to all the people.\r\n\r\nAll  those  anti-national and  subversive  elements\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  protected by the State.  Democracy\r\n\r\nshould  not be used as a cover for their subversive\r\n\r\nand  anti-national activities. We  have  introduced\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  in this House today as the  first  step\r\n\r\ntowards  fulfilling  our  election  pledges.  After\r\n\r\nthat,  we  will  further  carry  out  our  election\r\n\r\npledges. We hope that this House can consider  this\r\n\r\nBill  and  avoid a meaningless debate  because  the\r\n\r\nmain  issues that concern Malaysia will be  debated\r\n\r\nin the Central Parliament and not here. Let us save\r\n\r\ntime now and come to the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in order not to give you a wrong\r\n\r\nimpression. I have to make some clarification. What\r\n\r\nthe newly-appointed Minister for Labour has said is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  facts. The former  Speaker  would  be\r\n\r\nlaughing  if he heard what the Minister  has  said.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government introduced the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives)\r\n\r\nBill  the  last time, we opposed it. We opposed  it\r\n\r\nbecause   it   gave  powers  to  the  Minister   to\r\n\r\nmonopolise  the whole affair. He would ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. would win. That was why we opposed it at\r\n\r\nthat  time. The Minister for Labour has  just  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  are trying to cheat the people by telling\r\n\r\nlies.  But,  in actual fact, our Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\nalso  the previous Prime Minister. I can give three\r\n\r\nexamples. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a\r\n\r\nfew  days before the election, the P.A.P. at  first\r\n\r\nthought that they would be finished, so they  tried\r\n\r\nto  make  use  of the State machinery to  propagate\r\n\r\nlies.  They  said  that the Prime Minister  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  the  Tunku and  not  Mr  Lee.  The\r\n\r\ndecision was made by the Tunku and not Mr Lee. How\r\n\r\nwould he know what the Federation would do? One  of\r\n\r\nthe biggest rumours they spread was that if we won,\r\n\r\nFederal troops would come into Singapore. Now,  how\r\n\r\ncould  they  know? They should be ashamed  of  what\r\n\r\nthey had said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the new Minister for Labour has said\r\n\r\nthat  he  had tried to persuade the Member for  Nee\r\n\r\nSoon.  What  he  was talking about was  the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nPlen. What they wanted to tell us has already  been\r\n\r\nmade known to all the people, so it would be better\r\n\r\nif  the new Minister did not waste the time of this\r\n\r\nHouse by talking this sort of rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Sir, I quote from the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, polling day, Saturday, 21st September,  when\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis said this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Lee Siew Choh, the Barisan Chairman, said,\r\n\r\n\"We  expect an overwhelming landslide victory.

When the results came to them  as\r\n\r\na surprise, may I quote what Dr Lee Siew Choh said\r\n\r\non 29th September, the Malayan Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He said that the results came as a complete\r\n\r\nsurprise to many of his supporters. He described an\r\n\r\nincident  in  which  one of the Barisan  supporters\r\n\r\nliterally  smashed a Rediffusion set  in  order  to\r\n\r\ngive    vent    to   his   pent-up   feelings    of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction.  And Mr Lee also  disclosed  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  his supporters had cried and others  even\r\n\r\nfainted on learning the results.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, obviously, while the campaign was fought, they\r\n\r\nwere  quite  satisfied that they were  winning  and\r\n\r\nthat they were given all the opportunity to canvass\r\n\r\nand to hold as many mass meetings as they liked.

Voting was done strictly according to the laws\r\n\r\nlaid down, There were checks and counter-checks  at\r\n\r\neach  stage.  They lost not because there  was  any\r\n\r\nmonkeying  with  procedures or  unfairness  in  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of the elections. They lost because  their\r\n\r\nstrategy  was incorrect, their political  appraisal\r\n\r\nwas  inaccurate,  and  the  manner  in  which  they\r\n\r\nconducted the campaign was in many aspects  stupid.\r\n\r\nThey  lost quite simply because they did  not  have\r\n\r\nthe  support  of  the majority of the  people.  The\r\n\r\nsooner  they accept that as a fact, the better  for\r\n\r\nthem   and  possibly  they  may  put  up  a  better\r\n\r\nperformance  if they go about their business  in  a\r\n\r\nmore intelligent way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as regards the merits of the Bill, this\r\n\r\nis absolutely clear and beyond all doubt. We stated\r\n\r\nto  the electorate and during the elections that if\r\n\r\nwe   formed   the  Government  after  the   general\r\n\r\nelections  we  did  not  propose  to  have  another\r\n\r\nelection  for  the Central Parliament because  that\r\n\r\nopportunity was offered to all Parties in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  July  this year, and the Barisan Sosialis,  for\r\n\r\nreasons  best  known to itself, saw fit  to  reject\r\n\r\nthis  offer of elections to the Central Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat  being  the  case, we decided that  there  was\r\n\r\nabsolutely no point in having two general elections\r\n\r\nwithin  a  short space of a few weeks to decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  membership  of  the Central Parliament  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore, in fact, that issue was made clear\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt, and in this very copy of the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  on  polling day, it states here in headlines -\r\n\r\nIF P.A.P. WINS NO NEW POSTS FOR CENTRAL PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nMEMBERS. So what is all this fuss about? I honestly\r\n\r\ncannot  understand  the song and  dance  which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Members are creating today. If they want to\r\n\r\nattack  Government policy and show up  inadequacies\r\n\r\nof  the  administration in any field  of  activity,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have the opportunity in due course.  So\r\n\r\nplease  be  patient. The time will come when  under\r\n\r\nthe  rules of debate of the Assembly there will  be\r\n\r\nopportunity   for   them   to   debate   on   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  farmers,  rural  areas,   extravagant\r\n\r\nexpenditure, this, that and the other.

He says that our Chairman stated that the\r\n\r\nelection  was conducted in a fair and just  manner.\r\n\r\nNobody   will  believe  him,  because  during   the\r\n\r\nelection we found that the people were on the  side\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis.

All these  threats\r\n\r\nand  intimidation  are  the usual  tactics  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  If  it did not feel that a Barisan  victory\r\n\r\nwas  possible,  then  why did  it  resort  to  such\r\n\r\nthreats  and intimidation? The Prime Minister  even\r\n\r\nwent  to the extent of simply making statements  at\r\n\r\nrandom  to the effect that Federation troops  would\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore because he himself did not enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of the Federation Government.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the tactic he adopted to intimidate the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  but  we must  see  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation says with regard to this\r\n\r\nmatter.

When we come to an open argument with\r\n\r\nthem,  they say that we are irrelevant and that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not talk. What is this? This line  of  open\r\n\r\nargument  is  not reserved for the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nalone.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will  do  my  best  to\r\n\r\nexplain  things in the shortest possible time.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are matters which have been referred  to  by\r\n\r\nthe  Party  in  power in connection with  the  open\r\n\r\nargument. So I wish to make my reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying just now that if Tunku Abdul Rahman\r\n\r\nhad really endorsed the views of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  then  he would  not  have  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  the eve of the election  and  denied\r\n\r\nwhat the Prime Minister of Singapore had said. This\r\n\r\ngoes  to show that the calculation of Dr Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh was correct. It was because the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwas  afraid of a possible Barisan victory  that  he\r\n\r\nresorted   to   tactics   such   as   threats   and\r\n\r\nintimidation and said that. We wanted to merge with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  We  must  come to  an  open  debate  as\r\n\r\ngentlemen, but did the P.A.P. do so? They did  not.\r\n\r\nThey resorted to cheating, deceit and threats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am opposed to the intention of electing Members\r\n\r\nto  the House of Representatives from this Assembly\r\n\r\nin  proportion to the representation in this House.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  put forward by the P.A.P.  Members  is\r\n\r\nthat  another election would cost some more public\r\n\r\nfunds. This is again another way of deception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  all  know  that the last general  election  was\r\n\r\nconducted  in a most unusual manner and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to repeat the facts relating thereto.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave the right to demand the Party in power to  put\r\n\r\nthis  matter of the election of representatives  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Parliament to  the  people  again.  I\r\n\r\nremember that soon after the general elections, the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister in his victory speech said that  the\r\n\r\npeople  were for the P.A.P. Since it has been  said\r\n\r\nthat the people are supporting the P.A.P., then how\r\n\r\nis it that the P.A.P. do not have the guts to allow\r\n\r\nthe people to elect representatives to the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives? [Interruption in Mandarin] We have\r\n\r\nalready  explained  that as far  as  the  money  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, this is not important because the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  very good in wasting public money. It makes use\r\n\r\nof  the  Work  Brigade for its own ends.  It  talks\r\n\r\nabout  the rural development plan. Has it done  so?\r\n\r\nIt  talks about the construction of roads, bridges,\r\n\r\nand so on. Has it done so? It sent some members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade to tear off the posters  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. This is the  way  in  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has wasted public funds. We do not oppose in\r\n\r\nprinciple the construction of community centres but\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is making use of these centres as Party\r\n\r\nbranches. Now is this not a waste of public  funds?\r\n\r\nInsofar as the interest of the P.A.P. is concerned,\r\n\r\npublic  funds can be wasted. Now if such funds  can\r\n\r\nbe  wasted  in  this  manner, then  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should be given an opportunity  to  elect\r\n\r\ndirectly  Members  to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIf  the  P.A.P. is prepared to spend a few  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand dollars on this election, then there would\r\n\r\nnot  be  any grumble or complaint from the  people.\r\n\r\nThe  amount of money involved is not very great and\r\n\r\nthe  people will not grudge such an amount of money\r\n\r\nspent.

Seeing new Members and new\r\n\r\nfaces in this Assembly, I believe surely they would\r\n\r\ngive  new  opinions and arguments. But  it  appears\r\n\r\nthat  their arguments are not different.

I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  have  given  enough\r\n\r\nopportunity  to them to carry out secret  campaigns\r\n\r\nand they had entered the rural areas every week  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  people. We  have  also  given  them\r\n\r\nsufficient  opportunities without binding  them  in\r\n\r\nany  way  and without shutting the mouths of  their\r\n\r\nsupporters.  We  know  that  the  Rural   Dwellers'\r\n\r\nAssociation and also a large number of trade unions\r\n\r\nsupported them and we did not interfere with  their\r\n\r\ncampaign.  We allowed the Barisan to  use  them  so\r\n\r\nthat they could have the opportunity to contest the\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary get\r\n\r\non  with the matter under discussion and leave  the\r\n\r\nelection  alone?  Otherwise we are  going  to  have\r\n\r\nreplies  from  the  other side. He  should  try  to\r\n\r\nconfine himself to the Bill under discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have said\r\n\r\njust  now  that I have no wish to talk  about  this\r\n\r\nmatter. But three or four Members in the Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  talked about it. I see that only one of  them\r\n\r\nis  an  old Member and the rest are new. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for me to offer an explanation  so\r\n\r\nthat we will know the real situation, that is, what\r\n\r\ntook  place in this Assembly before they come here.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Member for Hong Lim at one\r\n\r\ntime  said  that the P.A.P.'s struggle in  politics\r\n\r\nwould come to an end. But it would appear that only\r\n\r\nhe  himself managed to come in and the rest of  his\r\n\r\nParty  had vanished. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  difference  about this matter.  It  was  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  last Government that  if  we  were\r\n\r\nelected  we  would  not have another  election  for\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament. It means\r\n\r\nthat  we  have obtained a mandate from the  people.\r\n\r\nArguments  have been put forward but they  have  no\r\n\r\nvalidity.  I  feel  that is  enough.  We  have  now\r\n\r\nobtained a mandate from the people not only to  sit\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly but also to elect Members of this\r\n\r\nAssembly to sit in the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish\r\n\r\nto   remind  the  Opposition  that  this  House  is\r\n\r\ndebating  a Bill in respect of the election  of  15\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   the   Federal  Parliament  and  not  a  matter\r\n\r\nconcerning  the past general election.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  the  past, and it is  useless  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to cry over spilt milk. I  quite  agree\r\n\r\nthat  a number of Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen here\r\n\r\nwere  not Members of the last Assembly. However,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they were aware of the Bill in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  election of Members to the Federal  Parliament\r\n\r\nwhich the former Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Ong\r\n\r\nPang Boon, introduced. For no rhyme or reason,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis combined with the U.P.P. and  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  to  block  its  passage.  That   was   an\r\n\r\nindication  that  these people  did  not  want  the\r\n\r\nelection.  Now I do not know for what  reason  they\r\n\r\noppose this Bill in respect of the election  of  15\r\n\r\nMembers  to  the  Central Parliament.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,   instead  of  debating  its  merits   or\r\n\r\ndemerits,  were pleased to go on talking about  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  election.  I  would  like  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members that if they are going  to  win\r\n\r\nthe  next  general election, they had  better  work\r\n\r\nharder  than the P.A.P., but do not work  hard  for\r\n\r\ntheir foreign masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  since  this  morning  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Assemblymen have spoken and their  common\r\n\r\npoint  is  to stress that the last general election\r\n\r\nwas undemocratic. The Member for Jurong did not say\r\n\r\nwhy it was not democratic. I would like to ask him\r\n\r\nwhether  the Assemblymen here were elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople directly, if popular elections had been  one\r\n\r\nof  the principles of the Barisan Sosialis. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask them this question. If they say  that\r\n\r\nthe  election of 15 representatives from this House\r\n\r\nis  undemocratic,  then I would like  to  ask  them\r\n\r\nthis.  Will the wishes of the people change in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of just one month? This only shows that they\r\n\r\nare  only  arguing  for the sake of  argument.  The\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  recent State general  election  is\r\n\r\nconcrete  proof of the people's wishes. Before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  election the Barisan Sosialis were  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  result of the general election would  be\r\n\r\nthe judgment of the people. But things did not turn\r\n\r\nout the way they had hoped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor.  The  P.A.P. did not perish. Instead,  certain\r\n\r\nRight-wing  opportunist Parties were  crushed.  Why\r\n\r\ndid  the  P.A.P. win this general election?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has done many things. There  has  been\r\n\r\ngreat  progress in Singapore. There have been  all-round  achievements. The greatest merit is that  we\r\n\r\nhave secured a merger with Malaya to form Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why the people have wholeheartedly  voted\r\n\r\nfor  us  and  returned  us to  office.  As  to  the\r\n\r\nelection of 15 representatives to the Federal House\r\n\r\nof  Representatives, we are of the opinion that  by\r\n\r\nelecting these representatives from this House,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  saving  public money. Before  the  recent\r\n\r\ngeneral  election, the Prime Minister already  told\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore about our intention to  do\r\n\r\nso. At that time, Members of the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\ndid not say anything against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nsaid  that the P.A.P. is most clever in squandering\r\n\r\npublic funds. If that were true, then I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask:  From  where did Singapore  get  the  $400\r\n\r\nmillion surplus in the four and a half years of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  term  of office? It is the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government to call the Barisan's bluff  and\r\n\r\ntell the people not to be deceived by them. Had  we\r\n\r\nbeen  deceiving  the  people, we  would  have  been\r\n\r\ndefeated.  The most important thing is to  let  the\r\n\r\npeople  know  what we have been doing and  disclose\r\n\r\nthe  whole truth to the people. This does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat it is the P.A.P.'s threat to the people --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

We have had our fill of  it  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  two and a half years. I had only a faint hope\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps the lesson of the last two and a half\r\n\r\nyears  would  have dawned in all its  vividness  on\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite. However, that is not to be,  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  resigned to this constant plugging of  the\r\n\r\nbig  lie. They did not want the 15 seats. Now  they\r\n\r\nsay they want the 15 seats. We offered them the  15\r\n\r\nseats.   They  refused.  Now  they   say   we   are\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  But I do not believe the  memory  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore is that  short  or  that\r\n\r\ndefective.  Members  on  the  other  side  do   not\r\n\r\nrecognise that. With that last Assembly which ended\r\n\r\nin  July,  it was the end of an era. We meet  today\r\n\r\nunder different circumstances. I no longer hold the\r\n\r\ngun.  The gun is in Kuala Lumpur. I do not have  to\r\n\r\nbe  a contestant with the gun. The referee has  the\r\n\r\ngun.  Therefore, the fight between  us  is  one  on\r\n\r\ndebate,  peaceful  persuasion  and,  if  they   are\r\n\r\nfoolish   enough   to  resort  to  unconstitutional\r\n\r\nmethods, they face the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have called for a copy of the papers this\r\n\r\nmorning because it is interesting to note that they\r\n\r\nnow   say  they  will  defend  the  integrity   and\r\n\r\nsovereignty of the nation and they have  all  taken\r\n\r\ntheir oath to defend Malaysia which they have sworn\r\n\r\npreviously  to  destroy. They should realise,  when\r\n\r\nthey  took that oath, however light-heartedly  they\r\n\r\nmay  have done so, that it means that the authority\r\n\r\nof the State will bear down upon them like a ton of\r\n\r\nbricks  if  they  try to destroy  Malaysia.  It  is\r\n\r\ntreachery  and  treason. In  many  other  Socialist\r\n\r\ncountries  - 15  Socialist countries  in  the  world\r\n\r\n- they line them up against the wall and shoot  them\r\n\r\nat  dawn  without any ceremony at all. But in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  they  are fed and clothed,  all  free  of\r\n\r\ncharge at public expense. I seriously urge them  to\r\n\r\nrethink and reappraise their position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Assembly is no longer the arena for\r\n\r\ndogfights. I hope that with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend of this debate and in our next session we go on\r\n\r\nto the constructive things over which the State has\r\n\r\nauthority.  Defence,  security,  foreign   affairs,\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  denouncing, troops  being  sent  to\r\n\r\nBorneo  or Sarawak - all that goes to Kuala  Lumpur.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  not  running away from  it.  We  look\r\n\r\nforward to meeting them and their counterparts from\r\n\r\nPenang and from other parts of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to congratulate them today on\r\n\r\nshowing more intelligence than the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  in  wanting  to  redeem  themselves  from   an\r\n\r\nuntenable position. The Member for Hong  Lim  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  out  of his depth now.  At  least  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis realises that if you go  on  just\r\n\r\ndenouncing Malaysia, you are going down the  drain.\r\n\r\nThe   Member  for  Hong  Lim  has  not  taken   the\r\n\r\nprecaution   of  redeeming  himself;  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis has. But mind you, Sir, the qualifications\r\n\r\non  their loyalty are so enormous and multi-farious\r\n\r\nthat one doubts whether in fact their intention  is\r\n\r\nto   be  loyal  at  all  to  the  country  and  its\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in whose name - the name of  democracy,\r\n\r\ndemocratic privileges - they are seeking to  destroy\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we had lost the election, if it were a\r\n\r\nfree-for-all, that would have been the  last.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the  reason  why we held the  elections  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Day, so that even if we had  lost,  there\r\n\r\nwould  have been further elections. And we  offered\r\n\r\nthem,  Mr Speaker, Sir, an opportunity which  they\r\n\r\nwould otherwise never have got. I do not expect  to\r\n\r\nreceive  gratitude for it. I did not do it  because\r\n\r\nit  was  in their interests. But at least  I  would\r\n\r\nhave thought they would have realised that here was\r\n\r\nthe  last  chance  to prove this  boast  about  the\r\n\r\nmasses.  There  were  no  masses  on  the  21st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember.  That is the plain, brutal fact  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  Everything thrown in, every communal  pull\r\n\r\nsentiment  thrown into the kitty. It could  not  be\r\n\r\ndone and never will again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to wind up for the record; what I\r\n\r\nsaid, what they heard me say over the wireless  and\r\n\r\nover  television  on the evening  of  the  11th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I quote from my broadcast?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The next reason (for calling for elections\r\n\r\nimmediately)  is  that the Opposition  Parties  had\r\n\r\nblocked our Bill for the election of 15 Members  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the Federal Parliament. We must  have\r\n\r\nthe  15  Members  to  represent  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament  in Kuala  Lumpur  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  It is our intention that these elections\r\n\r\nfor  the 51 seats will also decide the 15 seats for\r\n\r\nParliament  in Kuala Lumpur, for we  shall  pass  a\r\n\r\nBill for the election of the 15 Members from the 51\r\n\r\nMembers you are now electing in proportion  to  the\r\n\r\nParty  representation as shown by  the  results  of\r\n\r\nthis  election.  Every general election  costs  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  about  three-quarters  of   a   million\r\n\r\ndollars, money of the taxpayer which could be  more\r\n\r\nusefully spent on constructive projects. Now it  is\r\n\r\nup  to  you (meaning the people) to elect the  next\r\n\r\ngovernment of Singapore and at the same time decide\r\n\r\nwho   will  represent  Singapore  in  the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament in Kuala Lumpur; who will stand  up  and\r\n\r\nspeak for Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can be more simple, nothing can be more\r\n\r\nclear,  and nothing could have been more  decisive.\r\n\r\nAs  my  colleague the Minister for Labour has said,\r\n\r\nwe  gave  them an opportunity - 15 seats.  For  very\r\n\r\nunwise reasons, they ganged up with the opportunist\r\n\r\nRight  and  blocked  it. The  Right  had  different\r\n\r\nreasons.  The  Right  was planning  their  complete\r\n\r\ndestruction and extinction before the elections. We\r\n\r\nwanted  them  to be destroyed, not  in  a  physical\r\n\r\naction,  but in the hearts and minds of the people,\r\n\r\nand   that  was  what  happened  on  the  21st   of\r\n\r\nSeptember. Never mind the traitors who went to gaol\r\n\r\non  the  1st  of  February;  people  who  by  their\r\n\r\nactivities brought about confrontation; people  who\r\n\r\nencouraged the anti-Malaysia line, that  today  has\r\n\r\nbrought  about  a  situation in which  we  and  our\r\n\r\nneighbours have broken all diplomatic ties.  If  we\r\n\r\nhad waited till after the 16th of September for the\r\n\r\nelections, maybe the Member for Thomson may not  be\r\n\r\nhere. I do not expect him to thank us, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, because I did not do it for him. I did it  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We can well look after him here  or  in\r\n\r\nthe Federal Parliament - word for word, argument for\r\n\r\nargument,  in any language he chooses; in  Mandarin\r\n\r\nif  he  wishes,  in English, in Malay  or  even  in\r\n\r\nTamil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also for the record, may I just refer to Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 21, No. 2, Thursday, 25th July, 1963, when the\r\n\r\nvote  was  taken  on the Bill intituled  \"Singapore\r\n\r\n(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives)\r\n\r\nBill. The final division - 23-23; 4 paired - and all\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  lined up, including  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu. We welcome him back as one of the  old\r\n\r\nones who knew what happened. Those are halcyon days\r\n\r\ngone.  He  voted against it. Now he says  he  wants\r\n\r\nanother  try. No. If they are prepared  to  put  up\r\n\r\n$750,000 and pay for the cost of removing  all  the\r\n\r\nwretched  posters  that they put  up  illegally  in\r\n\r\nexcess of the numbers allowed them and all the mess\r\n\r\nthey  made of the City in 18 days, running  around,\r\n\r\ncampaigning  they started their campaign  from  the\r\n\r\nday we issued the writ; they know that we knew that\r\n\r\n- then  I say we can have another show. Let us  have\r\n\r\nanother   runaround.  Not  this  defeat;  this   is\r\n\r\nfinished and closed. There can be other issues. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  could  have a referendum  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  pro-Communist Parties  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  continue  or whether  they  should  be\r\n\r\nclosed down. Then they could run around. Once more,\r\n\r\nwe allow their mass meetings. I say that that is an\r\n\r\noffer  I make. Let them ponder on these things.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  prepared to pay for  it,  we  are  quite\r\n\r\nprepared to meet the verdict of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He  has  got to make up  his  mind.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  is a more intelligent outfit. It has  more\r\n\r\nI.Q.,  more brains. I am not saying that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim is not a very intelligent  chap.  He\r\n\r\nreads  The Three Kingdoms backwards from  cover  to\r\n\r\ncover,  but  he  has to learn how to  analyse.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  have  analysed that if  they  continue  to\r\n\r\noppose  Malaysia, there is only one conclusion  - up\r\n\r\nagainst  the  pillar!

Then they go back again - \"serving\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  imperialists and  colonialists\".\r\n\r\nThis is all gone. Nobody believes all this. Let  me\r\n\r\ntell them that we are here to serve the interest of\r\n\r\nthe people and that we have the great advantage  of\r\n\r\nno  longer being the referee with the gun.  We  are\r\n\r\njust a contestant. The referee is somebody else. He\r\n\r\nhas  the gun. Anybody who breaks the rules gets it.\r\n\r\nThey  wind  up  by  saying,  \"Our  loyalty  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry\".  I do not know whether they mean  loyalty\r\n\r\nincludes  loyalty to Sarawak and  Sabah  - also  our\r\n\r\ncountry;  or  whether  they mean,  like  the  other\r\n\r\nstatement  issued  by  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,   only\r\n\r\nMalayan. \"...does not mean loyalty to the party  in\r\n\r\npower.\"  What  does it mean?

Do they suggest that in the Soviet Union\r\n\r\nor in all the great socialist countries anybody can\r\n\r\nstand  up in the House of Representatives in Moscow\r\n\r\nand say, \"I am loyal to Russia but not to the party\r\n\r\nin  power.\"?  I would like to see what  happens  to\r\n\r\nthat gentleman. What are we talking about? \"We  are\r\n\r\ndenied  the  freedom of speech.\"  All  this  drivel\r\n\r\nbeing  published. Sedition, that  is  what  it  is;\r\n\r\nspreading   disaffection,   disloyalty    to    the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and constitutional authority.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  is time enough for us to meet again in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur and we shall pick up the argument from there\r\n\r\n- security,    defence,    foreign    affairs    and\r\n\r\nconfrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let them always remember this - that they have\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  the unemployment of  about  10,000\r\n\r\npeople  at the moment. It may become 20,000, 25,000\r\n\r\nat the end of one year. But they encouraged certain\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries into believing that Malaysia\r\n\r\ncould  be  stopped. They led the  agitation  inside\r\n\r\nSingapore  linked up with the S.U.P.P. of  Sarawak.\r\n\r\nThey are the chaps who agitated all this. They are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  who encouraged Azahari, who  lined  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  Filipinos,  finally  brought  about  the\r\n\r\nrevolt  - armed  insurrection  - and  landed  up   in\r\n\r\nJakarta. They encouraged others to believe that  it\r\n\r\nwas  possible  to  stop Malaysia via  fifth  column\r\n\r\nelements  in  our midst. The Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nencouraged    it   - \"Down   with   Malaysia!    Neo\r\n\r\ncolonialism!\"  As  a  result, foreign  powers  took\r\n\r\nheart and finally found themselves in a position of\r\n\r\nconfrontation ending up with a break  in  ties.  If\r\n\r\nall of us had remained solidly united, whatever our\r\n\r\nideological  and  political  differences,  for  the\r\n\r\nsurvival of the people, the nation and the country,\r\n\r\nforeign  elements might have not made this  mistake\r\n\r\nof believing that Malaysia could be stopped. It was\r\n\r\nbecause  they  believed that it  could  be  stopped\r\n\r\nthrough the use of traitors in our midst that today\r\n\r\nthe  situation  has  come about.  I  say  that  the\r\n\r\nhardship that has befallen those connected  in  the\r\n\r\nentrepot   trade  with  Indonesia  can  be   traced\r\n\r\nsquarely   back   to  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   the\r\n\r\nS.U.P.P.,  the United People's Party of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim and even some absent Members in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  like the former Member for Anson.  They  are\r\n\r\nthe  gentlemen who led themselves into this  facade\r\n\r\nof  democratic opposition to Malaysia that made the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  and  the Filipinos  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  team can go down  to  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nBorneo  and  give a verdict against  Malaysia.  Why\r\n\r\nnot? They went to the United Nations - the President\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis and the former Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson. They led themselves to this. My last parting\r\n\r\nword  of  advice  to them is, \"Please  desist  from\r\n\r\nfurther  stupidities.\" Enough calamity has befallen\r\n\r\nthem and befallen about 10,000 workers. We have  to\r\n\r\nretrieve the position and pay out from our  savings\r\n\r\nin  conjunction  with enlightened employers  paying\r\n\r\nout one-third, but it cannot go on indefinitely. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  find  alternatives. If  they  start  more\r\n\r\ntrouble in the unions and factories close down,  or\r\n\r\nthey  try to make them close down and try to create\r\n\r\nmore  unemployment, then I say that this time  they\r\n\r\nought  to rethink the position, read the law  book.\r\n\r\nThey always say that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to  work constitutionally, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  they inevitably wind up by calling a political\r\n\r\nstrike  to  paralyse the country.

On the basis  of  the  37\r\n\r\nseats which the P.A.P. have acquired, it is only 72\r\n\r\nper  cent out of a total of 51 seats in this House.\r\n\r\nIf  they  were to elect representatives, then  they\r\n\r\ncould only he entitled to 10.8 representatives, and\r\n\r\nthe    Barisan    Sosialis    should    have    3.8\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  This is why we should  have  this\r\n\r\namendment to this effect. It is based on  fair  and\r\n\r\njust  principles, and not like the P.A.P.'s  unfair\r\n\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been proposed, as the first\r\n\r\namendment to clause 4 (1), in page 2, line  18,  to\r\n\r\nleave   out  \"elected  from  the  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly\" and insert \"nominated by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party and the Barisan Sosialis\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the\r\n\r\nproblems  which confront hon. Members on the  other\r\n\r\nside  of the House is the illogical nature of their\r\n\r\nstand,  the  constant contradiction of stand  being\r\n\r\naltered on one argument to another, cancelling each\r\n\r\nother  out. They were given 15 seats through direct\r\n\r\nelections. They said no. They wanted 51. We gave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  51,  and, at the same time, said that  if  we\r\n\r\nwon,  15 would be chosen from the Assembly. It  was\r\n\r\nclearly stated. I read the excerpt. It is on  radio\r\n\r\ntape  and  also on magnetic tape. Even if they  had\r\n\r\nprotested, by the election results we have a  clear\r\n\r\nmandate. That is the first democratic principle, if\r\n\r\nthey believe in democracy and democratic principles\r\n\r\nand  majority  will. But far from protesting,  they\r\n\r\nacquiesced  in it in the hope, as my colleague  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  that  they would  have  a  landslide\r\n\r\nvictory  and then they would take all the  15.  Now\r\n\r\nthe  unfortunate event has taken place, and we have\r\n\r\nbeen  generous enough to give them three  seats.  I\r\n\r\nhave told them just now, Mr Speaker, that in Sabah\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak the winners take all. All the 40 seats\r\n\r\ngo  to  the Alliance. They will miss their  friends\r\n\r\nfrom the S.U.P.P. in Sarawak because they have  not\r\n\r\neven found themselves in sufficient numbers to  get\r\n\r\ninto  the Council Negri, let alone Parliament. Many\r\n\r\nof  them have crossed over the border to help those\r\n\r\nwho  are confronting us. Their friends. Again  they\r\n\r\nare responsible for our trials and tribulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must reject this as hypocritical and\r\n\r\ndeceitful.  First they say we are  not  democratic.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to go back to the people. Here  are  51\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people.  Three  regrettably\r\n\r\nare  absent - force majeure. But the other two  have\r\n\r\nwillingly absented themselves. Now I do not want to\r\n\r\npress  this  point. But if we start calculating  on\r\n\r\nthe abacus, 8 to 37, - five on the Front benches and\r\n\r\nthree on the Back benches - 8 to 37, we will wind up\r\n\r\nby  getting 13 to 2. And again I think it would  be\r\n\r\nwrong because it is in the interest of Malaysia -10\r\n\r\nmillion  people - to know that there are such  human\r\n\r\nbeings amongst us, to hear them and see them in the\r\n\r\nflesh in Kuala Lumpur. Mind you, it may not be that\r\n\r\nthey  can always go there for five years. One never\r\n\r\nknows  how  these things develop! But I  will  give\r\n\r\nthem  this one assurance. I know they have  another\r\n\r\nfear,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  if  we  elect  them\r\n\r\ninstead  of nominate them, then we might not  elect\r\n\r\nthe  most experienced of all their Assemblymen. The\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu is a man of great experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  has  been through it all. I can assure  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  that  we  have no intention  of  electing\r\n\r\ntheir  three stupidest chaps. In fact, if  we  have\r\n\r\nany  say  in  the matter at all, we want  to  elect\r\n\r\ntheir   three  most  intelligent  and  their  three\r\n\r\nfiercest revolutionaries to carry the red  flag  to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur. But in the name of democracy, we have\r\n\r\ndecided that we will leave it to them to decide, as\r\n\r\nI  have  said at the opening. Whether they want  to\r\n\r\nchoose the three stupidest fellows, most amiable to\r\n\r\ndrink brandy and beer with and wine in Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nat  the  bar and make friends and slowly  insinuate\r\n\r\ntheir  way  among the Alliance friends and  capture\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance Party, or whether they want  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  three  fiercest chaps to scare everybody  so\r\n\r\nthat  power will drop from the Alliance grasp, they\r\n\r\nsuddenly stricken down with fear, they decide.  But\r\n\r\nlet  us  have  none of this hypocrisy of  not  only\r\n\r\nhaving  51 to choose from, but also wanting to  get\r\n\r\nin  by the back door. By this clause, they now wish\r\n\r\nto  nominate somebody who cannot even get a seat in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly! Just this morning we heard a lecture\r\n\r\non  democracy,  democratic rights,  freedom,  human\r\n\r\nliberty and how we terrorise them. And now we  have\r\n\r\nthe   unholy   spectacle  of  seeing  this   little\r\n\r\namendment being sneaked in whereby the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, who is not a Member of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  can  be  nominated. I  am  not  a  great\r\n\r\nsupporter of the democratic system in its  absolute\r\n\r\nand  prudish form. But this is carrying it too far.\r\n\r\nHad  they  only mentioned this to me, I would  have\r\n\r\nbrought  it  to  the  notice of my  colleagues  and\r\n\r\nperhaps   we   might   have  considered   him   for\r\n\r\nsenatorship and given him a voice in Kuala  Lumpur.\r\n\r\nEven now it is not too late. We might mention it to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Government. The Yang di-Pertuan  Agong\r\n\r\nhas powers. He has a few extra senatorships and the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  can  join  an\r\n\r\nhonourable  phalanx of men, but  not  through  this\r\n\r\nback  door. This Assembly is not the back  door  to\r\n\r\nthe Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalked  about  something very  far  away  from  the\r\n\r\ntopic.  We  have said that the P.A.P. is trying  to\r\n\r\nforce  through this Bill to elect 15  Members  from\r\n\r\nthis  House  to the Central Parliament. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  its  Prime  Minister talk about  fairness  and\r\n\r\njustice.  We say it is unjust and unfair, but  they\r\n\r\nsay we were given a chance and all that. If you  go\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  simple  arithmetic  learnt   by\r\n\r\nprimary students, from 51 Members of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nif  one is to get 15 Members, then we will get 3.4.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, 3.4 persons will be  entitled  to\r\n\r\nelect one Central Parliament representative. If you\r\n\r\ndivide  37  by 3.4. then you will get 10.8  as  the\r\n\r\nanswer. I think my arithmetic is still quite sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of the 13 Barisan Members, we will say that\r\n\r\nif  this  figure of 13 is to be divided  3.8.  then\r\n\r\nwhere  is  the  .5 going to? Is it  to  be  carried\r\n\r\nforward  or just to he left out? We ask the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. knows full well. The  Assemblymen  are\r\n\r\nelected by the people. Now, if the P.A.P. says that\r\n\r\nthese   elected   Members  are  pro-Communists   or\r\n\r\nCommunists  or  anti-nationalists, then  why  allow\r\n\r\nthese  people  to  stand for election?  Why  arrest\r\n\r\nthese  people after the election? It is because  of\r\n\r\ntheir victory. If they were defeated, then there is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  say. Because they are  victorious,  so\r\n\r\nthey  must put them behind bars. Is that democracy?\r\n\r\nIf  the three leaders of the unions happened to  be\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. and happened to be leading  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions,  like  our friend, Mr Devan Nair,  leading\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C., then we say that these three leaders\r\n\r\ncould  have been appointed representatives  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will try to cut short\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am  going to say  with  respect  to\r\n\r\nfairness  and  justice.

If he wants to be fair\r\n\r\nand  just  and  wants  to  play  the  game  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  way, then let these representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  people  be given a chance  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament to express  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in their capacity as representatives. If  he\r\n\r\nagrees, then we will show by facts in the next five\r\n\r\nyears.  Let  them show by deeds in  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears  that we are wrong and let them prove in  the\r\n\r\nnext five years whether they have been doing things\r\n\r\nin a fair and just manner. But the people have been\r\n\r\ngiven  the impression by the P.A.P. that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  so,  because,  in the first place,  the  three\r\n\r\nMembers of the Barisan Sosialis have been arrested;\r\n\r\nthe reason is that they were agitating for strikes.\r\n\r\nNow,  where  is our autonomy in labour?  They  talk\r\n\r\nabout  autonomy  in  labour. The anti-P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunions  have  grievances against the  P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunions.  That  is  why there were strikes.  But  he\r\n\r\ncomes to arrest them. Why? How is it that no member\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. has ever stood up to say that we have\r\n\r\nlabour  autonomy  and it is wrong for  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  arrest  the leaders  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  belonging to the Opposition? I  am  talking\r\n\r\nfor  you.  I am not talking for us. We are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  a  constitutional and peaceful struggle.  If\r\n\r\nthat is so, then the people can very clearly indeed\r\n\r\nsee  for themselves that the arrests of these three\r\n\r\nleaders  of the Barisan Sosialis were done  by  the\r\n\r\nAlliance in order to save the P.A.P. If the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndo not admit this, then they should come out with a\r\n\r\nstatement that they are no longer interested  in  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional and peaceful struggle.  They  should\r\n\r\ncome  out  and  say that under our constitution  we\r\n\r\nhave  autonomy  in  the field of  labour  and  they\r\n\r\nshould not arrest these trade unionists. I hope the\r\n\r\nMembers of the Party in power should know this.  If\r\n\r\nthey do not know, they should return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the two Assemblymen, it is said\r\n\r\nthat  the  police want to contact  them  about  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of Communist activities. All this  is\r\n\r\nhumbug. If the purpose is just to arrest them, can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. say that because they are now Left  and\r\n\r\nno  longer  here and there are only  eight  of  our\r\n\r\nMembers  here? We still have 13; no matter  whether\r\n\r\nyou  say 13 is unlucky. We still have 3.8.  We  are\r\n\r\nstill  entitled to 3.8 representatives. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  only entitled to 10.8. which can mean  11.  On\r\n\r\nour  side  3.8 can also be equal to four.  Then  we\r\n\r\nshould  be entitled to four representatives and  if\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. are sincere, then they should accept our\r\n\r\nsuggestion - from our side four and from them 11. If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  because of the fact  that  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  proposed 12, find it difficult to  retract\r\n\r\nafter wanting to force through the Bill, then  they\r\n\r\nhave to look after their own business. But, on  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  I  would say that they should act fair  and\r\n\r\njust  according to strict calculations.  Even  when\r\n\r\nthey  have 11 and we have four, they are  still  in\r\n\r\nthe    majority.   That   is   according   to   the\r\n\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jek Yuen Thong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  did not intend to say anything more  about\r\n\r\nit,  but  because of the persistence of the Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers,  I would like to say a few words on  these\r\n\r\namendments. I am very sympathetic towards  them.  I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with  their pains in introducing  these\r\n\r\namendments.  Just look at them! You  can  see  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  only a few of them. Some of  them  have\r\n\r\nbeen arrested, some have disappeared, some have not\r\n\r\nbeen  elected, and some are not here. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey  propose this new figure and that is why  they\r\n\r\nstrike  a compromise, making a suggestion to enable\r\n\r\ncertain   of   their  members   who   have   either\r\n\r\ndisappeared   or   not   elected   to   be    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in the Central Parliament.  But  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  that if these people are not elected  by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore to be Assemblymen in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,    then    they    cannot    be    appointed\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. If they want to elect\r\n\r\nanyone outside this House to be a representative of\r\n\r\nthe  people to the Central Parliament, then  I  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is a representative of the people  and\r\n\r\ncan become a Federal representative as well. If  he\r\n\r\nhas no qualifications and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot represent Singapore, then he should not be a\r\n\r\nrepresentative    in   the   Federal    House    of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives.    As    to    the    number    of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, why should they argue about  this?\r\n\r\nThey  should  admit their defeat. Why  should  they\r\n\r\nhaggle  over  these figures? They say we  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen democratic and do not act democratically.  But\r\n\r\nI  would ask whether their way is democratic. Those\r\n\r\npeople have not been elected by the people and  yet\r\n\r\nthey want them to be representatives in the Federal\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representatives. This sort of bargaining\r\n\r\nis really cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about their arguments of percentage and\r\n\r\ndecimal points and round figures, perhaps they  are\r\n\r\nquite  good in science and mathematics, but I think\r\n\r\nperhaps  they  have been calculated for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime  by  Dr  Tan  Chee Koon who  belongs  to  the\r\n\r\nSocialist  Front in the Federation. Is  it  because\r\n\r\nthe  present  Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\ndisappeared from this House that they have to  have\r\n\r\nDr  Tan Chee Koon from the Socialist Front in  the\r\n\r\nFederation    to    calculate   for    them?    If\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who are not Members  of  the  House\r\n\r\ncan  be  appointed  to be Federal  representatives,\r\n\r\nthen I cannot understand what democracy means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the Member for Queenstown has  said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Assemblymen here no  longer  need  to\r\n\r\nfollow our Party Chairman. But I would say that the\r\n\r\nMember need not worry about it. We are solidly with\r\n\r\nthe  rank and file of our Party. We will follow Dr\r\n\r\nLee's  leadership  and guidance  according  to  the\r\n\r\nparty  line  and  policy in  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we opposed Malaysia because the terms\r\n\r\nof   Malaysia  stipulated  that  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore could not become Malaysian citizens. This\r\n\r\nis  most  unreasonable. The  second  point  of  our\r\n\r\nopposition  to Malaysia is that we could  not  have\r\n\r\nequal  representation  to  the  Federal  House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives. That is why our Party in the  past\r\n\r\nopposed  Malaysia. I believe that in the Press  and\r\n\r\nin the records of Hansard, it is clearly stated why\r\n\r\nwe opposed Malaysia. It does not mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we are not loyal to Malaysia or to the people.\r\n\r\nAt  that  time we believed that Malaysia would  not\r\n\r\nbring about peace, prosperity and happiness to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and in their interests, we opposed it.  The\r\n\r\nMember has said that the P.A.P. were victorious  in\r\n\r\nthe  general election, but the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nknow  why  they were able to get 37 seats.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, they are very clear about the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ntactics   of   deceit   and   intimidation    which\r\n\r\ncontributed to their getting 37 seats. The election\r\n\r\nwas  conducted in an atmosphere of fear.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the P.A.P. were returned  to  power,\r\n\r\nsecuring 37 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just\r\n\r\ndraw  your  attention to a section of the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  relating  to  irrelevance  in  debate?

He\r\n\r\nseems  to  have  drifted  away  and  is  not   even\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the principle of the Bill. If  he  can,\r\n\r\nplease  concentrate on the proposed  amendments  to\r\n\r\nsub-clauses (1)  and (2)  of clause 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI mentioned those things because the P.A.P. thought\r\n\r\nthat  they  could, by their majority, suppress  our\r\n\r\narguments and speeches. For instance, when  Members\r\n\r\non this side of the House made their speeches, they\r\n\r\nwere interrupted by the P.A.P. Members. That is why\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to point out that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   should  be  given  a  fair  chance   to\r\n\r\nunderstand what is going on here about this Bill in\r\n\r\na  quiet  and  peaceful atmosphere. As  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMembers have spoken on certain matters, we have  no\r\n\r\nalternative  but to make our replies to  them.  Our\r\n\r\narguments  are based on these reasons. The  general\r\n\r\nelections   are   State  elections,   whereas   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to the Federal Parliament  are  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  the people of Singapore in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. According to the proportional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentation in this House, the P.A.P. cannot get\r\n\r\n12.

Whether there is\r\n\r\na  decimal  point  or not or a round  figure,  they\r\n\r\nshould  he  able  to understand simple  arithmetic.\r\n\r\nWhat  is their basis of calculation which will give\r\n\r\nthem  12 seats? Is it based on 37 seats or  on  the\r\n\r\ntotal  votes  cast? We just want to understand  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of their calculation which they claim  would\r\n\r\nentitle  them  to  12  seats.  According   to   our\r\n\r\ncalculation, we should be entitled to  four  seats.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  want to understand is, how  they  can  be\r\n\r\nentitled to 12? We insist on having four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have to admit that when I was\r\n\r\nin  school I was very poor in mathematics.

The beginning and\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the story of the Barisan Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nthat   they   want  more  seats  in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. So, why not be frank and say so? As the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has said, we are even  willing  to\r\n\r\nhold another election for 15 Members if the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are prepared to pay for the cost  of  the\r\n\r\nelection.  So,  why not he a hero  and  accept  the\r\n\r\nchallenge instead of touching on irrelevant matters\r\n\r\n- \"We calculate 3.8 and so on.\"? I advise them to do\r\n\r\nit  this way.
