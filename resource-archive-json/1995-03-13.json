The Ministry of Health accordingly built Yishun Medical Centre as a pilot project for the provision of primary health care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yishun Medical Centre was completed in September 1993 and the clinics leased to private practitioners in April 1994.

Currently, there are already 40 GP clinics and 15 dental clinics in Yishun New Town. So there is already adequate provision of primary health care in Yishun. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HI-TEK VEGETABLE FARMS PTE LTD</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Bankruptcy)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether his Ministry is aware that a company named Hi-Tek Vegetable Farms Pte Ltd, of which the Economic Development Board is one of the shareholders, has been declared bankrupt and that it is still owing a few employees their salaries and, if so, whether his Ministry has taken any action to assist these employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1991, eight ex-employees of the company Hi-Tek Vegetable Farms approached my Ministry for assistance to claim salary arrears against the company. As the company was in financial difficulties and was unable to make any payment, the case was referred for hearing at the Labour Court of my Ministry. The Labour Court ordered the company to pay a total of about $33,000 to the eight employees. Unfortunately, the company failed to comply with the order. We then advised and subsequently helped the workers to enforce the Labour Court Order against the company in the Subordinate Courts by way of a Writ of Seizure and Sale. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Writ of Seizure and Sale could be executed, the Subordinate Courts advised the claimants that the company had been placed under receivership by a secured creditor. Hence, the workers' claims for arrears of wages had to be taken up with the Receiver. Since this involved making claims against the Receiver, my Ministry requested the Legal Aid Bureau to provide legal assistance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the affected workers. The Legal Aid Bureau has since assigned the case to a legal firm for follow-up action on behalf of the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were informed that the company has been placed under liquidation on 3rd June 1994. That being the case, the workers' claim will be dealt with by the liquidator of the company in accordance with the priority spelt out under the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RECOVERY OF MONIES BY FOREIGN WORKERS FROM EMPLOYERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Guidelines for Immigration Department)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any directions or guidelines have been given to the Immigration Department on the position of foreign workers who have commenced proceedings in the courts against their employers to recover monies lawfully due to them from their employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, if a foreign worker is pursuing a civil suit of any nature in Singapore and his work permit meanwhile has expired or is cancelled, the Immigration Department could, at his request, place him on a Special Pass on a short-term basis. This is to enable him to make the necessary arrangements for the legal proceedings. Foreign workers cannot be allowed to stay in Singapore indefinitely for the purpose of pursuing their civil suits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Is the Minister aware of two cases by the names of Ranganathan Adaranti Vellar and Ramasamy Shanmugam for claims against their employer for arrears of wages which were withheld? The case was fixed for court hearing on 21st February 1995 but the Immigration Department deported the workers concerned on 10th February 1995. As a result, they could not proceed with their claims in the court. I think this is not fair to the workers concerned. What is the Minister's answer to that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the answer is really very simple. I have by coincidence looked up the two cases mentioned by Mr Low and by coincidence I have also discovered that these two persons were represented by Mr J B Jeyaretnam and Mr Jeyaretnam is the Secretary-General of the Workers Party. I think Mr Jeyaretnam knows full well of the circumstances why these foreign workers could not be allowed to stay in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These foreign workers had placed a claim against their employer with the Labour Ministry some time in October 1994. Eventually, they withdrew their claim and pursued a civil claim against the employer. From November to 10th February 1995, which was the last day given to them to settle their claim, they have almost three months to settle the claim. So when the Immigration Department told these workers they could remain here on short-term Special Passes they should really make full use of the time to settle the claim and, if they could not, they would have to go back. We have no choice but to ask them to go back because we cannot allow foreign workers to remain here indefinitely to pursue their civil claim. We do not know how long it will take the claim to be settled or if it can be settled at all. If the case drags on for a long time, does it mean that these workers will be here without jobs or maybe working illegally? In fact, according to what I know, the following is the case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's staff, in a sworn affidavit to the court, said that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These workers have not been in receipt of any income. They are unable to work in Singapore and have informed Mr Jeyaretnam that they are suffering extreme financial hardship, seeking accommodation with other workers who have come from India. They on their part are desirous of returning to India because of the difficulty they have here following the cancellation of their work permit.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, in the first place, these workers have no means to support or sustain themselves. Secondly, they want to go back. If they have no means to support or sustain themselves, then I do not think they should stay here. That does not mean that they cannot pursue their claim. They can always come back on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> date when the court decides to hear the case and pursue the claim. If they indeed have a good claim, then their counsel can ask for cost from the employer and the cost will pay for their stay here and for the air-fare back here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite fair to them that they should be asked to go back, otherwise Singapore will be saddled with many of these workers who are unable to work and indeed we have several hundred foreign workers or foreigners who have overstayed and worked illegally in Singapore. Every month, the Immigration Department, the Police and the Work Permit Department arrest several hundreds of them for overstaying or illegal entry. For those workers who are working here, if the employers are unable to carry on employing them and they cannot survive here on their own, then they should rightfully go back. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, my understanding is that the case was fixed for hearing on 21st February 1995 and the request was made to the Immigration Department to allow the workers to stay until the case was heard in court. It was for about 10 days in which the pass could be granted. Would the Minister consider, in future cases where the workers have a rightful claim of legal proceedings in court, allowing them to stay until the case is concluded provided their counsel undertakes to proceed with the case soonest possible? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am really disappointed that Mr Low has not been fully apprised of the facts of the case. He just told us that his understanding is that the hearing of the case was on 21st February 1995. From what I know, the hearing on 21st February was not a hearing of the merits of the case. It was a preliminary hearing, in other words, the lawyers and the company get together in court to fix a date for the trial. It is not a hearing. That is my first disappointment that he has not been informed of the correct facts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second disappointment is that Mr Low is pursuing a case of his party's boss. When his party's boss fails to take up a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> case like this or is unable to pursue a case for his client, he has made use of this Parliamentary proceeding to pursue his private interest. I am really disappointed with that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, if the counsel is the Secretary-General of the Workers Party, it does not mean that Mr Low has got any interest in the case. May I ask the Minister whether it is fair of him to mention that the counsel is the Secretary-General of a party in which Mr Low is a party member? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I concede that Mr Low does not have a pecuniary interest to declare. I concede that. But at the same time Mr Low knows, and I know, that this case was represented by Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Jeyaretnam is his party's boss. I think at least he should have the decency to tell us that this case was pursued by his party's boss who had failed with the Ministry of Home Affairs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I beg to differ with the Minister. In this particular case, he is merely asking a Question on behalf of two foreign workers. There is no indication that he is asking on behalf of Mr Jeyaretnam who is the Secretary-General of his party and therefore --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, what is your question? Can you ask your question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sorry. Is the Minister fair in mentioning all these background facts when, on the face of his Question, there is no connection whatsoever? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> In fact, I was not about to mention Mr Jeyaretnam until Mr Low mentioned the names of these two foreign workers. There is a direct connection. Mr Jeyaretnam is the counsel for these two persons that Mr Low mentioned, and that is a fact. I am only stating a fact that Mr Jeyaretnam is the Secretary-General of the party which Mr Low belongs. I think it is a very fair statement that people ought to know how this case came about. We are not talking about general policy. If we are talking \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> about general policy I would reply to him on a question of general policy and the general policy of the Immigration Department is, yes, we will give reasonable time to any foreign worker who has a dispute with his employer to pursue his civil claim. I think two or three months is a reasonable time. If the worker cannot support himself here, then I think he should go home first and his counsel can still pursue his claim here until he is able to come back again. Nobody is denied any right to pursue any claim, whether it is civil or whatever it is, so long as he can support himself here. If he cannot, and he has no means to support himself, then he cannot remain here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister unaware that it is specifically stated in the affidavit filed by the two workers that they are in financial difficulties and they are unable to come back to fight their case if they return home? That is why they have asked for an extension. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Chiam has missed my point. The extension up to 21st February does no good to the workers, because 21st February is only for fixing a date of hearing. If the hearing is fixed, say, for June, are we saying that they be allowed to remain until June and meanwhile they would be unemployed or employed illegally and become like those illegal workers whom we will arrest and be caned? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Would the Minister be so sure that the court would not give them an early date? How can he decide on behalf of the courts? They might give a date one week ahead for the hearing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Let me correct one remark. Illegal workers do not get caned. But if they are overstayers, they would be caned. I do not know whether the court would give them an early hearing or not. What Mr Chiam has said is purely speculation and I am also hypothesizing that if the court gives them a hearing date in June, what happens to the workers here in the meanwhile. So I think it is only fair that they go back first. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that foreign workers, who have also made a contribution to our economy, should not be prejudiced by the action or regulation of the Immigration Department to pursue a legal claim against their employers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No one is being prejudiced. I am not saying that they have no right to pursue a civil claim. They can, and they should if they have a rightful claim. But what I am saying is that after having given them a reasonable period to settle their claim and they cannot do so, and they cannot sustain themselves, then they should go home first. Meanwhile, when they get a hearing date, they can come back again. And when they succeed, they will be able to get all the costs from the employer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that, in the first place, these workers already have financial problems and they will not be able to come back to Singapore again to pursue their claims? So how does the case proceed in court if they are sent back? I suppose they cannot even afford an air ticket to come back again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No, as the Member said, the defence counsel or the lawyer can give an undertaking to bring these people back to pursue the claim and get the money for them if they succeed in their claim. It is not the responsibility of the Immigration Department to keep these people here. Neither is it our business to deny any foreign worker from pursuing any claim. We take a neutral position on this. But if he cannot live here because he has no money, then he will become an illegal worker and, worse still, he might commit a crime. What happens if he commits a crime whilst here? I have the responsibility in making sure that people who are here have a legitimate interest to remain here and I would not allow people who have no legitimate reason to remain here to stay here and eventually get into problems. I think it is in our interest to protect them by sending them back. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Point of clarification, Sir. Can Mr Low tell \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this House whether the two foreign workers concerned did personally approach him for assistance? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers concerned did not approach me personally for assistance. I am asking this Question for the purpose of clarification from the Minister concerned. As Singapore relies quite heavily on foreign workers, I think it is only fair that we should not in any way prejudice their cases. That is why I have asked the Question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two more supplementary questions, Sir. One is whether the Minister will consider allowing foreign workers, who have a case in court and their legal counsel has undertaken to proceed with the case soonest possible to fix a hearing date, to at least complete their case before they are being sent back? The Minister also mentioned just now that if the Immigration Department should grant them the Special Pass to stay here, they might commit crimes or become illegal workers. Does the Minister agree that we should not pre-empt or be prejudiced against these workers that they might commit crimes or work illegally the moment they remain in Singapore? I think it may not be a fair statement to make against foreign workers who are working here and who are making a contribution to our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, we will allow them to stay provided we know the date of hearing of the trial. But if it is only for setting a date for the trial, then we actually do not know how long that it is going to take. So we must be reasonable about this. I am not jumping into conclusion that every foreign worker who overstays or who works here and has a dispute with the employer will commit crime. No, I am not. But neither am I so sanguine as Mr Low that these workers will not get into trouble. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me disclose that in another case, represented by Mr Jeyaretnam, which concerned seven other Indian workers, the Immigration Department gave them Special Passes up to 9th March, or thereabout, to settle their case. During that process, one had already absconded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> What has happened to the absconded Indian worker? I do not know. He might have gone back, or he might have smuggled himself out. He might still be here. He might be working illegally. He might have committed a crime. So I cannot be so sanguine as Mr Low to presume that all foreign workers are of good behaviour. Neither am I saying that all foreign workers commit crimes. But here I have an instance where a worker, given a Special Pass to remain here to pursue a civil case, had absconded. No amount of undertaking by any counsel can ensure that his client will not get into trouble. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I know from the Minister whether, if a case is confirmed for hearing, the worker concerned will be allowed to stay in Singapore till the case is heard and completed? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We have to know when the hearing date is. If, for example, on 21st February, the hearing date is fixed for 1st May, I would be very reluctant to say that he can remain here for another three months and in the meanwhile he has nothing to feed himself. During this time what will happen to the foreign worker? Will the defence counsel say, \"I will feed him and I will ensure that he will not work illegally.\" I think that will be difficult. But if, on 21st February, the court has fixed the hearing for, say, 28th February, or 3rd March, or some reasonable period, yes, I will be very sympathetic. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Just a clarification from the Minister. The Minister has said that one of the nine foreign workers who sought legal help from Mr Jeyaretnam had absconded. Can the Minister tell this House how many workers had absconded who were not involved in any legal cases? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if the Minister is expected to keep such data in his head, I think there will be a lot of things for him to remember. But I remember this particular case because I checked it up. I asked why is there an interest in this case, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and it has come to my attention that there are indeed two such cases; one case with five workers, the other with seven workers, not nine, and one of whom had absconded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Minister not agree with me that those foreign workers who are not even involved in illegal cases have absconded? It is not fair for him to point out that just because Mr Jeyaretnam acted for one who had absconded and therefore the extension of time should not be allowed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Chiam hits the point correctly. Indeed there are workers who will abscond even when they are working legally and this is all the more reason for the Immigration Department to be very strict. It just proves my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I come back to this particular case which Mr Jeyaretnam is doing. The Minister says that on 21st February the court was supposed to fix a date for hearing and they were asked to leave Singapore 10 days before 21st February. Is his Ministry not being neutral? The Ministry should have at least waited until the result of the hearing on 21st February before making a decision because the court could, in fact, give a hearing date the next day. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I do not agree with Mr Chiam because the Immigration Department has been very patient. It has given these workers a lot of time. Since the last employment, they were allowed to remain here for three months. Three months is a reasonable period. \n  <br>12.55 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BILL INTRODUCED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MERCHANT SHIPPING BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to revise the law relating to Merchant Shipping and to repeal and re-enact with amendments the Merchant Shipping Act (Chapter 179 of the 1985 Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>recommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [1st March, 1995], \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1995 to 31st March, 1996.\" - [Minister for Finance]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit held a dialogue session on 7th March 1995. Let me summarize the main points raised in the session: (a) Most participants were happy with the personal income tax rebate, HDB rental and service and conservancy (S&amp;C) rebates and the CPF top-up; (b) There was no objection to the increase in water conservation tax, although it was suggested that the minimum 20 cubic metres of water consumption level should be adjusted according to the household size; (c) Representatives from the Chambers of Commerce and other business associations were disappointed because there was no cut in corporate tax rate and no tax incentive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The retail sector is facing some difficulties; (d) SMEs also requested for incentives and assistance from the Government, the suggestions ranged from training of sole proprietors to setting up of a research centre; (e) Most participants also realised the importance of training and retraining of workers; and (f) Other participants also expressed their concerns about the high expectation, including the expectation from the Minister for Finance, to hand out goodies every year in the Budget Statement, and stressed the importance to inculcate in young Singaporeans moral values. Sir, our GPC has met the resource panel. We will be raising some of these issues and other matters in this debate and in the Committee of Supply. Let me now focus on three main issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, business costs. The high expectation, particularly among businesses, was due to the excellent performance of our economy in the last two years, and another reason was that many also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expected 1995 to be an Election year. Apart from disappointment over no tax concessions, businesses are also concerned with the rising business cost. This is a more valid concern as a cut in corporate tax rate benefits only profitable companies whereas rising costs affect all businesses. While the unit labour cost for the whole economy rose by only 1.9% last year due to fairly strong labour productivity growth, other costs such as rent and the foreign workers levy continue to rise. The cut in property tax by 2% point is welcome, but businesses are concerned that the valuation of properties will be adjusted upwards. The Minister for Finance has urged landlords to share the tax savings with their tenants but businesses wonder whether JTC and HDB will do so. Sir, rising domestic costs will erode our economic competitiveness. May I ask the Minister: if the economy is over-heating, where are the coolants? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, water consumption. Among all tax changes, the increase in water conservation tax by 5 percentage points is most significant. This increase sends a signal to remind Singaporeans that water is precious. If Singaporeans do not make an effort to conserve water now, they will face even more painful measures in future. There were some concerns expressed about the impact of the increase in water conservation tax on low-income households, particularly those with more family members. I suggest that the Minister for Finance work out the additional tax burden of different households living in 1- to 5-room flats, based on the water consumption patterns of these households. I believe the additional tax burden of water conservation will be more than offset by the savings in personal income tax, HDB rental and S&amp;C rebates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have an amendment in the Committee of Supply on the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Minister for Trade and Industry may also want to give an analysis on water consumption by domestic users by different types of households and non-domestic users in terms of industries and activities over a period of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that MTI and PUB launch another public education campaign to encourage Singaporeans to conserve water. The previous public campaign was a success. Sir, you may recall the slogan \"Every Drop Counts\" and the cartoon character Bo-Bo. I think this slogan and the cartoon character are still vivid in the minds of those Singaporeans who are above 35 years old. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that PUB should give more information on the supply side of water, for example, the full capacity of the reservoirs, water work projects and the long-term plan to maintain water supply including desalination plant and its cost. This will help Singaporeans to have a better understanding of the current and future situations on the demand and supply of water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong was quoted as saying \"at the moment, there is really no danger of shortage of water as in the past. I think we have got the local reserves in place, and actually the alarm bells have not sounded yet.\" [The Straits Times, 2nd March 1995.] I am disappointed with Mr Chiam's reaction. I think he is wrong. He is learning the Chinese language. Perhaps he should learn two Chinese proverbs: wei yu chou mou [ ] and lin ke jue jing [ ]. Wei yu chou mou [ ] simply means `save for a rainy day'. And ling ke jue jing [] means `dig a well only when you are thirsty'. Water consumption is a national issue concerning all Singaporeans, now and the future. It also reflects our vulnerability. All Singaporeans should take this long-term issue seriously. I am glad that the Prime Minister chose to discuss this issue openly. Sometimes it is desirable for the Government to share its worries and concerns with our citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, long-term competitiveness. More important than tax changes is the long-term competitiveness of our economy. Last year, for the first time, the World Economic Competitiveness Report presented one consolidated ranking of the competitiveness of all the 44 countries or areas, and ranked Singapore Number 2 in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> terms of overall competitiveness, second only to the United States. We should be very happy with this assessment. However, the question is whether we can sustain our competitive edge in the face of global competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of large Asian economies such as China, India and Indonesia has intensified the competition for capital and markets. Capital has no national boundaries; it flows to places and projects with higher returns. Ample supply of labour and land in these large Asian economies offers low cost production bases. Their large domestic markets are added advantages in attracting foreign investments. This creates a capital diversion effect. Further, products from these countries are exported and they compete with our products in the international markets. All this means that unless we can constantly maintain our competitive edge and upgrade our products, jobs will be lost. The threat is particularly serious for unskilled workers as labour in these large Asian economies is much cheaper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key response to this challenge is manpower development. As the Minister reported in his Budget Statement, Singapore has invested heavily in education, training and retraining. Manpower development will help to maintain our competitiveness in three ways: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) attract foreign investments with higher level of technology to Singapore; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) raise labour productivity to ensure that our products can compete effectively in international markets; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) carry out R&amp;D activities and management restructuring benefitting both domestic operations and ventures abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy investment in education and training has raised the proportion of young Singaporeans going into post-secondary education from 19% in 1980 to 71% in 1994, and the aim is to raise this proportion further to 85% by the year 2000. The entry of each cohort of better educated, better trained young \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singaporeans will raise the education profile of our workforce. However, as the backlog of less educated workers remains large, 53% of the workers had primary or lower education in 1984, the overall quality of our workforce cannot be upgraded too rapidly. Greater efforts must be put on retraining of existing workers. Many workers are not inclined to go for retraining because of inertia and also because they have to forgo part of their already low income during training. Some employers are also reluctant to train their workers because these workers may job hop after training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retraining of existing workers, particularly those with lower skills, is important. These workers should not allow the present tight labour market to blur the potential danger of unemployment in view of the keen global competition. Government, employers, trade unions and workers themselves must put up a concerted effort in retraining. In this context, may I ask the Minister for Finance whether he will consider channelling part of the collection of the foreign workers levy to enlarge the resources of the Skills Development Fund so as to provide more incentives and programmes, particularly on-the-job training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasing the proportion of young Singaporeans going into post-secondary education will no doubt enhance our economic competitiveness. However, at the same time, it will put pressure on the second challenge, ie, of Singapore becoming a more middle-class society. Even if we assume the aspirations for material well-being of each successive cohort of better educated young Singaporeans remain unchanged, the sheer increase in the number of such middle-class members will mean higher demands for properties and cars which will be increasingly difficult to meet as our land area is finite. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister for Finance that Singaporeans should take the quality of life as a package, including a vibrant arts scene, a safe home, and efficient amenities, and not just material rewards such as a car and landed property. To do so, the Minister himself should be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prepared to allocate bigger budgets for the arts and sports. More importantly, we should instil a sense of belonging and inculcate moral and family values among Singaporeans from young. This will help the more successful Singaporeans to adjust their aspirations for a better life to a more realistic level as defined by Singapore's long-term realities and constraints, and also to develop a sense of obligation to help the less successful fellow citizens. Only then can we meet the future challenges, and build a cohesive and gracious society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget provides only about 1.2% of the GDP for health care cost. To me, this is too little. Recently, according to the World Bank's ranking, Singapore is ranked one of the 10 richest countries in the world. Out of these 10 richest countries in the world, we have a number of countries like Hong Kong and Japan. Hong Kong is providing about 5.7% of its GDP towards health care cost. Japan is providing 6.5%. Of course, the United States is exorbitant, 12.7%, and Germany, 8%. But we are only making a provision of 1.2% of the GDP for health care. This is clearly way, way below what the country can afford to provide. Even among those countries which were not within these 10 countries, like Malaysia, 3% of the GDP was given for health care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying that it is not too much to ask that the percentage point be increased by between 1% and 2%. Instead of 1.2%, it probably should be increased to 2.8% or 3%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should do more for the needy and the poor and also look after the welfare of the geriatric citizens of Singapore. And we have the chronic prolonged illness among us. The Government should provide more to look after this unfortunate lot. As it is now, we could look at the Government hospitals and the private hospitals. If one goes to a Government A&amp;E department as an outpatient, he pays $25. This is excluding medicine. And if one goes to a polyclinic, he pays $7 per visit and this is also excluding medicine. If one adds the cost of medicine in the polyclinic, he pays \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> about $12. But if he goes to a private clinic, he pays about $14. In terms of market price, one can say that for the Government hospital, you pay about $2-$3 less. But one must not forget that the profit aspect of a private clinic has not been factored in. Therefore, in this respect, the Government, in fact, should reduce this to reflect more equitable fees and charges for the poor and the needy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in respect of ward charges like A class ward charges, the difference is around $10-$20 between the private hospital and Government hospital. Here again, one has not factored in the profit that a private hospital makes. Therefore, in health care, the Government should not adopt a profit-oriented and cost recovery approach. The Government should not adopt this approach. Government should consider comparing with the fees and charges of private hospitals and clinics and adjust them accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider the fees and charges paid by those with chronic, prolonged illness and the geriatric patients to be GST-exempt. My understanding is that when kidney patients attend dialysis treatment, they have to pay GST. Some of these patients, even if they go to the National Kidney Foundation, have to pay about $600, and to a lot of sole breadwinner Singaporeans, even with an income of $1,500, they are not able to cater to these high charges and fees for their dialysis treatment. The Government should consider all these things. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read in the newspaper that in Penang if you go to a Government hospital for an open heart surgery, you pay $275. And if you go to a first-class ward, you pay only $1,700. I call this real subsidy. This amount is inclusive of ward charges. It is not independent of the ward charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to education. The school fees in the independent schools have escalated dramatically. Some of them have already charged $200 per pupil while others are charging $175. It has become \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prohibitive to a number of poor students to pay the fees of these independent schools. The Government should consider granting more scholarships. In granting scholarships, the Government should take into consideration the financial background of the parents of the students who are in the independent schools. As I have suggested before, and I am reiterating it now, for the well-to-do families whose children perform well in school, the Government can just award them with honorary book prizes so that the money can be channelled to the poor students for them to continue in the independent schools. I am quite sure that the well-to-do families would not object to this. But, of course, when you come to the university level, they should be given full scholarship irrespective of their financial background. The simple reason is this: when you are in the independent school, you can get all the scholarships you want and you are not bonded. You owe the Government nothing. Later on, if you do not accept a scholarship in the university, you can send the children overseas independently, whereas if you accept a university scholarship, you are bonded to the Government, you have to serve the Government. Therefore, there is the return to them. So this should not apply to university scholarships. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is the public assistance scheme. From statistics, the number of Singaporeans receiving public assistance is coming down. Until the last two years, probably we have about 2,700 Singaporeans receiving public assistance. Now, even with GST, a single person is only receiving $155. This $155 is inclusive of rent and food, which is clearly way, way below subsistence for these people. If we want to assist these poor Singaporeans, it is only fair that they are given a fair subsistence level and not just pay them $155 and $455 for a family of four and above. With the present system, it involves the Government only about $10 million. So if you increase this by 100%, probably it will cost the Government $40 million. The Government has raked in $752 million from betting and sweep stakes. Can this money not be channelled to help the unfortunate? Alternatively, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can the Government not organise another lottery, the proceeds therefrom could be channelled to help these poor and unfortunate? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Government here to reconsider granting medical benefits to children of women civil servants. They are doing the same job and we profess equality. Why can we not give them the same privilege and benefits accorded to male civil servants? The amount involved is only $8 million. Why can the Government not reconsider this and give the same medical benefits to the children of the women officers in the civil service? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government is encouraging more housewives to work. We have a lot of housewives who have no choice but to work simply because their husbands may be their only sole breadwinner and the wives may not be educated. The fact is that because the income of the husband is insufficient, the wife has been forced to work in order to augment the income of the husband. With the imposition of a levy of $330 a month, it is just not worth the while for most housewives to work at all. If you have a low education, and the income of your husband is low, you just cannot work because with the levy of $330 with effect from 1st April 1995, it is just not worthwhile for some of these housewives to work anymore. Because if you work in a factory you are paid $900. If you have to provide the maid food and pay the levy, it is not worth the while for the housewife to work even if her income is $1,200. I hope the Government will seriously consider reducing the maid levy so as to enable the wife to earn extra income to augment the low income of the husband. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the sale of Housing and Development Board flats, I would similarly urge the Government not to adopt the profit-oriented and cost recovery approach. There must be a subsidy. When I say \"subsidy\", I mean below cost subsidy and not below market price subsidy. There is a vast difference between these two. \"Low cost subsidy\" means the Government is building the property and selling it to members of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> public at below cost. So the difference is the amount of subsidy, and not below market price. If you do a comparison here, you pay $330,000 for a HDB executive flat and $600,000 for a private flat. If you look at it that way, it is subsidy because in the open market you pay $600,000 and the HDB is only selling it at $330,000. The subsidy difference is $200,000 to $300,000. If you go on this theory, HDB in fact is making a profit out of it. When private developers sell at $600,000 they easily make 50% of that. So the actual cost is only $300,000. In fact, the HDB is selling more than the private sector when they sell at $330,000. These are factors one must seriously consider. When you acquire a piece of land for a song, you do not sell it out to your own citizens and tell them the market value is so much. That is wrong. You are dealing with your own citizens whom you are duty bound to look after them. In areas like health, education and housing, the Government is duty bound to subsidise in every way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to touch briefly on the Elected President. It may sound a bit out of place but, to me, I think it is relevant to this budget session in the sense that the People's Action Party introduced the Elected President as a mechanism to check against a drawdown on our reserve as hand-outs or to subsidise social services. With the constitutional amendment, this is taken out. In other words, in respect of certain matters, the concurrence of the President is removed, ie, any matter relating to defence and security, we do not need the concurrence of the President. I suggest here that we are back to square one. This is simply because there are no more checks for a drawdown on the reserve. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Defence budget, like all other budgets, comes to Parliament every year for scrutiny. But the difference is that in the case of any other Ministry, we have a breakdown of the expenditure. We know how much is spent for a particular programme. For example, for Education, you would say it is for the building of new schools. But in the case of the Ministry of Defence, there are certain areas, for reasons of sensitivity and security which the Government claims, they do not let \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> you know. What is there to prevent a future Government, in order to circumvent the provision, from couching in the Defence budget a certain amount of money which is meant for subsidising social security? Parliament would not know because we have no chance to ask questions. A certain amount is put aside. It is spent on ground of security and none of us would know. I think it is a very dangerous thing to happen when the provision is taken out of Parliament. At first, with the amendment, we thought it is vested in the President. Now the latest amendment has made an exception to this rule. I think the danger is there. We are back to square one. All we are driving hard to get at can be circumvented. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr Speaker, can I ask some clarification from the Member? Mr Speaker: Is there something in his speech you do not understand? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> I want to know more from Mr Ling with regard to his comparison of the health care provision in Singapore and Hong Kong. Mr Ling mentioned 1.2% for Singapore and 5% to 6% for Hong Kong. In his research, can he inform us what is the figure of the per capita allocation for the residents in Hong Kong as compared to Singapore? What I mean, Sir, is that 1.2% or 5% can be misleading in the sense that if I have $100 and I distribute among 10 persons, each one would get $10. But if I distribute $1,000 among 1,000 people, each one would get $1. That is the difference I wanted to understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this: Can the Member inform us what are the causes for them to allocate a lot more from their budget for health care? Is it because of high cost of manpower, high cost of medicine or is it because too many people get ill too often in that country that they require a lot more money for the service? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is whether the Member can inform us whether the people in those countries also have a kind of savings scheme to help them to pay for medical bills, like what Singaporeans are doing now through Medisave and MediShield. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the United States is concerned, the reason why they spent about 12.4% of their GDP is that it is a litigious society. So invariably the practitioners there, in order to prevent being sued, increase their fees, resulting in this sort of subsidy going up. We do not have a situation over here where doctors are being sued left, right and centre. No. That is why their expenditure has gone up so high. And, in fact, as the hon. Member has just mentioned, we have other schemes, like MediShield and Medisave. Whether other countries have these schemes or not, I think the point here is if in fact the Government can afford it, it should subsidise more for the poor and the needy. MediShield does not come free, you pay premium. So it really makes no difference whether we come out from our own pocket to get back from the Government, which I think is wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> He was asking about Hong Kong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Hong Kong now, I believe, is about 5.7% and Hong Kong's income tax is also about 16%. Offhand, I think the corporate tax is about 18.5%, much lower than here. And yet the difference between Hong Kong's corporate tax and personal income tax rate is around 2 percentage points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are using only 1.2%; Hong Kong is 5.7%, much, much higher. What I am saying here is that if we can really afford it, we should do more for the unfortunate by increasing their subsidy. Even if we increase by 1 percentage point, it involves about 3 million people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Did they live longer? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> That is not the point. The point here is, as the Government, you have a duty to subsidise these people. You can afford it, you give them \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tuppence. That is what I am driving at. It is not a question of how long. Singaporeans have a longer life-span of 74 years. Do you mean the Government make us have a longer life? I do not think so. Look at Japan. The Japanese are known to have a longer life-span in the world and yet the government is giving them more than 8% of GDP. So the amount of percentage of GDP given is not in any way relevant to one's life-span. It is not relevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, unfortunately, the Member did not reply to the questions I asked, that is, the per capita allocation, why is it that they have to spend more money for health care there, and in what way is it more superior to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> I really do not understand what the hon. Member, Encik Maidin, was saying. Whether you are superior or not superior, what difference does it make to the question of subsidy? Is he suggesting for a moment that in Malaysia, there are all the bomohs treating the patients and we have all specialised people treating the patients? Is he suggesting that? Is he suggesting that across the Causeway there are bomohs or the witch doctors or quack doctors treating them? We have first-class medical treatment here no doubt. But what I am saying is that we should channel more to subsidise those poor and the needy. For the well-off, they can pay. But we should help a lot of these poor and needy - those who are suffering from kidney ailment and chronic diseases. Government can do more for these people in the present circumstances. That is what I am driving at. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, may I seek further clarification from Mr Ling? He asked for more Government expenditure. Maybe he can tell us specifically what will be the objective he hopes that Singapore will achieve with more health care expenditure, because he seems to suggest that a longer life-span and lower infant mortality are not the standards. He just painted with a very broad brush by saying that we want to spend more on the unfortunate and the poor. But I think the Government needs to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be guided as to what will be the objective. Maybe he can point out to us specifically what are the objectives we should be achieving. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of this increased subsidy is to get the poorer and unfortunate people to pay less for their treatment. One example is a kidney patient. Now he is paying about $600 a month. With Government subsidy, perhaps he pays $300 a month. And for those who have prolonged illness and have to stay in hospital for a long time, instead of charging them ward charges, like C or B2 class, of $60 or $85, they pay $40. Is that not a way to help our poor and unfortunate brethren? It is very simple. I am not asking the Government to help the well-off. I am asking the Government to help the less well-off, those unfortunate brethren of this society. That is what I am asking for. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, Mr Ling has not replied to my questions about per capita allocation and whether the money, as he said, is good to provide health care there in Hong Kong and other countries, and why is it that they have to allocate a higher percentage of their GDP to provide health care to their population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part two of his reaction to my point is regarding the bomohs in Malaysia. I wonder whether the Member knows the number of bomohs in Malaysia who, he said, were somewhat involved in the health care service. I do not know about this, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I replied to him simply because he is insinuating that the standard of our medical practice is much superior to that across the Causeway. That is why in reply I was even suggesting about bomohs across the Causeway, because he was insinuating that if you pay more, you have first-class medical treatment. That is my reply. It is impossible for me to tell him the number of bomohs over there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is Singapore's per capita income is about $2,000-plus. Of course, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in Malaysia, it is about $300-plus. [Interruption.] No. I am sorry. It is the amount they spend. In Malaysia, the amount they spend is about $300 per patient; in Singapore, it is about $2,000 per patient at the hospital. I am drawing this comparison here. The point here is that we may be one of the richest countries in the world, but that does not follow we have no poor people. You know very well how it works. You get an amount there, add to the value below, you divide, that is your answer. I mean, you may be in a rich country, but you may be drawing $500. In Singapore, we have people drawing $300 a month. We may have a very high per capita income, but it does not mean that you are earning a lot of money. I am appealing to this Government to look more into the welfare of the few poor and needy. No more, and no less. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> I still did not get an answer to my clarification from the Member.

He said that in Singapore, there are people drawing less than $300 per month. Maybe he can give us data on this.

Perhaps he can tell us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am drawing this point simply because at the last debate we said that we had about 4,000 or 5,000 people drawing about $300 a month. Can he tell me that it is completely eradicated and no more poor people are earning this amount? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest he take a look at the Labour Force Survey.

It is very much more than that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>1.40 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Sir, the issues which Mr Ling has brought up are not new in this House. I am sure these issues have been brought up in the past over and over again. I am sure Members of the GPCs for the various Ministries will again address these issues in the course of their speeches. But I would like to add one comment. As an economist, I know it is always difficult to use statistics to compare inter-country achievements, expenditure patterns and tax structures because statistics can be misleading. When we quote statistics, are we quoting them in real terms, in current terms, in what currency? I think this has to be made known before we disclose any statistics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, true to what has been predicted, the Budget in my view is a painless one, generally much welcomed. However, for some Singaporeans, the hand-outs were below their expectations. It was to them a non-event. They had expected more good news given the fact that Singapore celebrates its 30th Birthday this year. But this has not happened yet. Perhaps the Government is holding back the best news for release in the month of August when we celebrate our National Day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the business sector is said to be somewhat disappointed with the Budget. This need not be so if it remembers that a number of incentives would be introduced to boost R&amp;D activities and to further promote the financial services industry. Businessmen understandably perceived this Budget as less than ideal. They said the Budget only benefited certain segments of the economy. They have wished for another reduction of corporate tax, but I think they cannot really feel disappointed as the last corporate tax reduction of 3% was made only last year and businesses generally are still benefitting from it. The business outlook remains cautiously optimistic despite a number of unfavourable developments since the beginning of this year, ie, the Kobe earthquake, the Mexican peso crisis, the collapse of Barings, and now the weakening of the US dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this `pro-people' Budget appears to be an expansionary budget with development expenditures projecting to reach a high $6.7 billion in FY95, an increase of 46% over FY94. Sir, one must remember that the economy grew by 10.1% last year and foreign investments in Singapore reached an all time high of $5.8 billion. All these expansions will put a further strain on our limited resources, particularly manpower and land. These will drive up wages and rentals. My concern, Sir, is that our economy may be in danger of overheating. Unless we manage our growth prudently and with caution, cost inflation will rise and this will add further pressure on the cost competitiveness of our existing industries. We cannot allow what happened in the mid-1980s which led to an economic recession in 1986 to repeat itself in the near future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about our limited resources, water is a precious but scarce resource. It is therefore timely for the Government to send an amber signal to Singaporeans to conserve water. The high water conservation tax has to come at a time when water consumption remains high and increasing. We must develop a habit to conserve water. But, Sir, I would ask that due consideration be given to manufacturers who use water as a basic ingredient, such as those in the food and beverage industry. It is the wastage of water which should be discouraged. By the same token, there should be incentives when efforts are made to conserve water and, for that matter, other forms of energy. I therefore fully agree with Dr Ow Chin Hock that we should launch a campaign to conserve water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to come to the Budget surpluses. Whilst many countries, including once economic powers, are grappling with budget deficit problem, we are blessed with another year of budgetary surpluses. Sceptics, especially those who are jealous of our success, are throwing mud at us. They said the current budgetary surplus is the direct result of the PAP Government's \"pay and pay\" policies. Is that really so? The truth is our budgetary surplus is largely the consequence of our strong economic growth from which wealth is created and some \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> returned through tax collections to the State for spending on infrastructure, defence, education, health care and other social services. Indeed, the Hon. Minister for Finance has shown this fact through Table 1 of his Budget Statement, which shows that tax revenue forms a large 80% of total revenue collected in 1994. Non-tax revenue which is a consequence of Government's non-fiscal policies forms the other 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not be embarrassed by our budget surpluses. There is this temptation to want to spend the surpluses more liberally. I am glad that the Government has again resisted clamours for free handouts without considering whether it would weaken the will to work hard for Singaporeans. Neither should the Government be tempted to spend more than is necessary in order to narrow the budget surpluses. Doing so, Sir, is likely to have dire consequences and will overheat the economy and lead to inflation. Instead we should look at how best to use the budget surpluses to achieve our long term national objectives. In particular, we should use our budget surpluses to address the likely structural problems we will face in our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view, Sir, that we should channel more of our budget surpluses to the field of education and for the retraining of Singaporeans. I am glad therefore that the Government has decided to channel another $1 billion to the Edusave fund to allow students to participate in a larger variety of educational programmes to maximise their potential. But the Edusave fund, Sir, only benefits our younger Singaporeans. The adult population does not benefit from it. Sir, as our industries regionalise and expand overseas, Singaporeans have to be properly trained to manage our overseas investments. Many Singaporeans today are ill-equipped to do such tasks. May I therefore suggest that a small part of the surpluses be channelled to a fund to be set up to be called the Regionalisation Training Fund, or RTF, to train Singaporeans in the necessary languages and management skills, in order to better equip them in their work overseas as we expand regionally. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, still on education and retraining, we should also seriously look at channelling part of the surpluses to the Skills Development Fund, or SDF. I think there is a need to retrain our workers, particularly those in non-executive positions who are in their 30s and 40s, who did not receive much education and skill training in the past, and this is a point which has also been put forward by Dr Ow. The recent spate of retrenchments in the electronics industry resulting in thousands of workers being out of job is, indeed, a warning sign. This pool of workers is lucky to be able to seek alternative employment when our economic growth is still buoyant and the electronics industry robust at the moment. The scenario may be different if circumstances change within the next one or two years. This would also apply to non-electronics industries as we become less competitive due to cost pressures and businessmen relocate their operations to neighbouring countries. And when this happens, more and more Singaporean workers without the necessary skills would be out of jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am therefore proposing that we channel part of the surpluses to the Skills Development Fund for the training, education and the retraining of our older Singaporean workers to better equip them for employment opportunities as our economy gradually transforms to a more skill intensive and higher value added one in the years ahead. Coupled with this, I am proposing that we step up our efforts in encouraging this group of Singaporeans to go for retraining and upgrading to cope with the challenges ahead. I can understand why these Singaporeans do not feel a pressing need to undergo retraining now because current economic conditions are favourable and jobs aplenty. But we cannot wait for doomsday to happen. We must do something now. I therefore suggest that a special committee headed by either a Minister or Minister of State and comprising specialists from the public and private sectors be formed to address this problem and mindset, and come up with solutions and recommendations as quickly as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget debate last year, I proposed that the Government set aside a small amount of its surpluses to a fund to help the needy in our constituencies. This proposal has certainly not been taken up by the Government. I would like to propose this concept again this year. The point here is that the needy in our constituencies needs the money more than anyone else. And the best people to identify which households deserve a little more to meet immediate and pressing needs are none other than our community leaders in the constituencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore suggesting that we set up a \"Constituents Hardship Relief Fund or Needy Fund\" using part of the budget surpluses to be administered by the Ministry of Community Development for spending on the people at the constituency level. Applicants for this fund will have to have a deserved cause to be supported by the constituency Citizens' Consultative Committee and endorsed by its Advisor. Applicants will have to be people with a dire need for financial support caused by unforeseen circumstances. Some money may also be put aside to help deserving students from these needy families to pay for their school fees and textbooks. It may not cost a lot but it will go a long way to touch the hearts and assuage the worries and fears of these constituents. In this way, Sir, the Government would not be mistaken as a Santa Claus to all and sundry. The people will also see that part of their money will go back to them in a use that touches their hearts more deeply. Even if he is not the direct beneficiary of this fund, I am sure he will still see and feel the joy of his neighbour's plight assuaged by financial assistance through the State. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important to remind ourselves not to take the budget surpluses we enjoy year after year for granted. We must remember that this sharing of wealth is only possible if we as a nation continue to work hard to prosper and the economy continues to perform creditably. It is equally relevant to remind ourselves not to take a robust economy for granted, that it will and can carry on thriving indefinitely. Without good planning and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> astute vision, as has been the hallmark of this Government, all this wealth creation will just be a pipe dream. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I join my fellow Members of the House to voice my support for this Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly, Budget 1995 must be one of the most generous, yet prudent and farsighted one in the world. Indeed, how many governments today, whether in the developed or developing world, are able to present such a healthy and sound budget? Certainly, Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu must be the envy of his contemporaries in other countries. Today, it is becoming increasingly harder, if not rare, for finance ministers the world over to present a balanced budget, not to mention one with a huge surplus. So Singapore must be doing something very right - accolades and kudos to the Finance Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, enjoying a healthy economic growth which in turn generates a budget surplus is one thing. How the surplus is spent is another. It will be ruinous to just give away the surplus in the form of ready cash for the people to spend as they like, or to give them over generous subsidies. It is human nature that a people used to free handouts will always ask for more. Once their appetite for free handouts has been whetted, it will be insatiable. Sooner or later, the government will find itself unable to cope with the demand of the people. This is when the trouble begins. Even a rich and powerful nation can go downhill once its people's psyche is cast in a spendthrift mould. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the United States, for example. From a recent BBC broadcast entitled \"Letter from America\" by Alistair Cook, it was said that the USA, though being the richest nation in the world, is estimated that it may go bankrupt in the year 2010. Its current budget deficit is US$200 billion a year. And its world debt stands at US$800 billion. The yearly interest it pays to its creditors amounts to more than the nation's annual expenditure on defence. All this woe is brought about mainly by its populist fiscal policy, and the popular \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> philosophy of a people who believe in enjoying life today rather than worrying about tomorrow. Three-fifths of its annual budget are spent on entitlements, in other words, on lavish subsidies for its citizens. This means the future generations will have to pay for what the present generation is enjoying. But is this morally and politically right? To us Singaporeans, I must say, it is very irresponsible behaviour on the part of the present generation. And it must never be allowed to take root in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am saying all these because there are already unhealthy signs that complacency has begun to rear its ugly head in Singapore, especially among many of the younger Singaporeans who are used to many years of continued prosperity. Our fiscal policy must therefore be able to arrest this trend, lest we fall into the same trap that many Western economies are in today. We must also constantly remind ourselves that it is a persistent feature of the history of migrant people that the immigrant drive seldom survives into the second or third generation. Can Singaporeans be different? Can we prove history wrong? Well, Sir, it all depends on us. But for survival and continued prosperity in a more and more competitive global economy, we Singaporeans, living in a tiny island state without any natural resources to speak of, have really got no choice but be made of sterner stuff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No thinking and rational citizens can deny that the Budget presented in this House on 1st March is a generous, balanced, fair and forward-looking one, which will help take Singapore into the next era without hiccups. Some people have aptly described the budget allocation to how a wise farmer divides his income derived from a bumper harvest, into three parts. The first part he spends giving all those who have contributed to the success of the bumper harvest a feast; the next part he stacks away for a rainy day; and the third part he invests in more advanced farming equipment, as well as sending some of his farmhands for training. All this is done to ensure more good years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, despite the fact that Budget 1995 is a painless and generous \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one, it seems that we still have quite a bit of explanation to do before we can convince all Singaporeans that the PAP Government is doing the right thing. And this explanation must be done in simple layman's terms, not couched in technical jargon, so that all Singaporeans can understand and think long term rather than just to have more money in their pockets now. We must not forget that at the moment, almost 50% of our workforce have not had the opportunity to receive education beyond the primary stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mention this because some citizens have commented that with so much surplus in the kitty, the Government should be more generous. Some argue that there should have been a reduction in their personal income tax. Others say that there should be a cut in corporate tax. It may sound rather far-fetched, some even think that the Government should declare a tax holiday for all wage earners, regardless of their income for FY95 to reward them for their contribution in the economic growth. Some, though disappointed, are accepting the budget philosophically that something is better than nothing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's $200 contribution to the ordinary CPF accounts of all Singaporeans aged 21 and above, and the $300 to CPF SOTUS do not seem to mean very much to these people. Firstly, it is not ready cash which they can spend straightaway. Secondly, the amounts do not mean much to each individual although it translates to the tune of $360 million and $380 million respectively on the part of the Government. Some even question the rationale of imposing the age limit of 21 to qualify for the CPF top-up. They think it could be because only those who are 21 and above are eligible to vote in an election; so 1995 must be the General Election year! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the main I am happy with the Budget, I would still like to tinker with a few ideas for the Minister to ponder, maybe for the next Budget, if adjustments cannot be made this year. First, when our economy is doing exceptionally well, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whether the Minister would consider giving retirees, especially those who retired many years ago, and whose pension is very small and has been badly eaten into over the years by inflation, a one-off payment. Call it a bonus, or whatever suitable name. After all, former MPs who retired some years ago have recently petitioned to the Prime Minister for a revision in their pension. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, whether the Minister would make some changes to the CPF top-up scheme. As it stands now, only those who are economically active are entitled to the benefit. Those who are not, for example, housewives, are being left out. But is not bringing up children and doing household chores considered important activities? Mr Speaker, Sir, surely they are. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a blanket payment to all and sundry who are considered economically active, thus contributing to our economic growth, does not seem very logical. A few hundred dollars to a rich man means hardly anything, and certainly he does not need it. Whereas the same amount means a great deal to a person earning only a few hundred dollars a month. Therefore, Sir, would the Hon. Minister consider fine-tuning the present CPF and CPF SOTUS? Maybe a cap on income could be used to decide the eligibility of the recipients of the top-up. Granted, this method may be cumbersome and tedious in practice, because of the sheer numbers involved. I have, of course, no intention to question the rationale behind the Government's good intention in returning some of its accumulated savings to the people. I am only suggesting that maybe the money to be given back to the citizens could be more fairly distributed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the financial policy of the Government as presented by the Finance Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said on this year's Budget Statement, both in public and in private. Many people have described the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Budget as prudent, cautious and forward looking. The Budget has addressed short-term and long-term objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate short-term concern is that there should not be overheating of the economy. The long-term objectives are the competitive challenges coming from the emerging nations, and internally, the problems of coping with rising middle class aspirations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have also described the Budget as an election budget, with rebates for the people, a 10% tax rebate, a CPF top-up of $500, and for those who do not pay tax, the Government has give-aways in terms of S&amp;C charges and rentals. 1995 could indeed be an election year! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now have a few personal observations of my own to make on this year's Budget Statement. Firstly, the Government should consider reducing the personal income tax to the level of the corporate tax. The 10% tax rebate on individual income tax is equivalent to a 3 percentage proportional cut in tax rates. Sir, may I propose that the Government consider making this 3 percentage cut in individual tax rates a permanent feature for the Budget Statement of 1996. After all, it must be remembered that the ordinary individual taxpayer has no recourse to tax planning or other devices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point concerns the rising labour cost and the strong Singapore dollar. According to the Economic Survey of Singapore 1994, real wage growth increased from 1.4% in 1993 to 5.2% in 1994. Although the manufacturing sector registered strong productivity growth of 11%, for the rest of the economy, productivity growth was lower, and wage growth higher in 1994 compared to 1993. This resulted in unit labour cost for the overall economy rising by 1.9%, in contrast to the slight decline of 0.2% in 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to rising labour costs, the Singapore dollar appreciated against the currencies of the NIEs, namely, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, by a range of 8-10%. It strengthened against the Malaysian Ringgit by 4.3%, the Thai Baht by 8.4%, and the Indonesian Rupiah by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 15%. It registered a stronger 10% appreciation against the US dollar and closed the year at S$1.46 per US dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are rapidly losing our competitiveness and I hope the Government is fully aware of the problems faced by our manufacturers and exporters as a result of rising labour costs and an appreciating Singapore dollar. The Budget did not address these issues and I hope the Minister can provide some means to help restore our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Minister has stated in the Budget Statement that funds have been allocated to the Economic Development Board for venture capital funds to assist local SMEs to take advantage of regional opportunities. Funds have also been made available for EDB to make strategic investments and to assist local SMEs through various economic development schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to give more details of the funds allocated, and a progress report of the schemes set up to assist local entrepreneurs to expand into the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note and with these comments and suggestions, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister's Budget Statement this year seeks to adjust our tax system in order to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of Singapore. This is indeed praiseworthy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Minister is giving a 10% rebate on our personal income tax, and rebates on service and conservancy charges and rentals for residents of HDB flats. A sum of $500 million will be credited to the Edusave Fund, and another sum of $1 billion into the Medifund. $380,000 will be spent on a second round of CPF top-up for all Singapore citizens above the age of 21. About 71% of the people of Singapore will not have to pay any income tax. The Government is, in fact, paying back its budget surpluses to the people of Singapore, especially those in the lower income group, so that they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can have a share in the benefits of our economic prosperity. I think these measures are very important and this Budget is an important one too. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with Mr Ling How Doong. From the political and economic point of view, the Government has begun to implement the scheme of sharing the fruits of our economic development with the people. This is a very humane touch on the part of the Government. But I am beginning to worry that the good intention of the Government to share the benefits of economic development with the people may result in the younger Singaporeans forming the wrong impression that such handouts are to be taken for granted and thus forgetting about the vulnerability of Singapore and the increasing competition from the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this point because after the announcement of the Budget Statement, a lot of young people said, \"Very good, we too have some hong baos to collect!\" Some young people even said \"What a disappointment, only a small pittance.\" Therefore, I feel that if the Government were to continue sharing the economic fruits among the people, it must first understand the mentality of the young people on this kind of handouts before implementing it, so that this benefit sharing will not be wrongly considered as a kind of welfare scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the proposal of Mr Ling How Doong about giving more of this and more of that. I think maybe the motive and intention are good but it is certainly not realistic. He quoted Malaysia as an example. We cannot compare Singapore to Malaysia. Malaysia is a large country with lots of natural resources like rubber, tin, palm oil, etc. But in Singapore, we have none. We do not have any natural resources, not even water. Our land area is very small. The circumstances are different between the two countries. We cannot even use Hong Kong as a comparison. Hong Kong is not a sovereign state. It does not need to spend on defence and foreign affairs. Hong Kong saves a lot of money on these two areas. I feel that we should be more realistic. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I like to raise is on the respect for the old and the aged. I think this is a traditional virtue of Singaporeans. However, there seems to be no provision in this Budget for the pensioners. I feel that the pensioners need to be looked after. At a time when our national economy has performed well, we should not forget that there are many people who retired in the 1950s and 1960s who had made considerable contributions to the society and the country. These are the older Singaporeans. Especially in the 1950s and 1960s, when ex-ministers, ex-MPs and ex-civil servants retired, they did not have the benefit of NWC recommendations or CPF savings. All they received was just a miserable sum of pension. These people who had made contributions to Singapore in the past cannot depend on the small pensions computed then for the living in the 1990s. Many of the ex-MPs who retired told me that when they retired they received only a pension based on the then MPs' allowance of $500. They had made valuable contributions to the country and the Party but they are left with almost nothing. I hope that the Government can consider the contributions made by these people, and make appropriate adjustments to their pension. I believe that the number of such people is very small and it would not add on to the burden of the present and future taxpayers. Maybe we can use another method, ie, to use the surpluses from the budget to look after them. I hope the Minister for Finance will consider this suggestion sympathetically. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance also said that through its fiscal policy the Government will make Singapore's economy more competitive, such as reducing the tax burden of the businessmen to the minimum, and providing for relatively tax-free repatriation of their funds. I welcome the statement from the Minister for Finance, but I hope that he would also consider helping the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in their overseas ventures by giving all of them the necessary assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to declare my interest. I am a businessman. The Government should consider setting up a development \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bank to provide loans for the SMEs in the establishment and building of factories and plants overseas and thereby using such factories as mortgage thereof. At least, give them loans of 30% to 50% of their total overseas investments so that the SMEs would be able to develop properly in their overseas ventures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, consider the use of CPF savings for certain selected investment scheme overseas so that the SMEs will be able to have a share in the regionalization programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, provide the avoidance of double taxation and simplify the procedure for the benefit of the SMEs. Give them more information so that these people will be able to send their money back to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with regard to male citizens who go out to work outside Singapore, if they bring their wife and children with them, they should be able to enjoy higher tax rebates and other tax incentives so as to enhance family cohesion which is the tradition of our people, and that will prevent the establishment of second homes outside. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is going to allocate $500 million to Edusave Fund. This will enhance the opportunities for our people to receive training and retraining to maximise their potential. Our students will be able to get scholarship from the Edusave fund. But there is one thing which I fail to understand, that is, why is it that our clan associations, which provide scholarship and bursaries to the students, cannot be granted any tax incentive from the Government. If the Minister is concerned that these clan associations cannot manage their finances properly, then if the school principals can certify to the effect that scholarship and bursaries are being given, we should allow the clan associations to receive tax exemption on their bursary and scholarship funds. I believe that the able ones should help the less able ones. I think this is one of our core values. Since the Chinese clan associations are actively promoting bursary and scholarship schemes, I think it is playing the same role as the Edusave \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> scheme. The Government should allow them to enjoy tax exemption. I hope the Minister will consider this seriously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Budget statement by the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>2.23 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Minister for Finance's budgetary statement for 1995. As we have learned to expect from the Minister's past performances, he has expertly and deftly put together a package which manages to accommodate the competing and, sometimes, conflicting needs of different interest groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1995 Budget was praised in the press as a far-sighted one. However, some businessmen seem to think the Budget would have been better with more tax cuts or tax breaks. Nevertheless, the message underlying this year's Budget is that Singapore prospers because we make it so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit in this message is that the 1995 Budget is meant to help all those who are economically active. As I see it, that is the rub of this year's Budget. The Budget is silent about the Singaporeans who are not gainfully employed and are not welfare recipients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we glibly talk about the economic success of Singapore, we tend to forget that not all Singaporeans benefit from this economic success. This is because Singapore does not function like a giant lift. If it were so, we would be all in cloud nine, because when a lift rises upwards, all the persons would automatically rise up with it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in real life, it would be apt to liken Singapore to a nimbus-cumulus cloud or rain-storm cloud. As Singapore soars upwards on free market forces, the dynamic or enterprising Singaporeans will soar much higher than the rest of their fellow Singaporeans, while some hapless Singaporeans may even drop below the bottom of the cloud. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting we give them golden parachutes like those the multi-national CEOs give themselves. Singaporeans have to find whatever handholds or safety straps they can to hang on for their dear life as Singapore rises even higher in the sky. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always prided ourselves on our guiding principle of self-help. We had plumped for a wholly contributory provident fund scheme rather than a fully or partly state-funded pension scheme. While our Singapore Government may pat itself on the back for avoiding a potentially fiscal nightmare, some Singaporeans see only a nightmarish future when they retire. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we like it or not, money loses some of its value over time. Our currency, fortunately, is relatively stable. Nonetheless, even a slow but steady rate of erosion of monetary value over several years must adversely affect those who are dependent on frozen incomes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are economically active have incomes, that is, profits or wages, that rise or are adjusted to compensate for the shrinking value of money. Retirees and others with frozen incomes have to tighten their belt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know our Government has been urging Singaporeans to hedge against their retirement by wisely investing their CPF money. But it is easier said than done. The recent report by the CPF Board shows more CPF investors lose than gain by trying to increase their CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the factors responsible for monetary depreciation are not all necessarily within the control of our Government, I hope our Government will be able to find a way of keeping up the progress of Singapore without unduly reducing the purchasing power of our currency. Otherwise, the future will be bleak for our senior citizens who will form an increasingly larger component of our population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget similarly refers to our need to conserve the use of fresh \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> water without touching upon a non-fiscal solution. Even before the Budget was announced, this need to save water has been publicly stressed and voiced. The Mentri Besar of Johor seized the opportunity to reassure Singaporeans, since Johor is our main fresh water supplier at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not doubt our Government has reason for being overly anxious that we use up more water than we really need to, as Singapore has very limited fresh water resources. Understandably, the public may be at first puzzled why the intention of our Government, as reflected in the Budget, does not match its vocal concern on the subject of water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local press reported the Minister for Trade and Industry has now informed us that the desalination of sea water has been actively canvassed. I only wish an indication should have been given in the Budget of our Government's efforts to find alternative sources of fresh water. Our water supply is a matter that concerns the whole nation and not merely a statutory body. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who have visited Hong Kong may be aware that one of its solutions to the problem of limited fresh water supply is to have separate plumbing systems for flushing toilets and for drinking, cooking and bathing purposes. By using sea water for flushing toilets, Hong Kong cuts down on the use of fresh water. Of course, an objection to the use of sea water for this purpose is that we in Singapore do not flush raw sewage into the sea and we recover the toilet-flushing water for industrial use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, we have to do more research and study to find ways of cutting down on the use of potable water that are suitable in our circumstances. Our Government has set aside about $740 million for crediting the CPF accounts of eligible Singaporeans. I should think that, in the long-term interest of Singaporeans, setting aside another sum of money for water research would be very much in order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that matter, our Government should channel the water conservation tax into \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> water research and not the general revenue. Even if the levy imposed on consumers using more than 20 cubic metres of water a month does not yield much, the fact that our Government finances water research will serve to underline the seriousness of our water situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding my comments, I support the 1995 Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Dr Richard Hu's Budget Statement has been described in various ways. Mr Speaker, I found it comprehensive and visionary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spelt out the short-term and long-term challenges facing Singapore. In my opinion, where short-term issues are concerned, the Government has its finger on the pulse and is reading it correctly. We can confidently look forward to more good years in the short-run and we can commend the policy-makers for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is the long-term challenges that are more problematic and we should be focusing on them now so that we can take pre-emptive measures. As outlined by the Finance Minister, these long-term challenges are both global and local and to a large extent they are inter-related. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the key challenge for Singapore is to develop its only resource - its people. Much has been done for the education and training of our people and more is planned. By the year 2000, we should see 85% of our population with post-secondary education. This is very impressive. It will give us a workforce equipped with the knowledge and skills needed for value-added and competitive economic effort. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, there is one problem. A good number of these workers - possibly as many as half of them - will have to hold two jobs: they will have to shoulder the double burden of earning an income to ensure their families have the best possible in life while also taking on the bulk of the responsibility of caring for the children, the home, the aged, or the disabled relatives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking, Sir, of a matter that has been raised in this House and in general public discussion time and again in recent years. It is the question of how we are to help working Singaporeans, and especially the women, find a better balance between the demands of the workplace and the home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we need our women in the workforce is undeniable. Singapore's labour shortage is so great that a sizeable chunk - almost 20% - of our workforce comprises foreigners. The economy needs all the womanpower it can find. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore women, meanwhile, need to work not just because they want to apply the education and training they have received but because their income is, in many ways, vital to the family economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statistics Department found that in the decade from 1980 to 1990, the number of dual income couples doubled. In 1993, there were 260,000 dual income couples out of a total of 550,000 couples in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his report on dual income couples in Singapore, the Chief Statistician Dr Paul Cheung said the working wife contributes on average 41% of a couple's income. Among lower income couples, the wife's salary is even more important - as many as 43% of the lower-income couples derive at least one-half of their combined income from the wives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Cheung summed up the implications of women's participation in the workforce by saying:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) because the supply of young workers in the labour force is expected to dwindle with decreased birth rates, married women will play a critical part in meeting demand for labour. It is therefore important to look at work arrangements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A second income will put a middle-upper class lifestyle within reach of many couples and help ensure financial security after retirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a third implication, and that is, for the lower-income families, the loss of a wife's income will cut family income - and thus the standard of living \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> - by half. The wife's income is, in other words, crucial if the family is to have any hope of keeping pace with the material progress of the rest of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the dual-income couple is both a reality and a necessity of life in modern Singapore. Unfortunately, attitudes have not kept pace with the very real changes we have seen in our society and economy. Too many of us appear to be caught in the mental quagmire of seeing the man as the breadwinner and the woman as the home-maker and the care-giver. And so, even when both the husband and wife go out to work and may well bring home similar pay packets, it is the woman who looks after the home and on whose shoulders is placed the responsibility of keeping the family together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Dr Hu in his Budget speech said Singapore must become even more of a middle-class society. I wholeheartedly support that goal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our leaders, and especially the Prime Minister, constantly remind us that we must preserve the family unit as it is this that will hold together our society. I agree completely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must stop and ask ourselves whether these two goals are compatible given certain conditions and attitudes in our society. In order to have the income that allows a middle-class society, most families will need the wife and mother to work at a job. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is, in other words, joining her husband in the breadwinning task. It would seem logical - and would augur well for the family - for her husband to join her in the home-making and care-giving task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this happening? And if it isn't - and the evidence is that it isn't - why is this so? More importantly, what are we going to do about it? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate on the issue of the dual burden on women and the attitudes about the role of men and women in society has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unfortunately sometimes been depicted as a tussle between so-called \"liberated\" women and men and families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When women's groups call for steps to be taken to change attitudes which are lagging behind social and economic realities, policy makers tend to respond by suggesting that these are the shrill cries of a minority of women who are selfishly demanding doctrinaire equality and symmetry for their own ends. And then they warn of the dangers of aping the ways of the West, pointing to the high rates of divorce and single motherhood and general social decay there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, Mr Speaker, we had another such reminder when the Minister of State for Finance and Defence spoke at the Woman of the Year gala dinner. The Minister listed the progress Singapore women have made in many areas and then pointed to the Nordic countries where women almost match men in many areas of life - and where there is also the greatest evidence of a crumbling social fabric. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our policy makers do Singapore women an injustice when they suggest that those of us who press this matter are mindlessly riding the wave of western feminism, that we cannot see the dire implications of certain social trends, that we care naught for the security and the sanctity of the family and social cohesion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we see these implications - and more. We see the strains being placed today on Singapore families as they seek to cope with their rising aspirations and with the ever higher standards in the school-room, at the office, in the factory and shop floor. We see Singapore women struggling to play both their modern and ancient roles - and in so many cases, it is a silent and solitary struggle, the man and society generally, choose not to recognise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that all of us - the Government, unions, employers, women's organisations and voluntary organisations, and each individual, and all of us in this House - look afresh at this question of women's and men's roles in the family and in society generally, and consider how best \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we can make those adjustments in attitudes and in work conditions that will allow for a better balance between the demands of family life and economic activity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not \"just a woman's issue\". It is a national issue, one that affects men and women and families, and it calls for serious attention and action instead of the polite murmurs we have had so far. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made two appeals in the last two years in this House to the Prime Minister to take under his personal charge the task of finding a better balance for Singaporeans of the twin demands of family and work. I appeal to him once again. Finding this better balance is at the heart of achieving both economic progress and social cohesion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if I could now turn to another aspect of what constitutes the quality of life in Singapore. Dr Hu spoke of the need to retain \"high premium\" individuals in Singapore who will create wealth for the country. He talked about the role of Government in satisfying their material, psychological and emotional needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has gone a long way, as measured materially, to give our people a good quality of life. Singapore has the highest home ownership rate in the world and the Acting Minister for National Development is formulating even more creative and equitable means of increasing this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the Minister for Communications is working very hard to make public transport a viable and attractive alternative to cars. We wish him luck and we should try to help him. I look forward to the time when our MPs, senior civil servants, highly-skilled professionals and well-heeled executives will either sell their cars or leave them at home and instead use public transport for their daily journey to and from work. Cars will then become necessary only for week-end travel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the material progress, the upper middle class and the so-called \"high premium\" individuals seem to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unhappy. The Government is understandably frustrated by what it considers the unjustified griping of these people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the problem? I would like to venture to make a diagnosis and suggest a prescription that could make for a healthier populace. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material rewards are not the end-all and the be-all of human endeavour. It is in the area of psychological and emotional needs that the Government needs to do more. The Minister for Information and the Arts, BG Yeo, pointed to this lacuna when he spoke so eloquently in 1991 about the development of civil society, but since then the efforts to carry out this goal have been patchy. Indeed, when there have been attempts to take on an active citizen's role in matters involving policy-making and affairs of the state, the response of the Government has been seen sometimes as one of discouragement. People start to feel that the Government is over reacting to their participation and they become defensive. The message sent is that \"the leaders know best\" and they should trust their judgement. This may well be true. But if well-intentioned Singaporeans end up feeling they are being discouraged from entering the arena of policymaking, from offering a view on the trends in their society, they may well conclude that they are not an integral part of the fabric of our society. For them, Singapore becomes just a place to make money. Their bodies will be in Singapore but the battle for their minds and hearts will have been lost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Singaporeans to work hard and achieve excellence, and able to cherish their families and help the less fortunate in society, we have to let them feel they belong to Singapore. They must feel they have a right to participate in debates about policies and trends. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they should respect the integrity and authority of our leaders and the institutions of society, but this should be a respect granted willingly and whole-heartedly. A sullen silence or sycophantic smiles in the presence of authority do not make for a healthy society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's socio-economic changes in the last 30 years are mind-boggling. The changes have been so rapid that it would be no surprise to find some underlying tension as people strive to make sense of these changes. There are bound to be stresses with high growth. And because the ruling party has been, in these 30 years, instrumental in achieving the Singapore socio-economic miracle, some of this underlying tension is directed at the Government. This tension has to be managed with understanding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect for authority and established institutions is vital for our economic and social progress but, like all human emotions, respect should be a two-way process. Many concerned citizens feel that more should be done for this two-way process because the country has reached a critical point in its social and political development. I think it is important for this House to recognise this unmet need and to respond to it creatively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I would like to address another concern that may be forgotten in our celebration of being the 10th richest country in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 10 years from 1982/1983 to 1992/1993, Dr Hu has told us real household income for the bottom 20% kept pace with those of the middle 60% and the top 20%. This is good news but it could be better. The bottom 20% should, ideally, be catching up with the middle 60% who in turn get nearer the top 20%. In fact, although income disparity has not increased in the last 10 years, wealth disparity has, because of asset inflation. This does not augur well for social cohesion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some statistics that show how far we have to go before we become a real middle-class society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1990 census found 26,600 households, or 4%, of total resident households who received income below $500 per month and had no working member in the household. The source of income of these families was not known. There were only 2,000 odd families on public assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 30% of these families with less than $500 income per month had three or more persons in the household and they must have been in dire poverty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1990 census also found 38,900 households with income between $500 and $999 with four or more household members. There were another 8,800 households with income between $1,000 and $1,499 with six or more members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statistics suggested that about one in 10 households, or 10%, in Singapore was either in poverty or vulnerable to poverty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another vulnerable group - the aged. From the monograph No. 1 (Census on Population) by Dr Shantakumar, the findings were: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore's aged population is growing at 3.8% per annum - among the fastest in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Compared to other age-groups, the aged form the largest proportion with incomes below $1,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Most of the non-working aged may depend upon personal savings (if any), allowances from children, interest, rents or dividends - this information is not captured adequately in the census. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Females have increased in number throughout the older population and more older women would be widowed in frail old age. Current provident fund savings are rather low for women aged 45 to 54 and this would be reflected among the future aged women. Widowed, divorced and single aged women presently make up to 80,000 persons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Some further worrying statistics about the aged show that 9,000 aged persons live in single person households and 11,000 aged persons live in non-family households. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 20,000 aged people may require financial and social assistance. The critical group will be those who do not own their homes, are disabled, non-working and have no savings or other means of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> support. What financial and social plans do we have for this sector of our society? I would like to hear Dr Hu's response to this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the part of the Budget that I found especially meaningful was the CPF Top-Up Scheme. I think it is a very progressive and equitable step taken by the Government to give $200 to each and every Singaporean over the age of 21 and to put this money into their CPF account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will take the necessary steps to open CPF accounts for those who have not done so yet and deposit the money for them and then tell them of their newly acquired wealth. If this is not done, then the old, the infirm and those unable to open their own accounts may miss out on their share. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Mr Speaker, how about taking the CPF Top-Up Scheme even further? Why not convert the CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS) into the plain CPF Top-Up Scheme. SOTUS only benefits those who are actively contributing to CPF accounts or those who are wealthy enough to contribute the required minimum sum into their accounts. SOTUS thus excludes the poor and many of the aged whose need for the money is far greater than those who qualify for SOTUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Instead of putting $200 for the CPF Top-Up Scheme into the ordinary CPF accounts of citizens, the money should be put into the retirement accounts which will give 1.25% higher interest rate. At present, the interest on the ordinary CPF account is 3.1%, I think, while inflation has been calculated at 3.6% and so in effect there is a negative return. If we can slowly build up the CPF retirement accounts of all Singaporeans over the age of 21 from budget surpluses, we will be moving towards self sufficiency and self reliance for each and every aged person. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Minister for Finance is renowned for his prudence and his innovative thinking - would he thus consider creating a CPF Endowment Scheme starting with $1-2 billion and building it up with budget surpluses slowly? The annual interest from this Endowment Fund could be distributed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the retirement accounts of all Singaporeans over 21 years of age. This should not be thought of as a handout but as part of the asset enhancement programme for Singaporeans. It will also help Singaporeans to be self reliant in their old age. Older citizens would then be able to hold their heads high and depend on themselves for their financial security. We would then truly become a developed nation without becoming a welfare state. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that Dr Richard Hu will consider the CPF Endowment Scheme and we will then have another instrument of social policy like Edusave and Medifund that works in the interests of equity and social cohesion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in concluding, I would like to congratulate the Finance Minister for a great job done for yet another year and I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Our ASEAN neighbours are likely to register robust growth. The Singapore economy is expected to continue to grow at 7.5%-8.5% this year, higher than our long-term sustainable growth. In short, our economy is in good shape. However, I have some concerns. I have three points to make this afternoon. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point number 1, to hold business costs. With two years of good growth behind us, our domestic cost pressures are intensifying. Rentals for office and industrial space are on the rise. The labour market will continue to tighten this year which will increase upward pressure on wages. Coupled with higher interest rates and the dramatic strengthening of the Singapore dollar, this will have an impact on the cost of doing business in Singapore. One example is our cost for industrial space is now the highest in the region including Hong Kong. This is a reversal of the situation of two years ago. The main cause of this is the slump of the Hong Kong property market and the strengthening of the Singapore dollar. The Singapore dollar has strengthened more than five percentage points against the US dollar in just the last six months. Whereas I support the need for a strong Singapore dollar to maintain investor confidence, I worry that our dollar may be going up too fast too soon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high cost of doing business in Singapore is the most talked about problem among the business community today. I am heartened to hear Finance Minister's recognition that the use of fiscal measures to allocate scarce resource may have resulted in some unintended cost impact and that the Government is studying possible changes to its fiscal policies to make the economy more competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unleashing of free and unbridled market forces can lead to excessive competition for a scarce resource in the short term. This happened in earlier years of the textile quota bidding leading to the weakening of the industry. I hope that the Government will look at a combination of fiscal and other measures in the allocation of scarce resource in order to contain business operating cost at a reasonable level relative to our capabilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help contain operating cost for Budget Year 1995, aside from the increases already announced, eg, the water conservation tax, the Government should hold any pending increases in public sector fees, charges and levies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that as much as possible, for future financial years, all intended increase in public sector charges and levies should be announced in the Annual Budget Statement. So businesses can in turn control their own budgets more accurately. Increases outside the Budget should be kept only to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now go to my second point on local SMEs. Singapore's economy has performed well in 1994 led by the manufacturing sector whose 12.9% annual growth and 11.4% productivity growth are the best in recent years. A survey of industrial expectations by the Ministry of Trade and Industry recently indicates continuous strong growth in the manufacturing sector in the first half of 1995. Overall productivity growth of 5.3% last year was also much higher than those of previous years except for 1993. But we have to be concerned about our local SMEs. Are they keeping pace with the national growth performance or are they falling behind? How are the SMEs performing in terms of productivity gains? From feedback, many SMEs are facing difficulties in regionalisation. Problems like insufficient funding, lack of know-how to regionalise and operating below optimal scale are some of the problems. This is in spite of the many schemes that the Government has implemented through agencies like EDB, TDB, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordination among the Government agencies assisting SMEs have improved since the Economic Report of 1987. However, pressures faced by the SMEs have also intensified in recent years. Apart from the tight labour market and their difficulty in recruiting workers, and the increase in business cost, regional competition has also increased, adding to their woes. Local SMEs need more than incentive schemes. They need the combined assistance of agencies like the EDB, TDB, NPB and SISIR to upgrade and compete effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not rethink about an old suggestion of a one-stop centre to help our local SMEs? I am not suggesting that the Government set up another large \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> statutory board to help all SMEs. Perhaps some parts of the existing agencies could be restructured and some of their relevant departments regrouped to form a unit to provide coordination and strategic assistance to those SMEs that are vital to Singapore. The Ministry could give direct grants to this unit which could then be held accountable for the overall assistance to local SMEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to my last point which is the retail sector. This particular sector is very hard hit and is fighting for the same and limited domestic market. In 1994, there was a reduction in the property tax for industrial, commercial and let-out residential properties by one percentage point from 16% to 15%. In his 1995 Budget Statement, the Finance Minister has reduced the property tax by 2 percentage points to 13%. The Government strongly encourages landlords to share this reduction in property tax with their tenants. However, we have feedback from the Singapore Retailers' Association that not many landlords are sharing this reduction with their tenants. Can the Government consider incentives that can impact retailers more directly? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a year since the introduction of GST which was implemented very smoothly. I would like to congratulate the Government for its efficiency. Now is perhaps a good time to review and fine-tune the GST system. One area that the Government can assist the retail sector is on the refund of GST to visitors. At present, we only refund GST at the airport for purchases of $500 or more and this has to be on one single receipt. This is not very shopper-friendly. For instance, I draw the comparison with Japan. In Japan, any purchase, except food, of 5,000 yen or more, which is about S$80, can receive cash refund immediately at the point of purchase. This is much friendlier to shoppers. Visitors need only surrender the receipt at the point of departure and subject to the occasional check of merchandise when requested. Other European countries give cash refund to tourists at different points of departure when presented with receipts. Minimum purchase to qualify for refunds is also lower than our $500. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major local distributor of electronic goods has told me that their sales have declined since the introduction of GST. He gave the example that visiting seamen who used to purchase large quantities of electrical goods have stopped because they cannot get GST refund when they leave by sea. This electrical appliance business is very price sensitive. Another major outlet is the causeway. I think these are some examples of the unintended fall-outs of the GST. The Government should review the GST refund to visitors. The Government may wish to consider point-of-sales refund together with lower qualifying minimums or, short of that, the setting up of more GST refund counters at departure points outside of Changi Airport. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I join my other Parliamentary colleagues in support of the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our economic success has been achieved mainly because of honest and competent leadership and the firm and prudent financial management of our limited resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget for financial year 1995 correctly continues with the development process aimed at building a stronger foundation for sustained economic growth into the next century. Sir, as we all know, the world is now more compact and increasingly competitive as we move into the next century. With new and formidable players in the international economy who are determined to step up their pace to develop quickly, we face a serious challenge if we do not act urgently to enhance our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of our economy must therefore be managed in the context of this serious challenge in the international economy. Capital and technology are mobile and will vigorously seek locations where they will get the best returns for their investment. At the same time, on the local scene, we have to deal effectively with the challenge of the rising expectations of our people. Sir, the younger generations have grown up in a period of general affluence and have not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> experienced the hardship and difficulties which the older generations have. While we have to do our best to push and improve the quality of life of the people, we have to continue to remind ourselves of the need to adhere strictly to the principles of prudent financial management and living within our means. We cannot afford to be soft and complacent when we do not have any natural resources and our domestic market and human resources are limited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said this, I have to also point out that it is crucial that our Budget must address adequately the concerns and needs of the lower income workers, especially the mature workers, and those with lower education and skills. We have to assure them that they are not denied a fair share of our economic success. Sir, this is most crucial because we want to develop a cohesive society where everyone, regardless of race, religion or creed as well as social and economic position, can live in peace and harmony and can contribute to the nation's success as a strong, vibrant and united team. If we do not continue to have social stability, our ability to compete effectively will be seriously undermined. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's economy is small and open and vulnerable to external developments. Although the current external development is judged to remain favourable, certain developments, like the rise in the US interest rate, the devaluation of the Mexican peso, the earthquake in Kobe and now the US dollar crisis, can have an impact on our competitiveness. Sir, I think the Minister could help to explain and educate Singaporeans in simple terms how these developments can have an impact on our economy so that we can have a better understanding of how external development can suddenly change our economic fortune. Perhaps the Ministry can explain what measures it has to monitor these developments and to ensure that we are able to take timely action to limit the adverse impact on our economy. Sir, confidence is the important factor in ensuring that our economy continues to grow and that we are able to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> attract investment to Singapore to provide good and better jobs for our workers. We have to ensure that there is continued confidence in our ability to manage or weather any economic storm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these general comments, let me turn to some specific proposals. First, the issue of training of our workers. This issue has been discussed and recommendations have been made, both by Dr Ow Chin Hock and Mr Chew Heng Ching. Firstly, we should consider channelling part of the budget surpluses to the Skills Development Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, training of workers is a central factor in the way we manage our competitiveness. It is important that the lower income workers and the mature workers, particularly those workers over 40 years of age, are given adequate opportunities to receive training. The NPB has identified on-the-job training as one good way to train our workers. I think more emphasis must be given to this way of training workers. Although the Skills Development Fund will have increased earnings by virtue of the fact that the salary ceiling for contribution will be increased from $750 per month to $1,000 per month, there is still general concern that there might not be enough finance in the SDF. Therefore, channelling part of our budget surpluses to the SDF would be a good indication or sign that we take the training of workers very seriously and we want to make sure that they can be trained effectively to make us more competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the announcement which the Government has made recently on the adjustment of salaries of top civil servants, particularly those in the Administrative Service. Sir, it is important that in any salary revision in the civil service, it should cover everyone in the service, and not only the top echelon. The contribution and hard work of all officers in the civil service should be recognised and that they be equitably compensated for their contribution and performance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil service has been rated among the best in the world and it can certainly continue to be the best in the world. But there must be good and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> effective team work in the service. Senior civil servants should give due regard to the aspirations of their junior colleagues and help to motivate them to perform to the best of their ability. So as the relationship between senior and junior officers in the civil service is crucial to the effective functioning of the civil service and it would certainly help if, whenever there is a revision of salaries and benefits in the civil service, it goes to all officers in the civil service, and not only to a particular section of the civil service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economy has performed well and there are good budget surpluses for the past few years, from FY89 to FY94. With these good surpluses, the Government has given benefits in the form of 10% tax rebate as well as rebates in the form of rental and payment of Service and Conservancy charges to 70% of those who no longer pay income tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although this effort by the Government is considered to be generous, I share the same concern, and I have also received the same feedback, that many feel that not much has been done for the lower income. They felt that the rebates should be more generous to help those in the lower income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a suggestion here. Firstly, contribution to Edusave. What we can do is perhaps to help the lower income by making a bigger contribution to their children's Edusave. When we want to give rebates or return part of the surpluses to the citizens, we should do it in such a way that it is not merely a handout to those who are receiving it. We should try and do it in such a way that it becomes something which they can use to improve themselves. So by giving the lower income group better Edusave contribution, we can help them to see that their children can have better education opportunities. They can make use of this fund to help their children in education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel that when we have to make use of the budget surpluses to benefit the citizens, we do it in a way that we help them to use these surpluses or the rewards we have given them for the good performance of the economy to help \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> themselves. Edusave is one way we can do it. Giving workers a contribution into their CPF for training purposes is another way. These are some of the areas in which the Government can help the lower income to help themselves and we help them to be more competitive. In this way, they will see that they have the opportunities to share in the success of the economy and the success of Singapore, and we can build a very cohesive and united team. We need a cohesive and united team in order to be competitive in this world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded with beyond 4.30 pm and the proceedings thereon be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 at this day's sitting. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget can be said to be a very generous one. Apart from giving the taxpayers a 10% tax rebate, it also gives the residents of HDB flats rebates in rental and service and conservancy charges as well as CPF top-up amounting to $500 for each citizen of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, both the higher and lower income people will benefit from this Budget. Those who live in 1-room and 2-room flats will receive the most benefit. This shows that the Government is very concerned with the lower-income group of people and has tried to give them greater assistance, and keep its promise to let the people share in the fruits of our economic success by enhancing their assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement, the Finance Minister mentioned two challenges facing our people: (1) How to deal with the competition from other countries, particularly from within Asia, and (2) How to satisfy the rising aspirations of the middle-class people in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Minister that in the long-term, we have to raise our competitiveness through education and technical training for our workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also gave statistics to prove that presently 71% of each cohort of students will receive training at least in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). This percentage will be raised to 85% within six years, that is, by the end of this century. From 71% to 85% is a big increase. Assuming that in the next six years, the quality of our students remains the same, then we will see a drop in standard of our students in all fields of education. Therefore, at this point of time, we have to make a choice. Either we lower the standard to increase enrolment or improve the efficiency of our education system and raise the quality of the students to enable more students in each cohort to be given the opportunity to receive a higher standard of education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read from the newspaper that the undergraduates today are not good at analytical thinking. On this subject, I tend to quite agree with them. Apart from the really good students, most undergraduates are somewhat weaker in critical thinking and analysis. At the same time, they are not psychologically prepared to face hard challenges. I believe this situation of our undergraduates today cannot be said to have nothing to do with our school education system. I feel that the Education Ministry should look squarely into this problem and rectify this defect in our education system, so as to generally improve the quality of our students to enable more students in each cohort to receive a higher level of education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the training of talents, most people would focus their mind on technical training. From my point of view, whether graduates, skilled or unskilled workers, all of them equally require training. This is very important and necessary. On one hand, this is one of the necessary conditions for our economic reform to enhance our economic benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> On the other hand, it would enable the people of Singapore to have the opportunity to move higher in life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, I have been advocating that the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) open their doors to admit more graduates of the polytechnics, so that they further improve themselves. After waiting for a few years, I am glad to hear that the NUS will start a course, known as Bachelor of Technology, specially for polytechnic graduates. This is a good beginning and I hope that NUS will open more new courses so that even non-engineering students can benefit from the training. At the same time, I hope that the Polytechnics will also provide opportunities for ITE students to be admitted to some special courses to improve themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, when we talk about skill training, we often forget a large group of people in the lower-income group whose educational level is low. They can only do odd-jobs, sweepers, and coffee-shop assistants, etc. If we do not make some special arrangement for them to receive some form of technical or handicraft training, then even if they work their whole-life through, they will not be able to catch up with the pace of our economic development and enjoy the benefits of economic development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can divert some of the Skills Development Fund allocation, such as the 15% used on the training of management staff, and use it on these low-skilled, low-income and lowly-educated workers, it will certainly benefit them. Because of their low education, the lack of mathematical and linguistic aptitude, these people may not be suitable for training under the conventional method. Perhaps, we may train them to take up some traditional vocations, such as drivers, barbers, tailors or flower arrangers, etc. This may not sound sensible, but if you think carefully about it, you may find that it makes sense and may do them real good to master a skill which may earn them better income. Many of such jobs are now undertaken by foreign workers. If we can provide our own people the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> opportunity to be trained in these skills, I think we would not only raise the quality of their work, but also their income. Then, all Singaporeans, those who are doing well and those who are less capable, will be able to catch up with the progress of economic development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the changes in our society and the emergence of a middle-class society, we will find that people's mental attitude has been changing too and they are aspiring for material comfort and spiritual needs. In the Budget, there is an emphasis on the demand for cars and private property by the middle-class. As for the aspiration to own cars, we realize that Singapore is a small country and the number of cars that we can accommodate will depend on how much we can enlarge our road network and how well we can manage our traffic, or to suffer less mobility on our roads. In any event, the rate of increase just cannot be too fast. From the long-term perspective, we must endeavour to make the upper-class and middle-class Singaporeans feel that even if they do not own a car, it would be just as convenient and comfortable for them to rely on public transport. Therefore, I feel that the authority should give the terms \"convenience\" and \"comfort\" new definitions. Under the new definitions, we shall review the present public transport systems, including MRT, buses and even taxis, Bus-Plus and the LRT, etc., to make them more efficient and effective in serving the middle-class and upper-class people. Then, the pressure from the demand to own a car may be lessened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for demand for private residential property, more and more people are aspiring to own private residential property, and the simple theory of demand and supply will inevitably bring the prices of private property up. At present, we are facing a very big problem. The gap between the private property prices and the prices of HDB apartments is very big. The Government sells its apartments at about $200 per square foot, whereas the private condominiums and apartments are being sold at $750 per square foot. The big gap in their prices has brought about a big problem. Because of this wide gap, the resale value of HDB flats \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> has also gone up. Those who have the means to buy private property will find that the burden is getting heavier and heavier. Furthermore, with the resale prices of HDB flats getting higher and higher, the resale of HDB flats has become a speculative activity. More owners of HDB flats will apply to the Government to purchase bigger flats. As a result, young couples will have a longer wait before they can be allotted a flat from HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a country with limited land for use. The supply of landed property cannot be too much. But there should not be a problem as far as condominiums are concerned. The reason is, if our plot ratio remains unchanged or increased, then the sites originally used for HDB flats can be changed to private property development. Then we can set aside 20% of the land for use as private property development in line with the market demand. By so doing, we will be able to satisfy the people's demand for private condominium. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the wide gap between the prices of private property and public housing, I feel that the Government has got the responsibility to fill up this gap, because the gap between $200 and $750 is too wide. Perhaps, from the long-term perspective, we should encourage the introduction of medium cost condominium and high-cost condominium. Then the gap may be gradually narrowed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are determined to look after the interest of the middle-class and their aspirations, I think we will find ways to meet their demand and satisfy their aspirations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in the name of the Finance Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister recently highlighted the water issue as an example of some of the key challenges facing Singapore, it struck a chord with the Singapore public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members of the public and MPs have since spoken out in support of the increase of 5% points in the water conservation tax announced by Dr Richard \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Hu in his Budget Statement. Some have expressed concern over the availability of water supply to meet our long-term needs and suggested that the Government look into alternative supplies of water. Some proposed that recycled water from our sewerage treatment works be used for toilet flushing. Others have stressed the need to create greater awareness amongst the public on the need to save water and to make water conservation a way of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Dr Ow Chin Hock and several MPs have also made various suggestions, as well as asked some questions about our water supply and usage. I would like to take this opportunity to give Members a clearer picture of the water situation, and respond to some of the points raised by the public and by Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Water Supply</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain to Members the maximum amount of water available to Singapore from the present sources and under the existing Water Agreements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two agreements with Malaysia. The first agreement, the 1961 Water Agreement, gives us about 86 million gallons of water a day (or mgd), and will expire in the year 2011. The second agreement, the 1962 Water Agreement, entitles us to 250 mgd, and the Agreement will expire in the year 2061. So we have a maximum of 336 mgd until the year 2011, and after that, if the 1961 Agreement is not renewed, only about 250 mgd from the Johor sources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservoirs and catchment areas in Singapore supply about 100 mgd, and after the year 2011, this means that all our present sources of water, both in Singapore and Johor, will only give us 350 mgd. And that is our limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Seriousness of our water situation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what about our consumption trends? Our water consumption has been growing steadily over the last 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> From 1985 to 1990, consumption grew at about 3.3% per year. However, consumption grew rapidly after that, especially in the last four years, averaging about 5.2% per year. While such a rate is already not sustainable, what is even more worrying is that in 1994, we recorded a significant increase of 6.5% in our consumption rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, Singapore consumed 260 mgd. Sir, if we continue to use 6% more water each year, we will run short of water in six years' time, ie, by the year 2001. But let us suppose that through rigorous water conservation measures, we succeed in reducing the growth in water consumption to half, ie, to 3% per annum, which is half the rate in recent years. Our water consumption will still reach 350 mgd a day by the year 2009, ie, before the 1961 Water Agreement expires. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was reassured to read the Mentri Besar of Johor saying recently that Johor will continue to supply water to Singapore as long as it can. But Singapore cannot afford to take chances with something as vital as water. We must do everything in our power to ensure that our limited water supply is used prudently and never wastefully. We therefore need to take immediate steps to reduce our water usage. Sir, I would like to request the Clerk of Parliament to hand out a Table (Cols. 241 - 242) which I have prepared. [Copies of table distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950313/19950313-HA-0640241.htm\">Table - COMPARISON OF WATER PRICES (Cols. 241 - 242)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, the Government is also actively exploring alternative sources of water. However, I must warn Members that any possible new supplies will be many, many times more expensive than current sources, as heavy investments will be needed. Furthermore, by international standards, Singapore's water rates are still quite low. Members can refer to the Table which has just been given out. If you look at the explanation below, for the first block of water consumption, we are charging S$0.59 per cubic metre for the first 20 cubic metres of water used per month. That places us just above Norway and Canada, ie, we are the third lowest of all the developed countries. And even if we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> include the second block of another 20 cubic metres, that will place us at about S$0.74, which still places us fourth from the bottom. So for the quality of water that we are supplying, this price is very low. It is, therefore, inevitable that the Government's water conservation tax and PUB's water rates must go up substantially over the next few years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of water in Singapore must reflect the true scarcity of this precious resource. The cost of water is not just the cost of collecting the rainwater from the sky in reservoirs, processing it, and piping it to the customers. It is the cost of getting additional water after rainwater runs short, when we must either pump water from long distances away in Indonesia, or desalinate sea water to get fresh water. This will cost five to eight times as much as rainwater. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Water Conservation Campaign</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go on to touch on the measures which we are reviewing to restrain water consumption. The PUB will emphasize public education in order to encourage Singaporeans to conserve water. As Dr Ow Chin Hock had pointed out, the previous save water campaigns were able to restrain growth of water consumption. The PUB will launch a fresh series of annual Save Water campaigns, starting in June this year, to coincide with our drier months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign will focus primarily on domestic consumers, as domestic water consumption accounts for over half of our total water consumption. As part of the campaign, PUB will also hold neighbourhood water-rationing exercises. This will help drive home the message that if we do not make saving water a constant habit, water-rationing, with all its attendant inconveniences, may one day be a way of life. In addition, the PUB will hold exhibitions and other educational programmes on a regular basis throughout the year as and when an appropriate occasion presents itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB will also be reaching out to the non-domestic water users, most of whom are in the manufacturing and commerce \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sectors. This will not be a new activity for PUB. PUB already routinely identifies major non-domestic water users, and helps them to reduce their water usage. The PUB also vets new projects that are significant water users, and ensures that they incorporate water conservation measures. I am glad that some major companies have already taken concrete steps to reduce their water usage. One good example is Shell, which has built its own desalination plant, and is now almost self-sufficient with regard to water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of PUB's on-going efforts, our overall non-domestic water consumption has been growing more slowly than our GDP for the past three years. In 1994, the manufacturing sector grew by almost 13% while its water usage increased by only 8.6%. The corresponding figures for the commerce sector are 9% and 3.7% respectively. This is encouraging but, nonetheless, we must improve further. Hence, the PUB will enlarge its outreach programme for non-domestic water users, and explore new ways to help them conserve water. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Water Conservation Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the water conservation tax is another key measure to encourage the prudent use of water. While the public education programme highlights the importance of saving water, the conservation tax links the message to the actual usage. It reminds Singaporeans every month when they receive their utilities bill that water is precious, and that there is a cost to its usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced by the Finance Minister, with effect from 1st April 1995, the water conservation tax will be increased by 5 percentage points to 15% for domestic consumers, and to 20% for non-domestic consumers. As the new water supplies will cost many times more, we will need to progressively increase the water conservation tax to better reflect the true scarcity value of water in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Recycling Waste Water</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been suggestions that we look into the use of industrial water for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> toilet flushing, which accounts for about 20% of our domestic water consumption. Industrial water, which is recycled water from the sewage treatment plants, can be a significant source of water for us, as a large proportion of the water we consume every day eventually is discharged into our sewers. Currently, the Ministry of the Environment recycles some of this water into industrial water, which is used by industries for cooling, washing and process applications. I would like to inform Members that the PUB is looking into the wider use of industrial water, including for the flushing of toilets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we try to curb the demand for water, the Government is also actively exploring the development of new and alternative water sources, to meet our future needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Limited Additional Local Sources</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility is to increase our local sources of water. We can build more reservoirs, for example, by damming up the sea between Singapore and Pulau Ubin, but the constraint is not reservoirs. The constraint is catchment areas. Already 50% of Singapore is catchment area. Besides catchment areas, like Mandai or the Western catchments, we also collect rainwater from the cleaner urban and less industrialised areas. This includes some of our housing areas. The rest of our land cannot be used as catchment areas, either because it is too built up, or too densely populated, or includes pollutive industrial activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Overseas Sources of Water</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is additional overseas sources. We signed an Umbrella Agreement with Indonesia in 1991 to jointly develop water resources in the Riaus for use by both Singapore and Indonesia. Under the Agreement, Singapore can draw up to 1,000 mgd of raw water from the Riau Province. However, individual projects have to be carefully evaluated, to make sure that they are technically feasible and commercially \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> viable, because they will require massive investments - at least several hundred million dollars per project. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first project is the development of catchment areas on Pulau Bintan. This is presently in its preliminary stages. There is also a long term possibility of drawing water from Kampar River in the Riau Mainland on Sumatra. The potential supply from Kampar is huge, but because of the long distances, by the time the water is brought to Singapore, the cost per cubic metre will be very high, perhaps five to eight times the current cost of PUB water. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Desalination</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also looking into desalting - desalination or reverse osmosis to turn salt water into fresh water. Desalting is expensive, but from the technical point of view it is entirely feasible as a supplementary source of potable water. Being an energy intensive process, the cost of desalted water will go up if oil prices increase. Based on the current cost of about US$20 per barrel, the cost of desalinated water will be about seven to eight times the current cost of treated water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA and the PUB have already reserved land for desalination plants in Singapore. A study team from the PUB and my Ministry will be visiting several countries with on-going large-scale desalination operations to study their experience. Depending on the conclusions of the study, PUB plans to build a pilot desalting plant in Singapore. This way, PUB will gain experience operating desalting plants, so that should the need arise, we will be able to fall back on this source of water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now respond to some of the points raised by Members. Dr Ow Chin Hock expressed concerns about the impact of the increase in the water conservation tax on low-income households, particularly those with large families. About 80% of households living in HDB rental flats and 60% of 3-roomers use less than 20 cubic metres of water per month. The fact is that water charges are low. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bill for using 20 cubic metres of water is only $11.20. Families using double that amount, ie, 40 cubic metres of water, pay $28.80 a month. Their conservation tax will increase by 80 cents under the 5 percentage point increase announced by Dr Hu. Only about 3% of HDB rental households and 6% of 3-roomers consume more than 40 cubic metres of water a month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether for low-income families with large families, could we have a threshold system based on a per capita basis. While such a system is possible, it would be costly and difficult to implement and to operate. Why? Because some of the problems would be that PUB must then keep track of the number of people residing at a particular address and update their records all the time. PUB will also need to keep track of births and deaths, marriages and movement of people in and out of each household. Implementing such a system will definitely be very expensive, and the costs will ultimately have to be paid by the consumers in the form of higher tariffs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, there is no reason to have a 20 cubic metre threshold. Since water is precious, in principle, the water conservation tax should apply to every drop of water that we use. This would also resolve the anomaly of big families being discriminated against on the 20 cubic metre threshold quantum. The Government will not change the system at the moment, but will keep the question of the appropriate threshold for the water conservation tax in mind when it reviews water rates and taxes every year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been other suggestions, eg, the use of underground caverns to store water. I would like to assure this House that the PUB will be looking into all suggestions and exploring all possibilities for reducing water consumption and increasing the supply of water. We will consider again proposals which were not viable in the past but which may now be viable. We will explore possibilities which are not viable now, but which in future may be viable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a secure water supply is a major long-term challenge for Singapore. Over the years, the Government and the PUB have taken decisive actions to develop domestic water sources to the limit, to meet the growing needs of the economy, and to promote water conservation. Through a combination of these measures, we have up to now been able to postpone the day when demand for water exceeds supply of water. But this approach is reaching its limits, because our traditional sources of water cannot increase much further to meet our needs, which continue to grow. In fact, in the year 2011, when the 1961 Water Agreement expires, the supply will shrink. This is why water is always a matter of utmost seriousness to us. Hence, the Government is developing alternative water sources in Indonesia, and is now actively exploring desalting as an important supplementary source of potable water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we will solve the water problem. Even if we have to desalt every drop of water that we drink or cook with, as countries do in the Middle East, we can do so. It will cost us a lot of money, but it will not bankrupt us. Fortunately, we do not have to do this, as we still have other sources available. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs the close cooperation of all Singaporeans to tackle this challenge. Every Singaporean must do his or her part to control water consumption. Water is a scarce resource. We must therefore make water conservation a way of life. By planning well ahead, by boldly taking the necessary tough decisions, we will ensure that all Singaporeans will have adequate water to maintain our quality of life for many years to come. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened to the Minister's suggestion that we should use industrial water for flushing of toilets. I thought that it would be fair for me to give the experience in Teban and Pandan on what actually happened when we used industrial water for the flushing of toilets. Teban and Pandan estates were used as experiments for the use of industrial water. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Singapore needs strong reserves because unlike big countries which have plenty of natural resources, our reserves are the only wealth we have got. They are extremely important to us when we face a major economic downturn. Strong reserves also give us a strong currency and thus better purchasing power and lower inflation for our people. The recent Mexican peso crisis and the weakening of the US dollar show us how persistent budget deficits can cause depreciation of their currencies and threaten them with high inflation. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is there a negative side of high surpluses? The answer is yes, if they become a heavy burden on the economy or if we do not use the surplus enough to encourage private sector investments. Socially, it will also not be good if high surpluses become a heavy burden on the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with the Minister that Government burden on the economy as a whole is not high, I think not enough is done to encourage private sector investments, especially from the small and medium enterprises. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic policies have been favouring the MNCs and big companies. They have done well. And our high economic growth can be attributed to the very high value-added per worker of these companies whose output constitutes a large part of our GDP. But the majority of our companies, which are the SMEs and which employ the majority of our workers, are not having such high value-added and growth. Workers from these companies can feel frustrated because, on the one hand, they were told that the GDP is growing so strongly but, on the other hand, they themselves are not experiencing a corresponding growth in income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result we see today is a narrowly based Singapore economy whose growth rate is highly dependent on relatively few companies. At the same time, the majority of our companies and workers are not moving up fast enough out of the lower value-added industry. They are facing the danger of losing their businesses and their jobs to the fast developing countries in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is clear. The Government must tackle urgently this structural problem of the economy. Government must do more to help the SMEs to grow. It can help them in two ways: first, encouraging them to invest, retrain their workers and upgrade their operations; and, second, lowering their costs of doing business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, I think investment allowance for the additional depreciation of capital investment should be given more generously to local SMEs. On this, may I ask the Minister whether he has statistics to show how much investment allowance has been given out and in what proportion between the big and the smaller companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs can invest and upgrade their operations through a number of ways. They can upgrade through acquiring technology or know-how. For example, a furniture company can increase its value-added by going for better design. Incentives should therefore be given for companies to move up to the higher value part of the value-added chain. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to help the smaller companies is to encourage a big company in the same industry to provide the leadership. The current Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP) is mainly getting the MNCs to help upgrade their own supporting companies. It should be extended to getting big local companies to help upgrade smaller local companies. Left to themselves without a leader, smaller companies will never be able to agree on how they can cooperate in upgrading themselves. They will hardly want to upgrade the skills of their workers for fear of losing them to their competitors. But if there is a big company to be their leader, they will be able to benefit from the economy of scale, from better management and finance, and from training of workers. One example I can provide is the tying up between QAF and 16 smaller fruit wholesalers in building a large cold-storage warehousing for fruits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should also help SMEs to lower their business costs. With the weakening of the US dollar, any cost increase will be compounded by the difference in exchange rates. This will cause our companies to be less competitive. Government should therefore relook at how industrial land costs are determined and see whether they have become too expensive for the SMEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has decided in the Budget to withdraw the property tax exemption for land under development. However, exemption will be given to approved building projects endorsed by the EDB. May I ask the Minister why should the exemption not be extended to all industrial building projects? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the urgent need to help the SMEs, may I suggest that a national committee involving private sector businessmen be commissioned to consider ways to help SMEs upgrade on a national scale. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the distribution of surplus to the people. Giving money back to the people is not an easy task. Whatever ready cash that the people receive from the Government, they will soon come to rely on it as part of their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> income. The more cash they receive, the more their reliance on it will be. I therefore agree with the Government's approach of asset enhancement through HDB upgrading and CPF top-up schemes, and of keeping the payment of cash through rental and S&amp;C charges modest. The money that the Government gives through asset enhancement is likely to appreciate in value over time. In times of real need, these assets can be liquidated and the extra cash can be used. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I hope to see the Government do more is to help those who needed more help. Let me give an example. The CPF Minimum Sum has been raised from $34,600 to $80,000. Its purpose is to ensure that retirees will have at least a certain monthly income to see them through their old age. There are, however, a lot of older workers who will not have enough CPF savings to make up the required Minimum Sum. The CPF top-up scheme for all Singaporeans above 21 will help but is insufficient. We should therefore have a CPF Minimum Sum Top-Up Scheme to help deserving older workers to go nearer the Minimum Sum target. We want to encourage workers to work after 55. So if a worker does not have enough Minimum Sum at 55 and if he is prepared to continue to work after that, the Government should consider topping up his CPF if he or his employer can credit at least a certain annual sum into his account. I hope the Minister will consider this kind of suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if one were to look at the Budget Statement for \"give-aways\", one would definitely be disappointed. The commonly heard comment is why were there not more \"goodies\" for a year which showed sparkling performance. I must admit that I personally expected more \"goodies\". However, on reflection, it was not the numbers game that was the most important part of the Budget Statement. It was the underlying philosophy which I found most engaging and most enlightening. Let me elaborate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section on \"Laying the Foundation for Sustained Growth\" is an area, to me, more important than the \"give-aways\" announced. It stressed, firstly, social progress and social cohesion and, secondly, it focused on the two key new challenges for the future: (a) entry of new players; and (b) the development of a middle class society in Singapore. I would like to comment on these areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Social Progress and Social Cohesion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In economic terms, this refers to equitable income distribution and addressing the role of government in social programmes like public housing, primary health care and education. In all these areas, the Government has done well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we believe in a meritocratic society which gives equal opportunity to all through education. Here I cannot agree with Mr Ling How Doong on his philosophy regarding scholarships. Education is universally available to all. We have successfully addressed many of these issues. However, we can refine these areas to meet future challenges and give our citizens an even more satisfying quality of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Public Housing</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Upgrading Programme and the Interim Upgrading Programme have been welcomed by our residents. This is a very meaningful way to ensure that our public housing estates do not turn into slums like in the old cities, whilst at the same time enhancing the personal value of each homeowner's assets. In the area of the Interim Upgrading Programme, I feel that additional funds should be given to two main areas: (a) lift upgrading and (b) utilities upgrading - rewiring, changing of ageing water and sanitary pipes. This should not be a part of the allocation of $6,000 per unit, but could be funded jointly by the Town Council's Sinking Fund and the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance may be wondering why I am bringing this up at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this point of time. It is because I know that if I bring this up during the Committee of Supply, the Minister may answer that he would refer this to the Minister for Finance. So I thought that I would bring this up to the Minister's personal attention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person living in the block uses the lift daily, and the lift does not stop at every floor. With an ageing population, for the lift to stop at every floor becomes no longer a luxury, but a necessity. On utilities, it is just commonsense that tells us that it is of no use upgrading the exterior if the utilities are not functioning. Many would like to install air-conditioners in their flats and this can cause an overload on a block basis. I would urge the Minister for Finance to support these measures and to ask him also to seek the support of the Minister for National Development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system is sound and good, and 60% of each cohort now enters polytechnic or university. However, as the Minister has stated, education does not stop here. Education involves training and retraining or continuing education or upgrading. In this area, we must do more. I support the views given by my colleagues earlier. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups of persons who I especially want to see assisted. Firstly, these are the polytechnic and \"A\" level holders who, after some years at work, want the chance of a university education. Their chance of being accepted into NUS is small, so many go overseas at great costs. Many borrow from friends and relatives. The second group are the graduates who are not necessarily \"scholars\" or \"high-fliers\", but who are nonetheless doing well and want to upgrade in specific areas, especially that connected with their work, ie, after several years of work experience, they want to progress further. The courses that these persons may want to attend may be costly. There is no scheme to help these two groups of people. Perhaps the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education should look into the setting up \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of a fund to help these two groups. The SDF does not cater to these two groups. These are highly motivated individuals who should be assisted to further upgrade and contribute to Singapore's economy. Yes, the Open University is one avenue, but can there be others? Addressing these matters will indeed add to better social cohesion, as these individuals who are striving to help themselves would then not feel \"left out\" or \"denied\" because they are not the \"high-fliers\". They form the very important group of middle managers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement, the importance of regionalisation has been explained. However, some serious social problems related to regionalisation should also be addressed at governmental level. An example of this is the provision of hostels in some schools for children whose parents are overseas. However, this is costly. Can the Government assist in this area by providing grants or tax rebates? Furthermore, to keep families intact, opportunities for the family to be together should be made possible. For the wife who has to give up her job, should not some form of tax rebates on the husband's income be made possible? Also, could it not be considered making the air-ticket home tax-exempt? For example, a company may allow the employee to come back once a year and if the ticket is also tax-exempt, then the family can be together twice a year instead. I am sure that our very efficient Inland Revenue Authority is capable of drawing guidelines to make sure that these socially desirable objectives are not abused. It is often not possible for the whole family to move overseas with the husband or breadwinner for many, many reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that requires a relook is that of the use of Medisave for our citizens who are working overseas and hospitalised overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore no longer has a \"development\" bank. The Development Bank of Singapore now prefers to be known as DBS Bank. It is thus good that the Government has addressed the needs of the SMEs through the EDB venture \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> capital funds, and also to allow the EDB to make strategic investments in SMEs. This again is very important, as regionalisation must not only benefit the \"big boys\" but all Singaporeans, directly or indirectly. The EDB as a leader, mentor and master-planner, now has even more teeth to assist the SMEs. The EDB should be congratulated on its performance, and should also urge the other GLCs and MNCs to bring more SMEs on board in their overseas ventures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am comforted by the Minister's statement in paragraph 41, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It will keep the overall burden of Government levies on successful Singaporeans as low as possible, taking into account both income taxes as well as other levies like the foreign maid levy, and revenues from land transport, including COEs.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the issue of the middle class needs to be addressed. Often, we champion the cause of the poor, but are awkward in addressing the needs of the middle income earners. I must congratulate the Minister for identifying this as one of the two key new challenges for the future. One can see the very different approach to the problem by the Minister for Finance compared to that of Mr Ling How Doong. The middle class are a highly mobile people and sought after by many nations, both developed and developing, and even the underdeveloped. Their needs and aspirations must be addressed. The Minister has made a statement on the Government's stand on this. I hope that he will elaborate on the specific issues that he has addressed in paragraph 41, and I hope that in the Committee of Supply debate, his other Cabinet colleagues will amplify on this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bedok GRC, there are condominium units which are also ageing. Is there a similar plan for upgrading in a manner similar to that of the Interim Upgrading Programme? After all, they are also Singaporeans, be they middle class Singaporeans. Yes, the Minister is right, the needs of the increasingly large pool of the middle class need to be addressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I congratulate the Minister on the Budget and support him. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr John De Payva (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, going by newspaper accounts, employers or people representing the corporate world, like some Members in this House, are unhappy with one aspect of the Budget. Contrary to expectations, the Finance Minister has not lowered the corporate tax. But surely these people also pay income tax. Since there is to be a 10% rebate across-the-board, surely they will also benefit, at least as individuals and by large margins. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has introduced several measures to help companies become more competitive through employers, though employers expect much more from the good Minister. What about workers? Are they pleased with the Budget? Yes, they are, somewhat. They stand to gain from rebates and concessions announced by the Minister. Nevertheless, I hope the Minister would not think me churlish if I were to argue that overall the better off in society benefit more than the less well endowed. A person who has to pay $10,000 income tax will now save $1,000 because of the across-the-board rebate of 10% of income tax. On the other hand, a worker who has to pay $1,000 income tax will save just $100. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last financial year, a 5% across-the-board cut in income tax was given before a rebate of an amount not exceeding $700 of tax payable. In layman's term, it means that those whose income tax was $700 or below need not have to pay income tax. In this year's 10% across-the-board rebate, is it more generous than last year's? Would people again escape paying income tax if their tax is $700 or lower? I would strongly urge the Minister to retain the $700 cut-off point. Better still, why not raise it to, say, $1,000? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, Mr Goh Chee Wee, the Member for Boon Lay, then a Backbencher, drew needless blood from the Straits Times for suggesting that a good segment of workers earned less than $600 a month. Recently, in response to my question on the SDF levy, Mr Goh stated that raising the ceiling from $750 to $1,000 would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cover about 50% of our workers. This means that the take-home pay of workers earning $1,000 is $800. The point I am making is that we do have a sizeable proportion of workers earning relatively low salaries. They will not benefit from the 10% income tax concession. True, they will gain from the $200 which the Government will put into their CPF accounts. They will also earn another $300 if they or their employers have put $750 into their CPF accounts in an 18-month period ending 31st August 1995. But the well-heeled will also have the $200 plus $300 credited to their CPF accounts. Here, on this point, I would want to ask why the age of 21. Thousands of workers in manufacturing, in the retail, in the hotel or even in the civil service are below the age of 21. Why not give this concession to the working class? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the rebates for conservancy charges and rentals for HDB dwellers, we cannot but note that they are skewed in favour of the lower income. This is as it should be. It is good that concessions apply even to those living in 5-room flats. But with a large surplus, surely the Government can be more generous towards the lower income. Let me reiterate my point. Since we made an exceptionally high surplus last year, why stint on those who could benefit more from Government generosity? Here, let me state that I support the Minister's argument that as we equip Singaporeans with skills to compete effectively, we need to pay attention to those among them who are most able to create wealth for all. I say by all means reward these able Singaporeans. But look again at what we give to our lower income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still on the lower income, let us pause and ask: have we done enough to raise the skills level of such people so that they can move up in life? Members would have read in the newspapers of my recent criticism of seven professionals who argued that Skills Development Fund money should be used to pay for management training instead of training unskilled workers. I am happy that the SNEF supports the line I took. SNEF has made it clear that it shares NTUC's concern over the mass of workers with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> only primary education and with little or no skills. Both SNEF and NTUC want to have these unskilled workers given proper training to make them employable even if they were retrenched. But I am not sure this is going to be an easy task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older workers, those 40-plus and without skills, are the most vulnerable should there be an economic downturn. But because the economy is humming along nicely, many do not see the need to go for training. Why? Because they are tired after a hard day's work or they prefer to do overtime to earn a little extra. Whatever the reason, a number of these workers are not training. By training, they may lose out on additional income. They may be having additional jobs, part-time jobs, to make up for the shortfall. Here is where subsidies can be given to encourage this cohort to go for skills upgrading. Some form of make-up payment, if I may suggest, for loss of income arising out of availing oneself for training or re-training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of Singaporeans which should also be given appropriate training. I refer to the thousands of women who have either dropped out of the job market to look after children or who have never worked. They need to be lured back to the labour market. Funds can be made available to train or to re-train them. By them taking up jobs, perhaps we can restrict the number of foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the surface, this year's Budget appears to please everyone. There is no increase in personal income tax and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has not been increased. On top of that, the Government is unconditionally giving $200 to every Singapore citizen above the age of 21. However, the people of Singapore will not forget that the GST has already been implemented since the last financial year. Although the GST is a mere 3%, it has enabled the Government to collect a revenue of $1.5 billion in the last financial year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that the GST revenue estimate took a sudden jump \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from the original $960 million to $1.5 billion. The Government expects to collect $1.6 billion next year. Will the Government's GST collection exceed its estimate again? Let us wait and see. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, the governments normally expend more than their budget. But in Singapore, the Government's net income exceeded its budgeted amount. This must be another \"First in the World\"! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the huge increase in GST collection, the Government has also announced that offsets against the GST will be increased from the original $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion. As such, the Government is saying that the GST is revenue negative. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand how the Government works out its sums. What I know is that in order to offset the impact of GST on the people of Singapore in general, one of the measures was to pay one to three months of service and conservancy (S&amp;C) charges and rentals of some HDB dwellers, for which the Government paid out $28 million. As for the other measures, they would only cause a reduction in the Government's revenue. How do these measures implemented together with the GST suddenly increase so greatly? I would like the Minister for Finance to enlighten us on this. Who are the people favoured by the Government to receive such unexpected windfall in these measures? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the GST, the Government promised that the corporate tax would be reduced to 25%. But this year, because of the fear of overheating the economy, the corporate tax is not further reduced. If corporate tax is not reduced and Singapore is still able to retain its competitiveness in the international market, then the Government's earlier argument of implementing GST so that the corporate tax could be reduced in order to be competitive in the international market just cannot hold water any more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in 1994, the average labour cost in the manufacturing sector was not any lower than 1993. It is worrying to see from the economy as a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whole that the average labour cost has, in fact, increased by 1.9%, which is higher than the cost in 1993. Compared to other Asian NIEs, in terms of US dollars, I think the relative competitiveness of Singapore is declining. Furthermore, with the exchange rate of the US dollar declining and the Singapore dollar remaining so strong, I believe that our competitiveness will decline. If the Government does not try to lower the cost of doing business in Singapore, our economy will surely be affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fiscal measures in this year's Budget, the 10% rebate on personal income tax across the board is of no great benefit to the lower-income people. According to the Government, the majority of Singaporeans do not need to pay any income tax after the implementation of GST. Therefore, the 10% rebate will only enable the higher income group to receive even more benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more disappointing is that the Government is only prepared to pay the same amount as in last year in respect of the S&amp;C charges for the HDB dwellers. Since the GST has increased the Government's revenue and surpluses have increased so much, logically, more should be given back to the residents, especially those in the smaller flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their income is lower, many of them cannot enjoy the 10% across-the-board income tax rebate. Furthermore, they also cannot benefit from the tax rebate allowed to offset GST which was originally set at $700 but has been reduced to $650. This lower-income group does not get any real benefit and every day they have to pay GST to the Government. Is it fair to them? In the next financial year, the Government should try and compensate this group of people for their losses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, after the implementation of GST, when the Government is providing tax rebates and returning some of its budget surpluses to the people, it should consider the GST tax burden of the individual families. A family with more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> members, where the wife is a housewife and the children are still young and not economically active, and with retired parents or siblings who are still schooling, the GST tax burden will certainly be higher. The Government should alleviate the GST tax burden of such families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government is strongly promoting the enhancement of family cohesiveness and encouraging children to maintain their parents, there is nothing in this year's Budget to put this policy into effect. On the contrary, the Government is introducing measures with punitive implications. The water conservation tax is one example. Of course, water is precious and Singapore lacks water resources. Encouraging people to save water is a right thing to do. But using 20 cubic metres as the standard, irrespective of the size of the family, and punish those who use water in excess of the quantity fixed by the Government, branding them as \"wasting water\" and making them pay the water conservation tax, is just too arbitrary. I hope that some originally filial children and daughters-in-law will not make a fuss when their parents take a bath too many times during the hot weather, and stirring the whole family into a tempest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is no different from that of the previous year. Apart from the financial sector which will receive quite a lot of benefits, the cost pressure on the other businesses has not been reduced and there is no tangible improvement in the international competitiveness of Singapore. Yet, this huge monster in the form of GST is hanging over the life of the people of Singapore. The lower-income families with large family sizes, and those with heavy financial burden do not seem to get much compensation from this Budget. As compared with the previous year's Budget, this year's Budget is merely an \"old medicine in a new bottle\"! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me state my support for the Budget announced by the Finance Minister. This afternoon, I heard with regret the speeches by Mr Ling How Doong, a Nominated MP and Mr Low Thia Khiang. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Mr Low said that this year's Budget appears superficially to be one that would please everybody. I think this is a very unfair comment on a budget so carefully and thoughtfully presented by the Finance Minister on behalf of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the newspapers, whether Chinese newspapers or the English newspapers, share the view that this is one budget that will benefit everybody. It is a farsighted budget. If you say that this year's Budget is no different from last year's, then it only goes to show that the budgets presented by the Finance Minister and the Government are consistently far-sighted. What they have done is for the long-term benefits of the nation and not like what Mr Ling How Doong is advocating - to turn Singapore into a welfare state. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Mr Low said that the GST is a huge monster. I tend to agree with him to a certain degree because GST has become a part of life in Singapore. However, the revenue increase from GST is basically due to two main factors: firstly, the consuming power of our people has increased and, secondly, the extent of inflation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for inflation, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has already given its explanation. Inflation is well under control. Because our economic performance is good, people have better purchasing power - that is the reason why the revenue from GST has increased. This is a very fundamental point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. A resident of a 1-room or 2-room flat has an income of $800 per month. If his income is more than $800, then it will not be possible for him to live in a 1-room or 2-room rented flat. If his annual income is, say, $10,000, 3% is $300. From the 10% rebate on income tax given by the Government and the rebate on the S&amp;C charges, the benefit he gets is more than $300. So the net income is more even after paying his GST. When Mr Low criticised the GST and the Budget, he should have thought more carefully along this line. He was wrong in his calculation, just like Mr Chiam See Tong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of GST in Singapore is still in a very preliminary stage, but it appears to have been accepted by the people already. While we are still trying out this GST system, I think we have to look at it on a long-term basis, and not be short-sighted in our approach. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Nominated MP made his plea on behalf of the people and workers in the lower income group. I do agree with him in many aspects. Personally, I have conducted a lot of house-to-house visits and I have met a lot of residents in the lower-income group. In many aspects I agree with what he said. However, I feel that if we want to help the members of the lower-income family, we should take a more long-term view. Most senior members of these low-income families have low educational level, and they are unskilled. Therefore, our duty is to see how we could help them to improve the prospects of their children so that the next generation will be better-off with better education and higher skills level in order that they may be able to stand on their own feet in a highly competitive society like ours. This is the most important point. Of course, we can give them some immediate benefits like rebates in S&amp;C charges, income tax rebate as well as CPF top-up. There are also many other things we could do. Some residents asked for rebate in telephone charges because they could not afford to engage private tutors for their children, so they have to use the telephone to discuss homework with their classmates. So the telephone bill is costly. Some asked for rebate in electricity charges, and so on and so forth. Some even asked for rebate in water charges. We heard from the Minister just now that water is of vital importance to us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a certain extent, I agree with the concern of the Minister as to how we could help the lower income family. However, we cannot just have one uniform measure to help them. I think we should think more positively and ask the Minister whether he could implement some measures to help the lower-income people with large families. We must not just criticize that this Budget does not benefit the poor. We have to come out with some constructive suggestions on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> how to help the poor families. If you say 20 cubic metres are not enough, then how much do you want? 100 cubic metres? 200 cubic metres? I feel that Mr Low Thia Khiang should be more patient and allow the Minister more time to give us more details on how to help the lower-income families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that the Government will consider the suggestions by the Nominated MP and the other MPs that, while considering the long-term benefits, it should also see if some short-term policies may be adopted to assist and help the lower-income Singaporeans. As it is said, \"Water from afar cannot help to put out a fire nearby\". I hope that the Minister will seriously consider this matter. \n  <br>5.03 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance is certainly one that is welcomed by most Singaporeans. The general population can certainly be pleased with the rebates in the HDB rental, service and conservancy charges, the CPF top-up as well as the easing of their tax burden. It is good that the Government is distributing these goodies across-the-board and it should be such as these handouts are to a large extent a refund of the excess GST collected in 1994. The GST being a broad-based tax which affects all Singaporean consumers, it is only right that the excess collected be distributed equitably to Singaporeans at large. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I welcome the Budget Statement, I cannot help but feel that pensioners and retirees do not stand to gain much from the rebates and easing of their tax burden. I believe this issue was raised last year when the GST was introduced. I do not see it being addressed in this Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, monies from the Central Provident Fund and pension are not subject to tax. Yet our retirees who have withdrawn their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> CPF and are receiving pension find themselves subject to taxation when they spend their hard-earned savings. In this year's tax changes for individuals, the retirees are treated no different from the other income earning Singaporeans. They ought to be treated more generously. After all, these people have done their fair share in contributing to the Singapore economy during their working years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also feel that the worries of the small retail business owners are not adequately catered for in the Budget. The past year had seen overheads rising for all these small businesses and they are finding it harder to make ends meet. The introduction of the GST has resulted in a reduction in their profits. Many had to absorb the cost of the GST in order to be more competitive and to retain their market share. The strengthening of the Singapore dollar too has also affected the business of those who depend on tourist clientele. With further strengthening of the Singapore currency, the Government may have to review the viability of Singapore being marketed as a shopping destination for tourists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the reduction in the property tax rate from 15% to 13% is aimed at reducing costs for the industrial and commercial sectors, many small business owners may not benefit from it. By and large, they rent the premises they conduct their business in. Though the Minister has encouraged landlords to pass on the tax reduction to the tenants, this may not happen especially as rents are normally determined through tender. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area I would like to touch upon is with regard to estate duty. Sir, I understand the limit of exemption from estate duty was last fixed in 1984 at $500,000 for liquid assets and $3 million for immovable properties. I feel these figures are badly in need of a review considering the large income and asset inflation that has taken place over the last 11 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this tax is known to be referred to as a misery tax for when a head of family dies, the family has not only lost a breadwinner, but also suffers the misfortune of having to bear \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> additional tax burden. Like the Malay saying goes, Sudah jatoh di timpa tangga pula. One may even question the justification for such a tax. A man has already paid his due tax on his income earned during his lifespan. He has to pay again when he dies. It is a form of double taxation. For Muslims, it is a triple tax. This is because Muslims also pay to MUIS and other recognised bodies an annual tax on accumulated wealth. I believe the Government has no fixed formula to determine the ceiling for exemption from estate duty. The figures are simply reviewed from time to time. I urge the Minister to review it on a more periodic basis. Where estate duty is concerned, if we do have to err, we should err on the generous side. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to commend the Minister for a good and cautious Budget. While I support the motion, I hope the Minister will consider the points raised. It will further enhance the Government's image of one that cares and has compassion for all its citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the economic performance for last year at 10.1% GDP growth was indeed creditable, probably better than many of us expected. Even more comforting was the fact that growth was broad-based, which augurs well for all sectors again this year. Moreover, inflation was kept at 3.6%, despite the introduction of the GST of 3%. This good performance, I believe, did not occur by chance, but is a result of sound economic and financial policies of the Government. I congratulate the Government for a job well done, especially the measures taken to ameliorate the impact of GST which became a non-event. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for the next financial year appears to be a cautious one in order to prevent overheating the economy, yet contains the essential elements of a good budget. It rewards one-off those who have contributed to our economic growth, and it carries measures to promote the further growth of our financial markets. It is prudent to be cautious in the face of greater uncertainty in the world, increased cost pressures and an expected lower \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> growth rate of 7.5% to 8.5%. It is better to have financial policies that are long term and sustainable than to have populist ones that may have to be unravelled when the short term euphoria is ended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on some of these fiscal policies in greater detail. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Expenditure Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Government's FY95 Budget's spending priorities on defence, education, infrastructure, healthcare and quality public housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on defence. Defence takes up about 28.9% of the $19.5 billion budget and this is the largest share. It is up from 20% from FY94. Although I recognise the importance of defence, being an NSman myself, I would like to ask the Minister what accounts for the bulk of this increase and what measures do we have to account for the effectiveness of this higher expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on education. The education budget takes up 18.8% share and is the second largest. It is up 8% from FY94. At $3.71 billion, it is only 3.25% of GDP. Most countries spend between 3% and 5% of GDP on education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made great strides in the field of education, especially in the provision of tertiary education to our children. Our stated targets are places for 20% of each cohort for university and 40% for polytechnics. It is a vast improvement over having just NUS, NTU, Singapore and Ngee Ann Polytechnics not too long ago. Yet, frequent questions are still being raised on whether we are spending enough to increase the number of places at the two universities, NUS and NTU, to meet the needs and aspirations of our students who qualify. Too many students are still being turned away because of our stringent admission criteria, some because of the quota imposed as part of our overall manpower planning policy, and others because of the high cut-off points arising from keen competition. The more fortunate ones from wealthier families go overseas to UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to get degrees of their choice. Some of them return home \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to Singapore after graduation, others do not. The question I have is whether we have assessed the extent of this brain drain on our manpower resources. Are we able to cost it, including the outflow of foreign exchange? Are we able to measure it against the cost and benefit of creating more places here for such students, without sacrificing quality and standard? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expressed concerns in the past about over producing graduates and the inability of the local labour market in absorbing them. If this happens, the Government fears that these graduates might be disenchanted, disillusioned and eventually emigrate, leading to a brain drain too. I believe the situation today is slightly altered. With the push for regionalisation, our labour market is no longer just the Singapore labour market, but that of the region. It is a much bigger market, with easy mobility for many entrepreneurs and professionals. With the Government's encouragement for each person to be educated to his or her highest potential, a polytechnic education for many is not enough. We have evidence of many polytechnic graduates competing for places in NTU and NUS. Those who have gained admission, I am told, do very well. Others who have gone overseas instead have done equally well, doing Singapore proud. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: should we restrict the number of places at our two universities to 20% of each cohort, knowing that the people's aspirations are rising, the demand for such places is increasing, and many can qualify and do well? I believe the budget is not the issue. We can afford to spend more on education. Perhaps it is even time to consider a third university to meet the needs of our young. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am heartened to note that the Minister thinks likewise. I quote from paragraph 25, Part 1, of his Budget Statement: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To cap the supply of university and polytechnic graduates is an unworkable and self-defeating alternative. It will slow growth and depress earnings for all, including the graduates, who will have few job opportunities in a stagnant economy.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a psychological and emotional perspective, I believe Singaporeans who have been educated in Singapore at substantial Government subsidy are more likely to be proud of Singapore, and call Singapore their home, even though they may live and work overseas or elsewhere in the region. University life is a short but intense one, and one that all of us remember for the rest of our lives. So would you not prefer that they be in Singapore during this period of time than be overseas paying their own way? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for university education is further manifested by the success of the OUDP thus far. Other science courses are being planned by the OUDP. I hope the Government will continue to support the OUDP financially so that the fees will continue to remain affordable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the relatively higher expenditure on independent schools, autonomous schools and the gifted education programme. As they have proven to be a success so far, I hope the number of places in these programmes will be expanded so that more of our students can benefit from them. Our talented young should be nurtured early so that our politicians, senior civil servants and captains of industry can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Edusave, I am happy to note that another $500 million is budgeted for the Edusave Fund in FY95. If the economy performs well again, I would like to suggest that this amount be topped up to $1 billion. Secondly, we should continue to encourage our parents and students to make greater use of their Edusave funds. The Government may also wish to consider giving Edusave grants to primary schools so that they will be better off financially to provide all-round education to our young. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Public Housing</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next subject I would like to touch upon is regarding housing. Our public housing programme is without doubt the best in the world today. 86% of our people today live in high quality public housing, especially in the newer public housing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> estates. The Government is spending enormous sums of money. In fact, the bulk of the capital subsidy of $719 million is for upgrading the older housing estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that has often been asked, as I visit residents in private housing estates, is: what about the upgrading of the common areas in private housing estates? Should not the Government also set aside some funds to upgrade the public areas in private housing estates? Let me say that these residents are not begrudging what the Government is doing for the older public housing estates. They are happy for those who benefit from the upgrading schemes. Nevertheless, we should be aware that many private housing estates in Singapore are also more than 20 years old. The few common playgrounds and parks in some of these estates are run down and in need of major upgrading. Drainage in some estates is wanting, as flooding during sudden downpour still occurs. Estate roads, which were once considered adequate, are now too narrow and congested, as many areas have been rezoned to a higher plot ratio for medium and higher density housing. I have raised this issue before and I have been told that the various Ministries have already budgeted for the maintenance of roads, drainage, parks, etc. in their yearly budget. But these amounts budgeted are just enough for routine maintenance only, not major upgrading. Upgrading is expensive, and this is why we set aside separately almost three-quarters of a billion dollars on upgrading for FY95. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that the Government also consider setting aside a modest budget every year for the upgrading of older private housing estates, estate by estate, starting with the oldest ones. After all, if you look at the profile of the taxpayers of these private housing estates, I am sure they pay more than their fair share of income taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Goods and Services Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to revenue and tax changes. I would like to comment briefly now on the GST. I am happy to note that the GST was implemented \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> successfully, and due to the high economic growth, the GST collection is now expected to be $1.5 billion. We have been told that the GST offset package has since been revised to $1.7 billion. I would like to ask the Minister how this offset package has been revised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I welcome the incentives announced to further boost fund management, risk management and capital market activities in Singapore. These incentives, I am sure, will help to further enhance Singapore as a financial centre in this region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On income tax changes for individuals, I welcome the across-the-board one-off rebate of 10% for Year of Assessment 1995 and the rebates on HDB service and conservancy and rental charges for those who live in HDB flats and who probably pay little or no income taxes. The one-off rebates allow the Government to vary the amounts every year depending on the economic performance and our affordability. I also support the CPF Top-Up Scheme, the reduction in property tax and the increase in water conservation tax. We should all learn to conserve our precious water resource before it is too late. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that the FY95 Budget is probably one of our best budgets ever, with a budget surplus of $5.75 billion. No economy is immune from recession. We should therefore save up as much as possible and invest wisely while the going is good. For the man-in-the-street, a good budget must offer opportunities for wealth creation and allow him to translate his hard earned income into greater purchasing power for him and his family. To achieve this, the Government must continue to attract investments to Singapore and, at the same time, create opportunities in the region. It must also redouble its efforts to contain the cost of food, housing and transportation, the three main components of household expenditure. If we succeed, the budget will continue to be a happy event and we can be assured of more good years to come. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy for FY95. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the most striking features of this year's Budget is the substantial budget surplus attained. In fact, a standard positive feature of the Singapore Government's Annual Budgets is the consistent healthy budget surpluses achieved year after year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the last three years. The budget surpluses were: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, the budget surplus before contributions to Medifund and Edusave was $4.9 billion. In 1993, it was $7 billion. In 1994, it was $9.2 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For financial year 1995, the Minister has budgeted for a $5.8 billion surplus, which is in spite of the huge provision of $18.5 billion for both Operating and Development Expenditures. This is a good $4.4 billion or 31% above the actual total budget achieved in FY94. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are proud to have a Government that could manage the economy very well, achieve high economic growth and, as a result, turn out routinely strong surpluses. We should compliment the Government for its capable handling of our economic affairs. However, Sir, looking at these surpluses, I want to ask the Government the following questions: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is the impact of the surpluses deflationary? That is, could we have achieved even better growth and create a stronger and more robust economy, if we had siphoned less money out of the system via budget surpluses? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, are we not taking away too much of the private individuals' and corporations' initiatives in investment making, as surpluses are taken away from them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are two of the many implications that I feel the Government can consider. In addition, I thought the Government can also consider whether to do a comprehensive review of our taxation and non-tax revenue system. Are we over-taxing the system as to stifle initiatives and growth? Are the taxes and non-tax fees charged fairly spread and burdened by the different segments of the people? Are we over-taxing certain \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> segments of the people? These are questions which I thought it would be useful for the Government to have answers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on to comment about some specific budgetary measures. First, on the CPF Top-Up Scheme and the CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS). These two contributions of $200 and $300 respectively for the two schemes are generally well received by the people. I am in support of these measures. However, I would like to raise a few comments that have been made to me by my grassroots leaders. One remark is that these payments do not help the very poor. On the other hand, the amounts are not that meaningful to the very rich either. For the poor, they cannot get hold of the $200 which is put into their CPF accounts, as they cannot draw out until they reach 55. As the Chinese saying goes, yuan shui jiu bu liao jin huo [ ] which means far away water cannot save near fire. So those people who need money cannot touch the $200 that has been given by the Government as a handout. Similarly, for the $300 SOTUS scheme, the housewives, low-income earners and unemployed are also disadvantaged. These people may not earn enough to make an active $750 contribution into their CPF accounts. And to expect them to put in $750 cash may not be within their means either. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One alternative suggested is that instead of these handouts of $200 and $300 each into the CPF accounts, the Government can consider creating a certain pool of funds to be targeted to help the poor families and under-privileged in the areas of education and medical costs. The funds to be allocated to these schemes need not be large and can be administered by the grassroots organisations of each constituency. For a start, we can consider allocating a block grant of, say, $250,000, per constituency. This amounts to only a total of $20 million for all the 81 constituencies in Singapore. This sum actually is very small compared to a total of $640 million provided for under the two CPF Top-Up Schemes. But it will be a very much appreciated gesture \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by the Government. If the Government can accept this idea in principle, I am sure the details and mechanism can be worked out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On relief for pensioners from the GST, with the introduction of the GST, I understand that there is a pool of people who have to pay GST and are not getting any reliefs. These are the Government pensioners who retired after 1978 and who are now living in small private houses. These pensioners do not enjoy the pension re-adjustment which affected only those who retired before 1978. Such pensioners who are living in private residential estates do not enjoy any rebates on the service and conservancy charges given to HDB dwellers. In contrast, they are paying higher property taxes with the revision of their property tax assessments on their houses over the years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government should look into some reliefs for this pool of pensioners. Perhaps, at the next review of pensions for retirees, some adjustment can be made for them to account for their GST payments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water conservation, I would like to comment that the proposed increase in water conservation tax on domestic customers from 10% to 15% will again affect the lower income earners. The low income earners are usually very thrifty and therefore are careful not to waste water. In contrast, the high income households will not be badly hit in their pockets as they have the means to pay, and therefore may not be as water conservation conscious. Hence, I feel that a more effective approach is through education. There can be talks in schools and corporations. Campaigns can be organised every year to remind the people. I believe that education and reminders are more meaningful and effective. I also believe that Singaporeans are generally very responsible and responsive to such Government campaigns. Hence, I would like to urge the Government not to over-use the monetary punishments as they would be adversely received and are in fact regressive in taxing the poor more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by commending the Minister for a comprehensive and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> well-meaning Budget. In particular, I would like to congratulate him for achieving a record budget surplus. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been a long day. I would very much like to raise a number of issues in the Budget but I will confine myself just to one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on two related issues in the area of education. First, the social implications of intensive education upgrading and, second, the need for Singapore to become a learning nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister pointed out that there has indeed been a significant increase in the proportion of the tertiary educated (graduates from the polytechnics and universities) to 54% of the cohort today with a target of 60% in the near future. Take university education as an example. There are many more university graduates now compared to 20 or even 10 years ago. While there were only 1,770 graduates in 1980, for example, there were more than 7,000 in 1993 and this is even excluding the thousands who have graduated from universities overseas. Graduates have to get used to no longer being at the pinnacle of the pyramid. University education has become more broad based. This massive ramping up of the tertiary educated surely has wide ranging social implications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, consider the salaries of fresh university graduates, for which data are available. Ten years ago, from 1979 to 1984, fresh graduates on average used to earn 1 1/2 times that of the average monthly earnings of the workforce. In 1983, for example, fresh graduates earned nearly $1,400 while the average monthly earnings was about $860. If one were to take gross median income, however, that would be of course less. Now, however, the ratio is 1:1. Fresh university graduates in 1993 received on average $1,920 while the average monthly earnings for the workforce was $1,918. In other words, 10 years ago, university graduates, even from the start of their careers, had higher purchasing power compared to the average earnings in the workforce. Today, however, the purchasing power of fresh university graduates in relative terms is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> about the same as that of the average wage earner. This is exactly what one would expect with the rapid increase in the number of graduates. This is not to say, however, that salaries of professionals and managers are not high in Singapore. An international comparison would show that Singapore's middle and senior management salaries are already comparable with those of developed countries and higher than those in many developing countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in the 1960s and early 1970s, the vacuum left at the top by the departure of the British meant a unique opportunity for Singaporeans to move very quickly up the career ladder. It was not unknown, for example, for Singaporeans in their early 30s to become Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, CEOs in the private sector. But that was in a different era. Now, while the practice of meritocracy still rewards the superstars, the maturing of the workforce plus the raising of the retirement age do mean that promotions will occur, but occur at a slower rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third implication is that society will have to get used to a longer average time spent in getting educated. By the year 2000, with 85% of each cohort receiving post-secondary education, those with only secondary education or less would face difficulties later on unless deliberate efforts are made to upgrade their skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three factors - the decline in the relative income of fresh university graduates, the slowing down of upward career mobility and a longer average time spent on education - can lead to frustration because they are changes which have been compressed within a short span of time. The good life is still attainable in Singapore except that it might take longer or the concept of what is a good life may need adjusting. Expectations need to be lowered. This, I believe, is one important social consequence of the heavy investment in education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which I would like to raise is the re-examination of the concept of education. In today's world, with rapidly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> changing technology, it is not only computers which become obsolete. Labour skills can also become outmoded very quickly. There is increased pressure to upgrade one's skills which is equally true for the top management as it is for the rank and file worker. Also, it is fairly common for a person to have two or three different jobs in his or her own life time, especially with longer life expectancies and the raising of the retirement age. It is therefore important to broaden the concept of education. Education should not only mean formal pre-employment education. It should also include the concept of continuing education for upgrading job-related skills. I believe Dr Arthur Beng has also spoken on this subject. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's fast changing world, learning should occur not only in schools and universities, but need to take place continuously throughout one's working life. In order to meet the challenges of more intense competition, it is time to actively promote the concept of a learning nation, a learning society in Singapore. Training and retraining need to become a fact of life, difficult though it might be, just as the 80 degree climate is for us. One way to do this is for the Government to encourage job-related training. This is already being actively promoted at the worker level for those with \"A\" level and below. There are many schemes in place for skills upgrading and retraining of workers. Organisations such as the Institute of Technical Education offer a wide range of courses such as BEST, WISE, MOST and TIME. Many of these are supported by the Skills Development Fund which is administered by the National Productivity Board, a key organisation spearheading this effort. I support the proposals made by Dr Ow Chin Hock and Mr Chew Heng Ching for increasing the SDF. Dr Ow has suggested transferring part of the foreign workers' levy. Mr Chew has suggested channelling part of the budget surplus to the SDF. It would be good for the SDF to be expanded to support \"A\" level and less worker education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are few mechanisms in place to facilitate and encourage \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> job-related training for professionals and managers - those who have tertiary education. While some companies, especially the larger ones, regularly sponsor such training, others do not. I suspect that productivity could be significantly enhanced if there was a systematic and regular training at the professional level. Take the recent regionalisation effort, for example. It would be helpful if a person going on an overseas assignment went to country familiarisation and cross-cultural communication courses before his or her own posting. While this is routinely done in larger companies such as multi-nationals, it is still not a common corporate practice in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that the Government give some thought to fiscal incentives for the purpose of encouraging job-related training for professionals and managers. The principle of Government subsidy for education is a well established one. Formal education in schools, polytechnics and universities is heavily subsidised in Singapore and justifiably so. If the concept of education is broadened to comprise formal education as well as continuing job-related education, then it would be logical for the Government to lower the cost of job-related training as well as formal education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two possible methods of doing so. First, the Government can give a double tax deduction for training expenditures, which means conceptually treating training in much the same way as capital investment. In other words, just as there is capital formation in the physical sense, there is also capital formation in the human sense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way is for the Government to subsidise, say, up to 20% of training cost. There is one other possibility - the use of the Skills Development Fund. However, since the SDF is financed by collections from the Skills Development Levy from employers, I suggest that the fund be used for training and skills upgrading of the employees, especially the workers. If the SDF is expanded to encourage job-related training for professionals and managers, then more funds would be needed. Of course, employers can contribute towards \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this purpose, but I suspect that this would be an unpopular measure in the business community. The scheme would also need to be properly administered. Some controls need to be established so that abuse of the system, such as sending personnel on junket trips abroad, is minimised. One way is for courses to be approved by some Government organisation such as NPB before being eligible for the Government incentive. If the principle is approved, the details can be worked out by the experts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I am fully aware that the Government should not do everything. The burden of training should fall on the company and the individual. I am also not advocating a subsidy mentality. However, job-related training is not consumption but is human capital formation and does enhance productivity. Since people are the only resource in Singapore, we need to equip them with skills not only before but during their roughly 40 years of employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support the financial policy of the Government but do hope that more can be done in terms of job-related training. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like other MPs before me, I would like to congratulate the Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu, for giving us a sound budget for the financial year 1995/96. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Sir, some Singaporeans were not that much enthused by the Budget Statement. Some went on to say that it was a non-event. Why was this so? Frankly, I believe that high expectations were raised unnecessarily by the media. The event was advertised in the same manner as programmes like \"Masters of the Sea\" or \"Under One Roof\". Maybe in order to get a higher television rating. Night after night, there were wish lists ranging from reduction of personal income tax to corporate tax. Everybody interviewed wanted something. So when these wishes did not feature in Dr Hu's statement, there was disappointment. Sir, I begin to wonder whether it is necessary to build up such high expectations on an event like the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the Budget Statement itself, I have a few comments to make. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to stimulate fund management and other areas in the financial sector, further incentives and tax breaks were given. This is good and it should be welcomed. While it is necessary to stimulate the growth of new areas with tax breaks, I think the retail sector could have done with some help. Everyone is aware of the tough times facing the retail sector. Yet apart from the reduction in property tax, this sector was left to fend for itself. Maybe the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board should have made a stronger case to the Finance Minister on behalf of the retail trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of financial sector, I think our authorities have a good system of vetting Singaporeans getting involved in the financial sector. For example, if one wants to become a remisier, even if he is a professional, he has to take various tests before he is given a licence to operate as a remisier in the stock market. I think this is good and it should be continued. My question is whether the same stringent conditions are applicable to foreigners working in our financial sector. It seems it is easy for a foreigner settlements clerk to head a futures company in Singapore. It is now revealed that his application for a licence in the United Kingdom was not allowed. My question is: are the rules the same for foreigners and Singaporeans? If not, Sir, this area needs tightening up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax breaks given in the Budget benefit large corporations, both local and foreign. This should be encouraged. But at the same time, additional help should be forthcoming for our SMEs. I would like the Finance Minister to consider a lower corporate tax level for SMEs, as one of the many additional measures to help our local businessmen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this present trend continues, local companies will be phased out in a matter of time and we will end up as a nation of shopkeepers and book-keepers. Surely we do not want this to happen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the Government is assisting the SMEs. But I am suggesting \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that more should be done. Maybe we should set up a separate agency solely to concentrate on the problems and needs of SMEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, SMEs here are to stay and the Government should do all it can to help them grow. Maybe the Finance Minister can consider these proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I welcome the tax rebates for the individual - an across-the-board 10% rebate, the $300 share ownership top-up scheme and a further $200 paid into the CPF account of every Singaporean over 21 years and above. The Finance Minister is indeed very generous. All this is possible because of the healthy state of our finances and the good economic growth that we are enjoying. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only regret is that the less advantaged in our society could have been given a little bit more, especially when we have done that well. $30 million given in terms of relief to 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-roomers is, I think, slightly on the low side. The Minister could have been a little bit more generous to the 1-, 2- and 3-roomers. The loss of revenue on the 10% tax rebate amounts to $234 million, but the relief given to the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-roomers amounts to $30 million. The question one asks is whether this is equitable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last observation of this Budget Statement refers to the question of the management of our surplus. Many have asked: how are our surpluses being managed? How are our investments performing? The management of our surplus should also be transparent. There should be some form of disclosure on the performance of our reserves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for letting me speak. I had not actually expected to speak today. So I must apologise if my speech sounds rather extemporaneous. I had to re-create from memory what I meant to say. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion at hand. But I would like to focus attention on one particular aspect, and that is, the question of corporate governance in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, before I go on, declare my interest as a practising lawyer and as a director of a listed company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in the Barings case that the fingers are now pointing to lack of controls within the bank itself. And the question that has been on everyone's mind, both here and abroad, is: can it happen in Singapore? The knee-jerk reaction to something like Barings is of course to tighten up everything indiscriminately. But I think that would be self-defeating. You cannot complain on one hand that we lack entrepreneurs and then, on the other hand, try to control every aspect of commercial life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state my position clearly. I am not against strict regulation to ensure that the market is clean. What I am against is mindless regulation that seeks to control everything, where regulators poke into every nook and cranny and try to control everyone in everything that they do. To keep the market clean, two things are necessary. Firstly, you have to have clear laws, consistently enforced, so that people know exactly what they can do and what they cannot do. For a businessman, it is not of any use to go to a lawyer and the lawyer tells him, \"Well, you know, maybe you can do this because the laws are vague. If you do this, perhaps you will be prosecuted; perhaps you will not be.\" That is no use to any businessman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, you need adequate penalties, so that a person who does break the law, when he is caught, sentenced, he should be deprived of his wrongful gains. It is no point having expended all the efforts in bringing a person to book if the penalties are totally inadequate and the person goes out of court laughing and grinning from ear to ear because he has just been slapped on the wrist. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in many aspects, the system that we have in place is the precise opposite. Very often, we have vague laws and we make it hard for a businessman or lawyer to know for certain whether a particular course of action is legal. And sometimes, very often, I would say, we have penalties which were set maybe 10, 15, 20 years ago which today are inadequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the second point first. I have previously spoken in this House about the inadequacy of penalties under the Securities Industry Act and the Futures Trading Act. The same holds true, I think, of the Companies Act generally. For something as serious as market manipulation, for example, the maximum penalty is $50,000 fine for an individual and $100,000 fine for a company. Will these penalties deter potential crooks? Will Members in this House consider justice to have been done if the crook who makes $20 million gets off with the maximum $50,000 fine, and can spend the rest of his loot with impunity? May I say that penalties like these are totally inadequate as a deterrent. It is like being flogged with a wet lettuce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said previously in this House that his Ministry would look into the possibility of confiscating the proceeds of white collar crimes. May I suggest further that some thought be given to expanding the court's power to make compensation orders, as is presently provided in section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Greater use of this kind of compensation order will not only give the courts the ability to deprive a wrongdoer of the fruits of his crime but will also take the strain off the legal system because it will avoid having to commence duplicate civil proceedings later on to recover compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code is the section that has, if my memory serves me correctly, nearly a 100-year pedigree and was not really designed for white collar crimes. But it is one of the options that I think we should be seriously looking at. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to my first point, since the Companies Act was enacted in 1967, it has been amended nearly a dozen times. It has grown by nearly 50% in terms of sections; in terms of weight, it is probably the largest statute that we have on the book. But in all that time, no one has really sat down and thought about rationalising the many sections. We have borrowed freely from other countries - from the United Kingdom, from Australia, from Canada, from Malaysia - and all these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> things have been stitched together in a patchwork quilt. They do not really form a coherent code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is particularly with the provisions that govern directors. In Singapore, we have anticipated some of the problems of corporate governance raised in other jurisdictions. For example, in our Companies Act, it is compulsory for listed companies to have audit committees, something that the UK still does not require by legislation. Part of the scheme of improved corporate governance revolves around the necessity for having non-executive directors. In listed companies, audit committees must consist of independent non-executive directors. The idea is that the non-executive directors should check on management to make sure that management is not abusing their power. The trouble is, as the law presently stands, if a person wants to be a non-executive director, he knows the extent of the liability, he would probably think twice and thrice about doing it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often conduct seminars for the profession and for laymen about directors' duties and the reaction I usually get at the end of the seminar is: how can I quit my job as a director? Because all the liabilities seem frightening when you look at them. To reassure people, I tell them the chance of being prosecuted is probably less than the chance of being struck by lightning on a golf course. But that is very little compensation to those people who are prosecuted, because one has to remember in Singapore that being prosecuted is a no-win situation. Even if at the end of the day you are acquitted with no stain on your character, you still have to pay your lawyer, and that is going to be very expensive. So it is no consolation to you that you will go down in the law history books as a case that establishes a point of law when you have to pay for this privilege. And, therefore, we sometimes find that giving advice to clients who have a risk-averse mentality, they say, \"Okay, right. Since you cannot tell me for sure \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this is okay, I would rather not do it and get into trouble in Singapore with all the attendant problems.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems of the Companies Act is that it is drafted on the basis of a premise that is no longer true. And the premise is that the board of directors will actually run the company. In small companies, this may be true. But the larger the company gets, the less likely it is that your board is involved in day-to-day running. And by the time you get to the size of a listed company, the chances are that your directors really have very little input, especially non-executive directors. They have very little input into the management of the company and they are, in a sense, at the mercy of management who feed them information. The board meets once a month, twice a month perhaps, but the day-to-day operations of the company are run by employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Companies Act does not recognise this simple commercial fact of life. While the original Companies Act was drafted way back in the 1860s, non-executive directors were not thought of. But they have now become a fixture of corporate life. This leads to all kinds of anomalies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look, for example, at section 160A of the Companies Act. This requires a resolution of the company to approve certain substantial property transactions between a company and its directors, between a company and persons who are connected to the directors. So, for example, if you have got a non-executive director of a company that deals with luxury cars, if this non-executive director's wife wants to buy a car from the company, technically, you should get a resolution of the General Meeting. You call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM) and you get a resolution approving this. But if the Chief Executive Officer, who is not a director, wants to buy a car, there is no requirement for a General Meeting resolution, when the Chief Executive Officer is in a far better situation to influence the pricing than your non-executive director. This is an anomaly that arises because that distinction is not made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Malaysian equivalent of this section, there is an exception for transactions in the ordinary course of business. This suggestion had been made before by various people, including myself, to parliamentary draughtsmen but has never been accepted because it is said - this is hearsay from the parliamentary draughtsmen who told me some years ago - that MAS will not accept something like that. They would rather everything goes to the General Meeting. In practice, what happens? People ignore this, nothing happens to them. But if somebody wanted to make an issue of it, they could make an issue of it, because that is what the law says. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have sections that are the legal equivalents of a drift-net. They stretch out for miles into the ocean; they catch everything in sight, the good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty, and then the prosecutor decides who to prosecute. For example, section 156 of the Companies Act which requires directors to disclose their interest in contracts to the board as soon as possible after they know of this interest. You take the director of a company that runs a supermarket. Technically, every time he goes into the supermarket and buys groceries, he is making a contract with the company. He should in fact then go back to his board tomorrow and say, \"I have bought $50 worth of groceries.\" There is no exception for transactions in the ordinary course of business. Everything is criminalised. It is not just a civil matter. It is a criminal matter. You could be prosecuted; you could go to jail. You have to make this disclosure even though all the other directors know of your interest. In the UK and Australia, these cases have come to the judges and the judges have said, even though the section does not say anything, if everybody else knows about this, no disclosure is required. And this of course is a commonsense approach. But this commonsense principle is not in the section, and that is the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section is section 163 of the Companies Act. This criminalises the taking of loans from the company by a director of a related company. Take a very common situation. Many listed companies \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have got dozens of subsidiaries. Their officers, officers of a holding company, are nominee directors on the boards of the subsidiaries. Many of these listed companies have car loan schemes. So the officers of the holding company take a loan. They do not realise that if they are directors of the subsidiary and they take a loan from the holding company, technically, they commit an offence, for which they can go to jail, for which they can be fined, unless the loan scheme is approved by the General Meeting. How many of these companies have actually put these car loan schemes to the General Meeting? I venture to suggest not that many. And if you go through the list of listed companies, you will find quite a number do not have the approval and quite a number of these nominee directors actually are guilty of breaches of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases of inappropriate criminalisation. Do hon. Members know what their spouses are investing in on the stock market? Well, if you are a director of a company, you better find out because if your spouse has an interest in the shares of your company, you are deemed to have an interest, you are supposed to make disclosure within two days. Otherwise, it is a criminal offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many of the hon. Members of this House have changed their address in the last few years? Did you bother to inform your company within two days? That is what the Companies Act says, two days. Otherwise, it is an offence. So we have cases of inappropriate criminalisation. Things that may be small technical breaches but for which you have a fine, a jail sentence, possibly disqualification from directorship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sections in force that push businessmen to do things that are commercially illogical. Supposing, for example, Company A has an investment in Company B. They have a non-executive director on the board of Company B. They want to increase their stake in Company B. What is the logical thing to do? Surely, you would talk to your representative and find out whether it is a good idea. If you try that and your non-executive director has got price-sensitive information which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is not generally known, Company A and its board of directors are guilty of insider trading. So if you want to increase your stake in a company in which you have a non-executive director, do not ask to speak to him, do not see him, do not have any input from him, do the investment blind. That is what section 103 of the Securities Industry Act forces directors to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are whole significant areas which are free from legal guidance, the whole area of nominee directors, for example. What are nominee directors for? Surely, to represent the interest of the companies that appoint them. But in 1965, a Singapore judge said that for a nominee director to report back to his board certain information that he gets would be disloyal. We have problems with determining who owes to whom the primary duty of loyalty. Is it to the company who pays you, or the company on whose board you sit? All these things require some guidance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than detain Members of this House much longer by carrying on this catalogue as I could go on for hours - you can ask my students that - I am not saying that the Companies Act is unworkable. I am not saying that the law is unworkable. What I am asking for is that we should stop for a moment and just stop adding sections without thinking about what we are doing to the rest of the law. We have not set out to look at the Companies Act and see how it inter- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> relates with other pieces of legislation, like the Securities Industry Act, the Futures Trading Act and with things like the listing rules of the Stock Exchange. The tendency has always been to add rules rather than to consolidate and to rationalise. May I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he might at some time consider reviewing this whole area of corporate law to ensure that the legal infrastructure we have is as excellent as the commercial and financial infrastructure that we have? If we want to be a world-class financial centre, I do not think we should be content with a selection of hand-me-down sections borrowed from various countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Hu, debate to be resumed, what day? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Tomorrow, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Five Minutes past\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Six o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1995/19950313/19950313-HA-0640241.htm\">Table - COMPARISON OF WATER PRICES (Cols. 241 - 242)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
