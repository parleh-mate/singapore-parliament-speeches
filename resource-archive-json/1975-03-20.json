I  have  observed that Rochore  Canal  is\r\n\r\noften  heavily polluted with rubbish and  oil  and\r\n\r\nclearing  up operations are slow and  poor.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, it continues to smell badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common sight to see a considerable amount\r\n\r\nof  rubbish floating down the Singapore  River  to\r\n\r\nthe  sea.  Sometimes you can even see large  boxes\r\n\r\nand  huge pieces of rubbish floating down  to  the\r\n\r\nsea.  Why  is this important river allowed  to  be\r\n\r\nleft  like  that? This is definitely unsightly  to\r\n\r\nour  tourists. I hope the Minister will look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps are being taken to improve the\r\n\r\ndrainage  around Newton, Kampung Java  and  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  areas? During the rainy season, these places\r\n\r\nare usually flooded. Since this is a central point\r\n\r\nbetween  Bukit  Timah/Thomson Road and  the  City,\r\n\r\noffice workers always have a problem during  rainy\r\n\r\nseasons.  This problem has been going on for  many\r\n\r\nyears. Can something concrete be done about it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the excavation work at Bedok is\r\n\r\nundertaken  by the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nand  according to the schedule the  work  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by  the  end of 1975.  As  regards  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  building  a  reservoir   there,   a\r\n\r\nfeasibility  study  is  being  made  to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether the soil can hold water. Construction of a\r\n\r\nreservoir will depend upon the result of the study\r\n\r\nand the soil test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the Member for Anson say that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  an improvement  in  the  general\r\n\r\ncleanliness  of  our canals and rivers,  with  the\r\n\r\nexception  of one or two. It should be so  because\r\n\r\nwe  have spent $800,000 on contract labour for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1973-74 to  maintain  and  desilt\r\n\r\ncanals  and rivers. In addition, we have  our  own\r\n\r\nfleet  of  14 excavators to clean our watercourses\r\n\r\nof  silt  and refuse. It is a slow and  unpleasant\r\n\r\njob,  and  it  will take some time before  we  can\r\n\r\nclean  all  our rivers. But there is  improvement.\r\n\r\nThere  will be more improvement if members of  the\r\n\r\npublic stop polluting the canals. The odour  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  complained about  is  the  result  of\r\n\r\npollution.  There  is  still  a  good  number   of\r\n\r\nirresponsible  people  who  persist  in   throwing\r\n\r\nrubbish  into  rivers  and  canals,  though  9.800\r\n\r\noffenders  were  taken  to  court  last  year  for\r\n\r\npolluting our watercourses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding flooding at Newton and Kampung Java\r\n\r\nareas,  I think there has been a great improvement\r\n\r\nin  these  areas. The duration of  the  floods  is\r\n\r\nshorter  now  and frequency of flooding  is  less.\r\n\r\nThis  is because Phase I of the project to improve\r\n\r\nthe Bukit Timah Canal has been completed. Phase II\r\n\r\nis  under study. It will take quite a long time to\r\n\r\ncomplete the work, and it is going to cost  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  money.  There are other matters which  require\r\n\r\npriority  and it will be some time before flooding\r\n\r\ncan be totally eradicated from these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

To give an example, the beach  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of Sembawang has not got even a single litter\r\n\r\nbin.  In fact, the whole beach is littered. Pieces\r\n\r\nof  glass are strewn all over the sand, and  is  a\r\n\r\ndanger to picnickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, patches of oil are regularly found\r\n\r\naround  this beach. Obviously they come  from  the\r\n\r\nshipyard  which  is  just a short  distance  away.\r\n\r\nSince  a good crowd of picnickers and swimmers  go\r\n\r\nto  this beach, why cannot we look after the beach\r\n\r\nand  keep it clean? Maintenance can thus be summed\r\n\r\nup in one word \"nil\". Let us do something about it\r\n\r\nso  that our citizens in that corner of the island\r\n\r\nare not completely neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am pleased to say that the grass\r\n\r\ncutters  have  kept the grass in  that  particular\r\n\r\narea neat and obviously trimming has been done  so\r\n\r\noften  that it is the reverse in the case  of  the\r\n\r\ncemeteries at Chua Chu Kang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nreconcile  what the Member said just now.  On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  he said that on that particular  beach\r\n\r\n\"maintenance can be summed up in one word `nil' \".\r\n\r\nBut  then  he went on to say that \"However,  I  am\r\n\r\npleased to say that the grass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncutters  have  kept the grass in  that  particular\r\n\r\narea neat\", so there is maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deplorable condition of the beach is because\r\n\r\npeople   are   irresponsible  or  careless.   They\r\n\r\ncontinue to ignore the no-littering signs. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Member  was  there when picnickers  may  have\r\n\r\ndirtied  the  place  again immediately  after  the\r\n\r\ncleaners  have  completed cleaning.  So  I  cannot\r\n\r\naccept  the  statement  that  there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nmaintenance.  There  has been maintenance  but  no\r\n\r\namount  of maintenance can prevent what he  called\r\n\r\n\"this   deplorable  condition\".  This   deplorable\r\n\r\ncondition  is  the  result of  littering  by  some\r\n\r\npeople who use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the long-term solution lies in\r\n\r\neducating  the  public. Until  the  public  change\r\n\r\ntheir  habits,  no  amount of litter  bins,  beach\r\n\r\ncleansing work and enforcement action can keep our\r\n\r\nbeaches completely free of litter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no litter bin in the particular beach\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member mentioned because when the  tide\r\n\r\nis  high it covers the beach. So there is no point\r\n\r\nin  putting a litter bin only to see it float away\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint of oil sludge, may I inform the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson that the shipyard concerned  has\r\n\r\nits  own  facilities for reception of oil  sludge.\r\n\r\nThe  PSA  also  has  its own facilities  at  Pulau\r\n\r\nSebarok  for removing oil sludge from tankers  and\r\n\r\nships.  The  PSA has also been taking  enforcement\r\n\r\naction  against  sea  pollution.  We  are  at  the\r\n\r\ncrossroad  between East and West, and hundreds  of\r\n\r\nships  pass by daily. Some of the ships  may  have\r\n\r\ndischarged their oil sludge while passing  through\r\n\r\nwithout being caught. This is the price we have to\r\n\r\npay for being in the centre of a very busy trading\r\n\r\nroute.  But whatever can be done is being done  to\r\n\r\nprevent pollution of our sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

This  is  to\r\n\r\navoid the collection of rain water which will then\r\n\r\nbe a breeding place for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as you walk further you find lalang all over\r\n\r\nthe  place,  as high as the waist.  If  I  am  not\r\n\r\nmistaken,  in  the burial ceremony of  a  Catholic\r\n\r\npriest,  on  24th  June, 1974, a great  number  of\r\n\r\nmourners had to fight through lalang as tall as  a\r\n\r\nman, and thick undergrowth. To make matters worse,\r\n\r\nthere  were many muddy potholes and pools of water\r\n\r\nall  over  the  place - ideal  for  mosquitoes  to\r\n\r\nbreed.  Such  conditions  make  it  difficult  for\r\n\r\nanyone  to move about in a burial ceremony  or  in\r\n\r\npaying respects to the dead. Surely, something can\r\n\r\nbe  done to improve this poor state of affairs  at\r\n\r\nthe cemeteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the plots for burials dug deep enough?\r\n\r\nThey  seem  to  be too shallow. A  terrible  smell\r\n\r\npervades  the  air because of the shallow  graves.\r\n\r\nAre  the  graves really six feet deep or  are  the\r\n\r\ngrave diggers taking things a bit easy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has given a\r\n\r\npoetic  description  of  the  graveyard  and   its\r\n\r\nsurroundings.

This is  because\r\n\r\nanti-mosquito measures are being actively  carried\r\n\r\nout all the time all over Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chua Chu Kang cemetery is one of the many places\r\n\r\nconstantly  checked  for mosquito  breeding.  This\r\n\r\ncemetery is 900 acres in extent. Only part  of  it\r\n\r\nis  developed. Lalang and undergrowth are  cleared\r\n\r\nat  four-weekly intervals, that is, once a  month.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there may be occasions when rainfall  is\r\n\r\nheavier  than usual, and this will cause  them  to\r\n\r\ngrow   faster  than  normal.  Hence,  the   burial\r\n\r\nceremony  mentioned by the Member for  Anson  must\r\n\r\nhave taken place near an undeveloped piece of land\r\n\r\nand at a time when clearing of lalang was due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can appreciate his very imaginative\r\n\r\ndescription of fighting through waist-high  lalang\r\n\r\nand  hacking  through undergrowth, I must  however\r\n\r\naccept  it with a pinch of salt. However,' let  me\r\n\r\nassure the Member for Anson that instructions have\r\n\r\nbeen given to my officers to see that the paths to\r\n\r\nthe graves are smooth and clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, graves are not dug six feet\r\n\r\ndeep.  They  are dug five feet deep, according  to\r\n\r\nregulations.  The Superintendent of Cemeteries  is\r\n\r\nthere to see that this regulation is observed when\r\n\r\nthe grave diggers do their work. In addition, lime\r\n\r\nis added to the fill to prevent smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can take it as a fact that public\r\n\r\nconveniences for men and women are usually quite a\r\n\r\ndistance  away from the burial site. I believe  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  that perhaps someone had to answer  the\r\n\r\ncall of nature at about the time he was there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification, if the Minister\r\n\r\nwill give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the graves do actually\r\n\r\ngive  out  an  odour, especially  those  that  are\r\n\r\nfreshly  dug and burials done within  one  or  two\r\n\r\nweeks. I can substantiate what my good Friend, the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, has said, regarding the odour. I\r\n\r\nhave been there several times and I know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this is true. I think it is most likely that\r\n\r\nthis  is due to the condition of the soil in  that\r\n\r\nparticular area of Chua Chu Kang rather than  what\r\n\r\nhas been vividly described by the Minister as \"the\r\n\r\ncall  of nature\". I think it has something  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the soil. I am not an expert, but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact that some of the graves do smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been my\r\n\r\nunfortunate experience during the last few  months\r\n\r\nto  have  to attend quite a number of funerals.  I\r\n\r\nhave  always thought that I have a sensitive nose,\r\n\r\nbut I have not come across the smell that has been\r\n\r\ndescribed.  It could be that others  have  a  more\r\n\r\nsensitive nose than I and the explanation given by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol is probably true.  I  have\r\n\r\nasked  my  officers  but they cannot  confirm  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is possible that since the  soil  is\r\n\r\nloose   after  a  grave  is  dug,  the  smell   of\r\n\r\ndecomposition might seep through the soil. But  it\r\n\r\ntakes  a really keen nose to sense it. Anyway,  if\r\n\r\nthis  is  so,  we will make further investigations\r\n\r\nand  may insist on a deeper burial in the case  of\r\n\r\nsoil of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered\r\n\r\nthe  point about lalang. As soon as lalang is cut,\r\n\r\nit  grows again after two or three days.  To  stop\r\n\r\nit, lalang must be uprooted and not cut, otherwise\r\n\r\nit grows again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the smell, the explanation is this. The\r\n\r\nlalang  is about six feet high. The grave  diggers\r\n\r\ncan  only dig three or four feet deep because  the\r\n\r\nlalang  is very high. The grave is also  not  deep\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  the smell comes  out.  The  main\r\n\r\nfault  is the lalang. The Minister should go there\r\n\r\nand then only will he know what is going on. I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  that this is a fact. If the Minister  goes\r\n\r\nto  that place he will then know it. It is a  long\r\n\r\ndistance away, and perhaps the Minister is  unable\r\n\r\nto go there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>An hon Member:</B> He has no time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Even among the  Hindus  too,  a\r\n\r\ncertain  group  does  not cremate  those  who  die\r\n\r\nyoung. They are buried. All these matters must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.  The main thing is that I  am  telling\r\n\r\nthis  House  that the problem of  lalang  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  Once  the lalang  is  fully  uprooted,\r\n\r\neverything  will be all right, the  soil  will  be\r\n\r\nvery  clean. Anyway, Sir, I beg leave to  withdraw\r\n\r\nmy amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead RCA 8101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise two questions under this\r\n\r\nsubhead. The Hawkers Department has spent a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  money  on  the  construction  of  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  to  accommodate the hawkers  in  sanitary\r\n\r\nconditions for them to do their business,  instead\r\n\r\nof  in  the  open  where they are exposed  to  the\r\n\r\nelements.  The policy is good. But the design  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  of hawker centres, particularly  the\r\n\r\nquality of materials, are open to question, and  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether such an objective can be  achieved.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in my constituency one hawker centre\r\n\r\nwas  built  with very old building  materials.  In\r\n\r\nother words, old materials have been used for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a new hawker centre. As a  result,\r\n\r\nthere  are holes in the roofs and gutters and  the\r\n\r\npillars are very shaky. When it rains, water pours\r\n\r\ndown   through   openings   in   the   roof,   and\r\n\r\nconsequently the whole hawker centre is flooded on\r\n\r\nrainy  days. On a sunny day the stalls  along  the\r\n\r\nsides  of the hawker centre are completely exposed\r\n\r\nto  the  sun. They cannot do business in the  sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the hawkers want to put up tarpaulin, they do\r\n\r\nnot get the permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the design of the stalls in the hawker\r\n\r\ncentres,  I  find that the size and space  of  the\r\n\r\nstalls  are  becoming smaller  and  smaller.  They\r\n\r\ncannot meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of the hawkers. If  the  hawkers\r\n\r\nwant  a larger wash basin or a wash tub, there  is\r\n\r\nnot enough space. So most hawkers prefer to have a\r\n\r\nclear  empty space for a pitch than a  stall  with\r\n\r\nall   sorts   of  amenities  that  restrict   free\r\n\r\nmovement. What I am trying to say is that if it is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Government to help hawkers by\r\n\r\nspending  so  much money on them  then  we  should\r\n\r\nbuild   some  decent  hawker  centres  which   are\r\n\r\npractical  and  will meet their requirements.  The\r\n\r\nhawkers  will  then be grateful to the  Government\r\n\r\nfor putting up a very fine hawker centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister some questions concerning the Corporation\r\n\r\nDrive  Hawker Centre I that was newly  constructed\r\n\r\nin Jurong. When will repair and renovation be made\r\n\r\nto  this  hawker centre? When will the leaky  roof\r\n\r\nand  gutters be changed or repaired? I would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister whether a proper  awning\r\n\r\nwill  be put up on one side of this hawker  centre\r\n\r\nso  as  to  provide shade for the stalls from  the\r\n\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two years ago a lot of licences were\r\n\r\nissued  to  hawkers, that is to say, hawkers  were\r\n\r\nput  under control by licensing. Once licences are\r\n\r\nissued,  hawkers have to pay a licence  fee.  Pork\r\n\r\nsellers   have  to  pay  $30  per  month,  payable\r\n\r\nquarterly at $90 per quarter. For other  types  of\r\n\r\nstalls,   the  fee  is  $10  per  month,   payable\r\n\r\nquarterly.  The licensed hawkers who  ply  on  the\r\n\r\nroadside  also have to pay a licence fee but  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  enjoy  all the privileges that  they  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have. For instance, they do not  have\r\n\r\nwater  supply.  Sir,  hawkers  require  water  for\r\n\r\ncleaning and washing and to keep the place  clean.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  reasonable  request  that  should  be\r\n\r\ngranted.  I fail to see why the Hawkers Department\r\n\r\nhas  refused to grant this reasonable request  for\r\n\r\nwater  supply. I, therefore, ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Jurong has raised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  few  questions in regard to hawker centres,  in\r\n\r\nparticular to Taman Jurong Market I. His criticism\r\n\r\nis  that  the design and the construction  of  the\r\n\r\nparticular centre is far from ideal. I am sure  he\r\n\r\nwith  agree  with me that human beings are  always\r\n\r\nmaking  progress  and are therefore  always  faced\r\n\r\nwith  problems,  many of which have  no  solution.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to  say, human beings live  in  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  So we may have taken  a  different\r\n\r\nview  of  a  certain matter after  a  while.  This\r\n\r\nparticular market extension may be far from  ideal\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was  one  of  the  first  few  to  be\r\n\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jurong there are two markets, viz. Taman\r\n\r\nJurong  Market I and Market II. Between  the  two,\r\n\r\nthere is a lot of difference both in design and in\r\n\r\nconstruction. The second one was built  completely\r\n\r\non  the basis of a new design. The first one  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  referred to was actually a conversion\r\n\r\nof  the  existing cooked food section. So  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  conversion, some old materials  might\r\n\r\nhave  been used. That is admitted. As regards roof\r\n\r\nleaks, we have already notified the contractors to\r\n\r\ntake  the  necessary  action  for  repairs  to  be\r\n\r\neffected or improvements to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to answer another point\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  has raised. He  says  that  the\r\n\r\nfacilities   in  some  hawker  centres   are   not\r\n\r\nsuitable. Most of the hawker centres are meant for\r\n\r\ncooked  food and there is a great variety of  food\r\n\r\nstalls,  some selling drinks, some selling  cooked\r\n\r\nfood.  Different  types  of  food  stalls  require\r\n\r\ndifferent facilities. But in the planning of  such\r\n\r\nfacilities, we can only provide facilities to meet\r\n\r\nthe  general  requirements of  hawkers,  based  on\r\n\r\ncertain broad principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's complaint that the stall\r\n\r\nis  too  small, I cannot see eye to eye with  him.\r\n\r\nChanges  and  improvements are made from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime, and we find that the stall's dimensions  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  bigger  and  bigger.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\noriginal  stall  measured 6 feet by  4  feet.  The\r\n\r\nimproved type is\r\n\r\n9 feet by 7 feet which is very much bigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government subsidises hawker centres\r\n\r\nvery  heavily. The licence fee for a  cooked  food\r\n\r\nstall  is  only  $50 and yet  we  hear  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints and grumbles. On the other hand hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  licensed have to pay through  their\r\n\r\nnose  for  a  very small lousy stall in  a  coffee\r\n\r\nshop.  This stall measures only 3 feet by  4  feet\r\n\r\nand  the  rent ranges from $100 to $300! $400  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  Not only that, such stallholders in coffee\r\n\r\nshops are subject to a lot of restrictions imposed\r\n\r\nby  the  coffee shop owners. Quite often they  are\r\n\r\nasked  to  quit.  But  in the case  of  Government\r\n\r\ncontrolled hawker stalls, the hawkers have  a  lot\r\n\r\nof complaints to make. If they really have so many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  and grumbles, the best  advice  I  can\r\n\r\ngive  is  that they should get their  own  private\r\n\r\nstalls   which   can   meet   their   own    ideal\r\n\r\nrequirements. This is my own personal view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards leaky roofs and hawker stalls\r\n\r\nexposed  to  the  sun and the  elements,  we  have\r\n\r\nseveral times consulted the architects responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  design,  and a lot of  improvements  and\r\n\r\nchanges  have  since  been made.  In  cooked  food\r\n\r\nhawker centres, there is a lot of smoke when  food\r\n\r\nis  being  cooked.  In  a  tropical  country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore, if the roof is completely covered  then\r\n\r\nventilation can be very poor and the whole  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre  will be so stuffy and hot, and it will  be\r\n\r\nvery   uncomfortable.  Then  there  will  be  more\r\n\r\ncomplaints  again.  There must  be  provision  for\r\n\r\nsuitable   ventilation  and  therefore   we   have\r\n\r\nprovided  openings and holes at the sides  of  the\r\n\r\nroofs.  So, a little bit of splash on a rainy  day\r\n\r\nis  quite  inevitable, because the hawker  centres\r\n\r\nare  not  completely covered and  sealed.  In  the\r\n\r\nmornings  and afternoons when the sun  is  shining\r\n\r\nobliquely, a certain portion of the hawker  centre\r\n\r\nis  exposed  to  the sun. This  is  perfectly  all\r\n\r\nright.  I  am  sure  we  cannot  have  a  complete\r\n\r\nperfectly  designed  hawker  centre  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nideals of everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards hawkers whose requests have not\r\n\r\nbeen  met,  I would like to say that generally  we\r\n\r\naccommodate  their requests as far as we  possibly\r\n\r\ncan. In regard to water supply, the PUB is in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharge, and it is not a matter for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment to handle alone. So we must  have\r\n\r\nconsultations to come to an arrangement with other\r\n\r\nrelevant departments or ministries. But, generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, whatever it is I am sure Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  agree with me that,  according  to  a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying, it is difficult  to  establish  a\r\n\r\nbusiness   from  scratch  but  it  is  even   more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to maintain it. This is a problem  that\r\n\r\neverybody, including a government, has to face. As\r\n\r\nthe  saying goes, good advice is unpleasant to the\r\n\r\near, so is good medicine bitter to the tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to say to the Members who\r\n\r\nhave   spoken,  that  although  they   have   made\r\n\r\ncriticisms,   some   of  them   are   constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions with good intentions, and I would like\r\n\r\nto thank them for all that has been said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  saying  so much on how one should  behave  in\r\n\r\nlife  and  about life in general. But he  has  not\r\n\r\ndirectly answered the points that I have raised. I\r\n\r\nknow  that the Parliamentary Secretary is good  in\r\n\r\ntai-chi.  He  has admitted in his reply  that  the\r\n\r\nparticular  hawker centre that I referred  to  was\r\n\r\nbuilt  with  old materials, which resulted  in  so\r\n\r\nmany problems. So my question is: since it is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Government to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  hawkers, why did they not  adopt  the\r\n\r\nimproved  design  and use new materials?  If  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  a fully covered roof results  in  poor\r\n\r\nventilation, then they could have planned a higher\r\n\r\nroof for the hawker centre. Why must they keep the\r\n\r\nroof to a very low level? This is the crux of  the\r\n\r\nproblem. My question is: when will repairs be made\r\n\r\nto  this  particular hawker centre? And no  answer\r\n\r\nhas been given yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I raised, Sir, refers to the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  water,  which is  the  basic  facility\r\n\r\nrequired by hawkers. They may not ask for anything\r\n\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  pay  a monthly licence fee and all they  ask\r\n\r\nfor   is  some  water.  The  Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  says  it is because of the  problem  of\r\n\r\nmanagement, etc. Those are minor  problems  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  easily solved.

This would  be  useful  for\r\n\r\nvarious  sectors involved in cultural activity  to\r\n\r\norientate themselves towards. Such sectors are the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, voluntary cultural  bodies,\r\n\r\nteachers of the arts, institutions like the  Music\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the University of  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association, the National Theatre,  RTS,\r\n\r\nand even the Ministry of Culture itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural development seems to me to occupy a\r\n\r\nrather  uncertain place in the general pattern  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  development  plans.  And   yet   such\r\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  so  important for nation-building  and  giving\r\n\r\npeople a sense of community and solidarity. Here I\r\n\r\ntake  cultural development to mean development  of\r\n\r\nthe  means  and  facilities providing  access  and\r\n\r\nparticipation  in relation to culture.  Presently,\r\n\r\nwhat  are the rather blurred lines of policy  that\r\n\r\ncan be discerned especially according to budgetary\r\n\r\nallocation for cultural development. We find  that\r\n\r\nthere   is  good  support  for  broadcasting   and\r\n\r\npublicity. The rationale here is evident for  this\r\n\r\nrelates  to  communication between the  government\r\n\r\nand  the  people.  But other  sectors  within  the\r\n\r\nportfolio of the Ministry of Culture do not  seem,\r\n\r\nat  least  to  me,  Sir, to be receiving  adequate\r\n\r\nattention  in  terms  of financial  support.  Good\r\n\r\nsupport  for  art, for example, had to  await  the\r\n\r\ngenerosity  and  the initiative of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArts    Council.   Contributions    to    cultural\r\n\r\norganisations   have  gone  down   suddenly   from\r\n\r\n$110,000   to  $20,000.  In  respect  of  cultural\r\n\r\ncooperation  even expenses related  to  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nPermanent  Committee on socio-cultural  activities\r\n\r\nhave been pruned slightly from $20,000 to $15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of rather indifferent attention\r\n\r\nto  aspects related to cultural development is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the low grading for the post  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  the National Museum  and  inadequate\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the work of the Museum  although  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen as a repository of  the  nation's\r\n\r\ncultural heritage, as a fine centre of display  to\r\n\r\ninterpret effectively to the community the meaning\r\n\r\nof  our heritage, and as a centre of activities of\r\n\r\na cultural, educational and recreational nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another line we can discern is that we subscribe\r\n\r\nto the notion that culture is not for the elite as\r\n\r\njudged from our activities like music and art  for\r\n\r\neveryone, concert for the young people,  and  also\r\n\r\nfrom  the  activities of the People's Association.\r\n\r\nYet  after saying these things we could still  ask\r\n\r\nwhat other projections, what plans for development\r\n\r\ndo  we have, what attempts are we going to make to\r\n\r\nbring  our  cultural tradition up to date  and  in\r\n\r\nharmony with our needs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naspirations Static culture is dead culture but  we\r\n\r\nare very much alive as a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any kind of vigorous development in the\r\n\r\ncultural  field, money is required. To  make  rich\r\n\r\ncontributions to our culture, I am not speaking in\r\n\r\nterms  of  money  here,  we  cannot  rely  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of amateur talent, as we have  in  the\r\n\r\npast. We must work towards having an adequate core\r\n\r\nof  professional artistes especially for music and\r\n\r\ndance, and regular and organised effort has to  be\r\n\r\nplanned  for  the encouragement of the development\r\n\r\nof talent for drama, writing and song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any attempt at projection one has to know\r\n\r\nclearly  what  we have at present. Indeed,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  to select cultural indicators and  study\r\n\r\nthem  and  make an essay of what we have presently\r\n\r\nand  what  we  could do to improve the  situation.\r\n\r\nThese cultural indicators, apart from relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  number of books in libraries, the  number  of\r\n\r\nradio  and television sets there are, can also  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  percentages  of  the   population\r\n\r\ntaking  part  in cultural activities,  numbers  of\r\n\r\nstudents of the arts, the proportion of the budget\r\n\r\nallocated  to  culture and the proportion  of  the\r\n\r\ncultural budget allocated to different aspects  of\r\n\r\nculture,  and  so on. Culture is so  important  to\r\n\r\nnational  development that it is about  time  that\r\n\r\nsystematic modes of examination are applied to our\r\n\r\ncultural  situation for the purposes of projection\r\n\r\nof plans for cultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I endorse the views expressed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Katong.  The  Ministry  of  Culture  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's agency responsible for the  promotion\r\n\r\nof   the   arts   and  cultural  activities.   The\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  are very  great  indeed.  It  is\r\n\r\ncharged with the role of raising the level of arts\r\n\r\nand culture, inculcation of patriotism and nation-building.  It  is  also responsible  for  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  a colourful cultural life to Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nenrich    the   material   life   and    spiritual\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  our  people.  These   are   very\r\n\r\nsignificant and heavy responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much has the Ministry of Culture achieved?\r\n\r\nOver  the  past few years the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\nhas  made  certain  efforts in  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nhealthy  cultural activities. \"Music for Everyone\"\r\n\r\nand  \"Art  for  Everyone\" are  examples  of  their\r\n\r\nachievement. In regard to the programmes  of  RTS,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly    there    has   been    considerable\r\n\r\nachievement  and improvement over  the  years.  We\r\n\r\nhave  very wholesome programmes from time to time,\r\n\r\nlike  \"Youth  Magazine\", \"Life in  Singapore\"  and\r\n\r\nvarious  forums and programmes for  children,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the cartoons. All these programmes are of  a\r\n\r\nrecreational  and  educational  nature.  But   the\r\n\r\nfrequency  of  such programmes is wanting,  and  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that more programmes of this type  should\r\n\r\nbe broadcast and televised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next complaint is that locally produced\r\n\r\nprogrammes are few and far between. Most  of  what\r\n\r\nwe  have  are  imported. Why should  this  be  so?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Minister will say that it is  because\r\n\r\nwe  do not have sufficient local talent, and so it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible for us to have an  abundance  of\r\n\r\nlocally produced programmes. If that is the  case,\r\n\r\nI  would  say  that  it is not  a  very  difficult\r\n\r\nproblem  to  solve. The question  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  taken positive measure  to  promote\r\n\r\nlocal  talents. I am referring to the planning  of\r\n\r\nlocal  TV productions. If there is a comprehensive\r\n\r\nplan,  then  we  can systematically develop  local\r\n\r\ntalent in this direction and thereafter there will\r\n\r\nbe  no  lack  of such talent. I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill,  in the coming year, take positive steps  to\r\n\r\npromote the development of local talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we hear the Minister stressing the\r\n\r\nneed  for healthy cultural activities and the need\r\n\r\nto  inculcate  cultural  consciousness  so  as  to\r\n\r\nenrich  the  life of the people.  These  are  very\r\n\r\ncorrect and proper objectives, but what is said is\r\n\r\none thing. More important is whether such policies\r\n\r\nare  implemented. It is only when action is  taken\r\n\r\nthat  we can have results. So I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Minister any concrete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplans  in  the  coming year for the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nhealthy cultural activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At the moment there are quite a lot of comics\r\n\r\nand picture books flooding the market and roadside\r\n\r\nstalls.  I  notice  that  such  picture  books  of\r\n\r\nfantastic  stories  of  demons  and  fairies   are\r\n\r\ndisplayed for sale everywhere in Singapore.  These\r\n\r\ntake  up  a  lot  of  time of  our  young  people,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the primary schools. Instead\r\n\r\nof  learning their lessons, they spend their  time\r\n\r\nreading  such fantastic stories and picture  books\r\n\r\nwhich  have very adverse effects on them.  So  the\r\n\r\nDepartment concerned should take immediate  action\r\n\r\nto   ban  these  undesirable  picture  books   and\r\n\r\npublications  so  that our children  will  not  be\r\n\r\nexposed to the \"poison\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On the question of the establishment of the\r\n\r\nNational  Symphony  Orchestra, I  remember  having\r\n\r\nraised  this  matter last year. At that  time  the\r\n\r\nanswer  I got was that the idea was good and  that\r\n\r\nit  would  receive proper consideration. One  year\r\n\r\nhas  passed, and I wonder whether the Minister has\r\n\r\nmade any progress in regard to the proposal to set\r\n\r\nup  a National Symphony Orchestra. I feel that the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  a National Symphony Orchestra  will\r\n\r\nadd  to the prestige of Singapore. That would mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  would be able to develop a lot of  local\r\n\r\nmusical talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Over the past two years our cultural missions\r\n\r\nto  Australia,  Russia  and  Indonesia  were  very\r\n\r\nwarmly  welcomed. The performances of our cultural\r\n\r\nmissions  overseas had helped the people there  to\r\n\r\nunderstand us better. Cultural exchanges were also\r\n\r\npromoted at the same time. I would therefore  like\r\n\r\nto  ask whether there are any such plans this year\r\n\r\nto  send more cultural missions overseas.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  such  missions  are  valuable  because  they\r\n\r\npromote    better   understanding   and    greater\r\n\r\nfriendship  between Singapore  and  the  countries\r\n\r\nvisited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, as we have been talking\r\n\r\nso much about Singapore culture in the past, may I\r\n\r\nknow  how  much has the promotion of this  culture\r\n\r\nachieved?   Often,  we  find  that  the   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  of  certain  groups  have  been  given\r\n\r\nlesser importance or even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneglected in the multi-cultural shows.

May I know what has happened to this policy?\r\n\r\nSome time ago, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture led a  cultural  troupe  to\r\n\r\nforeign  countries  to exhibit  a  sample  of  our\r\n\r\nculture  there. What has happened to this  troupe?\r\n\r\nWe do not seem to hear much of it now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PAP took office in 1959, there\r\n\r\nwere  cultural  shows  organised  by  the  Culture\r\n\r\nMinistry under the name of Aneka Ragam at  various\r\n\r\nplaces. These shows were well patronised.  I  have\r\n\r\nraised  this  matter at the last  Budget  sitting.\r\n\r\nNowadays  the  different types of  cultural  shows\r\n\r\nthat  we have do not attract a big crowd.  Why  is\r\n\r\nthis  so? There must be something wrong somewhere.\r\n\r\nProbably  the  people are not  keen  to  view  the\r\n\r\npresent types of performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what plans are being drawn up to promote\r\n\r\nSingapore culture among our people, and how are we\r\n\r\ngoing  to get our people interested in local  arts\r\n\r\nas much as the Aneka Ragam shows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is this:\r\n\r\nhow  effective is the Singapore Arts  Council?  So\r\n\r\nfar  what has the Council done to promote arts  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic?  May we get some information  about\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Arts Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also know what is the National Theatre\r\n\r\nTrust doing to ensure that the National Theatre is\r\n\r\nfully  utilised?  What  is  the  profit  that  the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Trust has made in respect of  the\r\n\r\nutilisation  of  its facilities  during  the  last\r\n\r\nthree years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years back the Cultural Centre at\r\n\r\nCanning Rise was a popular centre for a number  of\r\n\r\nvariety  shows. Now we do not hear anything  about\r\n\r\nthis  Cultural  Centre. What has happened?  Is  it\r\n\r\nstill  a  hall for cultural activities, or  is  it\r\n\r\nbeing converted for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  other use'? Or is it haunted that the people\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to use this place? Can the  Minister\r\n\r\nexplain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know how many of our local instructors of\r\n\r\nthe  cultural  art have gone abroad to  learn  the\r\n\r\ntricks of the trade so that upon their return they\r\n\r\ncan  improve the standard of our local  talent?  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Minister will support this move\r\n\r\nto   send  such  instructors  abroad  for  further\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Katong seems to\r\n\r\nhave  taken a very mercenary view on culture.  His\r\n\r\nargument is that if you spend so much money  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain  thing  you will get better  things  done.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it leads him to believe that if you cut\r\n\r\nthe  money for this item on culture, then you will\r\n\r\nget less returns in terms of cultural performance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this is not so in  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nculture.  The same argument leads him  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  if  you place a person in the grade of  `A'.\r\n\r\n`B'  or  `C', then you will get better performance\r\n\r\nout  of  him.  I  think this again  is  not  true.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should leave this matter to the PSC  to\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that cultural matters cannot be\r\n\r\nmeasured by the yardstick of materialism. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  rather difficult to define cultural policy\r\n\r\nto  the satisfaction of all sections of the people\r\n\r\nin  our multi-racial society. What is regarded  as\r\n\r\ngood and refined culture by one sector may not  be\r\n\r\nso by another. I do wish that cultural performance\r\n\r\nof  a  society can be quantified and a measurement\r\n\r\nfound  to  indicate the number of units or  output\r\n\r\nthat culture can provide. Then it will be easy for\r\n\r\neverybody.  It will be easy for us  to  apply  for\r\n\r\nsubsidies or more funds on the basis of the number\r\n\r\nof  units produced, or we may impose certain  cuts\r\n\r\nas    penalties    for    under-production.    But\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  again cultural performance  cannot\r\n\r\nbe measured in the same way as we measure economic\r\n\r\nperformance  by  the  number of  jobs  created  or\r\n\r\ncomparing the GNP figures with other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say that there are two important\r\n\r\naspects of our cultural policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  aim  to  preserve  and  develop  our\r\n\r\ncultural heritage derived from the main streams of\r\n\r\nthe    Malay,    Chinese,   Tamil   and    Western\r\n\r\ncivilisations   towards   a   national    cultural\r\n\r\nidentity.  Secondly, we aim  to  raise  a  general\r\n\r\ncultural  level  of our people  by  allowing  easy\r\n\r\naccess to sources of culture and education as well\r\n\r\nas  through  promotion of aesthetic  creation  and\r\n\r\nappreciation,  particularly among our  young.  The\r\n\r\nevolution of a distinctive Singapore culture is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  and  long process. How  long  it  will\r\n\r\ntake,  nobody  knows.  It may  take  a  life-time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there has been some success  in  the\r\n\r\ncross-fertilisation of the four streams of culture\r\n\r\nin  the last decade. This is made possible by  the\r\n\r\neffective  use  of  the  radio,  television,   the\r\n\r\nprinting word and the mass media. As a result,  we\r\n\r\nknow  more about each other's culture. There is  a\r\n\r\ncommon  sense  of destiny and identity  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy, therefore, is to encourage a\r\n\r\nharmonious development of the various cultures  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic. But in the transitional period,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to raise the general cultural  level\r\n\r\nof  our  people.  And to do this we  are  actively\r\n\r\npromoting   cultural   activities   and   artistic\r\n\r\npursuits among our people, particularly the young.\r\n\r\nOur  young  people are given free  access  to  all\r\n\r\nforms of cultural activities, although there are a\r\n\r\nnumber   of   Acts  to  protect  them   from   the\r\n\r\ndemoralising  effects  of  undesirable  forms   of\r\n\r\nsubculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various cultural activities organised by my\r\n\r\nMinistry and its various departments are aimed  at\r\n\r\ninculcating  in the young a love and  appreciation\r\n\r\nof  good  music, the fine arts and  the  aesthetic\r\n\r\nthings  in  life.  Art  and  music  are  literally\r\n\r\nbrought to the masses free or at a nominal rate so\r\n\r\nthat  cultural development could take place  on  a\r\n\r\nnational scale. As a result, there is definitely a\r\n\r\ngrowing  appreciation of good music and  the  fine\r\n\r\narts  among our people. It is now possible for  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to give more active support to  original\r\n\r\nliterary and artistic productions. Our young\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople   especially   will   be   encouraged    to\r\n\r\nparticipate in these creative activities, not only\r\n\r\nbecause  they  constitute more than  half  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  but  they are also more  malleable  to\r\n\r\nchange and instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the role of culture and education as\r\n\r\nconstant  companion  in the process  of  life-long\r\n\r\neducation.  Culture  is not  just  something  that\r\n\r\nhappens. We have to educate or prepare the  people\r\n\r\nfor  it.  The Ministry of Education has helped  to\r\n\r\npromote   aesthetic  creation   and   appreciation\r\n\r\nthrough   aesthetic  education.   Similarly,   our\r\n\r\nNational  Library, besides providing the essential\r\n\r\nreading services, has played an important role  in\r\n\r\nraising the literary and cultural standards of our\r\n\r\nyoung  people through exhibitions, concerts,  film\r\n\r\nshows,  lectures and demonstrations. The  National\r\n\r\nMuseum and educational institutions in itself also\r\n\r\nimplement   various   cultural   and   educational\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the funds allocated to\r\n\r\nthe  National Library and the National Museum have\r\n\r\nall  the  time  been  on  the  increase.  For  the\r\n\r\nNational Library, the total provision in the  Main\r\n\r\nEstimates has increased from $2.6 million  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  financial  year  to  $3.1  million  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  financial  year.  This  will  be  further\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $3.6 million in the next  financial\r\n\r\nyear.  Even provision in the Development Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  National Library will be increased  from\r\n\r\nabout  $0.6  million  to  $1.8  million.  For  the\r\n\r\nNational   Museum,  the  provision  in  the   Main\r\n\r\nEstimates was increased from $2l0,000 to  $360,000\r\n\r\nfor  the current financial year. It will again  be\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $420,000 in  the  coming  financial\r\n\r\nyear.  Everyone agrees that more money  should  be\r\n\r\nspent  on cultural development, but then the  same\r\n\r\napplies   to   every  other  department   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  these days of  inflation,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to economise and there is no  exception\r\n\r\nin the matter of culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants us to have more\r\n\r\nlocally  produced television programmes.  I  think\r\n\r\nsome  other  Members will be raising  this  matter\r\n\r\nlater  on  and I prefer to deal with it  when  the\r\n\r\ntime comes. But at the moment I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  this to say. We would like to have  as  many\r\n\r\nlocally produced programmes as possible but it  is\r\n\r\nnot possible in view of the cost of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also worried about the comics in\r\n\r\nthe  five-foot-way stalls which the  children  are\r\n\r\nreading.  I  do agree with him that it is  harmful\r\n\r\nfor  children to read such material, particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  the comics are unhealthy in content. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure the Member that the  Publications\r\n\r\nSection  of the Ministry of Culture keeps  a  very\r\n\r\nstrict check on the import of comics. All imported\r\n\r\ncomics  must  be  declared at the various  Customs\r\n\r\ncheck-points  and  have  to  be  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nPublications Section before they can be  released.\r\n\r\nThe Section exercises very strict control on this,\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately there is always the question  of\r\n\r\nsmuggling.  I  understand that  these  undesirable\r\n\r\ncomics  have been smuggled in by bookshops through\r\n\r\ndevious  means. We would, of course, keep a  check\r\n\r\non this by conducting periodical surprise raids on\r\n\r\nthe bookshops, and if Members have any information\r\n\r\nthey are always welcome to pass the information to\r\n\r\nme.  I would like to assure him that we are taking\r\n\r\nall  possible steps to prevent them from appearing\r\n\r\nin the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the National Symphony Orchestra, he\r\n\r\nhas raised this question many times - almost every\r\n\r\nyear. I must thank him for reminding me. We  hive\r\n\r\nno  plans  yet  to  set up  a  National  Symphony\r\n\r\nOrchestra. An ad hoc advisory committee comprising\r\n\r\nseveral  knowledgeable persons in the music  field\r\n\r\nwas formed to advise, the Ministry on this matter.\r\n\r\nThey have put forward two proposals to my Ministry\r\n\r\nand  also  to the Ministry of Finance.  The  first\r\n\r\nproposal  was  a  very modest  39-piece  orchestra\r\n\r\nwhich  would  require slightly  over  $1  million.\r\n\r\nUnder the second proposal the scale was reduced to\r\n\r\na   20-piece  string  orchestra  and  the  annual\r\n\r\nmaintenance  cost was correspondingly  reduced  by\r\n\r\nhalf.  Yet  it  would still cost  half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars a year to maintain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered both proposals and we have\r\n\r\ndecided that the cost is too prohibitive. In  this\r\n\r\ntime of inflation and recession it is not easy  to\r\n\r\nconvince  the relevant Ministry of the  intangible\r\n\r\nbenefit of having a national orchestra. Apart from\r\n\r\nthe   financial  aspect  there  are   also   other\r\n\r\nproblems,  such  as recruitment of key  musicians,\r\n\r\ntraining  of  local musicians and  maintenance  of\r\n\r\npublic  interest, which require careful study.  So\r\n\r\nwe  have  decided  to keep the whole  proposal  in\r\n\r\nview.  But I promise the Member that we are  still\r\n\r\nkeeping this proposal in mind, and in case we have\r\n\r\na  windfall  from somewhere and if the  public  is\r\n\r\nready   for  such  an  orchestra,  then  we  would\r\n\r\nreconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no plans to send the national dance\r\n\r\ntroupe  to foreign countries this year because  we\r\n\r\nhave decided that the money could well be spent in\r\n\r\nSingapore itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Anson on the question\r\n\r\nof Aneka Ragam shows which had been discontinued a\r\n\r\nvery long time ago. I think it is not advisable to\r\n\r\nrevive  it.  He  asked  why very  few  people  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in our cultural shows. The reason  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that they are enjoying TV programmes  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own homes. They may not be interested'  any\r\n\r\nmore  in  the open air Aneka Ragam shows.  Members\r\n\r\nmust  remember  that  Aneka Ragam  was  introduced\r\n\r\nbefore  1961 when we did not have television.  The\r\n\r\nAneka Ragam show , was then the only form of  free\r\n\r\nentertainment  for the people and,  therefore,  it\r\n\r\nenjoyed popular support. But now since TV has been\r\n\r\nbrought to their homes or in the community centres\r\n\r\nwhere  they  can enjoy good television programmes,\r\n\r\nthere is no reason why they should go to very  far\r\n\r\naway places to watch the Aneka Ragam shows. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Singapore Arts Council, the original objective was to establish an Art\r\n\r\nGallery   and  an  Academy  of  Arts  to  promote,\r\n\r\nencourage and advance cultural activities. Towards\r\n\r\nthis end, about $1.1 million was raised. Obviously\r\n\r\nthis amount was not enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  such proposals, and it was decided to utilise\r\n\r\nthe  money to build an Art Gallery in the National\r\n\r\nMuseum.  After  that, the Singapore  Arts  Council\r\n\r\nwill again utilise the remaining fund to establish\r\n\r\na  Fine  Arts Library in the National Museum.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Arts  Council has also given  financial\r\n\r\nsupport  to various cultural bodies. For instance,\r\n\r\nin  the  last  two years it had sent  one  or  two\r\n\r\ncultural  troupes  to  Hong  Kong.  It  has   also\r\n\r\nsupported the Singapore Youth Orchestra, piano and\r\n\r\nvocal  recitals and other performances. They  have\r\n\r\nsupported all these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre is also doing its best to\r\n\r\npromote cultural activities. The average occupancy\r\n\r\nrate  of the National Theatre is about 15  days  a\r\n\r\nmonth. The National Theatre Trust has been staging\r\n\r\nshows  from  overseas  in order  to  increase  the\r\n\r\noccupancy  rate. These shows not  only  helped  to\r\n\r\nfoster  a closer understanding between the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and other countries but are  also  a\r\n\r\nsource of revenue for the Trust. I must point  out\r\n\r\nthat  with  a very large stage and with a  seating\r\n\r\ncapacity   of  over  3,000  people,  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre can only be used by large troupes which do\r\n\r\nnot  require good acoustics. However, the National\r\n\r\nTheatre. Trust will continue to strive for optimum\r\n\r\nutilisation of the Theatre by various  means.  The\r\n\r\nfinancial  position of the National Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nhas  improved steadily during the last two  years.\r\n\r\nThe  Trust  incurred a deficit of $19,000  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1970-71. But there was a surplus of\r\n\r\n$37,000  in the financial year 1971-72. This  was\r\n\r\nfurther  increased to $140,000  in  the  financial\r\n\r\nyear 1973-74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cultural Centre at Canning Rise does not come\r\n\r\nunder my Ministry. It comes under the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the Adult Education Board, which is a statutory\r\n\r\nbody.  I  can  assure the Member that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nhaunted.  I see that many drama groups  are  still\r\n\r\nusing  that place to stage their plays and so  on.\r\n\r\nHowever,  because  of  the  very  limited  seating\r\n\r\ncapacity - it can only accommodate about 200 or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n300   persons  -  it  is,  therefore,  not   being\r\n\r\npatronised  by  other groups which want  to  stage\r\n\r\nshows for commercial returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I asked the Minister what plans he had for\r\n\r\nthe  future  development  of  cultural  policy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  his answer, what he  was  definite\r\n\r\nabout  was  that there are no plans, for  example,\r\n\r\nfor  the  development of a symphony orchestra.  He\r\n\r\ndid  give a catalogue of the achievements and  the\r\n\r\npresent arrangements for cultural development,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  which we are gratified  to  see  that\r\n\r\nthere is a lot of activity going on which we  know\r\n\r\nabout. But as I have said, in the beginning of  my\r\n\r\naddress, the whole point about cultural policy  is\r\n\r\nvague. The Minister referred to the possibility of\r\n\r\nquantification. In December the Minister  attended\r\n\r\na  meeting in Indonesia in which discussions  were\r\n\r\ncarried   on   about  cultural  policy   and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the arts and culture in the region.\r\n\r\nThere   were   papers  which   referred   to   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  the  quantification  of  data  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  cultural  development.  There   were\r\n\r\ninstruments which were used in places like  Soviet\r\n\r\nRussia  and  Japan  and  they  were  thinking   of\r\n\r\nintroducing these instruments in Indonesia. So  it\r\n\r\nis obvious that there are possibilities of finding\r\n\r\nout  how  many people attend the dramas, how  many\r\n\r\npeople  attend  the  cultural presentations,  what\r\n\r\nsort  of  budget there is, and what proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe total budget this represents. On the basis  of\r\n\r\nsuch examination we can quantify and make plans to\r\n\r\nsee  whether in five years' time we are  one  step\r\n\r\nahead  or one step backwards. I do not agree  with\r\n\r\nthe Minister when he says that quantification is a\r\n\r\nbit  dicey  because  whatever instruments  we  are\r\n\r\ngiven,  even  if they are crude, are still  better\r\n\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister made references to me being\r\n\r\nmercenary. I say to you, Mr Speaker. Sir, that the\r\n\r\nMinister  knows me better than to say that.  If  I\r\n\r\nsay that our artistes should have a due return for\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions, then am  I  mercenary?  Even\r\n\r\nwhen  I want the artistes to have at least a  good\r\n\r\nlife   and   to  be  encouraged  to   make   their\r\n\r\ncontributions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  believe  that  nothing is  for  free,  except\r\n\r\napparently in the cultural sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of his reference to the Head of the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum  (I am not making  much  play  of\r\n\r\nthat),  he says it is not so much what we pay  him\r\n\r\nas  his  contribution that is  important.  On  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  that argument, we can go to  every  top\r\n\r\ncivil  servant  and pat him on the back  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"You know, it is not so much what we give you  but\r\n\r\nyour  contribution that is important. So why don't\r\n\r\nyou  come  down from Grade E to G?\"  or  something\r\n\r\nlike  that.  So  I  do not think his  argument  is\r\n\r\nnecessarily one that holds water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of quality, maybe that is something\r\n\r\nthat we cannot measure. But, as I have said, if we\r\n\r\nwant quality, then I am afraid we have got to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  it.  History shows that where there has  been\r\n\r\npatronage   of  the  arts,  there   has   been   a\r\n\r\nflourishing  of  the  arts. If  you  withdraw  the\r\n\r\npatronage, then the arts go down. If the  Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want to say anything, I  beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I want a clarification\r\n\r\nabout   newspapers   publishing   photographs   of\r\n\r\nincidents  such  as  a  robbery,  and  the   names\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the photographs of certain  people\r\n\r\nare  printed. These people can then be identified,\r\n\r\nand later on they can get into trouble. I wish  to\r\n\r\nknow whether I can speak on that topic here, as  1\r\n\r\nam in doubt about that. Anyway I am going to speak\r\n\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Anson quite sure about\r\n\r\nspeaking on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes. There is only one English morning newspaper\r\n\r\navailable  in town. It has dominated the newspaper\r\n\r\nmarket so much so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvertisers  have full confidence in  this  daily\r\n\r\npaper.  I notice that more than half of the  paper\r\n\r\nis  covered  with advertisements.' It  has  become\r\n\r\nmore  of an advertising paper than a newspaper.  I\r\n\r\nfirmly believe that this paper - we can, in  fact,\r\n\r\ncall  it  the \"National Paper\" -should carry  more\r\n\r\nnews  than advertisements. And when I speak  about\r\n\r\nnews,  I must emphasise that I mean news of  local\r\n\r\nevents.   It   is  agreed  that   we   must   have\r\n\r\nadvertisements  to  cover  the  rising   cost   of\r\n\r\nnewsprint.  But nevertheless, to be  fair  to  the\r\n\r\nnewsreaders,    news   items   should    have    a\r\n\r\nproportionate space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may reply that he has no\r\n\r\ncontrol in the setup of the daily paper. But  then\r\n\r\nhe  can put across his criticism. Sir, I am not  a\r\n\r\njournalist, editor Or a newspaper writer. But I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how far you will agree with  me.  I  am\r\n\r\nspeaking  from a layman's point of view. Sometimes\r\n\r\nwe  find  that  the  newspaper carries  news  With\r\n\r\npictures  which I think may not be appropriate  in\r\n\r\nthat issue. For instance, Sir, if you can remember\r\n\r\nthe  robbery and shooting incident at the  Diamond\r\n\r\nHouse  in Tanglin, the newspaper coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nincident  included the picture of a hidden  camera\r\n\r\nin  the  shop which had recorded the robbery.  But\r\n\r\nthen  to-date, if I am not mistaken,  One  or  two\r\n\r\npeople involved in that crime are still at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is this: the next time a crime\r\n\r\nis  being  committed, the criminals will look  for\r\n\r\nhidden  cameras,  and  thus the  secret  is  lost.\r\n\r\nAgain,  pictures of men and women  who  had  given\r\n\r\ninformation  to  the  police  or  foiled  criminal\r\n\r\nactivities had been published. This heroic gesture\r\n\r\nmay  appear  good for publicity, but is  it  worth\r\n\r\nwhile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that information by way of\r\n\r\nphotograph should be kept confidential.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  aides  of  criminals may be hunting  for  the\r\n\r\ninformers  and  harm them. But, conversely,  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   much   publicity  is  needed   have   been\r\n\r\nneglected. This is because this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndaily  paper has a monopoly and it can do whatever\r\n\r\nit likes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of cost, even if the paper were to\r\n\r\nincrease  its  price,  as it had  done  previously\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the increased cost of newsprint,  the\r\n\r\npublic had no choice but to pay whatever price was\r\n\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints from local soccer\r\n\r\nplayers that coverage of local soccer games  seems\r\n\r\nto  have  been  neglected. We seem  to  have  more\r\n\r\npublicity  on  foreign teams in the newpaper  than\r\n\r\nlocal teams. Why is this so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without publicity in the press, I believe that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing much that we can do to  promote\r\n\r\nwhatever  we have in mind. Therefore, I  urge  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to  give  greater  coverage  of  local\r\n\r\nevents.  I  say  this because, as everyone  knows,\r\n\r\nthere  is a soccer fever now in town. We  can  see\r\n\r\nthat   our   one-time  `White  Elephant   National\r\n\r\nStadium'  has all of a sudden become  a  place  of\r\n\r\nprominence. Why is this so? it is because  of  the\r\n\r\npublicity that has been given to the soccer  games\r\n\r\nbetween  our national team and the Malaysian  team\r\n\r\nthat  attracted  the  crowd.  Otherwise  not  many\r\n\r\npeople  would  witness the games as was  the  case\r\n\r\nsometime ago. Furthermore, with publicity we  find\r\n\r\nthat  our players are encouraged to perform  their\r\n\r\nbest, and that is why our national soccer team has\r\n\r\nan  unbeaten  record of the support  of  the  home\r\n\r\ncrowd at the National Stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge that the soccer section of the\r\n\r\nPress  should  give more publicity  to  our  local\r\n\r\nteams  for the purpose of encouragement,  so  that\r\n\r\nour   soccer  players  cannot  comment  that   the\r\n\r\ncoverage is biased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, posters of Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nare normally issued after an election. But only  a\r\n\r\nlimited number of these posters are available. Why\r\n\r\nis   there  such  a  terrible  shortage  of  these\r\n\r\nposters?  Furthermore, there could be considerable\r\n\r\nchanges of MPs between one election and the  next.\r\n\r\nCould  not  more posters be printed and circulated\r\n\r\nmore liberally to all departments and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunits  as  and when changes take place'?  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  the people will get to know their MPs better\r\n\r\nand be informed of the position they are holding m\r\n\r\nthe various ministries and departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Sir, these posters should be issued\r\n\r\nto  the  community centres because there had  been\r\n\r\ncases  of  people  from  the other  constituencies\r\n\r\ncoming  to see me. When I asked them to see  their\r\n\r\nown MPs, they said that they do not know who their\r\n\r\nMPs are. It is most probable that one poster costs\r\n\r\n$4,  so  if  an extra 100 posters are printed,  it\r\n\r\nwill cost only $400. As the Ministry of Culture is\r\n\r\nspending millions and millions of dollars, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  proper for them to distribute such posters\r\n\r\nto  the various departments, community centres and\r\n\r\nat  other appropriate places. I am not asking  for\r\n\r\nthe posters to be put up by the roadside. That  is\r\n\r\nvery bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, until recently, all these years\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Culture printed  well-presented\r\n\r\ncalendars for distribution to members of statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  the  Citizens'  Consultative  Committees,\r\n\r\nmanagement   committees  and   other   civic   and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders who served the Government in one\r\n\r\nway   or   another.  These  calendars  were   also\r\n\r\ndespatched  to  our  foreign  missions   and   our\r\n\r\nmissions  were  able to distribute them  to  other\r\n\r\nfriendly  missions and friends  who  would  be  of\r\n\r\nservice  to our Republic. The calendars were  also\r\n\r\nused in our Government offices and rooms of senior\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  who  had to use  a  calendar  for\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons.  But this year  these  calendars\r\n\r\nwere not printed. As a result, the annual gift  to\r\n\r\nfriends and well-wishers has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amount of goodwill lost cannot be\r\n\r\nequated  to  the  amount of  money  saved  by  not\r\n\r\nprinting  these  calendars. Today  when  we  visit\r\n\r\nGovernment offices and statutory boards,  we  find\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of  calendars displayed  in  prominent\r\n\r\nplaces. Some of these are pleasing to the eve, but\r\n\r\nothers  are  downright out of place,  to  say  the\r\n\r\nleast. Sir, if the cost of printing calendars  has\r\n\r\ngone up, we could have reduced its size. We could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso have it printed on not-so-glossy a paper, and\r\n\r\nother  means could have been found to  reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost.  There  is no good reason to  completely  do\r\n\r\naway with the printing of these calendars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note that this year the Other\r\n\r\nOperating  Expenditure in respect of the Publicity\r\n\r\nDivision,   subhead   BAA   2220,   $306,000    is\r\n\r\nappropriated  for  production of publications  and\r\n\r\ndiaries for sale. Is the Ministry of Culture going\r\n\r\ninto  publication of diaries for sale when it  has\r\n\r\nno money even to print calendars?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has raised a question\r\n\r\nto  which he himself has already replied, that is,\r\n\r\nwe  have no control over the press, and he knew it\r\n\r\nvery well. But strangely enough, many people still\r\n\r\nbelieve that we in the Ministry of Culture do have\r\n\r\noverall  power to control the press.  May  I  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to say that this  is  definitely\r\n\r\nnot so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think what the Member has raised has\r\n\r\nsome  truth  in it, especially the statement  that\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of our newspaper has gone  down.  I\r\n\r\nagree with him that the purpose of a newspaper  is\r\n\r\nto  carry  news  and  that advertisements  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  should not be of such a proportion  as\r\n\r\nto  exceed  the news coverage. But I  presume  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements help to defray the increasing  cost\r\n\r\nof  producing a newspaper, and especially in times\r\n\r\nof  rising cost of newsprint. If we want  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  price of the newspaper down, we have to  bear\r\n\r\nwith the very boring advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the Ministry of Culture is only a\r\n\r\npermit issuing authority for the newspapers and we\r\n\r\nhave  no control over them. We have no say  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat   should  or  should  not  be  put   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  If  the  newspapers  print  too  many\r\n\r\nadvertisements out of proportion to news  articles\r\n\r\nand yet people still want to buy and read it, then\r\n\r\ngood luck to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's comment on the photographs\r\n\r\nand headlines in the newspapers, I am sure he will\r\n\r\nagree that this comment should be addressed to the\r\n\r\neditor of the newspaper concerned. But may  I  add\r\n\r\nthis? Many of the points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned  by him depend on the taste, perception,\r\n\r\neducational  background  and  experience  of   the\r\n\r\neditors  and  journalists. But  unfortunately  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  seem  to have lost many  of  the  good\r\n\r\ntalented  journalists, and good  replacements  are\r\n\r\nnot in sight in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, journalists were trained in the\r\n\r\nvery hard and tedious way. They were recruited but\r\n\r\nnot  put to work immediately; they were called cub\r\n\r\nreporters. They were sent to the courts  to  learn\r\n\r\nabout  court  proceedings and the process  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  and so on. Slowly they worked their  way  up\r\n\r\nand  then finally became editors. But this is  not\r\n\r\nso  today. The newspapers recruit people from  the\r\n\r\nuniversity,   and   they  seem   to   have   great\r\n\r\nexpectations over what work they should be  doing.\r\n\r\nAfter a short employment if they are sent to cover\r\n\r\nvery  simple  stories, they become  bored  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  good job such as a public  relations\r\n\r\nofficer in a hotel or a company, they would resign\r\n\r\nimmediately.  I think that is one of  the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy we find that the standard of the newspapers is\r\n\r\ngoing  down very gradually. This is not  just  the\r\n\r\ncase  with the English newspaper. It also  applies\r\n\r\nto  the  other  language newspapers,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers  especially. The  journalists  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing  their job well. Speeches are not edited  at\r\n\r\nall  but  produced  in full. Of course,  many  MPs\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  this because the  speeches  which\r\n\r\nthey  wrote  are  faithfully reproduced  the  next\r\n\r\nmorning.  Whether the public wants to read  it  or\r\n\r\nnot  does not matter. So long as the speeches  can\r\n\r\nfill  up the newspaper, they are happy. They  have\r\n\r\ndone their job. It is the same with the editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very sad state of affairs. But how are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to  redress it? I think readers  should\r\n\r\ndemand better newspapers or allow others to form a\r\n\r\ncompany to run a newspaper. Unfortunately again it\r\n\r\nis  not on the cards, because it costs quite a lot\r\n\r\nof  money  just  to  set up a  company  to  run  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper. So much for the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nmentioned   is   about  posters  of   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  including the Speaker  and  Ministers.\r\n\r\nThese posters are not produced by my Ministry, but\r\n\r\nby  Parliament House. In fact, this matter  should\r\n\r\nbe raised in the House Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. When I asked this\r\n\r\nquestion in the office of Parliament, they said it\r\n\r\nshould  be addressed to the Publicity Division  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture. Now the Minister says  it\r\n\r\nshould be addressed to Parliament. Tomorrow  if  I\r\n\r\ngo  to Parliament Office, again they will say  \"It\r\n\r\nis  the Publicity Division\". This is very bad. The\r\n\r\nCulture  Ministry must take action on  this.  They\r\n\r\nhave  the  Publicity Division. They  arc  spending\r\n\r\nmore  money,  and therefore they  can  do  it.

What  I  am  saying is that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nprinted  these  posters in the  past.  So  if  the\r\n\r\nMember wants more, he should ask Parliament  House\r\n\r\nbecause  they printed it. May I also add  this?  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  Member of Parliament ought to  know  his\r\n\r\nconstituents and he should get his constituents to\r\n\r\nknow him, with or without the help of posters.  If\r\n\r\nafter  having been elected as an MP and  for  some\r\n\r\ntime   the   people  still  have   difficulty   in\r\n\r\nrecognising him as an MP, then something is  wrong\r\n\r\nsomewhere.  The  MP should find  out  the  reasons\r\n\r\nhimself,  and  not blame Parliament  House  or  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  the lack of posters.  I  personally\r\n\r\nfeel that this a source of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. The Minister said\r\n\r\nthat an MP should know his constituents. I have no\r\n\r\ndoubts about that. Every five years we go back  to\r\n\r\nour  constituents to be elected to this House.  If\r\n\r\nwe  are  elected  and if they have any  difficulty\r\n\r\nthey will come and see us. Naturally they want  to\r\n\r\nknow the MPs. But there might be some constituents\r\n\r\nwho  do not know the MP for their constituency and\r\n\r\nthey may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  reason  to go and see him.

When people from other constituencies go  to\r\n\r\nhim  and tell him that they do not know their  own\r\n\r\nMP,  then something is wrong with their MP and not\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I must take strong objection to that\r\n\r\ninference because so many' situations could arise.\r\n\r\nHe   cannot   expect  the  MP  to  go  round   his\r\n\r\nconstituency every day: the constituents will  get\r\n\r\nfed  up  with  him.  The  MP  does  go  round  his\r\n\r\nconstituency   during   elections   or    national\r\n\r\ncampaigns.  Between such periods  there  could  be\r\n\r\nmovements of people. There could be people  moving\r\n\r\nfrom  Chua  Chu Kang into Anson for example.  Chua\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  residents might not  know  the  MP  for\r\n\r\nAnson, because they, probably know only their  MP,\r\n\r\nMr Tang See\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChim.

So to give\r\n\r\nthe impression that the constituents do\r\n\r\nnot know their MP is wrong just because\r\n\r\nof a few ocid cases. What is required i.s\r\n\r\nprobably posters of MPs at the community centres so that when people visit\r\n\r\nthe community centres they can have the\r\n\r\nopportunity, particularly if they are new\r\n\r\nresidents, to see who their MP is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, to cut the\r\n\r\nmatter short, 1 think it should be the\r\n\r\nMP's responsibility to make himself\r\n\r\nknown to his constituents. I am not saying that the MPs are not doing their\r\n\r\njob. But 1 think MPs should be ordinary\r\n\r\npeople. Why should they want their\r\n\r\nfaces to be plastered all over the place?\r\n\r\nIf an MP has done his vrork, so be it.\r\n\r\nThe people will remember him for \ufffdhe\r\n\r\ngood work that he has done. That is my\r\n\r\npersonal view. But if Members think\r\n\r\nthat having more posters will help them\r\n\r\nin their work, then we will try to help\r\n\r\nwithin our resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of calendars mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Member for Telok Blangah, in\r\n\r\n1973 we spent over $31,000 for the\r\n\r\nprinting of the 1974 calendars. Last\r\n\r\nyear, as a measure of economy, we had\r\n\r\nonly $5,000. This sum is obviously not\r\n\r\nenough to print good quality calendars\r\n\r\nworthy of distribution to Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, individuals and overseas\r\n\r\nmissions, and so on. So we decided not\r\n\r\nto issue calendars for 1975, because a\r\n\r\ncalendar of inferior quality would be\r\n\r\ncounter-productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diaries issued by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture for use in Government and\r\n\r\nquasi-Government departments contain\r\n\r\ndata for use in the civil service. For\r\n\r\nexample, the 1975 office diary contains\r\n\r\nmetric conversion tables, postal information, tide tables and so on. We have to\r\n\r\nprice the diaries in order to recover the\r\n\r\nprinting cost, because nothing should\r\n\r\nbe given for free. 1 do not think any\r\n\r\nprofit was made out of this. It is just a\r\n\r\nnominal cost that we wish to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\ntake issue with the Minister over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst point vvhen he answered the Member for Anson, and that is over the\r\n\r\nquestion of journalists. He mentioned\r\n\r\nabout Members' speeches being published in full, and so forth. What is\r\n\r\nwrong with the MPs' speeches being\r\n\r\npublished in full, if they are good? Is\r\n\r\nit not important that their views are\r\n\r\nexpressed? In fact, their complaint is\r\n\r\nthat they have not been given that much\r\n\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of the standard of journalists, it is very difficult to\r\n\r\nput the blame on the journalists. 1 know\r\n\r\nthis from the journalists' union, which\r\n\r\nhappens to be an affiliate of the NTUC.\r\n\r\nTheir members feel terribly disgruntled,\r\n\r\ndissatisfied over the fact that the managements of newspapers do not encourage\r\n\r\ntheir journalists to improve themselves.\r\n\r\nMany of them want to improve them-selves professionally and their status.\r\n\r\nBut if the policy of the management is\r\n\r\ncommercially oriented, where very little\r\n\r\nattention is given towards the development of the standard of journalists, what\r\n\r\ncan the journalists do about it? What\r\n\r\nharm is there for the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nor even the Minister himself to call up\r\n\r\nthe managing directors of the news-papers occasionally to discuss about\r\n\r\ngeneral opportunities for the journalists\r\n\r\nto improve themselves and about standards of iournalism in Singapore? Are\r\n\r\nthese eflorts being made? Are the\r\n\r\nmanaging directors of the various news-papers being persuaded to give the sort\r\n\r\nof attention that they should give towards professional improvement of\r\n\r\njournalists in Singapore? This matter\r\n\r\nhas nothing to do with control of the\r\n\r\npress. 1 think this has not been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the managing directors and\r\n\r\nthe people who are in charge are more\r\n\r\nconcerned with the day-to-day administration and the profitability of the\r\n\r\nnewspapers. This is one of the frustrations of the journalists' union. We all\r\n\r\nwant to see an all round improvement\r\n\r\nin the standard of our journalists, doctors and others in our society. There is\r\n\r\na positive way of getting things done\r\n\r\nand there is also a very negative way of\r\n\r\nlooking at it. But 1 think the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture can do something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf   the  Minister  were  to  exercise  a  greater\r\n\r\ninfluence  on  the authorities of the  newspapers,\r\n\r\nperhaps  they  might  be persuaded  to  show  more\r\n\r\ninterest  towards  this aspect  of  the  newspaper\r\n\r\noperation, namely, professional improvement of the\r\n\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of working conditions.\r\n\r\nLike  anywhere else all over Singapore - the civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  all places of work  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  dissatisfaction  always  creeps  in   and\r\n\r\npeople get demoralised. I think we have seen  this\r\n\r\nin  all strata of our society. We have to have the\r\n\r\nsame  approach.

The\r\n\r\njournalists'  union, as I said, is  affiliated  to\r\n\r\nthe NTUC. Its officials often come to the NTUC for\r\n\r\nadvice and guidance with regard to their problems,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  not  just a question of  dollars  and\r\n\r\ncents. There has also been this desire on the part\r\n\r\nof  the journalists to want to improve themselves.\r\n\r\nThey  are  quite conscious of the need to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  professional standards.

I am saying that  they\r\n\r\nare not doing their job - speeches are not edited,\r\n\r\nand  whatever  written  material  is  handed  out,\r\n\r\nwhether it is a Government statement or any  other\r\n\r\nmatter, it is always faithfully produced.  But  we\r\n\r\ndo   not   find  this  situation  in   any   other\r\n\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as a journalist, if we want to do our\r\n\r\njob   well,  we  would  first  pick  up  the  very\r\n\r\ninteresting points in a speech and play  them  up.\r\n\r\nBut  in the case of the Chinese newspapers,  maybe\r\n\r\nit  is  because of pressure for time or a shortage\r\n\r\nof  manpower,  we  find that it is  always  poorly\r\n\r\ndone. I am not saying that they are producing  too\r\n\r\nmuch of the MPs' speeches. Maybe the MPs feel that\r\n\r\nthey do not produce enough of their speeches,  but\r\n\r\nthat is a matter of opinion, What I want to say is\r\n\r\nthat  the  speeches should be properly edited  and\r\n\r\nrendered  in  a  readable  form  and  not  squeeze\r\n\r\neverything into one whole page and leave it to the\r\n\r\nreaders  to interpret. As a journalist, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we can tolerate this kind of reporting in  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper. But since there are only a few  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers, there is very little we can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also very eloquently spoken as a\r\n\r\ntrade unionist for the Singapore National Union of\r\n\r\nJournalists. He has asked, \"What harm is there for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  tell, say,  the  Straits  Times\r\n\r\nmanagement, to do this and that?\" I think there is\r\n\r\na  lot  of  harm  in it. In the first  place,  why\r\n\r\nshould   I  interfere  with  the  internal  labour\r\n\r\ndispute between the management and the union?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  I,  as the Minister in charge  of  issuing\r\n\r\nlicences   to  newspapers,  interfere   with   the\r\n\r\npromotion  or non-promotion of a journalist  in  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  company'? This should be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nmanagement and the union to sort out between them,\r\n\r\nand if they cannot come to an agreement then there\r\n\r\nis always the Industrial Arbitration Court to seek\r\n\r\nredress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the points that the Member has mentioned\r\n\r\nconcern  the working conditions of the journalists\r\n\r\nin a news-paper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany. That is labour dispute and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  right for me to interfere. As to the standard\r\n\r\nand  content of the newspaper, maybe we can as MPs\r\n\r\nraise our criticisms. But what right do we have to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the internal dispute  between  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and the union? The same question  also\r\n\r\napplies  to any other commercial firm. What  right\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Minister have in interfering  in  those\r\n\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

The\r\n\r\nMinister cannot blame the journalists because they\r\n\r\nare   doing  their  work  properly.  It   is   the\r\n\r\nmanagement that should be blamed. But we  are  not\r\n\r\ndiscussing  union matters here. We are  discussing\r\n\r\nmatters on culture now.

Therefore, they  are\r\n\r\ncovered  by  part-time news readers. News  readers\r\n\r\nneed  to  have certain qualifications before  they\r\n\r\ncan be selected. Since stiff requirements are laid\r\n\r\ndown,  it  is  not  easy  to  get  part-time  news\r\n\r\nreaders.   With  the  present  set  of   part-time\r\n\r\nreaders,  however,  the  news  section  is   doing\r\n\r\nextremely well. It would appear that these men and\r\n\r\nwomen  are paid $15 and $10 per reading on TV  and\r\n\r\nover  the  radio  respectively.  Considering   the\r\n\r\ndistance they have to travel from the bus stop  at\r\n\r\nThomson Road to the Broadcasting station, and  the\r\n\r\nodd  hours that these people are required to work,\r\n\r\nthe money paid is not really commensurate with the\r\n\r\njob  done.  It is high time that these rates  were\r\n\r\nrevised.  Otherwise, we will never  get  any  more\r\n\r\npart-time  news  readers the next  time  vacancies\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on colour TV, last year there was a\r\n\r\ndifference of opinion in this House when this item\r\n\r\nwas debated at Budget time. Now, I understand that\r\n\r\nsince  the  introduction of colour TV  only  about\r\n\r\n10,000  sets  were sold, and out  of  this  number\r\n\r\nabout 9,000 sets were taken up by the hotels. What\r\n\r\nhas  happened  to the general public  towards  the\r\n\r\npurchase of colour sets? Are they adopting a wait-and-see  attitude because of the speculation  that\r\n\r\nthe  licence fee may go up together with the cost?\r\n\r\nBut  then,  a  considerable amount  of  money  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  is being allocated for this project.  It\r\n\r\nis high time that the Minister did something about\r\n\r\nimproving the quality and increasing the frequency\r\n\r\nof colour TV programmes. Only then can the sale of\r\n\r\ncolour TV sets be enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour TV programmes in Tamil are non-existent.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  there  such  a  discrimination?  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister do something to introduce colour films in\r\n\r\nTamil? Besides, there is no Tamil programme at all\r\n\r\non  Sundays  when  everyone is  resting  at  home.\r\n\r\nSurely something can be done about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, questions had been raised by me\r\n\r\non  the late screening of Tamil films, which  went\r\n\r\non till midnight, a time that was inconvenient for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffice  workers and school children. We  are  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister had done something to  advance\r\n\r\nthe  screening times of these films.  However,  of\r\n\r\nlate, the  screening  times have  been  gradually\r\n\r\npushed  back,  and  this is a return  to  the  old\r\n\r\nsystem.  I  would request a timely check  on  this\r\n\r\n\"relapse\".  Sometimes it would appear  that  films\r\n\r\nare  not  screened  according to  schedule.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  when one tunes in to a desired  programme\r\n\r\none finds that one has already missed some portion\r\n\r\nof the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where Tamil `request' programmes on radio\r\n\r\nare   concerned,  the  announcer  indiscriminately\r\n\r\nmentions every name and address. This lasts  about\r\n\r\nfive  minutes  while one request song  lasts  only\r\n\r\nthree  minutes.  In  the end, listeners  can  only\r\n\r\nenjoy  about  five songs in a one-hour  programme.\r\n\r\nCan something be done to remove this anomaly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again Tamil programmes on radio end at 9.00 p.m.\r\n\r\nand  after  that  it  is well-nigh  impossible  to\r\n\r\nlisten,  in  to  some  music or  any  other  Tamil\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Can the Minister look  into  this  and\r\n\r\nensure  that  Tamil programmes end at about  11.00\r\n\r\np.m.?   I   would   suggest  that  the   afternoon\r\n\r\nprogramme,  which  is  not  listened  in  by  many\r\n\r\npeople, be taken off and put on the air at a later\r\n\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring this matter up because many Tamil\r\n\r\nlisteners  have  to  switch to foreign  broadcasts\r\n\r\nafter  9.00  p.m.,  simply because  RTS  fails  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the entertainment that it is supposed  to\r\n\r\nprovide.  Listening in to foreign broadcasts  does\r\n\r\nnot promote loyalty among the local population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Furthermore, we are  losing  a  golden\r\n\r\nopportunity   to   educate  the   Tamil   speaking\r\n\r\npopulation  because those are the very hours  that\r\n\r\nmost people like to listen in to the radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that\r\n\r\ncrime  is on the increase in Singapore.

Many of  them\r\n\r\nresort  to militancy and violent forms of  revenge\r\n\r\nagainst society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation like this our mass media,\r\n\r\nespecially  television and  radio, must  he  more\r\n\r\ndiscriminating   in   their   choice   of   public\r\n\r\nentertainment.  Films  appealing  to   the   baser\r\n\r\ninstincts  should he limited to the minimum;  i.e.\r\n\r\nthose  television programmes depicting  crime  and\r\n\r\nviolence  which  delve deeply into the  techniques\r\n\r\nused  by  hard-boiled criminals to  commit  house-breaking, safe-busting, robbery, murder, rape  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  Our youths can easily be misguided.  They\r\n\r\ncan  pick up a trick or two to try their  hand  at\r\n\r\nthese  anti-social activities. In  fact,  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat the under-world is doing all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not being too puritanical by banning all\r\n\r\nthese   undesirable  films,  some  of  which   are\r\n\r\nenjoying  an  unprecedented  popularity  in  other\r\n\r\nparts  of the world, some restraint must be  shown\r\n\r\nin  its  choice  and  frequency.  The  mother  and\r\n\r\nsweetheart  image  of  our  women  is  also  being\r\n\r\ndestroyed  by  depressing films and advertisements\r\n\r\non  television.  The accent should  be  on  better\r\n\r\neducational films to widen the mental horizons  of\r\n\r\nour  people,  whilst also providing entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe  choice of good, clean entertainment  is  very\r\n\r\nwide indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson regarding the fees paid to RTS part-time\r\n\r\nnews  readers  on  radio and  television  is  very\r\n\r\npertinent.  This has been a matter of  concern  to\r\n\r\nthe  Department of Broadcasting in recent  months.\r\n\r\nHowever,  no immediate increase in fees  has  been\r\n\r\npossible  so far because the sum budgeted  for  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough. But in the coming financial  year  we\r\n\r\nhave asked for additional funds. A revised rate of\r\n\r\nfees  has  already been proposed and, if approved,\r\n\r\nthen  the  revised  rates of  fees  for  the  news\r\n\r\nreaders,  i.e, the increased rates,  will  be  put\r\n\r\ninto effect in, the coming financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding colour TV project, Members were\r\n\r\ninformed during the debate on this subject in last\r\n\r\nyear's Budget that as most of the equipment at the\r\n\r\ntelevi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsion  station was over ten years old and  due  for\r\n\r\nreplacement, it was, therefore, economically sound\r\n\r\nto  introduce colour television. It may be pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  compared with last year's  prices,  the\r\n\r\ncost of some professional television equipment has\r\n\r\nincreased  this year by about 25%. In last  year's\r\n\r\nBudget  debate,  it  was  also  stated  that  only\r\n\r\noverseas   films,  programmes   and   some   local\r\n\r\ndocumentary  films, totalling one  to  two  hours'\r\n\r\nbroadcast time, would be telecast daily in  colour\r\n\r\nwith  the introduction of colour television,. This\r\n\r\nwas  effected on 1st August last year. The  colour\r\n\r\ntelevision programme now averages four hours daily\r\n\r\non  weekdays  and six hours on Saturdays,  Sundays\r\n\r\nand  public  holidays.  In terms  of  the  overall\r\n\r\nweekly   output,  colour  programmes  now  average\r\n\r\nalmost  31%. In addition, in spite of the lack  of\r\n\r\nfull  switching facilities and trained  personnel,\r\n\r\nRTS undertook outside broadcast by telecasting the\r\n\r\nNational Day parade, the opening of Parliament and\r\n\r\nthe  Chingay procession in February this year.  It\r\n\r\nalso  telecast  live and in colour the  World  Cup\r\n\r\nsoccer  final and the opening of the Asian,  Games\r\n\r\nin Teheran via satellite last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sale of colour TV sets, I think it\r\n\r\nis a matter of opinion whether the volume of sales\r\n\r\nof colour TV sets is poor or otherwise. Statistics\r\n\r\nshow  that  as  at 31st January, 1975,  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  11,738  sets licensed for  colour  TV.  The\r\n\r\nlicences  for colour TV are issued by  the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Department. I do not know how the  Member\r\n\r\ngot  his  figures when he said that out of  10,000\r\n\r\nsets  sold,  9,000 were bought by  the  hotels.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is completely untrue because the figures\r\n\r\nI  have  here  show that the issue  of  colour  TV\r\n\r\nlicences  averages about 1,200 per month.  In  the\r\n\r\nmonth  of  January this year, out of  a  total  of\r\n\r\n1,300  licences  issued,  only  15  licences  were\r\n\r\nissued  to the hotels; and in February  out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 1,637 licences, none was issued  to  any\r\n\r\nhotel. I do not think it is true to say that 9,000\r\n\r\nsets had been taken up by hotels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the increase of hours of colour TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes  the  sale of colour  TV  sets  may  be\r\n\r\npushed further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen   the  present  switching  system  has   been\r\n\r\nconverted to colour in about two months' time,  it\r\n\r\nis  planned to telecast in colour the news  and  a\r\n\r\nfew  local programmes, apart from documentary.  It\r\n\r\ntakes  time to train people and we have about  200\r\n\r\ntechnical   staff   to   train   for   this   very\r\n\r\nsophisticated piece of technology. It is very time\r\n\r\nconsuming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not say that there is no colour programme\r\n\r\nin  Tamil.  But  I agree that it  is  not  enough.\r\n\r\nColour  programmes in Tamil are very limited.  The\r\n\r\naverage screening time for a Tamil film is about 2\r\n\r\n1/2  hours, and so it is very difficult to fit  it\r\n\r\ninto  any standard television time slots, in order\r\n\r\nto  make the programmes interesting to all sectors\r\n\r\nof  the population, the programmes in Tamil  would\r\n\r\nhave to be allotted in a proportionate way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also mentioned about the\r\n\r\npunctuality of the programme. We have taken  every\r\n\r\nstep to see that the daily programmes are telecast\r\n\r\nat the times published in the press. Sometimes due\r\n\r\nto  unforeseen factors, as for instance, the  time\r\n\r\nneeded  to  cover  the Parliamentary  report,  the\r\n\r\nactual  length could not be determined. Therefore,\r\n\r\nin  such an event subsequent programmes have to be\r\n\r\ntelecast at times later than scheduled. But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  true  to say that the programmes are  put  on\r\n\r\nearlier  than scheduled. It may be later than  the\r\n\r\nscheduled  time  because of the earlier  programme\r\n\r\nbeing a bit longer than expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding the query on, the Tamil \"request\"\r\n\r\nprogramme  on  radio, it is the  practice  of  RTS\r\n\r\nannouncers not to mention more than 10  names  for\r\n\r\neach  request.  For special \"request\"  programmes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as those relating to festive occasions  like\r\n\r\nChristmas,  Deepavali, Han Raya  and  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear,  more  names  need to be  mentioned  because\r\n\r\nthere are more requests. But in a normal broadcast\r\n\r\nof  such  a  programme, this is not done.  In  the\r\n\r\nallocation  of air time, the size of the  audience\r\n\r\nhas  to  be taken into consideration, as has  been\r\n\r\nthe   case   for  many  years.  Our  schedule   of\r\n\r\nprogrammes in the afternoon takes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto consideration programmes for\r\n\r\nhousewives, youths and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has\r\n\r\nspoken on filnis depicting violence and\r\n\r\nvery undesirable elements in TV programmes. May \ufffd say that imported TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes for screening in Singapore\r\n\r\nare subject to very careful vetting. In  1974, 26 films were banned because of\r\n\r\nviolent themes and detailed depiction\r\n\r\nof crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason 80 to 100 censorship cuts are made every year. For this\r\n\r\nyear, up to February, four films havc\r\n\r\nbeen banned and 23 censorship cuts\r\n\r\nmade on grounds of crime and violence. Apart from this stringent censorship, the\r\n\r\nnumber of police and detective dramas\r\n\r\nscheduled is regulated. Of the 225 programmes in a week, an average of only\r\n\r\nsix such programmes are scheduled, and\r\n\r\nthese are not telecast every day of the\r\n\r\nweek. For instance, no mystery or\r\n\r\ndetective programme is currently being\r\n\r\ntelecast on Mondays and Tuesday. Programmes featuring ]aw enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers and crime investigators comprise, in fact, only 5.7% of \ufffdTS output.\r\n\r\n94.3% of transmission time is occupied\r\n\r\nby other categories of programmes.\r\n\r\nEven for this small percentage of police\r\n\r\nand detective dramas depicting violence\r\n\r\nand the details of criminal activities,\r\n\r\ndetailed scenes on crime and so on are\r\n\r\ncensored. Programmes which are finally\r\n\r\nshown dramatise law enforcement and\r\n\r\nsubstantiate the saying, \"Crime does not\r\n\r\npay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the more popular imported\r\n\r\nprogrammes telecast by RTS are also\r\n\r\nsubscribed to by 50 or more countries\r\n\r\nand in many different languages. There\r\n\r\nis a concern, in some quarters as regards\r\n\r\nthe possible effects these programmes\r\n\r\nmay have on vievvers.

In the last year or so,\r\n\r\nthere have been 15 resignations of young library\r\n\r\nofficers from the library service. Apart from\r\n\r\nthere having to be a reason why these young\r\n\r\nofficers have been so soon disillusioned with the\r\n\r\nlibrary service, there is also the problem of\r\n\r\nwork in the library service being affected. The\r\n\r\nlibrary service has been successful in evoking a\r\n\r\ngood response especially from our younger\r\n\r\ncitizens, and in popularising the habit of\r\n\r\nreading. Yet if one scrutinises the list of\r\n\r\npopular titles produced by the National Library\r\n\r\nover the past year or so, one cannot help getting\r\n\r\nthe impression that the purpose why a book is\r\n\r\nborrowed is a very material and instrumental one\r\n\r\nindeed. In the nonfiction section, for example,\r\n\r\nShakespearean tragedy, electrical engineering\r\n\r\nprinciples, strength of materials, biology of\r\n\r\nfunctional approach, are titles that one comes\r\n\r\nacross again and again apart from the extreme\r\n\r\npopularity of books on Lee Kuan Yew. Further work\r\n\r\nhas to be done obviously by the library to\r\n\r\nencourage the habit of reading for the sake of\r\n\r\ninterest in reading, not interest in passing\r\n\r\nexaminations and doing well in the General Paper\r\n\r\nat `A' levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of needs and in the midst of\r\n\r\ndissatisfactions that seem to prevail, an\r\n\r\nadditional irritant may be added to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  situation. There has recently been undertaken\r\n\r\na   review  of  the  operations  of  the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary. I do not know what the qualifications are\r\n\r\nof  those who are involved in this review but some\r\n\r\nof  the  proposals have aroused severe  criticisms\r\n\r\nfrom senior library staff. One of the proposals, I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  had it that it was possible to create  a\r\n\r\ngood  professional library officer out of  library\r\n\r\nassistants   who   only  needed   an   `0'   level\r\n\r\nqualification to become library assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope wiser counsels will eventually prevail and\r\n\r\nthe  situation  at the National Library  not  made\r\n\r\nworse. If the Ministry of Finance wants to have  a\r\n\r\nlook, their officials should have a thorough  look\r\n\r\nat the National Library and see it as performing a\r\n\r\ntotality  of  functions  related  to  the   better\r\n\r\ncultural  development of our people. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas himself in a speech about a month ago - and  I\r\n\r\nam  speaking about the Minister for Culture now  - recognised  the onerous burdens and many  problems\r\n\r\nconcerning librarians as a result of the knowledge\r\n\r\nexplosion.  Let  us help our librarians  do  their\r\n\r\nwork better, not hinder them in the attainment  of\r\n\r\ntheir professional objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

He was doubtful\r\n\r\nof  the  Library Service scheme that we introduced\r\n\r\nto train librarians with `0' levels. May I correct\r\n\r\nhim by saying that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  not really training librarians. They  are\r\n\r\ncalled library assistants, not librarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing our best to maintain the present\r\n\r\nhigh  standard of librarianship and we  would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  it  lowered. All  recruits  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   Library  Service  are  graduates   of\r\n\r\nrecognised universities. Those who do not have the\r\n\r\nadditional  professional  library  qualifications,\r\n\r\nwhen   first  recruited  into  the  service,   are\r\n\r\nencouraged to obtain these qualifications by means\r\n\r\nof  study  at overseas library schools, either  on\r\n\r\nscholarship or on no pay leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new scheme that he spoke about is for the\r\n\r\ntraining   of   library   assistants,   and    not\r\n\r\nlibrarians, who would have GCE `0' level passes in\r\n\r\nat  least  five subjects. These library assistants\r\n\r\nwill  work  under the supervision of  professional\r\n\r\nlibrarians in the carrying out of the more routine\r\n\r\nwork   in  Government  libraries,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nregistration of readers, the loan of books, and so\r\n\r\non.  In this way, the professional librarians will\r\n\r\nthen  be  able  to devote their time 10  reference\r\n\r\ninformation and bibliographical services, as  well\r\n\r\nas   the   promotion  of  reading,   which   their\r\n\r\nspecialised  professional training and educational\r\n\r\nbackground  have  enabled them to  undertake.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  lowering  the standard of librarianship,  we\r\n\r\nare  actually  trying to take away the  burden  of\r\n\r\nthis  routine work of the professional librarians,\r\n\r\nand  we hope that this service scheme is going  to\r\n\r\nwork  towards  giving  a  better  service  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson complained about certain\r\n\r\nbooks   not  being  available  in  the  Queenstown\r\n\r\nLibrary. May I say that the books he mentioned are\r\n\r\nof  a very specialised category. If any specialist\r\n\r\nwants  reference books on a certain subject  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  he would not go to a branch library, because\r\n\r\nit  is meant to serve the general readership in  a\r\n\r\nsatellite  town.  If the soil  test  experts,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, want access to specialised books,  there\r\n\r\nare many methods by which we can get for them. The\r\n\r\nbranch  library  staff would normally  refer  such\r\n\r\nenquiries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the National Library in Stamford Road where the\r\n\r\ncollection of books is much wider. There are  also\r\n\r\nother  libraries in the universities  and  various\r\n\r\nMinistries,  which  have a very  well  coordinated\r\n\r\nsystem. If a certain book cannot be found  in  the\r\n\r\nNational   Library,   the  librarian   will   make\r\n\r\nenquiries  for  the  public whether  the  book  is\r\n\r\navailable in another library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Tamil books in the National Library, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have quite a number of them.  The  only\r\n\r\nfault is that we do not have enough, because there\r\n\r\nare  not enough publications in Tamil. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson knows where these Tamil books come from.\r\n\r\nThey  are not published in Singapore. Only a  very\r\n\r\nlimited  quantity  can  be obtained  from  Madras,\r\n\r\nIndia, and so on. The number of Tamil books in the\r\n\r\nNational  Library comes to about  61,000  volumes.\r\n\r\nThis  is about 8% of the total book collection  in\r\n\r\n1974, and this corresponds with the proportion  of\r\n\r\nIndian population in Singapore, which is about 7%.\r\n\r\nAnd  if only the Tamil reading population is taken\r\n\r\ninto  count, then the percentage would  be  lower.\r\n\r\nThe National Library makes every attempt to supply\r\n\r\nreading  material for its Tamil readers,  but  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  publications in Tamil  is  very  small\r\n\r\ncompared  to the publication in the other official\r\n\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister referred to the percentage of\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil  population. If  we  are  to  take  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of the reading population as  a  basis\r\n\r\nfor  calculation,  then the  libraries  must  also\r\n\r\ncarry the same percentage of books. However,  even\r\n\r\nthe 5% of the Tamil reading population can read 8%\r\n\r\nof  the  books that are available. So the Minister\r\n\r\nshould  not  make  a comparison on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\npopulation.  The books are needed in the  library,\r\n\r\nso  that people can go and read them and get  some\r\n\r\nknowledge about Tamil. I think Tamil is one of the\r\n\r\noldest  languages. So the Minister must  find  out\r\n\r\nwhat books are not there and he must try to supply\r\n\r\nthose  books.  If the Ministry has  no  funds,  he\r\n\r\nshould say, \"We have no money.\" That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very reassured by what the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid  regarding the matter I raised.

I have already talked  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  the  National  Museum  in  nation-building  and its activities being geared  towards\r\n\r\nnation-building.  May  I  express  the  hope  that\r\n\r\nencouragement would be given to the expansion  and\r\n\r\nfurther development of these activities with  more\r\n\r\nfacilities provided by Government. Admittedly, the\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  to modernise the National  Museum\r\n\r\nhave  included  the provision of an  art  gallery.\r\n\r\nMost  of  the money in any case has come from  the\r\n\r\nArts  Council.  The  measures have  also  included\r\n\r\ngalleries  and rooms for the display  of  the  art\r\n\r\ncollection  of  the University  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nrooms for art exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these physical amenities are coming up,\r\n\r\nthe  necessary staff to implement the plans of the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum have not been forthcoming.  There\r\n\r\nare  only  two curators, one for art and  one  for\r\n\r\nanthropology. While the curator of art  will  take\r\n\r\ncharge   of  the  art  gallery,  the  curator   of\r\n\r\nanthropology will be responsible for  a  vast  and\r\n\r\nbewildering  range  of  subjects  extending   from\r\n\r\nprehistory  through ethnology to present  history.\r\n\r\nIt  would  require a genius indeed  to  devote  an\r\n\r\nadequate amount of time to so many disciplines, to\r\n\r\nsuch an expanse of knowledge, and excel in all  of\r\n\r\nthem.  For  a start, there should be an additional\r\n\r\npost  of curator of history. There should also  be\r\n\r\nan official placed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  public education if  the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum  is  to  be  a centre for  social  Contact,\r\n\r\ncultural agitation and creative' activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I will admit that allocations for certain\r\n\r\nsubheads  in  relation  to the  Museum  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased. For example, there is $30,000 allocated\r\n\r\nfor the acquisition of museum exhibits; but really\r\n\r\nthis  is peanuts. I am not suggesting that  we  go\r\n\r\nout and purchase something like the Mona Lisa, but\r\n\r\nwe  need to put vitality into the work of the  art\r\n\r\ngallery  which  will have lasting  effect  on  the\r\n\r\ncultural  development of our young people  and  on\r\n\r\nfuture  generations; we shall have to be a  little\r\n\r\nmore  generous, Or we shall have to put  out  best\r\n\r\nfoot forward in trying to stimulate the generosity\r\n\r\nof potentially wealthy patrons of the art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, for many years the National Museum has the\r\n\r\nunenviable reputation of being a quiet and  mystic\r\n\r\nplace,   stuffed  with  dead  animals  and   other\r\n\r\nobjects.  With  the  transfer  of  the  zoological\r\n\r\ncomponents  of  the  exhibits  to  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nScience Centre in 1972, we have taken the decision\r\n\r\nto  modernise the museum and to have it  renovated\r\n\r\nso  that it may become an educational and cultural\r\n\r\ninstitution devoted to the technology, history and\r\n\r\narts  of  Singapore  and other  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  The three basic functions of  the  museum\r\n\r\nare   first,  as  a  repository  of  the  nation's\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage. Secondly,  a  fine  centre  of\r\n\r\ndisplay  so  that  its  exhibits  may  be   better\r\n\r\nunderstood and appreciated. Thirdly, it serves  as\r\n\r\na  centre of activities in order that museum-going\r\n\r\nmay   be  an  enriching  personal  experience   of\r\n\r\neducational benefit, cultural value,  and  fun  to\r\n\r\neveryone concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this, the National Museum has\r\n\r\nrecently gone into two projects, which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong has made some mention of it. The first\r\n\r\nproject  is to convert part of the Museum building\r\n\r\ninto  a  modern art gallery. This is made possible\r\n\r\nby the contribution of the Singapore Arts Council.\r\n\r\nThe Government also have a subsidy of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$100,000 in it. The renovation work, I hope,  will\r\n\r\nbe  completed  by the end of May this, year.  The\r\n\r\nsecond   project  is  to  renovate   three   small\r\n\r\ngalleries at a cost of $355,000 by the end of this\r\n\r\nyear. This is to provide latest display facilities\r\n\r\nto  do  justice  to the art collection,  which  is\r\n\r\nbeing   transferred   from   the   University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  to be relocated and displayed  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum. After being left alone for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  these  new projects will  stir  life  back\r\n\r\nagain in the National Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last financial year, even with\r\n\r\ncomparatively limited resources, eight or nine art\r\n\r\nexhibitions had been organised, four of which were\r\n\r\ninternational exhibitions. There were  many  other\r\n\r\nexhibitions for students, young people and so  on.\r\n\r\nWe recognise the need to expand the service in the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum, and there is Government  support\r\n\r\nfor this renovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member has- described the funds\r\n\r\nprovided for the acquisition of museum exhibits as\r\n\r\n\"peanuts\", I do not think so because comparing  it\r\n\r\nwith  the past provisions, there has been a  great\r\n\r\nincrease. For instance, in 1973 we had only $3,000\r\n\r\nfor  the  acquisition of museum exhibits,  and  in\r\n\r\n1974  this was increased to $30,000, and for  1975\r\n\r\nit  is  again $30,000. Compared to other projects,\r\n\r\nthis  may  be a very small sum but it is  a  great\r\n\r\nimprovement  over  the  previous  years'  figures.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a need for more to be done by\r\n\r\nthe   National  Museum  in  the  years  to   come,\r\n\r\nespecially the staffing problem, and I agree  that\r\n\r\nwe should look into this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is obvious\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister and I see not only eye  to  eye\r\n\r\nbut  almost word for word, judging from  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister has used the words which I have\r\n\r\nalso  used  previously about the National  Museum.\r\n\r\nObviously, we have been reading the same material,\r\n\r\nand with that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ivan Baptist -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead GAA 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Baptist is not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (b) of  subhead AAA 3020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Association has undoubtedly\r\n\r\ncontributed   towards  community  development   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. However, there are certain shortcomings\r\n\r\nthat must be remedied if community centres are  to\r\n\r\nserve  more  fruitfully the  civic,  cultural  and\r\n\r\nother  needs  of the community they  serve.  While\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres are sufficiently well  equipped\r\n\r\nand provide reasonably good facilities, others are\r\n\r\nnot  so  fortunately placed. In densely  populated\r\n\r\nhousing   estates   where   the   residents    are\r\n\r\npredominantly in the lower income group, the  need\r\n\r\nto  have  proper  facilities  is  relatively  more\r\n\r\nimportant.  .it  is  in  such  areas   that   more\r\n\r\nattention  should be paid to develop  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ncommunity consciousness and cohesion. It is in  my\r\n\r\nview    vitally   important   for   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation to, coordinate with the HDB and  other\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned  that  in  future   housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme adequate provision  is  made\r\n\r\nfor the building of community centres as well.  It\r\n\r\nwould  perhaps  be  preferable  to  have  standard\r\n\r\ndesigns   for  community  centres  so  that   some\r\n\r\nfacilities exist in all community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the People's Association's policy\r\n\r\npertaining to the allocation of funds,  there  are\r\n\r\nsome   disturbing  inconsistencies.  The   general\r\n\r\npolicy is that the People's Association will match\r\n\r\nits  contribution  on  a dollar-for-dollar  basis,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say, if the community centres  raise\r\n\r\n$100,000  the People's Association will contribute\r\n\r\nan   equivalent  amount,  subject  to  a   maximum\r\n\r\ncontribution of $300,000 where no community centre\r\n\r\nexists in the constituency,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  a  maximum  of $150,000 where a  constituency\r\n\r\nwhich has already a centre wishes to rebuild it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, this seems reasonable but the\r\n\r\nrub  is  that  some constituencies which  have  no\r\n\r\npermanent centres are housed temporarily in rented\r\n\r\nHDB  flats and are insufficiently and inadequately\r\n\r\nequipped.    They    are   temporary    make-shift\r\n\r\narrangements, and it is inequitable to allocate  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of only $150,000 in such cases. It is  not\r\n\r\nright  to  treat them on the same basis  as  those\r\n\r\nwhich  already  have permanent community  centres.\r\n\r\nThey should logically be allocated the maximum  of\r\n\r\n$300,000  to  enable them to put  up  a  permanent\r\n\r\nbuilding.  However, I would consider it reasonable\r\n\r\nto  expect a permanent community centre  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  funds  in  order   to   introduce\r\n\r\nfacilities additional to those already provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I notice there is an amendment* on the same subhead standing in the name of Mr Lee Yiok Seng.\r\n\r\nWould Mr Lee like to speak on it now?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that in this year's\r\n\r\nEstimates   the   provision   for   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation has been increased considerably, it is\r\n\r\nmy  hope that the increased provision will further\r\n\r\ndevelop the activities of the People's Association\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the people in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the annual staff\r\n\r\nturnover in the People's Association has been very\r\n\r\nhigh.

The staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association are properly trained and\r\n\r\nthe  great  number of resignations causes  serious\r\n\r\nstaff  shortages  in certain  cases.

Due to the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff  certain activities in the community centres\r\n\r\nare  losing  ground.  There  is  also  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nplanning of activities.

They\r\n\r\nhave  so much to do that they do not have any time\r\n\r\nfor  the  management  committees  of  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. Therefore, there  is  lack  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding between the headquarters' staff  and\r\n\r\nthe  members of the management committees.

It  creates discrimination  among\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  because some  constituencies  for\r\n\r\nsome  good  reason  are  able  to  build,  through\r\n\r\ndonations, a community centre varying perhaps from\r\n\r\n$4  million to $1 million.

The People's Association  have  under\r\n\r\nits  charge over 170 community centres.  Some  are\r\n\r\nsituated in the kampung areas where the population\r\n\r\nis  small.  The  People's Association,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthinks that they do not play an important function\r\n\r\nand have closed them down. These rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity centres are very small with very  simple\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Their   structures   are    somewhat\r\n\r\ndilapidated and in need of repair and renovations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the People's Association does not want to\r\n\r\nprovide the money. The community leaders in charge\r\n\r\nof  community  centres situated in crowded  areas,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  decided to take the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nextending or improving their community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a community centre is affected by urban\r\n\r\nrenewal, it will have to be rebuilt. Sometimes  in\r\n\r\nthis  changing age, to meet the development  needs\r\n\r\nof  the  locality concerned, the community leaders\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  expand  or rebuild  the  existing\r\n\r\ncommunity centres or even to build new and  better\r\n\r\nones.  According  to  newspaper  reports,  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  past many constituencies wanted  to  build\r\n\r\nnew  community  centres or to  rebuild  or  extend\r\n\r\nexisting community centres. I can mention at least\r\n\r\nten   such   constituencies:  Anson,  Boon   Teck,\r\n\r\nHavelock,  Jalan  Besar, Kampung  Chai  Chee,  Kim\r\n\r\nKeat,  Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar, Tiong Bahru  and\r\n\r\nToa Payoh constituencies. According to what I have\r\n\r\nlearnt, they need building funds varying with  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  types  of  structure  required  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious constituencies. The funds needed vary from\r\n\r\n$1/2  million  to  more than $1  million, but  my\r\n\r\nconservative  estimate is that  the  total  amount\r\n\r\nrequired to rebuild all these 10 community centres\r\n\r\nwould come to more than S5 million, which is not a\r\n\r\nsmall  sum  of money. A few days ago the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance said that $4 million in tax concession\r\n\r\nwas  a  large  sum of money. I would say  that  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  for rebuilding only 10 community  centres\r\n\r\nis  indeed a large sum of money, not to  think  of\r\n\r\nthe   other   community  centres   outside   these\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these need fund raising. But how\r\n\r\nmany Members of Parliament have the experience  of\r\n\r\nraising  funds?  some  Ministers  also  have   the\r\n\r\nexperience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  raising  funds. There are three  very  popular\r\n\r\nmethods. The first method is to publish a  special\r\n\r\npublication  and to canvass for advertisements  so\r\n\r\nthat  copies  of  these  thick  publications  will\r\n\r\nbecome  commercial propaganda manuals. The  second\r\n\r\nmethod  is  to organise variety concerts featuring\r\n\r\nstar singers comprising chits and lassies from the\r\n\r\nfour corners of the world, who would be invited to\r\n\r\ngo  on  the  platform of the National  Theatre  to\r\n\r\nchirp and chirr out \"I love you deep down to  your\r\n\r\nbones\"  type of songs. The third method is to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  grand  feast among the philanthropists  and\r\n\r\nenthusiasts  who  would be asked  to  bring  their\r\n\r\nfriends  to  glut with rich and delicious  dishes.\r\n\r\nSuch a function would leave a residue of funds for\r\n\r\nthe  building  of  community  centres.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nagainst  all  these methods. But  I  say  that  if\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders are forced to do  such  things,\r\n\r\nthis  will become a social vogue, a hot fad and  a\r\n\r\nsocial  force,  then  the situation  needs  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.  Why?  If  the  Budget  Section  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry ignores the reasonable request of\r\n\r\nthe People's Association for funds, and if the  PA\r\n\r\nofficials in charge of financial matters would not\r\n\r\nadjust the present policy as what the Members  for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley and Boon Teck have just  said,  then\r\n\r\nundoubtedly the trend will be towards the adoption\r\n\r\nof  these  three methods as the social vogue.  The\r\n\r\nsituation  will  arise when many  people  will  be\r\n\r\ncanvassing  for  advertisements; everywhere  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  people looking for powdered  faces  with\r\n\r\ntwisting  waists;  and everywhere  there  will  be\r\n\r\npeople glutting and gluttonising on rich food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, in the light of the President's\r\n\r\nspeech in this House, all this is contrary to  and\r\n\r\nnot  in keeping with the spirit of diligence, hard\r\n\r\nwork  and  self discipline which we are trying  to\r\n\r\npromote  for  the cause of nation  building.  This\r\n\r\nsocial  vogue is a contradiction and  a  chord  of\r\n\r\ndisharmony. It will also have unfavourable effects\r\n\r\non  our economic, cultural and social structure in\r\n\r\nthe long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to make two very\r\n\r\nimportant suggestions to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture. I hope he will give  special\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  them  or  convey  them  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  for  more  study.   First,\r\n\r\ndevelop  the function of the Development  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee   of   the  People's  Association,   the\r\n\r\nchairman of the committee being the Chief  Planner\r\n\r\nwho  is  a  professional man. Our colleagues  have\r\n\r\nalso  suggested that there should be some  liaison\r\n\r\nbetween the People's Association and the HDB, with\r\n\r\nwhich the Chief Planner is closely associated. The\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Keat is also on this Committee.  He\r\n\r\nis a city planer himself. The Development Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee should be able initially to project  the\r\n\r\nfuture plans for the type of community centres  to\r\n\r\nbe  built according to the needs of the urban  and\r\n\r\nrural population; i.e, whether they should be of a\r\n\r\ncertain  size  or type necessary  to  meet  future\r\n\r\nneeds. This careful planning should not envisage a\r\n\r\ngrand and luxurious building with facilities  that\r\n\r\nare not actually used, because it would be a waste\r\n\r\nof  money.  This is important. I do  not  think  a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre should have air-conditioning from\r\n\r\nthe  kitchen  to the hall, which may appear  grand\r\n\r\nbut not practical. To me it is a waste of money to\r\n\r\nhave  such  a luxurious community centre.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister wants to build such a community centre in\r\n\r\nmy constituency, I will say \"no thank you\" to him.\r\n\r\nI  was saying that the committee in charge shou1d\r\n\r\nplan  well as to where, when and how to set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  in  a particular  locality.  It\r\n\r\nshould  be up to the committee concerned to decide\r\n\r\nwhether  its  members should be  professionals  in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  constituencies in  urban  areas,\r\n\r\nparticularly    the   Ministers'   constituencies,\r\n\r\nreceive generous donations from philanthropists in\r\n\r\ntheir constituencies, lf $130,000 is collected  in\r\n\r\na  rural constituency ten times that amount can be\r\n\r\ncollected  in  an  urban  constituency.  But   for\r\n\r\nKampung Kembangan constituency, I am sure everyone\r\n\r\nknows how difficult it is to raise $130,000 needed\r\n\r\nto build a community centre to serve the residents\r\n\r\nof Kampung Eunos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the management committee submitted its\r\n\r\napplication  to  the  Director  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation for grants, the reply was  that  there\r\n\r\nwas no provision to build a community centre there\r\n\r\nand  that they themselves must raise funds if they\r\n\r\nwished  to  build  a  community  centre  in  their\r\n\r\nconstituency.  When they asked for  permission  to\r\n\r\norganise donation draws, the reply was that it was\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the People's Association  not  to\r\n\r\npermit   the  management  committee  to   organise\r\n\r\ndonation  draws. Is this not dampening the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  the management committee? But surprisingly, as\r\n\r\nhas  been  explained by my colleague  earlier  on,\r\n\r\nsome  constituencies have been  given  dollar-for-dollar  grants for their community centre building\r\n\r\nfund.  In  addition, permission was also given  to\r\n\r\norganise donation draws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, with the management committee's\r\n\r\ncontinuous  effort  and dedication  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, the Kampung Eunos Community Centre  was\r\n\r\nconstructed  at  a cost of about $130,000  without\r\n\r\ndonation  of even a single cent from the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. However, there are still many \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin-adequacies.   It   needs  more   facilities   like\r\n\r\nbadminton courts, basketball courts, sepak  takraw\r\n\r\ncourts, classrooms and raising the backyard of the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre.  In  addition  they   need   to\r\n\r\norganise courses and other activities. Letters  of\r\n\r\nappeal were sent by the management committee about\r\n\r\ntwo  months  ago for donations but there  was  not\r\n\r\neven   an  acknowledgement,  let  alone  a  reply.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  the management committee  expressed\r\n\r\nits  desire  to make an appointment  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nDirector  or  the Deputy Director of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  discuss the  problem  of  Kampung\r\n\r\nEunos  Community  Centre. But  their  request  was\r\n\r\nturned down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many problems which cause concern to\r\n\r\nthe    management   committee   because   of   the\r\n\r\nindifferent  attitude  of  the  officers  of   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association. The management committees of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  consist of voluntary  workers.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the People's Association should be\r\n\r\nvery  careful  and  diplomatic when  dealing  with\r\n\r\nmembers  of the management committees of community\r\n\r\ncentres.  The  ideal  is to  maintain  a  dialogue\r\n\r\nbetween   the   People's   Association   and   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees. The  People's  Association\r\n\r\nshould  not content itself with giving  orders  to\r\n\r\nthe management committees through its supervisors,\r\n\r\nwithout   advising  how  best  to  implement   its\r\n\r\ninstructions. I hope the Minister for Culture will\r\n\r\nensure  that  officers of the People's Association\r\n\r\nare  responsive to the suggestions and  complaints\r\n\r\nof  the  management committees. Otherwise we  will\r\n\r\nlose  valuable  volunteers  who  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndedicate themselves to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the policy of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation    is    to    encourage     community\r\n\r\nparticipation and involvement in the building of a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre.  If  the community  can  afford\r\n\r\nbetter facilities for their people, then they will\r\n\r\nbuild  a  better centre. If not, then  they  would\r\n\r\nhave a standard-type community centre. There is no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in this. Because of this, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  has  been  encouraging  the\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders in the management committees and\r\n\r\nso  on  to collect funds for the building of their\r\n\r\ncentres.  This  has been going on  for  many  many\r\n\r\nyears, and they find that this works very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time the People's Association has\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary to upgrade the facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe  community  centres to meet the rising  demand\r\n\r\nand  expectations  of the people.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  from the Government has to be  increased.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance,  therefore,  has  been\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  increase the quantum of  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy. This matter has been reviewed towards the\r\n\r\nend  of  1973  and  we  have  worked  out  certain\r\n\r\ncriteria  for the grant for building of  community\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck is under the wrong\r\n\r\nimpression that every constituency will  be  given\r\n\r\nan  amount  of  $300,000 for  the  building  of  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre. I am afraid  this  is  not  so.\r\n\r\nAccording to the new criteria which we have worked\r\n\r\nout with the Ministry of Finance, for key centres,\r\n\r\nthe  maximum Government subsidy is $150,000  on  a\r\n\r\ndollar-for-dollar  basis.  For   urban   community\r\n\r\ncentres,  the maximum Government subsidy  is  only\r\n\r\n$100,000  on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, the maximum  subsidy  is  only\r\n\r\n$60,000 on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This  upward\r\n\r\nrevision   of   Government   subsidies   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of community centres took effect only\r\n\r\nin the last quarter of 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy of $300,000 is given only to two\r\n\r\nconstituencies, namely, Henderson and  Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nThey  were  given this very special  consideration\r\n\r\nbecause they were newly created constituencies and\r\n\r\nthey  were  without a single community centre.  In\r\n\r\nview of the inflation in building costs and so on,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance has decided on an outright\r\n\r\ngrant of $300,000 for the first centre in each  of\r\n\r\nthese two constituencies. But then, this does  not\r\n\r\ninclude  the  cost of land which  has  got  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired. And, of course, the land cost would come\r\n\r\nto quite a lot more, which we have not worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, Members will appreciate the difficulty\r\n\r\nof  building community centres. It is not possible\r\n\r\nin  every instance to give an outright grant of  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of money for a centre. This has  to\r\n\r\nbe  measured  by  the  number  of  people  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency and whether or not there  is  already\r\n\r\nan  existing centre in the constituency.  So  this\r\n\r\ngrant  by the Ministry of Finance is very limited,\r\n\r\nand  therefore  we will have to  utilise  it  very\r\n\r\nwisely.  It  is not possible really to give  every\r\n\r\nconstituency   $300,000  to   build   a   $300,000\r\n\r\ncommunity centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with Members when they say that\r\n\r\nthere  is  discrimination in the  distribution  of\r\n\r\nfunds. As I have already stated just now, we  give\r\n\r\na fixed sum for the building of community centres.\r\n\r\nA maximum has to be fixed, otherwise there will be\r\n\r\nno  end  to  it. But above this maximum amount  of\r\n\r\nGovernment subsidy, if the community leaders,  and\r\n\r\nthe  people in that area can support or can afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  more for better facilities, then  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans  they  can raise their own funds.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  to be satisfied with  the  fixed\r\n\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not very certain of the suggestion made\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Henderson. He seems to be  very\r\n\r\ncritical  of  the  way community  leaders  collect\r\n\r\nfunds. Of course, they are trying their best. They\r\n\r\nmay  meet with a lot of difficulties but they  are\r\n\r\ntrying  their  best  to  collect  funds  to  build\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, It may be in  the  form  of  a\r\n\r\nvariety   show.  It  may  be  in   the   form   of\r\n\r\nadvertisements. But it is carried out in the  good\r\n\r\nspirit of fund raising. Apart from that, I am  not\r\n\r\nvery certain of what his suggestion is. I think he\r\n\r\nis  suggesting that we should build  more  centres\r\n\r\nbut  he  also objects to the collection  of  money\r\n\r\nfrom the public. I am not very certain what he was\r\n\r\nsaying.  But  I must say that his constituency  of\r\n\r\nHenderson  is getting very special attention  from\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association. With $300,000,  he  can\r\n\r\nbuild a very good centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is not how much money we\r\n\r\nshould spend on a community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentre. I agree with him that we should not\r\n\r\nhave  luxurious centres with air-conditioned rooms\r\n\r\nfor   the  committee  members,  and  so  on.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  thing is, what kind of  activities  are\r\n\r\nintroduced into the centre, and how well  can  the\r\n\r\ncentre  be  used.  I  will just  give  Members  an\r\n\r\nexample.  My  community centre in  Queenstown  was\r\n\r\nbuilt  more than 10 years ago. I do not  know  how\r\n\r\nmuch  it  cost us. It should be about  $20,000  to\r\n\r\n$30,000.  But  it  is  a  place  with  a  lot   of\r\n\r\nactivities  going on. We have the Girl  Pipers,  a\r\n\r\nphotographic   section  with  a  dark   room,   an\r\n\r\norchestra, and many other activities too. I  think\r\n\r\nit is how well we make use of the place. It is not\r\n\r\nhow much money can be spent on the centre. Members\r\n\r\nshould  bear this in mind. If the centre is  fully\r\n\r\nutilised,  then  I do not think  that  the  amount\r\n\r\nprovided by the Government is made inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the number of resignations by the\r\n\r\nstaff of the People's Association, I think this is\r\n\r\nnot  confined  only  to the People's  Association.\r\n\r\nMany  Government departments are facing  the  same\r\n\r\nproblem. The People's Association is no exception.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  want to point out is that the  number  of\r\n\r\nresignations is not so serious as the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang  wanted  us  to  believe.  For  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the Member, resignation figures  of\r\n\r\nthe full-time staff of the People's Association in\r\n\r\nthe last three years are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n       Year        Resignations\r\n\r\n       1972            119\r\n\r\n       1973             92\r\n\r\n       1974             77\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the same period, the total full-time staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association averaged  about  1,200.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in terms of percentage, the  number  of\r\n\r\nresignations has shown a downward trend from about\r\n\r\n10%  in  1972 to about 6.5% in 1974. I  must  also\r\n\r\npoint  out that the majority of those who resigned\r\n\r\nare Division III officers. So this does not affect\r\n\r\nthe  working of the People's Association.  We  are\r\n\r\ntrying our best and, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact,  it  is the standing policy of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation to improve the general performance  of\r\n\r\nDivisions  II  and  111 officers.  The  Organising\r\n\r\nSecretaries  and Assistant Organising  Secretaries\r\n\r\nare  sent  for  training  in  the  National  Youth\r\n\r\nLeadership Training Institute. On completion, they\r\n\r\nare put to better use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons for the resignations.\r\n\r\nSometimes it may be because of the nature  of  the\r\n\r\nwork and of the irregular working hours, and maybe\r\n\r\nthe  salary is not as attractive as those  offered\r\n\r\nby  the  commercial firms outside. In  general,  I\r\n\r\nwould   say   that   to  work  in   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  especially the field workers,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  sense of dedication and  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice.  They should not expect normal  regular\r\n\r\nworking hours like office clerks. However, what we\r\n\r\nhave  done  is this. We have asked the  Management\r\n\r\nServices  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to\r\n\r\nconduct  a  comprehensive  survey  of  the  entire\r\n\r\norganisational structure and other related matters\r\n\r\nof  the  People's  Association,  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nimproving the terms and conditions of service  and\r\n\r\nto    provide   better   prospects   for    career\r\n\r\nadvancement.  Once this is done, I  hope  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to further reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nresignations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan has raised a\r\n\r\npoint  concerning  his community  centre.  He  was\r\n\r\nsaying that when his management, committee of  the\r\n\r\nKampung   Eunos   Community   Centre   asked   for\r\n\r\npermission to run a Lucky Draw to raise funds,  it\r\n\r\nwas  turned  down whereas other community  centres\r\n\r\nwere  allowed to do so. I think he was  under  the\r\n\r\nimpression   that   his   community   centre   was\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against. Before 1973 the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association was not to encourage the\r\n\r\nholding  of  lucky draws by community centres  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of raising funds. But as a result  of\r\n\r\nintensified development programmes, people  wanted\r\n\r\nmore  money  and we had to yield to  this  demand.\r\n\r\nTherefore, after 1973, we allowed certain  centres\r\n\r\nto hold lucky draws. The request from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKampung Kembangan Community Centre was made before\r\n\r\n1973, and therefore it was not allowed. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  policy  and  not  discrimination.  The\r\n\r\nrequest just came in too early. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the request to stage\r\n\r\nan exposition in Gay World and said that there was\r\n\r\nnot  even an acknowledgment letter. My information\r\n\r\nis  that  the  People's Association  had  actually\r\n\r\nreplied to the Member's request on the 29th April,\r\n\r\n1974, advising him not to hold the exposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

The\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture said just now that he had the\r\n\r\nimpression that I am opposed to donations. I would\r\n\r\nlike to say that I do not oppose because donations\r\n\r\nare  given  every  year  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nactivities of community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I touched on was the building of community\r\n\r\ncentres.  I have even given figures to  show  that\r\n\r\nthe  funds  required in each case  range  from  $\ufffd\r\n\r\nmillion  to  more than $1 million. If a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  wants  to  raise funds  -  in  fact,  many\r\n\r\ncommunity centres want to do so\r\n\r\n-  there are other organisations too that want  to\r\n\r\nraise funds. What is he going to do about it?  All\r\n\r\nI  am saying is that the Development Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Association should decide on the type\r\n\r\nand  size  of  the community centre to  be  built,\r\n\r\nwhether  it should be square or round and  matters\r\n\r\nrelating thereto, After the decision is made,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association must be  consistent  in  the\r\n\r\npolicy. They should not later argue that because a\r\n\r\ncertain  constituency is a Minister's constituency\r\n\r\nthey  should give it priority over a Backbencher's\r\n\r\nconstitiency.  What I am trying  to  say  is  that\r\n\r\npersonal  considerations should not be allowed  to\r\n\r\ninfluence priority. This is important. Of  course,\r\n\r\nflexibility could be allowed because of  financial\r\n\r\nposition.  But, there must be some consistency  in\r\n\r\nthe policy to carry the job through to the finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that - Sir, allow me another\r\n\r\nminute - in my constituency although I may  get  a\r\n\r\nmoderate  community centre with a $300,000  grant,\r\n\r\nlast year's planning for our community centre  was\r\n\r\na  budget  of  about $600,000 and the  Development\r\n\r\nCommittee of the People's Association had  decided\r\n\r\nto  approve  it. However, the People's Association\r\n\r\nfinally  told  us that since there were  no  funds\r\n\r\navailable we would not have a new community centre\r\n\r\nand  whether we would be satisfied with a  smaller\r\n\r\none.  I  must  stress the point that the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation must be consistent. There  should  not\r\n\r\nbe   any   variation  merely  because  of  certain\r\n\r\npersonal   or  financial  relationship  with   the\r\n\r\nMinistry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Finance so that the People's Association could\r\n\r\nsuddenly  change its mind, thus causing  delay  in\r\n\r\nsocial    development.   How   is   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  going  to promote youth  movement  in\r\n\r\nthis  way? I hope the Minister will kindly  convey\r\n\r\nmy   opinion  to  the  People's  Association  that\r\n\r\ndevelopment planning must be consistently  carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

Thirdly, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  in my prepared speech I did not say that  in\r\n\r\nareas  where  there are no community centres  they\r\n\r\ncan  claim a maximum of $300,000. I said  \"subject\r\n\r\nto a maximum of $300,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two situations involving community\r\n\r\ncentres in the constituencies. One is where you do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  community centre at all. Another  is\r\n\r\nwhere  the  community  centre  occupies  a  rented\r\n\r\npremises.  I  told the Director  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation that if this was the case I had better\r\n\r\nclose  my  community centre, which premises  is  a\r\n\r\nrented one,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  six  months,  and could I then  claim  for  a\r\n\r\nmaximum grant? I should say that what we ought  to\r\n\r\nbe  interested  in  is not  to  ask  for  a  grand\r\n\r\ncommunity centre with air-conditioning and so  on,\r\n\r\nbut  a  community  centre which provides  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  facilities as in  any  other  community\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure I did not mention that the question of\r\n\r\na  dollar-for-dollar donation is no  good.  I  say\r\n\r\nthis is encouraging, and I am prepared to go along\r\n\r\nwith   this  idea.  I  am  sure  all  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  accept that this  is  a  good  way  to\r\n\r\ndevelop    civic    consciousness    among     our\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now I heard the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  People's Association  does  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against the various constituencies. I\r\n\r\nwas  not happy to hear that. Originally I  had  no\r\n\r\nintention to talk on this topic as I thought  that\r\n\r\nthe People's Association is a piece of rotten wood\r\n\r\nthat  cannot be used for carving, and there is  no\r\n\r\nremedy  to  it.  But, after having heard  what  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues    had   said   about   the    People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  I have got to stand  up  to  support\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency there is a small-sized\r\n\r\ncommunity centre, the Bartley Community Centre. In\r\n\r\n1970  when  the community centre was set  up,  the\r\n\r\nplace  was  already dilapidated. The  planks  were\r\n\r\nabout to collapse. So we decided to raise funds to\r\n\r\nrebuild  it.  After  a  certain  amount  had  been\r\n\r\nraised,  we  heard nothing more from the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  We  then  asked  for  permission  to\r\n\r\n\"tender\",  but there was no news. Five years  have\r\n\r\nalready  passed. But still I did not want to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  it, because I want to see how long  is  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association going to delay this matter. I\r\n\r\nbelieve that if the Bartley Community Centre  were\r\n\r\nin a Minister's constituency, then if a centre was\r\n\r\nasked for by tomorrow, it would already have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt by yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, may I reply to the Member for Henderson.\r\n\r\nThere   is   actually  at  present  a  Development\r\n\r\nCommittee looking into the facilities for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity centres in all the constituencies.  This\r\n\r\nDevelopment Committee has the discretion to decide\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not priority should  be  given  to  a\r\n\r\ncentre.  That  is always the case in the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise here that there is no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in the building of a centre  or  in\r\n\r\nattending    to   the   work   of   the    various\r\n\r\nconstituencies. For example, the community centres\r\n\r\nwhich  are now under construction are: the  Jurong\r\n\r\nNew  Town  Community Centre, the Sennett Community\r\n\r\nCentre, and the Joo Chiat Community Centre.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  any one of these  falls  in  a\r\n\r\nconstituency where the Member of Parliament  is  a\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  do not think Jurong is a  Minister's\r\n\r\nconstituency.  So are Sennett and  Joo  Chiat.  So\r\n\r\nneither  has  priority been given to  any  one  of\r\n\r\nthese  constituencies. This is not because the  MP\r\n\r\nof  that  area  is a Minister but because  of  the\r\n\r\nurgency  and  the decision made by the Development\r\n\r\nCommittee. It could be that funds have  been  made\r\n\r\navailable  by  the  hard  work  of  the  community\r\n\r\nleaders  in  that  area.  So  the  allegation   of\r\n\r\nfavouritism  or  discrimination  has  no   grounds\r\n\r\nreally.  If  there  is  discrimination,  then  the\r\n\r\nglaring  example  should be  seen  in  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nwhere  I am the MP. But anyone can have a look  at\r\n\r\nthe Queenstown Community Centre to see whether any\r\n\r\npriority  or  favouritism has been given  to  that\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck has asked me to clarify\r\n\r\ncertain  points.  First, whether any  priority  is\r\n\r\ngiven. I think we do, but not according to whether\r\n\r\nthe MP is a Minister but according to whether that\r\n\r\narea  has a centre or not. For instance,  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven priority to Henderson and Toa Payoh. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Henderson, we have even gone out  of  our\r\n\r\nway  to  increase the subsidy, but the MP  or  the\r\n\r\npeople there do not seem to like the design and so\r\n\r\nthere  has been some disagreement. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nproject has been held up. We had an argument  with\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance and finally we managed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecure  more money for Henderson. We got  $300,000\r\n\r\nand the People's Association was also prepared  to\r\n\r\ndig  out from its savings another $100,000 to  add\r\n\r\nto  the  building cost of the Henderson  community\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question which the Member asked is\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  it  is a good  idea  to  have  a\r\n\r\nstandard type community centre. I personally think\r\n\r\nthat  it  may not be a good idea to have the  same\r\n\r\ntype of community centre in every constituency. We\r\n\r\nshould  allow some free-play of design,  since  we\r\n\r\nhave  so  many architects. In this way,  we  could\r\n\r\nfind   the,   best  possible  solution   for   our\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about the delay in the building of\r\n\r\na community centre in Paya Lebar, but I presume it\r\n\r\nmust  be a small rural type of centre. It  is  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to  discourage the rural type of community\r\n\r\ncentres. With better communication and so  on,  it\r\n\r\nis a good idea for community centres to pool their\r\n\r\nresources  in order to build a good centre  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to  spread  them out in too many  areas  and\r\n\r\nbuild a sub-standard type of centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  clarify  this point. The Member for  Henderson\r\n\r\nshould  be  happy to receive $300,Q00. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Toa Payoh will also be getting $300,000. Boon\r\n\r\nTeck  is  also a new constituency, and it  is  the\r\n\r\nsmallest of all the 65 constituencies. It has only\r\n\r\none road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No need for a community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Yes, no need for a community\r\n\r\ncentre. Perhaps my constituents can share the  use\r\n\r\nof   the  community  centre  at  Toa  Payoh.  But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, my constituents feel that there is a\r\n\r\nneed for a community centre because more than  75%\r\n\r\nof them live in one-room flats. A community centre\r\n\r\nwill  not  only  provide the social  and  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities for the lower income group but it  will\r\n\r\nalso  be used by students to study there. I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  more urgent and the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nshould  convince  the  Minister  for  Finance   to\r\n\r\nincrease the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsum   of  $300,000,  which  I  consider  is   very\r\n\r\nunrealistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is if there is no discrimination,\r\n\r\nwhy  is  Boon  Teck  constituency  given  $150,000\r\n\r\nagainst Henderson's $400,000? I am sure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kim  Keat  will support me, but unfortunately\r\n\r\nlie  is  in the People's Association and he cannot\r\n\r\nstand up to support me. Boon Teck constituency has\r\n\r\na   community  centre  housed  in  a  rented  shop\r\n\r\npremises which has been converted into a temporary\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre. May I request the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nenlighten me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think we would leave this request for\r\n\r\nconsideration. It may be that the constituency  is\r\n\r\nso  small  that  it  is  unrealistic  to  have   a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is unfair for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to say this. I have  consulted  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of the People's Association and  I  have\r\n\r\npointed out to him that Boon Teck constituency  is\r\n\r\nin urgent need of a community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, there are a number of reasons why a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre is not built in Boon Teck, it may\r\n\r\nbe  that  land is not available. It  may  be  that\r\n\r\nmoney  is also not available. There arc also other\r\n\r\nreasons, but I can assure the Member that  if  the\r\n\r\nright combination of reasons is found and if there\r\n\r\nis  a  good case we would, of course, support  his\r\n\r\nrequest to build a community centre at Boon Teck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to enlighten me on\r\n\r\none point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Phey, I do not think we can prolong the debate\r\n\r\nany  longer.
