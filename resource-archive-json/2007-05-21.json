Officials on both sides worked hard and made progress. Given that both agreements involve many complex issues, significant give-and-take was required on both sides. On 23rd April 2007, the Foreign and Defence Ministers, as well as armed forces chiefs, from both sides met to discuss the outstanding issues in Singapore. In a spirit of compromise and friendship, both sides sorted out their differing positions vis-a-vis the various issues and reached agreement on the ET and DCA as a political package. This means that the two signed Agreements contained a carefully negotiated balance of benefits. These agreements are good for both countries. Now that they have been signed, the next step is for both agreements to be ratified by Singapore and Indonesia through our own procedures.&nbsp; As they are a package, we have agreed that they should come into force together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Indonesia,&nbsp;as we all know, is a close neighbour. Our relations are extensive and broad-based. It is therefore in our interest to find opportunities to work with them where we can. The ET and DCA will help lay a strong foundation for further cooperation in the future. The<p align=left>Column: 681<p> ET will strengthen our cooperation with Indonesia in tackling crime and other offences, including acts of terrorism, in accordance with the domestic laws of each country. Similarly, we would like to enhance the enduring defence ties between the SAF and the Indonesian Armed Forces (or TNI) and strengthen the professional bonds and interoperability of the two militaries through the DCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these agreements come into force, relations between Singapore and Indonesia will enter a new phase. But this does not mean that there will be no more bilateral issues. Indeed, signing an ET has removed a bone of contention in bilateral relations but it may also create other problems. For example, there are legal procedures and judicial processes which have to be followed when an extradition request is made. Indonesia's police and judicial processes will be subject to review by our judges and vice versa. It is therefore important that both sides understand this and allow the due process of law in each country to take its course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, it is natural that differences in bilateral relations will arise from time to time between close neighbours. We can resolve them together, as long as we take the right perspective against the overall relationship.&nbsp; This should also not stop us from finding ways to resolve these differences or explore new areas of cooperation on a \"win-win\" basis. The ET and DCA&nbsp;are&nbsp; good examples of how our countries were able to tackle difficult issues and find mutually beneficial solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am therefore confident that Singapore-Indonesia relations will continue to mature and deepen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But we have since learned that the DCA has hit some snags,&nbsp;there are several agreements which have not been signed, and there are problems arising from that.&nbsp; Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether this means that if the DCA and its implementing agreements are not signed as mutually agreed upon earlier, then the ET will be off?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, we are looking forward that both will be ratified.&nbsp; There are some snags in terms of implementation issues, but we are waiting for the Indonesian side to conclude that, and we look forward to signing both together.&nbsp; Our understanding is that, in fact, both will have to be signed together and both will be made applicable at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State: since it was signed two months after the sand ban, did we sign it because we were under the pressure of the sand ban?&nbsp; My next question is: what has we sacrificed or compromised in reaching this agreement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But specifically in answer to her question about sand, they are separate matters and are not linked.&nbsp; As I recounted earlier, the decision to negotiate and<p align=left>Column: 683<p> conclude both the ET and DCA as a package was made much earlier in October 2005.&nbsp; The negotiations were already well advanced when land, sand and granite became an issue earlier this year.&nbsp; It was a distraction but not related to these talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indonesians have repeatedly stated that there is no ban on granite sales.&nbsp; It is the prerogative of the Indonesian government to sell or not sell us sand so long as they comply with the WTO rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you all know, and&nbsp;it has been reported before, we have made alternative arrangements for our sand supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</B>:&nbsp; To answer that question, there are others who are saying why it has taken so long.&nbsp; We started back in 2005.&nbsp; Many had, in fact, complained as though we were dragging our feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when both Ministers and the chiefs of the armed forces&nbsp;met - after the officials had not been able to come to any agreement -&nbsp;they were able to iron out the differences and even come to a conclusion. I do not know whether it was a surprise,&nbsp;but I think it was timely.&nbsp; I do not think the sand and the granite issue which came just before that was the primary contribution towards the signing of the two agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) is a strategic framework for mutually beneficial defence cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia.&nbsp; The agreement provides for a balance of benefits to the SAF and TNI, and will promote closer relations, greater cooperation and interoperability between the two armed forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the DCA, we will restart joint projects which the SAF and TNI find professional value in, including the Air Weapons Range and Air Combat Manoeuvring Range in Pekanbaru, and the use of a naval gunfire support scoring system in Pulau Kayu Ara in the South China Sea.&nbsp; There will also be a new area of cooperation between the two armies with the development of facilities and infrastructure at the Baturaja Land Forces <p align=left>Column: 685<p>Training Area in south Sumatra.&nbsp; The SAF will benefit from having access to these facilities and being able to train alongside their Indonesian counterparts.&nbsp; Such training opportunities will allow the SAF and TNI to develop professionally and enhance their interoperability, which has enabled both armed forces to work closely together in times of need.&nbsp; We have seen them&nbsp;do so&nbsp;in instances such as in the search and recovery operations following the crash of SilkAir Flight MI 185 near Palembang in December 1997 and in the tsunami relief mission to Aceh in December 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will continue to provide training assistance to the TNI through simulator training for their pilots, including the F-5, G-FET and Super Puma simulator training, and restarting professional courses like the Combined Fighter Weapons Instructor Course.&nbsp; To date, over 250 TNI-AU pilots have undergone simulator training in Singapore, and 10 TNI-AU instructors have graduated from the Combined Fighter Weapons Instructor Course.&nbsp; We will also continue to offer the TNI academic courses, such as scholarships to pursue postgraduate studies in Singapore at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, as well as English language courses at the Regional Language Centre (RELC).&nbsp; To date, 12 TNI officers have graduated from postgraduate studies in Singapore, while 120 have gone through the English language course at RELC.&nbsp; We will also provide the TNI with naval technical assistance and access to training facilities in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will benefit from having access to training areas in Indonesia for the conduct of military training and exercises.&nbsp; While the SAF has access to training areas and facilities in many countries, the DCA will allow the SAF to <p align=left>Column: 686<p>conduct useful training closer to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, most importantly, the DCA will allow us to strengthen the strategic relationship between the SAF and TNI, which goes back more than 30 years.&nbsp; The TNI is an important institution in Indonesia.&nbsp;The DCA will promote closer interaction and interoperability between the two armed forces, enabling them to work effectively together in times of need.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The LTA has completed a Station Upgrade Project begun in 2000 to enhance the accessibility of MRT stations along the North-South and East-West lines.&nbsp; Lifts, tactile guidance systems and accessible toilets were installed.&nbsp; Each station also had at least one entrance upgraded to be barrier-free for wheelchair users.&nbsp; These features are already present in the stations on the North-East Line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA is currently reviewing whether some stations require more than&nbsp;one entrance with a lift to make it easier for our less mobile citizens to access our trains more conveniently.&nbsp; Any enhanced standards would also apply to the Downtown Line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheelchair-accessible buses have been introduced progressively since June 2006.&nbsp; They have been introduced on&nbsp;five bus routes identified in consultation with the voluntary welfare organisations and more will be rolled out.&nbsp; Bus stops along such routes are also upgraded to ensure accessibility.&nbsp; By 2010, 40% of our public bus fleet will be wheelchair accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2006, LTA launched a programme to implement barrier-free routes within a 400-metre radius of all MRT and LRT stations.&nbsp; These measures include having an unobstructed pedestrian walkway wide enough for a wheelchair to pass, ensuring that the pavements are flush with the road surface, introducing ramps where necessary, and providing decision tactiles to guide the visually impaired at crossings and pedestrian overhead bridges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 690<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, LTA will also look at providing more traffic light crossings at suitable locations, as such crossings are more convenient for the elderly and less mobile.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA will continue to enhance our land transport system to meet the varied needs of our population as we move towards a more socially inclusive society.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, on stretches like expressways and main arterial roads where the speed is a lot higher,&nbsp;pedestrian overhead bridges would be used.&nbsp; This is the guiding principle.&nbsp; And where there are no land take constraints, ramps&nbsp;could be considered&nbsp;to also facilitate these movements. A lot of what is available is usually constrained by what is possible at the different sites, such as a more gradual gradient for the ramp and this would be taken into consideration whenever LTA decides to construct a pedestrian overhead bridge.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Miss Penny Low</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it therefore imply that in places like new towns, in particular, there could be the possibility of building&nbsp;more graduated or low gradient overhead bridges?&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, I would&nbsp;like to also ask two supplementary questions.&nbsp; The Minister of State mentioned that 40% of the buses will be disabled-friendly by 2010.&nbsp; May I ask if it is possible to accelerate that because to wait for the next five years, or maybe<p align=left>Column: 691<p> even 10 years, to get 100% is actually a long wait for the disabled population.&nbsp; On top of that,&nbsp;is it also possible to enlarge some of the pedestrian walkways, especially in new towns, so that they can also be wheelchair friendly?&nbsp; One last supplementary question:&nbsp;&nbsp;have the pedestrian crossings&nbsp;been effective because there had been a number of accidents in the past?&nbsp; If it is not, are there plans for road safety education?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me take the questions in turn.&nbsp; Generally, where overhead bridges or signalised pedestrian crossings are built in densely built-up areas, the land take is really quite a severe constraint. Therefore, even though we can plan for new towns and accommodate some of the overhead bridges to provide for ramps, this will still be ultimately a balance between the other users of the overhead bridges as well as the elderly and the disabled.&nbsp; A balance has to be struck because if the gradient is far too gentle, then all those who are more able will actually have to walk a fuller length of the ramp which then might defeat the whole purpose of facilitating a quick crossing of the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the 40% target that we are reaching in 2010, this is really&nbsp;to accommodate the replacement programme of the buses as it is very expensive to replace all buses at one go. And this is already being funded by the Government in terms of providing the cost of equipping the buses with these ramps.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has also asked whether walkways could be wide enough to accommodate the needs of the wheelchair users. Again, this is a balance that we have to strike as it involves the allocation of space.&nbsp; This applies equally to road space, space at the side table.&nbsp; Generally, at the end of the day, it is a question of the constraints of the area and&nbsp;the needs of the different stakeholders.&nbsp; And, by and large, for some of these where there are possibilities, then grassroots organisations would be involved in the <p align=left>Column: 692<p>discussion of what might be the most appropriate for that particular situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I think Miss Penny Low alludes to the point of public education and personal safety. The Government can only go so far as to provide the structures, such as signalised pedestrian crossings or overhead bridges.&nbsp; But, ultimately, the responsibility is for each pedestrian to maintain his own personal safety and to look out for&nbsp;himself.&nbsp; So you could have a signalised pedestrian crossing, but if the user does not want to wait and decides to jay walk across, then he is putting his own life in danger.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:TRANSPORT SYSTEM AND NETWORK ON SENTOSA ISLAND--><p align=left>Column: 692<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:TRANSPORT SYSTEM AND NETWORK ON SENTOSA ISLAND:::694-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the current tightness in the office space market is due to high demand, which is driven by Singapore's robust economic growth over the last two years, coupled with low net supply due to the previous few years of slow growth, the conversion of office space to other uses and the redevelopment of office buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the increase in demand of 290,000 square metres in 2006 was the highest annual increase since year 2000.&nbsp; On the other hand, because not many new office projects were initiated in the last few years, and with the conversion of some office buildings to other uses and the redevelopment of office buildings, the net additional supply of office space was low.&nbsp; In 2005/2006, the supply increased by only 47,000 square metres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the situation is expected to improve in 2010 when a substantial amount of new supply, totalling about 330,000 square metres, comes on stream.&nbsp; This includes 180,000 square metres of office space from Phase 1 of the Marina Bay Financial Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp; MND will continue to release land at a steady pace via the Government Land Sales Programme, to ensure that there is<p align=left>Column: 695<p> sufficient land for office developments in the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, the market is already making some adjustments to mitigate the current tight situation.&nbsp; For example, some companies have started to reorganise their operations so that they can relocate either fully or partially out of the Central Area.&nbsp; This will free up some office space in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides office buildings, space at business parks can also meet the needs of some companies.&nbsp; Backroom operations and data centres of financial institutions or SMEs can be housed in such business park space.&nbsp; For example, a new 20,000 square metres development has just been completed in Changi Business Park which can cater to such backroom user needs.&nbsp; More business park space is expected to be completed over the next two to three years, to help meet the office space needs of suitable firms.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies can also consider leasing vacant State buildings, such as office buildings or suitable old school buildings, which are immediately available and can be put to office use quickly.&nbsp; SLA has made available some 51,000 square metres of such space.&nbsp; More such properties suitable for office use will be made available in the next few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further ease the short-term shortage, URA will be identifying sites for the development of transitional offices.&nbsp; These sites will be made available on short-term leases for the development of low-rise office buildings of about three to four storeys.&nbsp; They can be built quickly in about one year and at relatively low cost, and can thus meet more immediate needs.&nbsp; More details on the development of transitional offices will be made available shortly.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, measures to meet office demand in the short term will not be effective if<p align=left>Column: 696<p> there is a continual depletion of office space through the conversion of existing office buildings to other uses.&nbsp; This is taking place despite the tight office situation, especially within the Central Area.&nbsp; As such, URA has announced earlier today that it will temporarily disallow conversion of office buildings to other uses in the Central Area until 31st December 2009.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain the rationale for this move.&nbsp; The conversion of office buildings in the Central Area worsens the current office situation in two ways.&nbsp; Firstly, it immediately removes supply from the office stock, as buildings are demolished or closed for refurbishment.&nbsp; Secondly, the decanted businesses exert additional demand as they have to look for alternative space to relocate their operations.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these buildings are in reasonably good condition and can still meet the needs of most office users, especially in the next two to three years.&nbsp; While the Government does encourage building owners to rejuvenate and redevelop their older buildings, such redevelopment is not appropriate at this point in time.&nbsp; It will worsen the office supply shortage, and hinder our efforts to attract financial institutions and other businesses who are thinking of setting up offices or expanding their existing operations in Singapore.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND and URA will continue to monitor the office market closely and when the supply situation improves, we will remove this restriction.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Member also asked whether my Ministry will publish information on available office space.&nbsp; I would like to inform her that such information is already provided by property agents and consultants and are publicly available.&nbsp; There is no need for the Government to duplicate their efforts.&nbsp; However, what<p align=left>Column: 697<p> we can and will do is to publish information on the new supply of office space in specific projects that will be completed over the next few years.&nbsp; I hope the release of such additional information will improve the working of the office space market and facilitate the necessary market adjustments in supply going forward.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the comprehensive response to my questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have two supplementary questions for the Minister:&nbsp;Would the Ministry consider some sort of a relocation grant to ease the burden of some of the SMEs who have actually been forced to shift because of redevelopment?&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the fact that from now till 2010, when there will be more supply of office space, in the interim, would the Minister consider liberalising the use of residential homes for some of these operations?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;</B> <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; Sir, the Member asked whether we would consider a relocation grant to ease the financial burdens of SMEs due to redevelopment.&nbsp; If she is referring to the relocation of SMEs from existing commercial buildings, then this is something that the SMEs or the tenants have to take up and discuss with the landlords of the buildings themselves.&nbsp; However, if it is a matter of relocating from Government premises, eg, SMEs relocating out of HDB industrial parks, yes, there are schemes that are in place which do provide some relocation grants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the interim shortage of office space, as I have explained earlier, this is due to quite a severe imbalance in supply and demand.&nbsp; The Ministry, as well as other Government agencies, is looking into various ways of meeting this<p align=left>Column: 698<p> demand, especially in the short term.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we have decided to allocate sites for transitional office space.&nbsp; Whilst there is sufficient space coming on stream in 2010 and beyond, the problem is a shortage of space from now until 2010.&nbsp; So, in order to try to meet that transitional shortage, we would like to offer such sites for transitional offices.&nbsp; And, indeed, these offices are quite easy to build and also very comfortable.&nbsp; I believe some Members may have visited the LTA offices in Kampong Java.&nbsp; These offices were built very quickly and at a very low cost.&nbsp; The people who are working there tell me that it is a very comfortable office to work in.&nbsp; So that can help plug some of the gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For SMEs or small businesses who want to start up or who have difficulties looking for space, they are currently able to use residential premises for their office.&nbsp; HDB has a Home Office Scheme.&nbsp; The Home Office Scheme is very well taken up.&nbsp; Anybody who would like to set up an office for two to three people, or who would like to experiment and start off on a very modest basis, can register their office using an HDB address.&nbsp; In fact, many have already done so.&nbsp; If the Member is interested, I would be happy to send her further information on this scheme.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Ellen Lee:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I just like to ask the Minister,&nbsp;when he mentioned about&nbsp;short-term leases, is he talking about leases below three years until 2010 when the supply is stabilised?&nbsp; And what will happen to all these transitional offices once all these leases expire, because that would mean relocation and incurring more cost again for these businesses that have to relocate?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member is correct in pointing out that if the leases are too short, there will be disruption problems later on when the leases expire.&nbsp; Similarly, if the leases are too short, then<p align=left>Column: 699<p> it is not worthwhile for people to take up those leases.&nbsp; So we are looking at a suitable lease which will not be too short but which will not be too long either that would cause the cost of the land to go up. &nbsp;We are looking at something around 9-10 years' lease, renewable over two to three tranches.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> &nbsp; Sir, I would like to know whether MND or any other Ministry has made an assessment of the impact of this rental hike: (a) on the survivability&nbsp;or cost of doing business for the small enterprises; and (b) on the price of consumer goods and services to the&nbsp;consumers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, as far as the impact on the final price of goods and services to the consumers is concerned, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has a CPI index that it publishes regularly.&nbsp; I believe that the overall impact on inflation so far, not just because of the shortage of space and rent hikes but many other things, is relatively mild.&nbsp; I will leave MTI to announce the details.<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the impact on cost of doing business is concerned, let me just point out for Members' benefit that although our office rental rates have gone up, in terms of the overall comparison with other major global business hubs in the world, we are still ranked relatively low.&nbsp; Compared to, say, New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, we are actually ranked quite far down the list.&nbsp; In fact, I have got some figures here.&nbsp; If I may share this with Members, there is a Global Office Occupancy Cost Survey that was done in January 2007, and it ranked Singapore number 55 in terms of overall office occupancy cost.&nbsp; I think they define this \"cost\" to mean not just the cost of rental per se but also the cost of maintenance, property tax, and so on.&nbsp; In terms of overall cost, we are number 55, way down the list.&nbsp; London is number one, then Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo,<p align=left>Column: 700<p> Seoul, and so on.&nbsp; This is obviously something which we would like to monitor closely.&nbsp; We do not want to price ourselves out of the market if the costs of doing business in Singapore are too high.&nbsp; At the same time, I think we should also bear in mind that there is a limited amount of rabbits that the Government can pull out of its hat in terms of keeping costs down, especially when it comes to land cost, especially in a situation where land is in short supply.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SUB-SALE OF PRIVATE PROPERTIES IN CENTRAL AND OUTER CENTRAL REGIONS--><p align=left>Column: 700<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SUB-SALE OF PRIVATE PROPERTIES IN CENTRAL AND OUTER CENTRAL REGIONS:::702-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The higher level of sub-sale activity in the CCR compared to that in the RCR and OCR was due partly to the strong foreign interest in this segment of the property <p align=left>Column: 701<p>market.&nbsp; It is in line with the robust growth of our economy and reflects the confidence of foreigners and investors in the growth prospects of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of sub-sales in the first quarter of 2007 is still lower than that in 1996, when sub-sales reached a high of 1,700 per quarter and accounted for up to 28% of all private residential transactions in a quarter.&nbsp; In comparison, sub-sales as a proportion of all private transactions in the first quarter of 2007 is 6.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to inform Members that sub-sale activity is only one of the many indicators that the Government keeps track of to ensure that the residential property market is healthy and growing in a sustainable manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also monitors the prices of private residential properties.&nbsp; Recently, there have been media reports which cited developers achieving record sale prices for their projects.&nbsp; While some of these high priced transactions do take place, I am concerned that such reports may not paint the full picture and as a result may mislead home purchasers.&nbsp; For example, such record prices could be for a few choice units with special attributes and not be representative of the transacted prices for most of the units in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have therefore asked URA to work with the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) to see how we can give a fuller picture of the range of transacted prices for all newly launched private residential projects. This will further improve the transparency and efficiency of the Singapore property market and help buyers and sellers make more informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to assure Members that the Government will continue to monitor the<p align=left>Column: 702</p> property market closely.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the price of concrete is determined by the market.&nbsp; Following the sudden disruption in the supplies of concreting sand and granite from Indonesia in February and March respectively, concrete price rose to about $200 per cubic metre.&nbsp; This was due largely to the significantly higher prices of sand and granite and short term supply uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the industry has adjusted to the market, including the sand and granite prices from alternative sources.&nbsp; There is now greater supply and pricing clarity, and concrete price has fallen to below $175 per cubic metre.&nbsp; I understand that the industry associations, including the Real Estate Developers' Association of<p align=left>Column: 703</p> Singapore (REDAS), the Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL), the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV), and the Ready-mix Concrete Association (RMCA) have come together to examine the cost structure of concrete production, and agreed on some principles on the cost-sharing arrangement for the increased costs of sand and granite for on-going projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are about 10 ready-mix concrete suppliers in the market.&nbsp; I believe there is sufficient competition in the market of concrete.&nbsp; However, the Government has released land for new concrete batching plants and, if necessary, is prepared to release more if there is demand for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure the House that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely, and will look at any specific feedback of cases of unjustified increase in concrete prices.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They have not reached the final conclusion on each of these complaints.&nbsp; But as and when they do, I will make sure that the results of these complaints are released to the relevant parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the land that has been released, I think the intention of the release of more land for batching plants is to increase the <p align=left>Column: 704</p>number of players in the market, not to keep them at the same level or, worse still, to reduce the number of players.&nbsp; So if that is the objective, then I think it would not serve the purpose for us to release such land to the existing players.&nbsp; Having said that, if there are any complaints on profiteering, there are ample opportunities and avenues for the various complainants to bring their cases up, not only to the BCA.&nbsp; I am sure the Competition Commission may want to have a look at it as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;let us look at each of these complaints and see whether they are justified or not and, if they are, then I would like to assure the Member that action will be taken.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SUBSIDISED BEDS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS--><p align=left>Column: 704<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SUBSIDISED BEDS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS:::708-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the supply of acute hospital beds must keep pace with increasing demand, as our resident population expands and ages.&nbsp; We try to match supply and demand, but it is&nbsp;quite a challenge to do so perfectly given the long lead time in putting up new hospitals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current bed situation is tight, particularly in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital as it is the only hospital serving the large population in the north besides its own large catchment area.&nbsp; The over-crowding in Tan Tock Seng Hospital in turn causes spill-over to the other hospitals, especially National University Hospital and Changi General Hospital.&nbsp; There will be relief when the new general hospital in Yishun opens in three years' time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 705</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we are adding new beds to existing hospitals.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this year, we have added 81 beds in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and NUH.&nbsp; All are subsidised beds.&nbsp; Another 67 beds in NUH and Changi General Hospital will be opened in the second half of this year,&nbsp;ie, over the next few months, also in the subsidised wards.&nbsp; We will continue the incremental expansion wherever practical until the new general hospital in Yishun opens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our resident population will continue to expand and age, demand for new hospital beds will continue to rise even after the new general hospital is fully opened with 550 beds around 2012.&nbsp; Our rough projections suggest that we will need 60-100 new beds per year until the population stabilises.&nbsp; A significant proportion of these beds will be in the subsidised wards.&nbsp; We are planning ahead.&nbsp; A new general hospital in the west will be built during the next few years.&nbsp; Otherwise, National University Hospital may become as over-crowded as Tan Tock Seng Hospital is today.&nbsp; Our plan is to keep Alexandra Hospital temporarily for a few years while the new general hospital in the west is being built.&nbsp; The exact timing and location are being studied.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, pending the completion of the two hospitals which the Minister mentioned, how does the Ministry intend to deal with this shortage of total beds, whether the measure the Minister mentioned just now is sufficient to meet the shortage of beds in the subsidised wards?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, the plan is to add in incrementally because patient demand does not increase suddenly to 500 beds in a few years' time.&nbsp; It increased gradually, just as<p align=left>Column: 706</p> population ages gradually every day.&nbsp; So the rough projection of between 60 and 100 new beds per year should be adequate.&nbsp; And I think the plan that we have added this year and next year should be able to meet the demand.&nbsp; But let me make a word of caution here that for public hospitals, as I have explained in this House before, we try to run it on high occupancy because that is the only way to keep costs as low as it is feasible.&nbsp; The easiest thing is to keep on adding beds but demand will simply swell to meet up.&nbsp; By keeping beds a bit tight, it forces the administration to look out for areas of possible wastages, and eliminate them.&nbsp; If I may give a simple example of day surgery -&nbsp;I remember introducing day surgery in public hospitals over 20 years ago when I was running NUH.&nbsp; At that time, it was a new concept and habits had to change.&nbsp; So the take-up was slow.&nbsp; I am quite glad that more than 20 years later, today more surgeries are done as day surgeries than as inpatients.&nbsp; That is a dramatic achievement.&nbsp; But we have probably hit the maximum of what is possible for day surgeries.&nbsp; In recent months, we begin to study what other medical treatments which may not require surgeries but which can be done on an outpatient basis. And each time we push the frontier, if we can save X% of hospitalisation, then we save a lot of costs both for the patient as well as for the society.&nbsp; This is an important effort that we must continue to push on.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, for us in this business of healthcare, our instinct is always to save life and not to do harm.&nbsp; So I do not think doctors would be discharging patients before they are ready to be discharged.&nbsp; A lot of times, the pressure is on where we know we have done all we can for the patients in an acute hospital setting, and the patients can be competently handled in a community hospital or nursing home.&nbsp; That is where the discharge is all about, where we are worried about \"abuse\" - if I may use that word - of expensive acute hospital.&nbsp; When the acute episode is over and we have done what we can, say after surgery and the patient may need a few more days of recovery but can be adequately managed in a community hospital, our preference is to move that patient from a very expensive acute hospital - expensive both to the patient as well as to society at large - to a nursing home or community hospital.&nbsp; But, currently, the pricing sometimes skews the outcome, because they may<p align=left>Column: 708</p> find that SGH is so cheap and the consultants are there, even though they know they could be adequately handled, say, in Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital.&nbsp; But they say, \"Please, can we stay one, two or three more days?\"&nbsp; But each time we allow that, there are patients waiting in the emergency department, new patients with acute medical conditions, who can benefit from the use of that bed.&nbsp; That is the sort of trade-off which we have to do, and we hope patients will continue to be cooperative.&nbsp; But, I think if we price it rightly, they can be more readily cooperative.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CLASS B2 AND C WARDS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS--><p align=left>Column: 708<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CLASS B2 AND C WARDS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS:::710-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The first part of Mdm Cynthia Phua's Question relates to the provision of non-airconditioned Class B1 wards.&nbsp; On that subject, we do receive an occasional request, but when we look at it in proportion to the requirements that most&nbsp;patients going into B1 ask for, then it does not amount to a strong demand.&nbsp; Our feedback has in fact been that many patients opt for B1 wards precisely for<p align=left>Column: 709</p> their air-conditioned comfort.&nbsp; As the request is generally caused by the shortage of Class B2 wards and the beds there, we will focus on adding more B2 beds as a more meaningful solution.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Not everybody is averse to air-conditioning.&nbsp; In fact, we have found out that the majority of people look for&nbsp;air-conditioned comfort as well.&nbsp; In the current setting, those who feel that they might need an extra blanket or so are certainly given one.&nbsp;

Various measures were also announced then.&nbsp; For example, the S Pass quota will be raised from 10% to 15% from 1st June 2007 to give businesses more access to mid-skilled manpower. &nbsp;Certain regulations in the construction and <p align=left>Column: 711</p>process sectors have also&nbsp;been eased to help meet the anticipated manpower needs, given the upcoming big projects.&nbsp;

While the Government does not perform a job-matching service for foreign workers, we recognise that it is important in this era of global competition for talent, that we help companies by promoting Singapore to overseas talent.&nbsp; Our Employment Pass framework facilitates the entry of global talent recruited by companies, and there are no quota restrictions.&nbsp; MOM recently introduced the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) to better attract and retain talented foreign professionals.&nbsp;

With regard specifically to PMETs, we announced recently the introduction of a professional conversion programme and this is targeted at&nbsp;mid-skilled Singaporeans, to train them for specific sectors that we foresee would have a <p align=left>Column: 713</p>rising demand.&nbsp; Through this conversion programme, we will help them to switch careers and&nbsp;equip them with the skills necessary for these new sectors of growth.&nbsp; This is one&nbsp;example, and&nbsp;we will continue to help them.&nbsp;

Among these 450,000 job opportunities that we are going to create, we do not have&nbsp;specific targets, because these are macro numbers.&nbsp; But we do believe that, because most of these jobs will be service-related and in the service sector in Singapore, by and large, the majority will continue to be Singaporeans and, therefore, most of these jobs will be Singaporean-based.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PART IV OF THE EMPLOYMENT ACT--><p align=left>Column: 713<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PART IV OF THE EMPLOYMENT ACT:::714-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Eligibility and levels of retrenchment benefits are also another area of concern to employers.&nbsp; In the spirit of tripartism, MOM will consult with workers, unions and employers to determine which provisions of the Employment Act require a review and what changes would be made.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:POLICE COAST GUARD--><p align=left>Column: 714<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:POLICE COAST GUARD:::716-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is equivalent to about 19,000 tonnes of plastic or 0.8% of the total waste disposed of in Singapore annually. &nbsp;Unlike in most countries where plastic bags remain in landfills for years, plastic bags in Singapore are incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants to recover energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pointed out by Dr Lim, many households re-use plastic bags to bag their refuse.&nbsp; This is a good hygiene practice as it prevents spillage when refuse is collected by our waste collectors.&nbsp; Our refuse is usually wet and, in our warm tropical climate, tends to putrefy rapidly, resulting in smell nuisance.&nbsp; Unbagged refuse also attracts pests.&nbsp; The majority of Singaporeans live in high-rise buildings, so bagging our refuse helps to keep the refuse chutes clean and hygienic.&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry has been advocating the practice of re-using plastic bags to bag household refuse and will continue to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 721<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we will not phase out the use of plastic bags now or in the future.&nbsp; However, Sir, we are concerned with excessive and wasteful use of plastic bags.&nbsp; Thus, the National Environment Agency launched the \"Why waste plastic bags?

The Competition Act aims to promote the efficient functioning of Singapore&rsquo;s markets and strengthen our economy.&nbsp; The Act prohibits activities that unduly prevent, restrict or distort competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Competition Bill was passed in Parliament in October 2004, it was announced that the Act would be implemented in phases.&nbsp; We have followed the plan and made good progress since.&nbsp; Allow me to highlight the key milestones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) was established on 1st January 2005.&nbsp; A year later, on 1st January 2006, the first two key prohibitions of the Competition Act came into effect.&nbsp; They are: section 34&nbsp;- the prohibition against anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices -&nbsp;and section 47&nbsp;- the prohibition against the abuse of dominance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the CCS has received three notifications for decision, seven notifications for guidance and 14 complaints.&nbsp; The majority of the complaints relate to anti-competitive agreements under section 34.&nbsp; They involve practices such as co-operation agreements between competitors, standard contract terms, exclusive contracts, bid-rigging and the bundling of products.&nbsp; The CCS has closed out about half of these cases, while the rest are still under investigation.&nbsp; The CCS has also actively carried out outreach and education programmes to gain public support for and foster understanding of our competition law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and final component of the Competition Act: section 54 - the prohibition against mergers that substantially lessen competition -&nbsp;is the main subject of today&rsquo;s Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 728<p>\r\n<p><I>Overview of the merger regime</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a small and open economy.&nbsp; Some degree of rationalisation and consolidation is inevitable to achieve economies of scale and, in some instances, minimum operating scale.&nbsp; Hence, it is proposed that only mergers that substantially lessen competition and which do not have offsetting efficiencies will infringe the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing for the merger regime, like the other prohibitions, the CCS studied international best practices. &nbsp;The study showed that changes to the proposed merger regime were needed to better align it with international best practices. &nbsp;Industry and lawyers had also provided feedback to the CCS on areas for improvement.&nbsp; As these changes would have a wide-ranging impact on mergers that affect Singapore markets, the CCS conducted a public consultation from October to November last year, on the amendments as well as its proposed guidelines.&nbsp; The feedback gathered was carefully considered and, where appropriate, included into this Bill or the CCS&rsquo; guidelines.&nbsp; I would like to thank all the individuals and professional bodies that had provided useful feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act currently provides for a voluntary merger notification system. This means that merger parties will self-assess if their merger would lead to a substantial lessening of competition.&nbsp; If they are of the view that there could be competition concerns, they can apply to the Commission for a definitive decision.&nbsp; As most mergers are unlikely to raise competition concerns, we will retain the voluntary notification system.&nbsp; A system requiring mandatory notification of mergers would be more onerous on businesses and impose unnecessary costs.&nbsp; The Commission will publish <p align=left>Column: 729<p>guidelines shortly to help businesses assess whether to notify their mergers and outline its procedures and method for assessing mergers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Specific amendments and rationale</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now outline the main amendments in the Bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 8 introduces the key amendments to the merger regime.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Act will be amended to allow merger parties to notify the CCS for a decision on their anticipated mergers that are no longer confidential.&nbsp; The Act currently allows businesses to obtain CCS&rsquo; assessment of a merger only after it has been completed.&nbsp; This is not ideal, because merger parties will face significant costs if they are required to unwind a completed merger found by the CCS to be anti-competitive. &nbsp;Businesses can, however, still decide to opt to notify the Commission after a merger has been completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Removal of provision of confidential guidance by the CCS<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the provisions allowing merger parties to apply to the CCS for confidential guidance on a merger will be removed.&nbsp; Experience in the UK and Australia has shown that such guidance is of minimal value to businesses as the competition authority would not be able to get market feedback or issue a definitive decision, ie, the guidance may be reopened if there are further complaints.&nbsp; The removal of this provision will also streamline the merger notification process.&nbsp; To assist merger parties, the CCS will hold informal, confidential pre-notification discussions with the merger parties on how to file notifications and, where possible, highlight potential areas of concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 730<p>\r\n<p><I>Power to take pre-emptive action</I></p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the Act will be amended to give the CCS power to take pre-emptive action.&nbsp; I had earlier mentioned that the merger parties are expected to self-assess and decide if they should notify a merger to CCS for a decision.&nbsp; Similarly, parties will be allowed, at their own risk, to proceed with an anticipated merger or to further integrate a merger, while a notification or investigation is pending CCS' decision.&nbsp; The amendments will empower CCS to prevent parties from taking actions that would prejudice the consideration of the merger or to impose directions or remedies to address the competitive harm.&nbsp; This is on the basis that the CCS has reasonable grounds to suspect that a merger is anti-competitive.&nbsp; As a matter of urgency, the Commission will also be allowed to take action to prevent serious irreversible damage or protect the public interest, thereby obviating significant costs of unravelling a merger.&nbsp; The CCS already has the power to do so with respect to the sections 34 and 47 prohibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Power to accept and vary commitments</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the CCS will be able to accept commitments.&nbsp; Commitments are undertakings given by merging parties binding them to act in a specific way to address competition concerns arising from a merger.&nbsp; They are given in exchange for clearance of the merger, and are widely used overseas to clear a merger speedily.&nbsp; The use of commitments will save both merger parties and the Commission valuable resources and time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me use an example to illustrate how pre-emptive action and commitments may be used.&nbsp; The UK competition authority recently examined the merger of two waste management companies.&nbsp; In doing so, it sought undertakings from the two companies to, amongst others, not<p align=left>Column: 731<p> further integrate the two companies before a decision was issued.&nbsp; Such interim directions serve to prevent the companies from taking any action that may prejudice the authority's consideration of the merger.&nbsp; Subsequently, when it was assessed that the merger would result in substantial lessening of competition, the UK authority allowed the merger to proceed provided the two companies agreed to undertake specific actions or commitments to address competition concerns, such as the divestment of certain assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Exclusions from the Act</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 24 amends the Fourth Schedule to clarify the types of mergers that are excluded from the Act.&nbsp; These fall into two categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, mergers are excluded if the written law requires them to be approved by a Minister or a regulatory authority.&nbsp; This exclusion, however, does not extend to mergers approved only by the court or by the shareholders of a company, without any sectoral regulatory oversight.&nbsp; The amendment also clarifies that mergers under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, including mergers covered under instruments, such as directives, notices and licensing conditions, are excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, mergers are excluded if the economic efficiencies to Singapore resulting from the merger outweigh any substantial lessening of competition caused by the merger.&nbsp; Such mergers may lead to greater innovation or choice, higher quality&nbsp;and lower costs.&nbsp; They are of overall benefit to Singapore and should be allowed to proceed.&nbsp; Other competition authorities also take a similar approach.&nbsp; For instance, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission allowed the only two glass&nbsp;container manufacturers in Australia to merge in 1991 on grounds of <p align=left>Column: 732<p>public benefit.&nbsp; In arriving at its decision, the Australian authority considered, amongst others, the merger's positive impact, in terms of wider consumer choice, greater economies of scale, and the improved quality and safety of goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also contains ancillary amendments that clarify matters such as the interpretation of control, definitions such as what constitutes a joint venture merger, the powers of the District Court in enforcing directions, and the inter-relationship of the sections 34 and 47 prohibitions vis-a-vis the merger regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Other non-merger related amendments</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Bill introduces amendments that fine-tune the Act and enable the CCS to better carry out its functions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Power to require documents or information that is not in the public domain for market inquiries and notifications</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 empowers the CCS to require documents or information that is not in the public domain for market inquiries and notifications.&nbsp; Currently, industry players or third parties can refuse to provide the CCS with information even if the CCS has reasonable grounds to suspect a market competition distortion or an infringement.&nbsp; This information can play a critical role in helping the Commission to understand the intricacies of market practices and their competitive impact, thereby leading to&nbsp;sounder and more robust decisions.&nbsp; The amendment will allow the CCS to require any person to furnish information and documents when it is assessing notifications for decisions or conducting market inquiries.&nbsp; It may only invoke this power when it has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Act has been infringed, or that competition in a particular market is restricted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 733<p>\r\n<p><I>Ability to prescribe decisions that can be appealed</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 17 gives the Minister the power to prescribe the types of CCS decisions that can be appealed.&nbsp; This power, which currently resides with the CCS, is more appropriately vested in the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Ability to augment resources</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments are also made to enable CCS to deploy temporary external staff to&nbsp;assist in investigations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the amendments will reinforce the ability of CCS to enhance the efficiency of Singapore's markets and strengthen our economic competitiveness.&nbsp; Mergers and&nbsp;acquisitions are part and parcel of business activity environment.&nbsp; The amendments will ensure that they do not harm Singapore's overall competitiveness while maintaining the smooth functioning of the economy.&nbsp; They will also help to better empower the CCS to achieve this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments proposed in this Bill, but I also think that we could have covered more ground in it to establish a firmer competition regime in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I welcome the inclusion of anticipated mergers within the competition regulatory framework.&nbsp; It is also a good timing for this amendment as all around the world, we are seeing waves of mega mergers and, if not regulated, it could result in distortions of the marketplace as some entities attain dominant positions in the market.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 734<p> Although some mega-entities bring with them efficiencies for the consumers, the regulation should however ensure a dominant position is not abused over a period of time, even if it may have been all right at the time of the merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems can arise if an entity only comes under regulatory scrutiny after it has merged, as the Minister has mentioned.&nbsp; If it is found to be anti-competitive under the applicable regulatory regime, then that merged entity may well be forced to break up, or to alter its business in the territory.&nbsp; De-merging is an expensive and complex exercise.&nbsp; Forcing such companies to take corrective action post-merger, when problems could have been foreseen before the merger took place, is economically inefficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I welcome the new section 56 which allows entities that are considering merging to come forward to the regulator and ask for a decision on whether the anticipated merger, if&nbsp;carried into effect,&nbsp;may infringe the section 54 prohibition (which regulates&nbsp;anti-competitive mergers).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note however that the proposed new section 56(3) allows the Minister to provide by regulations that only prescribed types of anticipated mergers may be notified to the Competition Commission.&nbsp; I would think that if a company is in doubt as to whether it will infringe the section 54 prohibition, then it should come forward anyway, regardless of the type of merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore would like to ask what types of anticipated mergers the Minister is being given the power to prescribe as requiring notification.&nbsp; Is it to be by market share, whereby anticipated mergers that lead to the merged entity controlling, say, x% of the market must be notified to the Commission, or is it by sector of the economy, for example, mergers of entities <p align=left>Column: 735<p>within the manufacturing sector or sub-sectors that must be notified?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Minister may be concerned about certain types of mergers, that would not prevent other mergers from possibly being uncompetitive.&nbsp; It would be better to put the onus on the parties considering a merger to come forward and seek a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I notice that there is no time limit proposed for the Commission to revert with its decision.&nbsp; I think that such a time limit should be built in, say, for example, three months, which can, by permission of the Minister, be extended by another one or two months, so that the companies can have certainty within an acceptable period of time.&nbsp; This is important so that companies can plan their business activity as it affects their operations here in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now turn to the decision-making process of whether&nbsp;anticipated mergers and mergers do infringe the section 54 prohibition.&nbsp; The proposed amendments to section 57 deal with anticipated mergers.&nbsp; Section 57(2) sets out that the Commission may make a decision on whether the section 54 prohibition will be infringed by an anticipated merger if it is carried into effect, and that if the prohibition will not be infringed, whether this is because of an exclusion whether by way of section 57(b)(i), an exemption under section 57(3) and section 57(b)(ii) or because of a commitment that has been accepted by the Commission in section 60A or section 57(b)(iii).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for transparency and to allow the public to scrutinise why certain mergers were allowed, it would have been better to require the Commission to explain the reason why a particular proposed merger falls within an exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar argument would apply to the consideration by the Commission of <p align=left>Column: 736<p>mergers under the proposed new section 58.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now comment on the commitments that can be accepted by the Commission.&nbsp; On commitments, section 60A allows the Commission to accept a commitment that would mitigate the substantial lessening of competition or adverse effects that may result from a merger or anticipated merger under scrutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission does not have the power to require commitments.&nbsp; These have to be made on the initiative of the party offering the commitment.&nbsp; But there may be situations where the Commission evaluates a merger or anticipated merger and feels that it would infringe the section 54 prohibition, but this infringement could be mitigated by some&nbsp;minimum safeguards or assurances given by the concerned entities as to how they would behave in the future after they have merged.&nbsp; I can recognise the discomfort with the Commission telling these entities how to do their business or advising them as to the minimum safeguards that they need.&nbsp; However, the Commission should be allowed to highlight areas of concern where safeguards would be needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To that end, the Commission should be given the power to require minimum assurances, which can be re-evaluated or adjusted, say,&nbsp;every 12 months, as part of an ongoing review into a situation where there is some potential form&nbsp;of infringement.&nbsp; At the very least, the Commission could be given the power to request the entities for a proposal of assurances covering certain areas of market conduct by these entitles.&nbsp; This would facilitate the process of consideration of mergers or anticipated mergers by the Commission, and also engage entities in a continuous dialogue if the Commission feels that there is some potential area for infringement, as the business environment changes over a period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 737<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 60B is useful in that once a decision is made to accept a commitment from a party, the Commission must decide that there is an infringement of the section 54 prohibition.&nbsp; This serves as an incentive to comply with the commitments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose however a mezzanine-level decision should be built in, where the Commission can decide that the merger may infringe the section 54 prohibition but that as a commitment has been accepted, the Commission is therefore satisfied that it does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, such a power would be useful in view of the removal of the existing section 60(2)(a), which allowed in the past the Commission to reopen a decision that the merger would not infringe the section 54 prohibition on the basis that the Commission has reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a material change of circumstances since it gave its decision in the past.&nbsp; Removing this power means that the Commission cannot reopen the decision even if new material effects of a merger come into light after the decision has been made,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>as long as the Commission was given proper information by the entities at the time it was deciding and based its decision on the information that was not incomplete, false or materially misleading.&nbsp; As business environment changes, circumstances could change but now this Commission will not be allowed to reopen the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the Commission can re-examine market abuses as and when&nbsp;they occur, even in the case of&nbsp;mergers that are approved.&nbsp; For the Commission to start a new investigation shortly after approval was given to a&nbsp;merger upon application would likely lead to uneasiness among businesses.&nbsp; It would therefore be good if the Commission can&nbsp;give red-flags for certain items where businesses know<p align=left>Column: 738<p> that the Commission will bring ongoing scrutiny as a preventive measure rather than coming back and investigating the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, giving the Commission the&nbsp;power, as part of its decision-making process, would require commitment and also a power to reserve the right to require commitments&nbsp;going forward would go&nbsp;some way&nbsp;to correcting market abuses that could occur in the future, even if they are not foreseeable&nbsp;when the&nbsp;merger is being considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the provision in the proposed amendment of section 85 for commitments to be registered in the District Court as if they were orders of the Court and enforced accordingly is, I think, likely to prove unworkable in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many commitments would have been in the nature of restrictive covenants or commitments to do certain things.&nbsp; To enforce these would be in the nature of enforcing specific performance.&nbsp; I am given to understand from some of my lawyer friends that&nbsp;where damages are adequate remedy, specific performance is usually not ordered by the Court.&nbsp; This is because&nbsp;of the public policy of not forcing parties to do things that they have decided that they did not want to do.&nbsp; It may be better instead therefore to punish a breach of commitment with a fine whose amount can be&nbsp;tailored to ensure that there is no incentive of non-adherence to the commitment.&nbsp; I therefore request that the Minister reconsider this provision as it will be difficult to enforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on stripping of immunity, section 59(5) and (6) (in the case of anticipated measures) and section 60(5) and (6) (in the case of&nbsp;mergers) provide for stripping of the immunity given by a decision that&nbsp;no infringement will or has occurred by the anticipated merger or&nbsp;merger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that is required once&nbsp;the decision has been made&nbsp;to strip the immunity is <p align=left>Column: 739<p>that the notice is given to the affected party that the immunity is to be stripped.&nbsp; The notice can even&nbsp;under subsection 6 provide that the immunity be stripped retrospectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is no provision in allowing the affected party to make representations before this is done and it is very onerous for the companies then.&nbsp; We should build in this provision in fairness to entities that may have gone to significant cost and taken much effort to merge.&nbsp; There is also no reason why a power to require further commitment cannot be applied in this case to mitigate the breaches of the section 54 prohibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some other areas of concern, first of all,&nbsp;on stay.&nbsp; &nbsp;Provision should be made allowing parties affected&nbsp;and appealing against decisions of the Commission to apply to the Board or to the High Court or District Court for an interim order allowing a stay of&nbsp;execution of the decision in appropriate cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of the likely complexity of the competition law matters, I would suggest that&nbsp;the appointment&nbsp;of a specialist judge&nbsp;at the Subordinate Courts or perhaps even&nbsp;at the High Court be considered to hear competition-related matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, I note that we have decided again not to bring the telecommunications sector within the fold of the general Competition Act framework.&nbsp; It is still regulated by the Code of Practice for Competition in the Provision of Telecommunications Services and therefore excluded from the Competition Act.&nbsp; My concern is that we would develop two separate bodies of law and regulations for these sectors in time to come.&nbsp; It may be better to consider integrating these bodies of regulations now when it is still early enough as the competition law is still in its infancy in Singapore.&nbsp; It may be harder to integrate<p align=left>Column: 740<p> these later.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; the telecommunications sector is quite open right now, and I see no reason why we still want to regulate it separately from the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the whole, I think that&nbsp;the Bill is well thought out.&nbsp; I do however believe that it can be further improved as suggested in my speech.&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, I support the amendments in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has grown and prospered as an open economy and we continue to do so&nbsp;in a world economy that encourages free and open trade.&nbsp; As a member of the WTO and as a signatory of several Free Trade Agreements, we also embrace the ideal of open competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing for this new era of open and free global trade, we have deregulated and liberalised a number of economic sectors, including banking, telecommunications and others.&nbsp; Singapore companies must anticipate the entry of new, and perhaps bigger and stronger, foreign entities as their competitors.&nbsp; They will have to design and develop new competitive strategies to continue growing and compete effectively in the new economic landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One such response may be to enter into corporate mergers and acquisitions, either with local or even with new foreign partners.&nbsp; The Government must be proactive to these changes.&nbsp; We must strengthen our laws to ensure that such corporate mergers, acquisitions and other forms of partnerships do not create monopolistic entities that are detrimental to Singapore's open, competitive and pro-business environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, our open, pro-business environment has become our differentiator and competitive advantage, and we must ensure nothing blunts this edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 741<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do have a few questions to raise for clarification on this Bill.&nbsp; First, may I know the rationale for replacing the criterion for a joint venture to be considered a merger, from its function on an \"indefinite basis\" to one that functions on a \"lasting basis\"?&nbsp; How does the law differentiate between \"indefinite basis\" and \"lasting basis\"?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in the matter of the Fourth Schedule,&nbsp;paragraph 2: \"The section 54 prohibition shall not apply to any merger if the economic efficiencies arising or that may arise outweigh the adverse effects due to the substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market in Singapore.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this argument can be potentially contentious.&nbsp; It is not unusual for business dealings, including mergers, to be packaged with&nbsp;the most noble objectives.&nbsp; The road to heaven, they say, is paved with good intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, mergers which initially demonstrate great economic efficiencies may not be able to sustain them in the dynamics of the business world, where change is the only constant.&nbsp; Even merged entities themselves undergo transformations and further mergers.&nbsp; Many are overtaken by new technology, new competitors, new business processes as to themselves become uncompetitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know the circumstances under which such \"dispensations\" are given, and what safeguards there are for the&nbsp;section 54 prohibitions to apply if the economic efficiencies from these mergers are themselves&nbsp;outweighed by the adverse effects on the competitive climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, if these mergers prove later to be uncompetitive, can the section 54 or other prohibitions apply?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 742<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with these concerns, I rise to support the passing of the Competition Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I would like to thank the Members of this House who have spoken and given their support for the Amendment Bill.&nbsp; Let me address the points they have raised.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked why the criterion for a joint venture merger is being changed from an<br>\r\n \"indefinite basis\" to a \"lasting basis\".&nbsp; Under the current definition, joint ventures with long but definite periods, for example,&nbsp;10 years, may not be regarded as mergers of indefinite basis even if&nbsp;they result in a lasting change in the merger parties' structure and eliminate competition between them.&nbsp; This is undesirable as the impact of such joint ventures on competition will be similar to that of a merger.&nbsp; The new definition will subject them to the merger regime.&nbsp; The term \"lasting basis\" is also used by the European Union.&nbsp; What constitutes a lasting basis will depend on the facts.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;the US competition authorities use&nbsp;10 years as a benchmark although the duration will vary according to industries' specific circumstances, such as technology life-cycles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh sought clarification on the types of anticipated mergers&nbsp;that merger parties may be&nbsp;required to notify.&nbsp; Sir, the purpose of section 56(3) is to allow the Minister to specify the anticipated mergers can only be notified after they are no longer confidential.&nbsp; This is to allow the CCS to consult and seek views from other market players, stakeholders and competition so that a well-informed and robust decision can be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must point out that there is no requirement for mergers or anticipated<p align=left>Column: 743<p> mergers to be notified to the CCS as notification is voluntary under our merger regime.&nbsp; Basically, merger parties with some concerns can choose to notify the CCS of the merger.&nbsp; The Act facilitates this process.&nbsp; Of course, parties can also choose to notify the CCS after the merger is effected or not at all.&nbsp; It is entirely their own choice and they should make their own commercial assessment.&nbsp; The CCS will soon publish guidelines to help merger parties assess whether their&nbsp;mergers are likely to infringe the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out that the CCS does not have the power to require commitments and suggested that it should at least have the power to require assurances or to vary commitments.&nbsp; While Mr Singh is right that the CCS does not have the power to require commitments, I should point out that the CCS can invite the merger parties to propose suitable commitments to address competition concerns.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members of this House that only after CCS has been satisfied with the proposed commitments that it would allow the merger parties&nbsp;to proceed with the merger.&nbsp; If there is a need to, commitments can be varied and substituted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether it is workable to register commitments in court to enable them to be enforced as order of courts.&nbsp; He suggested that it might be better to punish a breach of a commitment with a fine whose amount can be tailored to ensure&nbsp;disgorgement of the benefit by non-adherence to the commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may not be a good idea, as a breach of commitment is not a criminal offence.&nbsp; It might be more appropriate to treat commitments similar to directions issued by the CCS,&nbsp;ie, by registering them in court, and failure to comply with them will constitute contempt of court which is punishable by normal court sanctions, including fines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 744<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture,&nbsp;I should also mention that I will be moving a Notice of Amendment shortly after this.&nbsp; The Notice will address typographical errors in the Bill and will clarify Mr Inderjit Singh's query on allowing a merger to proceed where the Commission accepts a commitment that will address competition concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked how net economic efficiencies will be treated in the merger regime and whether there are any safeguards if the efficiencies cannot be sustained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as a general policy, it may be unfair to require merger parties to unwind a merger cleared by the CCS if it is subsequently found to be anti-competitive due to unforeseen changes in its operating environment.&nbsp; The CCS may only re-visit its decision if, among other reasons, the information on which it based its decision was materially incomplete, false or misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members that a merger must meet a set of strict conditions before it can qualify for the net economic efficiencies exclusion.&nbsp; The merger parties must show verifiable evidence of the benefits that are likely to materialise within a reasonable period of time as a direct consequence of the merger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the efficiencies must be sufficient to outweigh any competitive&nbsp;harm caused by the merger.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;the benefits, such as lower cost, greater innovation&nbsp;or choice, or higher quality products, must flow to the markets in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mergers that only create profits for themselves alone will not qualify for the efficiency argument.&nbsp; To ensure that the merger entity does not engage in anti-competitive behaviour, the other provisions under the Competition Act, ie,&nbsp;the provision against anti-competitive<p align=left>Column: 745<p> agreements and the abuse of dorminant position, will still apply to it even after it has been cleared on grounds of efficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now move on to address the procedural aspects of the merger regime raised by Mr Inderjit Singh.&nbsp; Before I do so, I should mention that the procedures have been designed to provide as much certainty and transparency to businesses while balancing the need for fairness and flexibility.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that limits be set for the Commission to revert&nbsp;its decision on anticipated mergers.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; The CCS adopts a two-phase approach in assessing notified mergers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mergers that clearly do not pose competition concerns will be cleared within phase one which is expected to last no more than 30 working days, and only mergers that can potentially pose competition concerns will undergo a more in-depth phase-two assessment which is expected to last no more than 120 working days. These indicative timeframes are comparable to the international best standards and the CCS will publish the time norms and other procedural details in its guidelines to be issued shortly&nbsp;when the Bill has been passed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The CCS will also be fair and transparent in its processes. Where it is practical to do so, it will publish reasons for its decisions, including why a merger falls within an exclusion from the Act.&nbsp; If it intends to remove the immunity conferred by a favourable decision, the CCS will consult the relevant parties and give them opportunity to make representations. Again, this will be included in CCS' guidelines to be published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that CCS should, upon approving the merger, make the merger parties aware that&nbsp;the <p align=left>Column: 746<p>Commission will continue to scrutinise the merger parties' business practices. Sir, we agree.&nbsp; The CCS will identify competition concerns during the assessment of the merger and communicate with the parties concerned.&nbsp; The Commission can examine market abuses as and when they occur even in the case of mergers that have been approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now touch on the sectoral exclusions from the Competition Act.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we should consider integrating the regulatory framework in the telecommunications sector within the fold and framework of the generic Competition Act.&nbsp; This indeed is our longer term goal.&nbsp; When the Competition Act was enacted in 2004, the number of sectoral authorities and respective regulatory frameworks had already been established.&nbsp; To acknowledge their continued operations, the Competition Act has provided exclusions from sections 34 and 47 in the Third Schedule and exclusions from section 54 are given in the Fourth Schedule of the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government then explained that the sectoral regulators, such as the Info-Comm Development Authority, will continue to have oversight of their respective sectors.&nbsp; This is because these regulators are in a better position to handle competition issues in their sectors.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Government remains committed to the goal of alignment and coordination of the various competition regimes.&nbsp; An inter-agency committee has been operating since 2005 to coordinate the application of competition law at the different sectors in Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry had also earlier indicated that it will review&nbsp; sectoral exclusions under the Competition Act three years after the Act has been enforced, ie, in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I will touch on the queries relating to how the Competition Act is <p align=left>Column: 747<p>generally enforced.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh expressed concerns that the CCS' powers of investigations are rather extensive and that taking documents during the investigation may be disruptive to business activities.&nbsp; I would like to assure the Member that the appropriate safeguards have been built into the Act.&nbsp; For example, the CCS must have reasonable ground to suspect an infringement before it can invoke its powers to require information or documents. The CCS also is mindful of the need to minimise unnecessary inconveniences to businesses when it conducts its investigations.&nbsp; As such, it will generally take copies of documents and will leave the originals with the business owners and, if the originals are taken, the parties will be allowed to make copies for their use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh also raised concerns about procedural fairness with regard to the appeal process and legal privilege.&nbsp; I should clarify that the Competition Appeal Board can order the suspension of a CCS decision while reviewing an appeal. As for legal privilege, the Act clearly states that the power to require disclosure does not extend to communication between a lawyer and its client.&nbsp; Although the CCS has the power to require the name and address of the client, this is only to allow the CCS to ascertain that the communication was indeed privileged and to ascertain if the client wishes to waive legal privilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his suggestion to appoint a specialist judge at the Subordinate Courts or even perhaps at the High Court to hear competition-related matters, this is something that is&nbsp;best left to the courts to decide.&nbsp; I should mention, however, that appeals against CCS' decisions are heard in the first instance by the Competition Appeal Board, which is a panel of persons appointed by MTI for their expertise and experience in competition-related matters.&nbsp; The Board is made up of lawyers,<p align=left>Column: 748<p> including a few senior counsel and former High Court judges, economists, accountants and representatives from the banking and business sectors. The Chairman of the Board is&nbsp;Mr Thean Lip Ping, who was previously a Judge of Appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;- [Mr Lee Yi Shyan].<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Clauses</I> <I>1</I> to&nbsp;<I>7</I> inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clause&nbsp;8</I> &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lee&nbsp;Yi Shyan</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp; In page 15, line 15, after \"will\", to insert \"not\"; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; In page 15, line 28, after \"has\", to insert \"not\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 8 proposes for a non-infringement decision to be made upon the acceptance of commitment.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Objective</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in March 2000, my Ministry announced that the gas industry would be restructured, similar to the electricity industry, by separating the contestable sectors of the gas industry from the ownership of the gas transportation business.&nbsp; To facilitate the liberalisation of the gas industry, my Ministry decided that the gas distribution and transmission network will be owned by a gas grid company which will allow all players open and non-discriminatory access to the entire gas pipeline network.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the Gas Act was passed by this House in March 2001,&nbsp; providing a legal framework for the governance of the gas market in support of a liberalised electricity market.&nbsp; It establishes a competitive architecture for the gas market, and a regulatory regime to ensure the security and reliability of the supply of gas to industry and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the question has been asked:&nbsp; why is it important to have an open access regime in our gas market?&nbsp; Let me <p align=left>Column: 750<p>elaborate.&nbsp; Natural gas is a key source of fuel for our power generation.&nbsp; About four-fifths of our electricity is fuelled by natural gas.&nbsp; Today, we import piped natural gas from our immediate neighbours.&nbsp; In future, we will also import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from other parts of the world.&nbsp; We must, therefore, ensure fair competition in our gas market, by allowing all players to have open and non-discriminatory access to the entire gas pipeline network and other relevant gas infrastructure in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A competitive gas market will further enhance competition in the electricity market.&nbsp; Sir, we have already seen the benefits of competition since we liberalised, in stages, our electricity generation and retail market from 2001.&nbsp; Greater competition in the electricity market has led to downward pressure on price, and has helped to cushion the impact of high oil prices on our electricity tariffs.&nbsp; For example, although fuel oil prices have increased by 71% over the six years from April 2001 to April 2007, our household electricity tariffs have decreased by 5% over the same period.&nbsp; This is despite the fact that fuel accounts for about 70% of the total cost of electricity generation.&nbsp; This is why it is crucial that we put in place an open access regime to support a competitive market for gas which is a key input for our electricity market.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry is proposing to amend the Gas Act to improve its effectiveness in relation to the open access policy.&nbsp; It also wants to cater to the changes in the structure of the gas market since 2001, and to enhance the safeguards for our critical gas infrastructure and our gas supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reviewing the Gas Act, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) has sought feedback from the public and industry players through two rounds of public consultation&nbsp;- first in February<p align=left>Column: 751<p> 2006, and later from December 2006 to January 2007.&nbsp; Let me now outline the key amendments to the Gas Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Ensuring market access</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first set of amendments covers issues relating to the policy of open access to gas infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, section 38 of the Gas Act empowers EMA to direct the owner of gas infrastructure, such as a gas pipeline network, to grant access to a new entrant.&nbsp; Clause 16 of the Bill extends section 38 to Onshore Receiving Facilities (ORFs).&nbsp; To enhance the effectiveness of the existing provisions on open access, clause 16 of the Bill also enables EMA to direct an owner of gas infrastructure to grant an applicant access to the infrastructure, even if the direction may prejudice the performance of any contractual obligation of the owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed amendment, it will be an offence if the directed party does not comply with EMA&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; It will also be an offence for anyone to do anything, such as threatening to institute or, in fact,&nbsp;instituting legal proceedings, which has or is likely to have the effect of obstructing, hindering or preventing the directed party from complying with EMA&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These provisions are necessary given the substantial public interest at stake.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to assure the House that EMA will be judicious in the exercise of its authority and it will give all affected parties the opportunity to be heard before issuing such directions on open access.&nbsp; More importantly, EMA&rsquo;s preferred modality is for the relevant parties to come together and arrive at an agreement on their own.&nbsp; If the concerned parties cannot reach an agreement, and access to the gas infrastructure is, in fact,&nbsp;blocked, then EMA is prepared to<p align=left>Column: 752<p> intervene to ensure that the larger public interest is served by allowing open access to our gas network.&nbsp; Indeed, EMA would welcome, and facilitate, efforts by the parties concerned to come together and negotiate a deal to enable the gas to flow through the pipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Act will also be amended to grant immunity to the directed party from legal proceedings in relation to any breach of an existing contract, if the breach is solely attributable to, or caused by, its compliance with EMA&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; This is to protect the directed party in the event that EMA&rsquo;s direction on open access places the directed party in conflict with its existing contractual obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that the immunity is confined to existing contracts.&nbsp; A directed party will not enjoy any immunity in relation to a contract which is made after clause 16 comes into force, as the party is expected to enter into contracts that comply with the open access regime.&nbsp; Immunity is also not conferred on any party other than a directed party.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle underlying the immunity provision, and indeed other provisions, in the Gas Bill,&nbsp;is to ensure that existing commercial considerations amongst the industry players would not have the effect of frustrating the public policy intent of having open access to our gas infrastructure.&nbsp; My Ministry believes that these amendments will send a clear signal to the industry of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to its policy of promoting competition in our gas and electricity markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an open access regime, multiple parties using a gas pipeline will also require an arrangement for the allocation of gas in that pipeline.&nbsp; Gas allocation in an onshore pipeline will be dealt with under the Gas Network Code.&nbsp; In the case of an offshore pipeline, it is common practice in many countries that such<p align=left>Column: 753<p> allocation is arranged on a commercial basis between the parties who use the gas infrastructure.&nbsp; Moving forward, as we implement the open access policy, EMA will also encourage the industry players to negotiate and arrive at an allocation agreement on a commercial basis.&nbsp; However, if a commercial agreement cannot be achieved, new users of the pipeline would be denied access to the pipeline.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent such a situation which will hinder competition in our gas market, clause 17 of the Bill will enable EMA to direct new entrants and existing users of an offshore pipeline to enter into a gas allocation arrangement.&nbsp; Similar to clause 16, clause 17 confers immunity from legal proceedings on directed parties in relation to contracts which are made before clause 17 comes into force. &nbsp;EMA will not invoke this power if the parties can negotiate an allocation arrangement amongst themselves.&nbsp; If the directed parties are able to subsequently arrive at an arrangement amongst themselves, the provision in the Act allows for the new arrangement to supercede EMA&rsquo;s direction.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For effective open access, we also need rules to ensure that gas shippers have untrammelled access to our onshore gas pipeline network.&nbsp; Consequently, clause 25 of the Bill empowers EMA to issue a Gas Network Code on the use and operation of an onshore gas pipeline network.&nbsp; The Code is adapted from the UK Gas Network Code and EMA has consulted extensively with the industry to ensure its robustness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Regulating market structure</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now cover the amendments relating to the regulation of the gas market structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 754<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cater to the changes in the structure of the gas industry since the Gas Act was passed by this House in March 2001, clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill expand the list of licensable activities to include the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;Firstly, the import of natural gas, whether in gaseous or liquefied form. This will enhance the security of gas supply to Singapore;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;Secondly, the management or operation of the LNG terminals and&nbsp; Onshore Receiving Facilities.&nbsp; This will enable EMA to have adequate regulatory oversight to ensure the safety and reliability of such infrastructure which are critical to our gas supply, and, consequently, to our electricity supply; and&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Thirdly, the shipping of natural gas.&nbsp; This will give EMA regulatory oversight of gas shippers to ensure that they abide by the gas transportation rules for reliable and secure operation of the gas pipeline network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Safeguarding Critical Infrastructure</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Security safeguards</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now cover the amendments which are intended to safeguard our critical gas infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 33 of the Gas Act currently empowers the Minister to issue a Special Administration Order against a gas transporter in specific situations where the security or reliability of gas supply is at risk.&nbsp; Clause 15 of the Bill extends the ambit of the Special Administration Order to include the LNG terminal operator.&nbsp; A Special Administration Order could be imposed if it is found that the security and reliability of the gas network or LNG terminal is or is likely to be compromised.&nbsp; When a Special Administration Order is in force, the affairs, business and property<p align=left>Column: 755<p> of the respective operator will be managed directly or indirectly by EMA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gas pipeline network is the only means by which gas is transported to key end users, like the power generation companies and pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; Any failure of the gas pipeline network, therefore, will have an adverse impact on our economy.&nbsp; To safeguard the gas pipeline network, clause 25 of the Bill introduces a new Part VIIB to the Gas Act under which EMA will be able to monitor and control changes in shareholdings or other such interests in gas licensees and other entities involved in the gas pipeline network business.&nbsp; The provisions also cover passive increases in the shareholdings or other interests.&nbsp; In addition, any business relating to a gas pipeline network cannot be acquired without the approval of EMA.&nbsp; These entities will also be required to obtain EMA&rsquo;s approval for the appointment of persons to key management positions.&nbsp; These provisions in their totality are intended to ensure effective regulatory oversight and control of the gas pipeline network which is a critical part of our national infrastructure.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Prevention of damages to gas pipes</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, turning to the provisions on the prevention of damage to our gas pipes and gas plants, such damage can have catastrophic consequences to human lives, property and our economy.&nbsp; Clause 14 of the Bill strengthens the protection of the gas pipes and gas plants by specifying the precautions to be taken before and during excavation works by persons involved in the works, providing for additional offences when damage is caused and increasing the penalties for existing offences.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhanced penalties</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments have also been proposed to strengthen the penalty framework in<p align=left>Column: 756<p> the Gas Act for effective regulation of the gas industry.&nbsp; Penalties have been introduced for the new provisions in the Bill.&nbsp; Existing penalties in relation to offences such as carrying out licensable activities without a licence, and causing damage to gas pipes, have been increased to reflect the severity of such offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Appeal process</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;now,&nbsp;on the appeal process.&nbsp; EMA has received industry feedback on the potential impact on businesses if a stay on EMA&rsquo;s decisions were not provided for.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, clauses 28 and 31 of the Bill provide for the Minister, at his discretion, to stay a decision or direction of EMA when it is the subject of an appeal.&nbsp; In exercising his discretion to do so, the Minister will take into consideration the implications for the open access policy, and the security and reliability of gas supply and gas infrastructure.&nbsp; In addition, there will be an automatic stay against EMA&rsquo;s decision or direction if the appeal is against the imposition of a financial penalty or its quantum.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There may also be situations where an appeal relates to matters which require certain technical or specialised knowledge.&nbsp; Hence, clause 31 of the Bill enables the Minister to establish an Appeal Panel to hear such an appeal.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Secondly, the amendments will enable EMA to implement more effectively the open access policy which is an essential aspect to the liberalisation of our gas market.&nbsp; This, in turn, will enable all consumers of electricity, households and enterprises alike, to benefit from&nbsp;

Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments proposed in the Gas (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; In fact, it has taken too long for the Gas Bill to be correctly structured.&nbsp; Since 2001, the Gas Act has not been able to effectively allow market competition as originally intended.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the weakness in the Gas Act has kept out new entrants into our energy market.&nbsp; I read from press reports that Island Power which is building a new power plant on Jurong Island has seen a two-year delay in their $1 billion project.&nbsp; If we have been successful, we would have seen the mergence of a new private sector energy company and I believe the consumers would have been the main beneficiaries of the new player, resulting in cheaper electricity charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main obstacle to the proper functioning of the Gas Act has been the control and access of the gas pipeline network.&nbsp; It is quite amazing that because of the protective behaviour of some incumbent players, the Government has not been able to make the Gas Act work the way it was intended to, which leads me to ask if the new changes will indeed result in changes which will effectively allow new players to utilise the gas pipeline as intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 amends section 38 of the&nbsp;Act and clause 17 of the Bill adds the new sections 38 and 39 to allow the Energy Market Authority or EMA to direct the parties to enter into an agreement for the allocation of gas in offshore pipelines.&nbsp; This is a good move.&nbsp; But how effective will EMA be this time when in the past, it failed to effectively help resolve the issues when after two years, PowerGas could not sort out the gas transport agreement <p align=left>Column: 758<p>with the incumbent user?&nbsp; I hope that, this time, EMA will be able to exercise its authority to speed up the open access of the gas pipeline network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the inclusion of the Gas Network Code or GNC as per clause 25 of the Bill, by adding the new Part VII, sections 61A to 61F.&nbsp; Section 61D makes the GNC a binding contract between the designated transporter and each gas shipper.&nbsp; Then section 61E spells out the limitations of the GNC which effectively says some parties can still delay the open access of the gas pipeline network.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is: will this allow the current issue that PowerGas is facing with the incumbent to be further prolonged and hence making the GNC not immediately implementable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have the same issue with clauses 33 to 35 of the Bill on what it intends to do.&nbsp; While I understand that this provision is for the transition period, and for the Minister to help manage the transfer, the flexibility given could also mean that EMA may not be able to effectively direct the free access of the pipelines as desired, if the appeal process takes too long to complete.&nbsp; This could also be a loophole used to further delay the process of free access.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister will give a time limit for such a process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am in full support of the spirit of what is being proposed in the Bill but, as I have spelt out, my worry is in the implementation.&nbsp; I hope that the EMA will be able to effectively implement the Gas Act and allow more competition into our energy market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For example, according to the <I>Business Times'</I> report on 10th May, this Bill, and I quote, \"should help new players like Island Power, whose S$1 billion power station project here has been delayed for years because of its inability to access the pipeline, to bring its own Indonesia natural gas for its project\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Dow Jones Newswires</I> went so far as to say, and I quote,&nbsp;\"a piped gas deal between Island Power and US-based ConocoPhillips hinges on the passing of an amendment by the Singapore Parliament, which will also pave the way for the construction of a state-of-the-art gas-fired power plant\". It even said that this Gas (Amendment) Bill is the last remaining major milestone before Island Power can gain access to the Sumatra-Singapore gas pipeline. There are also reports that mentioned of a June deadline for Island Power from the Indonesian authorities on the supply of gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of all these news reports,&nbsp;would the Minister clarify on this perception that this Amendment Bill is tailor-made to pave the way for the entry of Island Power, as reported by the media?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the Government's resolve&nbsp;to further restructure the gas market and to enhance the security of Singapore's energy supply. And I support the Government's decision to separate the ownership of gas transportation business, which is a natural monopoly, from the contestable segment. PowerGas, which will be the eventual owner of Singapore's<p align=left>Column: 760<p> gas infrastructure, will be regulated by EMA, in terms of price and, among others, shareholding control, as stated in clause 25. This shareholding controls is particularly important as EMA will be empowered to reject potential ownership transfer of critical gas infrastructure that is assessed to be detrimental to national security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the new structure to work, all competitive players, existing or new, need to have open access to the common gas grid on a non-discriminatory basis. These amendments would widen the powers of EMA significantly, giving the Authority the teeth to push through these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I support the intent of this amendment, I would also want to raise a few related points as well:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, on the supply and demand imbalance. Our generation capacity has grown steadily and&nbsp;I understand that the current excess capacity is way above the optimal 30% reserve capacity. With this amendment removing the impairment to open access,&nbsp;one more player would enter the market. &nbsp;Island Power is not covered under the moratorium to control piped natural gas coming to Singapore and hence would mean adding new capacity when they start operations.&nbsp; Even with this eventuality, how would the supply and demand imbalance situation be like from now to, say, 2012 when the new LNG gas starts kicking in? The LNG terminal is expected to be ready by 2012. How would the capacity versus the projected demand situation be like beyond 2012 as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have another situation.&nbsp; On the one hand, we want new player to enter the market to intensify the competition, but, on the other hand, there are currently still about 25% of the demand, mainly from the household consumers, that are not subjected to<p align=left>Column: 761<p> competition. Have we been consistent in this area?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More competition as a result of more players is of course good, especially to the end consumers. There are currently about five to&nbsp;six power generation companies (Gencos) in Singapore, supplying power in the contestable and non-contestable segment of the market. While we want even higher intensity of competition, EMA has to be mindful that competition remains healthy and sustainable, given our relatively small market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power generation business is capital intensive,&nbsp;with high sunken costs and&nbsp;very little product differentiation.&nbsp; So, these&nbsp;five to six&nbsp;players compete mainly on prices in the contestable segment.&nbsp; Besides the competition, the gencos also take on the fuel price volatility and volume risk. If the gencos are too caught up in the competition for short-term market share, we may see gencos being less willing to invest in long-term efficiency. This would not be in the long-term interest of consumers. Like any sectors, our energy industry needs to yield a reasonable return so as to continue to attract long-term capital and investments to sustain our future capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is on&nbsp; the legacy issues that have arisen because of the access. This amendment gives &nbsp;EMA wide powers to manage the market. For example, in section 38(4), EMA is given the powers to dictate to the facility owner how to charge existing users of the facility. The amendment also enables EMA to direct parties to enter into an agreement for the allocation of gas in offshore pipelines on terms specified by EMA. When the Authority issues a direction to the owner of a gas infrastructure to provide open access, the directed party will be provided immunity against any legal action, or in <p align=left>Column: 762<p>relation to any breach of an existing contract as a result of complying with EMA's direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am all for open access and for it to be expedited and for EMA to be given the additional powers to rectify some of the legacy problems as it restructures the market. However, existing contractual interests with the incumbent players which were entered into on <I>bona fide</I> commercial basis earlier should not be completely disregarded. Singapore prides itself as a hub of excellence in many fields. Our reputation as a jurisdiction where long-term business commercial agreements will be honoured and the sanctity of contracts will be upheld, should be safeguarded. Businesses and industries look to this certainty and confidence to plan and make long-term investments. EMA should seek to settle these legacy issues amicably with the existing stakeholders and should only use or exercise the new powers as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is on the liquefied natural gas (LNG).&nbsp;The decision to import LNG by 2012 as another alternative source of gas import is a reassuring one. Given our recent problems with the import of sand and granite&nbsp;as well as the piped gas dispute we saw between Russia and Ukraine, it makes very good sense to open up another source of gas supply via the LNG. By its nature, LNG imports are less captive than the piped natural gas (PNG) and therefore are also more price flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the PNG contracts with our neighbouring countries will end somewhere around&nbsp;2022, what would be the Ministry's strategies ahead to secure long-term energy supply for Singapore?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are LNG imports the way to go to strengthen our energy resilience?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economics of importing gas currently still favours the piped natural<p align=left>Column: 763<p> gas. Hence, the Government has imposed import controls on PNG so as to build up demand for LNG to a sufficient base load for the&nbsp;terminal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond this import moratorium, we should also consider other ways to reduce the investment risks of LNG terminals, including possible tax breaks and even a possible reserve off-take from the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point on this Bill:&nbsp; with this amendment and in the light of this restructuring in the gas markets as well as&nbsp;the entry of new player, is the divestment of gencos&nbsp;that was talked about some time ago still on the cards?&nbsp; How have all these developments impacted the financial ratings and valuations of these incumbent gencos?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

support for the Bill.&nbsp; They have raised a variety of issues on various aspects of the Bill and the industry.&nbsp; Let me attempt to try and categorise them in a way that makes for a bit more cogent response.&nbsp; One set of questions pertains to the whole issue of the Gas Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh opines that the Gas Act has taken a long time to reach an effective structure.&nbsp; Both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Liang have raised the point about the Island Power Company (IPC).&nbsp; In fact, Mr Liang is quite pointed about whether this&nbsp;amendment is in response specifically to Island Power's problems.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think it is important to clarify at the outset the fundamental intent of this amendment in this Bill.&nbsp; The policy of wanting to establish an open competitive gas market was articulated, in fact, in the year 2000 and subsequently when the <p align=left>Column: 764<p>Gas Act was passed in this House in the year 2001.&nbsp; So that policy intent has been very clear.&nbsp; However, in managing and overseeing such a market, there have been significant changes, including the possibility of LNG and the implications of that, and for our regulator, EMA, it has also been an experience in learning how to manage the dynamics of a competitive electricity market and, by implication, in a competitive gas market.&nbsp; So there has been a very deliberate process to assess what needs to be done in the market by way of regulations to govern it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment here covers various aspects and, in particular, there are three elements.&nbsp; The first governs security and reliability of our gas supply.&nbsp; This is important to ensure the critical aspect of our national infrastructure remains viable.&nbsp; The second element is the part on open access.&nbsp; This is critical to the competitive nature of our gas market, and this is part of the discussion that Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Liang are alluding to.&nbsp; But we also want to make sure that our gas market remains relevant.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments are in response to the developments in the market and in the industry.&nbsp; EMA has studied the trends and has proposed various ways of opening and further developing the gas market in Singapore, and the amendments here are in response to that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to stress once again that it is a response to the market, to the developments in the industry and part of an over-arching objective which was stated six years ago, not a response to any specific transaction or commercial issue that happens to be in the market at this point in time.&nbsp; Having said that, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Liang have both raised the IPC case and I think it is worth talking a little bit about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Liang have quite different perspectives on the matter.&nbsp; Mr Singh is urging that EMA <p align=left>Column: 765<p>should in fact be willing to exert its authority quickly in order to allow new entrants to come into the market.&nbsp; Mr Liang, on the other hand, is concerned about the reputation as a jurisdiction where long-term business commercial agreements would be honoured and the sanctity of contracts would be upheld.&nbsp; So he suggested that EMA should seek all avenues to allow for an amicable resolution of matters amongst the players before EMA resorts to its legislative powers as a last resort.&nbsp; Both perspectives are correct, and it is quite helpful because the path that EMA wishes to take is a middle one.&nbsp; What I mean by that quite simply is that EMA's preferred modality is in fact to bring about a market-based commercial resolution of these issues.&nbsp; Indeed, it is in the interest of all the industry players to come together, given this policy intent, to say what makes sense commercially for us to arrive at a settlement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA is prepared to even play the role of a facilitator to bring the parties to the table in order to have a productive discussion of this nature.&nbsp; However, when a commercial arrangement cannot be arrived at, then EMA has an obligation, especially when, as a result of the lack of agreement, access to the gas infrastructure is blocked, then EMA is prepared to intervene because the public interest far outweighs any private considerations.&nbsp; Therefore, this Bill empowers EMA to act in that manner for the benefit of the larger good in Singapore.&nbsp; So I want to assure Mr Inderjit Singh that we have, with this amendment, all the wherewithal for EMA to act in the best interest.&nbsp; But, at the same time, I want to assure Mr Liang that this is not an excuse to ride roughshod over private contractual interest.&nbsp; It is to ensure that, <I>in extremis</I>, when these efforts have failed to find an amicable resolution, then the Act, and the powers <p align=left>Column: 766<p>through it that are given to EMA, will be exercised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has raised some concerns over the limitations in the gas network code that may allow parties to delay a process.&nbsp; He refers, I think,&nbsp;to the provision&nbsp;in section 61E about arbitration, and so on.&nbsp; I want to make it very clear - and Mr Inderjit Singh, as a commercial entrepreneur, will appreciate this - that the&nbsp;Gas Network&nbsp;Code (GNC) provisions will buy in parties to open access.&nbsp; It is a contractually binding code.&nbsp; But like any good agreement, there is a dispute resolution mechanism.&nbsp; What section 61E merely says is that it provides for a particular dispute resolution mechanism, and all parties are obliged to conform to that, should a dispute arise.&nbsp; And I think that is good because it means there is a certainty that, in the event that there is a dispute, it will be resolved, and it will be resolved in the prescribed manner.&nbsp; So I think there is no cause for concern from that perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to clarify&nbsp;this,&nbsp;because I think Mr Singh raised this point about&nbsp;sections 93 and 94 on&nbsp;appeals on decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to be very clear, clauses&nbsp;33 to 35, which apply to the transfer of assets,&nbsp;relate to the Minister making a decision on issues relating to the separation of gas transporting and retailing business arising from our plans to restructure the gas industry.&nbsp; This is a decision of the Minister, and that is not subject to an appeal under the Gas Act.&nbsp; There is no provision for that.&nbsp; The appeal provision here is for decisions made by the EMA.&nbsp; When the EMA makes a decision or a direction, then there are two ways.&nbsp; If it is something to do with financial matters, eg, a penalty, once there is an appeal, there is an automatic stay.&nbsp; On the other hand, if it is on a matter of substantive policy, then the Minister can grant a stay of the decision.&nbsp; But, in evaluating&nbsp;it, the Minister will&nbsp;obviously take into account the broader&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 767<p>public policy objective, ie, whether open access through the gas infrastructure is in fact preserved, and whether we are able to also ensure that the competitive environment we are trying to keep in our gas market is maintained.&nbsp; So the Minister will take all those factors into account in deciding whether, in the first instance, a stay should be granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa raised a couple of points on the short-term and long-term supply-demand imbalances, and I thought I should address that.&nbsp; Mr Liang is correct.&nbsp; The current generation capacity is in excess of the 30% reserve margin in our system.&nbsp; Our current peak electricity demand is about 5,000&nbsp;megawatts, and the current installed capacity is more, around 10,000 megawatts.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is an interesting point: a large part of our excess capacity is actually due to the fact that many of the players, especially the incumbents, installed more&nbsp;cost-efficient gas plants to replace the old steam plants.&nbsp; So the question is whether a competitive market will allow for more efficient decision making which is in the interest of consumers, and I think this is evident that it works, because all the power gencos have chosen to have cost-efficient plants, gas-piped plants, in order to be competitive by keeping their cost structures lower.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is driven by their need to stay cost-competitive and it does produce outcomes that are aligned with our broader policy interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to say that this excess capacity is not really going to be a permanent feature of our system.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because our electricity demand grows by about 4% to 5% a year.&nbsp; That is about 300 megawatts a year or slightly more.&nbsp; Over the next 10 years, we would expect that this excess capacity will be absorbed in part by this growth in demand.&nbsp; At the same time, some of the older steam&nbsp;plants will be retired.&nbsp; That will also reduce the supply side.&nbsp; So you will find that there will be a gradual balancing off<p align=left>Column: 768<p> of the supply and demand side of the equation here without the excess supply concerns that Mr Liang has expressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang is correct that the power generation business is capital-intensive and this is exactly why the investors will be very careful in doing their long-term calculations before putting money in.&nbsp; When you invest in a power plant, you are thinking 20 or 25 years, not five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to make one point.&nbsp; The import control that Mr Liang referred to also covers IPC, because IPC's licence was issued on the assumption of piped natural gas before this control was announced in August 2006.&nbsp; So, that is covered under the control.&nbsp; Having said that, our preference is to leave it to the market to make its judgment on whether to invest, how much to invest, how much capacity to put into the system, what kind of technology, and so on.&nbsp; What the regulator and the Government policy attempt to achieve is a competitive framework so that barriers to entry are low, if not zero, that our market signals are transparent, so that the investors can make their calculations based on the price signals in the electricity pool, they know what the long-term projected demand is going to be, and they also know what are the different supply plans of the various players in the market.&nbsp; On that basis, our investors can make their calculations and decide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can this competition be destructive? This&nbsp;is a concern that Mr Liang raised.&nbsp; Destructive competition really is the result of irrational economic behaviour.&nbsp; We would assume that whoever is prepared to sink in hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, into these plants, would be very rational in their calculations and work out what is the best way to participate in this market to ensure returns that are reasonable for their shareholders and, at the same time, their ability to maintain their competitiveness in the market.&nbsp; So we are fairly confident that if<p align=left>Column: 769<p> we create the environmental conditions for a competitive market, both in the upstream gas as well as in the retail and the electricity side, then I think the&nbsp;investors will make appropriate rational decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the long-term energy supply, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has recognised what Mr Liang has said, ie, there is a need to diversify our fuel sources.&nbsp; Hence, the emphasis on LNG, something that we are working on with the&nbsp;view to bringing it onstream by 2012 or so.&nbsp; Why is that important?&nbsp; It will help us diversify from our reliance substantially on piped natural gas.&nbsp; At the same time, it also allows us to tap into a different kind of market, because the LNG market does have its own dynamic, in terms of supply and demand, and, therefore, price, compared to piped natural gas.&nbsp; So we will continue to work on this.&nbsp; EMA will be driving the project.&nbsp; The key point is that, in doing so, we&nbsp;have been and will be closely consulting the private sector.&nbsp; This is because, at the end of the day, this is a substantial investment, and we want to make sure that we create the conditions for this to be successful commercially.&nbsp; So it has to address both our market requirements and, if potential investors can see other ways, it can be enhanced as a value proposition, we would welcome that.&nbsp; Is there a role for the Government to play?&nbsp; It would depend on what potential investors tell us and, if it is assessed that there is a need for the Government to be involved, then, as Minister Lim has mentioned earlier, we would seriously consider that as part of the overall equation for this&nbsp;to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the question of divestment of gencos, Mr Liang asked if the genco divestment is still on the cards.&nbsp; As Temasek Holdings hold all the cards on this,&nbsp;the hon. Member would have to ask them.&nbsp; But what&nbsp;I can say is that I would<p align=left>Column: 770<p> imagine that Temasek Holdings would be seriously looking at this, and they have&nbsp;been on record previously&nbsp;saying that they will assess the market conditions and, at the appropriate time, consider a divestment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe I have substantially answered all the queries raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp; [Mr S.

The enemy hides amongst innocents and organises in small groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not wear a uniform and may not even hold a gun -&nbsp; the 9/11 hijackers were armed only with box-cutters when they took control of several aircraft and used them as weapons against national targets. The 2002 Bali bombers merged into the bustling crowd of locals and tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new adversaries have a destructive impact that far exceeds their numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Radical extremists and terrorists have no qualms about murdering innocents to inspire fear for political ends.&nbsp; With long-term planning and access to technical know-how and money, they can launch deadly attacks wherever there are crowds of people and against infrastructure, such as aviation, petroleum and tourism-related targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The equation of national defence and security has changed. States face security threats that operate across jurisdictions for external defence and internal security. Any lack of coordination between security agencies can create vulnerabilities that such elements can exploit.&nbsp; A closely coordinated inter-agency approach to <p align=left>Column: 772<p>security is therefore required to keep Singapore safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Existing security operations</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are our existing security operations?&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) are cooperating closely. The SAF has for some time been&nbsp;supporting the Home Team and other Government agencies in domestic security operations. This is, at their request, to&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;meet the evolving security challenges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorist attacks can come by air, by sea or by land. We know&nbsp;that Al Qaeda was actively targeting Singapore ports, and the JI was planning to crash a hijacked airliner into Singapore. The SAF is currently supporting civilian authorities to counter both air and maritime threats. This makes sense because it would not be efficient for the Home Team to duplicate the SAF's air and sea defence capabilities.&nbsp; Only the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has capabilities to counter aerial threats.&nbsp; In the maritime arena, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) works closely with the police coast guard to combat piracy and protect sea lanes.&nbsp; The navy conducts patrols 24 hours a day, seven days a week within our territorial waters, escorts selected shipping that ply our waters, and inspects sensitive vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For land security operations, there are three things that the SAF is currently doing. This is for land security operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">4.55 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, SAF personnel are called upon to support civilian authorities&nbsp;in operations requiring specialised capabilities that the SAF has.&nbsp; These include Special Operations and Chemical, Biological, <p align=left>Column: 773<p>Radiological and Explosive (CBRE) operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, SAF troops are deployed on a long-term basis to protect key installations, such as Jurong Island, the&nbsp;Sembawang Wharves, Changi Airport and&nbsp;various SAF camps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, SAF personnel are called upon to augment the Singapore Police Force to provide security during major events like the International Olympic Committee Session, the S2006 IMF-World Bank Meeting and National Day parades, and&nbsp;the SAF will be deployed again for the ASEAN Summit later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, about 1,000 SAF personnel are deployed every day for security operations to protect key installations and for maritime and air operations.&nbsp; In the event of additional security operations like the S2006 IMF-World Bank&nbsp;Conference, a further 1,000 or so personnel are deployed.&nbsp; These current efforts leverage on the SAF's capabilities and resources to supplement civilian enforcement agencies.&nbsp; As a small country with limited resources, this is a sensible approach to enhance&nbsp;domestic security in a more complex and uncertain security environment that we face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to fulfil the mission of national defence, militaries around the world are also undertaking homeland, air and maritime security operations in a non-war environment. For example, in Australia, legislation allows the Defence Force to be used to protect against national security threats within the country. They have the powers to detain, search, seize and exercise reasonable force to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Current gaps</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although SAF personnel are already undertaking homeland, air and maritime security operations, their legal powers and<p align=left>Column: 774<p> protection under domestic law when they are deployed are not sufficiently well-defined.&nbsp; These security operations often require the SAF to exercise selected and specific legal powers in Singapore territory and international waters and airspace that were not previously envisioned.&nbsp; Such powers include the right to intercept, stop, search and detain, seize, and apply force against hostile aircraft, vessels and persons. Existing legislation that SAF personnel operate under do not define these powers adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the SAF Act, only military policemen have powers of search and arrest and these are limited to places under possession, control or occupancy of the SAF or situations where SAF operations are obstructed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Protected Areas and Protected Places Act (PAPPA) provides SAF powers of search and arrest to protect installations like Jurong Island, but only within the gazetted premises. So, SAF guards do not have the authority to stop or search suspicious vessels or persons in the vicinity of, or approaching&nbsp;the gazetted premises. They have to seek assistance from the police and wait for the police to arrive&nbsp;and take action.&nbsp; The Protected Areas and Protected Places Act does not cover situations where SAF personnel are called upon to support the police to provide security during major events or for patrolling Changi Airport. They are not empowered to search suspicious persons and are hence constrained in dealing with terrorist threats like car bombs or suicide bombers. For instance, the servicemen who accompany police officers at Changi Airport are not vested with powers to search or detain suspects or seize suspicious items during joint patrol duties. They assist the police whom they are accompanying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Order (Preservation) Act allows the SAF to be&nbsp;employed to assist <p align=left>Column: 775<p>the civil authority, but only after the proclamation of a state of emergency by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This process is not sufficiently responsive in situations where the SAF needs to respond immediately to an imminent threat. The Public Order (Preservation) Act was designed to meet a completely different set of circumstances where you have riots and curfews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although SAF personnel can exercise force under the general provisions of the Right of Private Defence, these only allow them to act as though they are private citizens. It does not give them powers and protections as officers on duty, acting to protect public security.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there is currently no domestic law that regulate SAF operations in international waters and airspace, although under international law, Singapore authorities do have jurisdiction over Singapore registered and stateless vessels and aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Key provisions of the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is therefore a need for a proper legal framework to ensure everything in the conduct of security operations is properly specified, and to lay out clearly what servicemen can and cannot do.&nbsp; The proposed amendments to the SAF Act will provide the necessary framework for regulating the SAF when conducting security operations in support of civilian authorities.&nbsp; It will provide a clear legal basis for exercising the necessary powers.&nbsp; Permit me to highlight the key parts of this Amendment Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments specify the circumstances under which the SAF may be utilised to conduct security operations in support of civilian authorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 201B, the Minister for Defence may authorise the SAF to <p align=left>Column: 776<p>conduct air and sea operations, such as to combat piracy and to detect and prevent any aerial or maritime threat to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 201C, the Minister may also make an order for the SAF to aid civilian authorities in land operations upon the occurrence or likely occurrence of an event like a terrorist attack or hostage taking.&nbsp; Such security operations would comprise protection of key installations, support&nbsp;during national events and counter-terrorist operations such as hostage rescue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 201B and 201C also set out the selected legal powers that may be lawfully exercised by servicemen involved in the security operations. These include power to stop, detain, search and use reasonable force against suspect vessels, vehicles and persons.&nbsp; The SAF will not be given investigation or prosecution powers against civilians.&nbsp; Under section 201G, any person arrested or things seized, whether in a land, sea or air operation, must be handed over, as soon as practicable, to the police.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments also put in place checks and safeguards.&nbsp; In fact, that is really one of the motivations why we want to have this amendment in place.&nbsp;Under section 201B, authorisation for the SAF to support civilian authorities in air and sea operations can only be made by the Defence Minister.&nbsp; Section 201C imposes an additional safeguard for land-based security operations. The Minister for Defence has to first consult&nbsp;a committee appointed by the Prime Minister, before he can issue an order for the SAF to assist civilian authorities for land operations.&nbsp; However, if an extraordinary emergency makes it impractical to consult the committee before issuing such an order, he must consult the committee within three days or the order will lapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 201E sets out the chain of command for the exercise of<p align=left>Column: 777<p> powers.&nbsp; It requires a serviceman to exercise powers only in accordance with the authorisation by the Minister or under an order from a superior, acting in accordance with the Minister's authorisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The powers provided to the SAF are strictly circumscribed and are limited to those necessary for the serviceman to conduct the operations in aid of the civil authorities. They do not exceed the powers that the police have.&nbsp; The powers will be limited to specific areas, allocated periods of time, and for specific tasks, as approved by the Minister.&nbsp;Under section 201C, any order for the SAF to be deployed for land operations must specify the relevant circumstances, location or infrastructure, the interest to be protected or threat averted, the legal powers that apply and the period the order will be in force. SAF personnel will not have any powers when they are not on duty and hence, cannot interpose in situations like the police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Implementation</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To effectively operationalise these provisions, SAF personnel will be appropriately trained to exercise the limited legal powers accorded to them. MINDEF is cooperating closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure that SAF troops deployed in security operations are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF Military Police Command is the lead agency in the SAF to ensure a comprehensive and robust training system.&nbsp; It will develop lesson plans and training aids, conduct courses and audit SAF units to ensure standards and compliance at the system level.&nbsp; It also maintains the currency of the training system by organising regular seminars and <p align=left>Column: 778<p>workshops to disseminate updates and best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure quality training, we train our trainers rigorously and benchmark training standards to the Singapore Police Force (SPF).&nbsp; SAF Military Police Command&nbsp;instructors conduct the courses for SAF personnel expected to execute the legal powers of search, arrest and seizure.&nbsp; These instructors are also trained by the Singapore Police Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Police Officers are regularly invited by the Military Police Command as subject matter experts to share operational experiences.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, the SAF Military Police&nbsp;Command has worked closely with their Singapore Police Force&nbsp;counterparts to adapt the relevant training curriculum to meet the SAF's operational requirements.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course topics conducted by the Military Police&nbsp;Command include general legal knowledge, assessment of situation and suspects, search techniques, effecting arrest, incident site management, and seizure of suspect materials during security operations.&nbsp; This training syllabus has been validated with the police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being trained by the SAF Military Police&nbsp;Command, SAF personnel return to their respective operational units and undergo specialised training that focus on scenario-, location-specific and rules of engagement training contextualised to their unique operational environment, prior to being deployed for security duties.&nbsp; Subsequently, the SAF&nbsp;Military Police&nbsp;Command will conduct refresher courses to ensure that core competencies are regularly maintained and updates in<p align=left>Column: 779<p> doctrine and legal knowledge are disseminated systematically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, about 400 personnel have already been trained by the SAF Military Police Command.&nbsp; We will continue to train more personnel in the coming months to provide capacity to rotate personnel.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, we expect to train about 2,000 servicemen for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Operating Procedures and Rules of Engagement are being reviewed to govern the way the SAF conducts peacetime security operations under the new legal provisions, and how soldiers act in specific scenarios they might encounter during security operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same protocols the police use will be followed by the SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp; These ROEs and SOPs will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure their relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently our SAF personnel are already deployed to assist domestic enforcement agencies to address emerging security threats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides a good legal framework to regulate the conduct of security operations when the SAF is deployed for security operations.&nbsp; It will provide the legal framework and basis for SAF servicemen to carry out these security duties effectively, with confidence, and in a well regulated and defined manner.&nbsp; It will also give the public the assurance that these servicemen are trained and legally empowered to do the job that they are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all,&nbsp;I would like to speak in support of the amendments to the SAF Act.&nbsp; These amendments which are really intended to <p align=left>Column: 780<p>put in place a proper legal framework are timely.&nbsp; They are reflective of the changed security situation of the world that we live in today.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, it was possible to have a clear divide between external threats to security and internal threats.&nbsp; Those were clear.&nbsp; The SAF dealt with the external threats and defence, and the Police&nbsp;and the Home Team dealt with internal threats.&nbsp; But, of course, 11th September 2001 changed all that.&nbsp; On September 11th, the line between the military element and the civilian element had blurred, and the problem we face today is that an external threat would not necessarily come from the foreign armed forces of another country.&nbsp; It could quite easily be initiated by terrorists and their civilian associates.&nbsp; The enemy no longer needs to&nbsp;wear a uniform which identifies him as such.&nbsp; The enemy could be from within&nbsp;and be just like one of us.&nbsp; And in our new security climate, it is no longer just military targets but also civilian targets as well.&nbsp; Hence, the need to amend the SAF Act to allow for the SAF to assist in situations where they have to act in support of civilian authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been looking at the structure of the Act and there are really two parts to it&nbsp;-&nbsp;one, the ability to deploy the SAF for air and sea operations in aid of civilian authorities; and, second, the deployment of the SAF for land operations in aid of civilian authorities.&nbsp; And it is the part on land operations that I would like to concentrate on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the regime works, as I understand it, is that, first, the Minister must think that a relevant event has occurred, could occur or would be likely to occur, and then he can order the SAF to be declared for the relevant event for such period as is specified in the order, and that is a relevant event.&nbsp; That would be something like terrorist attacks, injury to life, damaged infrastructure, taking of<p align=left>Column: 781<p> hostages, unlawful carriage of weapons or explosives.&nbsp; Only when the Minister makes the deployment order,&nbsp;the serviceman is deployed and then he has certain powers.&nbsp; And these would include various things, one of which would be the exercise of any powers conferred on a police officer under Chapters 4, 12 and 68 of the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; He also has certain powers of arrest without warrant and powers of search and seizure if he has ground to think that an offence has been committed under the Arms and Explosives Act and the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serviceman cannot exercise these powers unless he is authorised either by the Minister or under orders from a superior.&nbsp; In the context of being authorised under orders of a superior, I had heard the Minister say in his speech that the orders of the superior must in turn be authorised by the Minister.&nbsp; I would be grateful for a clarification from the Minister with respect to section 201E of the Act, because it says, \"a serviceman may exercise any power either in accordance with the Minister's authorisation or under the authority of an order of a superior.\"&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification that under the Act, the order of the superior must be authorised by the Minister.&nbsp; Otherwise, the superior would be acting on his own.&nbsp; I&nbsp;assume that&nbsp;comes from section 201E(5) but I thought that it would be best to seek clarification here.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at&nbsp;least, there is a clear chain of command&nbsp;- from Minister to superior officer, and then from the officer to the serviceman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;aspects of the Act that I want to touch on.&nbsp; One, that the provisions of the Act are quite wide-ranging and understandably so, because of the need to be able to respond to a security threat.&nbsp; One item that was of<p align=left>Column: 782<p> interest was section 201C, because there are three instances where the Minister can make an order for deployment.&nbsp; Of course, he has to do it after consulting the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is&nbsp;when a relevant event has occurred. When a relevant event has occurred, there is no problem, because I think the public will understand that there is a clear danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also allows the Minister to make an order if a relevant event is likely to occur.&nbsp; That is not a problem as well because people know that there is a probable danger.&nbsp; It is the words that the Minister can deploy the SAF where a relevant event could occur, because \"could occur\" is where anything is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to ask for the Minister's assurance that such an order would not be made lightly or arbitrarily, and would be really made in a situation where there is a real need to do so.&nbsp; I think that is where the need for public reassurance comes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect is the powers that the serviceman would have, because these are&nbsp;quite wide-ranging and, importantly, the serviceman has&nbsp;an interface with the public in the exercise of these powers.&nbsp; I appreciate that there are already built-in safeguards because he cannot exercise these powers unless the deployment order has been made and unless the Minister has given the authorisation or a superior officer has given the authorisation.&nbsp; But once those three things have occurred, the serviceman is actually in a position where he will have to exercise some element of discretion, particularly when he is exercising any of the powers conferred under the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapters 4 and&nbsp;12, or section 68, or, for example, if he is deciding to arrest without warrant or to stop and search any vehicle in connection with the two Acts mentioned earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, I suppose the need for proper training is very important.&nbsp; I was <p align=left>Column: 783<p>reassured to some extent by the Minister's speech where he outlined the type of training that the serviceman would undergo.&nbsp; I think what is of importance is the serviceman's ability to carry out those powers when they are dealing with civilians, because there will be a time when he has to exercise his discretion.&nbsp; If he stops a vehicle and he thinks, for example, that there has been a commission of an offence under the Arms and Explosives Act, he has to take a decision because he has the ability to disarm such a person; he has the ability to seize what is in the vehicle; he has got to take a judgment call on the spot whether to do that or not.&nbsp; There will also be times when he may have to decide whether to stop and search a civilian.&nbsp; So, for these instances where the discretion is necessary, because I appreciate that the serviceman cannot stop on the spot and call back for orders and say, \"Excuse me, do I search the person now?\"&nbsp; He cannot do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The training is extremely important.&nbsp; For that, the point that I wanted to make was, it is not just the methodology of carrying out the search or seizure, but the training in when to exercise that discretion, how to exercise that discretion, particularly when dealing with civilians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the main points that I wish to make, Mr Deputy Speaker.&nbsp; I would also like to say that I do support the amendments to the SAF Act.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The powers that will be given to the Singapore Armed Forces in this Bill are timely and essential in this day and age.&nbsp; As the Minister has reiterated, terrorism is on the rise and the world is fighting back <p align=left>Column: 784<p>to stamp it out.&nbsp; The fight against terrorism is a global one.&nbsp; Singapore must do its part in that fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to do our part, it is important that our laws enable our armed forces, whether they be local enforcement or the military, to have the power to be effective in that battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the amendments that are tabled in this Bill will give the SAF the ability to act together with, and supplement, where necessary, our Home Team in the battle against terrorism.&nbsp; Some of us may ask whether this is really necessary.&nbsp; Can't our local law enforcement officers&nbsp;do the job?&nbsp; Aren't the conventional methods of law enforcement sufficient without having to involve the military?&nbsp; Don't our current laws allow our Police to fight terrorism?&nbsp; Much of the time, the answer to these questions is a resounding yes.&nbsp; But, occasionally, when the situation calls for it, more is needed.&nbsp; I believe that these amendments give the power to the SAF to help our Police Force so as to ensure that there are no gaps in our defences against terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, I would like to highlight an area of concern that I have with these proposed amendments.&nbsp; This concerns the operation of section 201C, which relates to land operations.&nbsp; Under this section, the Minister for Defence would be authorised to make an order which will call for the deployment of SAF personnel on the occurrence of or possible occurrence of one or more trigger events called \"relevant events\".&nbsp; Essentially, if the Minister is of the view that a relevant event, which includes a terrorist attack or hostage situation or threat to life or our infrastructure has occurred or may occur, he may make an order deploying SAF personnel to address that relevant event after consultation with the committee appointed by the Prime Minister.&nbsp; The committee, in fact, acts as a check and balance to the power granted to the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 785<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the powers that the Minister may confer on the serviceman to be deployed are the powers, which Ms Indranee Rajah has already covered under the Criminal Procedure Code, such as the power to stop and search without warrant and the power of arrest with warrant.&nbsp; The order is then published in the <I>Government Gazette</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once that order is made, two questions arise.&nbsp; First, how are Singaporeans going to know that it has been made?&nbsp; Yes, it will be published in the <I>Government Gazette</I>, but that, with respect, is not staple reading of most Singaporeans, and even me, as a lawyer, hardly reads the <I>Gazette.&nbsp;</I> But I presume that aside from publication in the <I>Gazette</I>, due publicity will be given to the order so that all people in Singapore will be made aware of the fact of the order and the terms of the order.&nbsp; That really is the lesser issue or the more minor issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greater issue and the one which concerns me most is how Singaporeans are going to know which SAF personnel have the authority to act under the order.&nbsp; I do not think that it is intended, and the Minister has clarified, that all SAF personnel would be deployed each time that an order is made.&nbsp; We are looking at about 2,000.&nbsp; I am sure this will be done in limited numbers and not all 2,000 at the same time, depending on the relevant event that has arisen or which may arise.&nbsp; But almost every male Singaporean owns or has in his possession a camouflage&nbsp;No. 4 uniform.&nbsp; In fact, they are&nbsp;readily available for purchase at various army surplus stores.&nbsp; Does this mean that once the order is made</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>we must allow everyone in No. 4 uniform to stop, search and seize and&nbsp;arrest us without warrant?&nbsp; How would we know which servicemen have the authority to act under section 201C order?&nbsp; How would we know whether a serviceman is or&nbsp;is not on duty even if he falls under the Act?&nbsp; When guarding a protected place or installation, such as an<p align=left>Column: 786<p> army camp or Jurong Island, the boundaries are clear.&nbsp; If the man is at the guardhouse, there is no dispute.&nbsp; But when we start talking about Suntec City Convention Centre or&nbsp;Changi Airport, the line becomes blurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation, as the Minister highlighted, the army personnel that tag along with the Police doing the patrols at&nbsp;Changi Airport have no powers.&nbsp; After these amendments are passed, if the Minister makes a deployment order,&nbsp;in relation to guarding&nbsp;Changi Airport, the Police need not accompany the SAF personnel.&nbsp; The point then is how do we know whether these people are on duty or not on duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation becomes even more interesting when you talk about Suntec City&nbsp;during a convention like the ASEAN Summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all grow up in a knowledge that a policeman in uniform has these powers of stop, search and seizure.&nbsp; So when a policeman in uniform tells us to stop, we stop.&nbsp; When he asks us questions, we answer those questions.&nbsp; And we know that he has got the power to arrest us on reasonable grounds.&nbsp; In addition, a policeman carries a warrant card which&nbsp;is a symbol of&nbsp;his authority to stop, search and seize.&nbsp; If a policeman is out of uniform, he can still exercise&nbsp;those powers provided he shows his warrant card.&nbsp; What about the servicemen deployed under section 201C?&nbsp; Will they be issued some symbol of their authority so that the general public know and are aware that these servicemen have that same powers as the police?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, it is only fair&nbsp;to both the servicemen as well as the general public that those empowered under section 201C be issued with a proper form of identification to make the authority&nbsp;clear.&nbsp; This will leave no room for doubt in the minds of the general public.&nbsp; The last thing we want&nbsp;is a situation where a member of the public is challenged by SAF personnel wielding a semi-automatic machine gun because there is doubt as to<p align=left>Column: 787<p> whether he has got authority to stop, search and seize them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to invite the Minister to consider what penalties would be imposed on people who impersonate a serviceman who has been granted authority under section 201C -&nbsp;as I said, No. 4 uniforms are owned by many&nbsp;male Singaporeans - or a serviceman who abuses the power granted to him under section 201C.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp;see provisions in the Bill which relate to those scenarios.&nbsp; Currently, complaints of abuse of powers by police are dealt with by internal enquiries within the Police Force.&nbsp; If they are justified, firm disciplinary action is taken.&nbsp; Will a similar procedure be established for such cases of abuse by SAF personnel?&nbsp; In the same way that you got a higher level check and balance, in terms of a committee appointed by the Prime Minister in respect of an order that is made by the Minister, we also need these lower level checks and balances in respect of the same powers that you are giving to SAF personnel that are given to the Police.&nbsp; I hope the Minister will consider and address the concerns that I have raised so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the powers provided for in this Bill, as I believe the amendments will enhance Singapore's ability in the fight against terrorism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that,&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.35 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, after 9/11, the security landscape has changed drastically.&nbsp; Terrorism is a clear and present danger, a threat to the peace and security of Singapore.&nbsp; So far, we have been spared the ravages of terrorism.&nbsp; This is due to the good work of the police, the Internal Security Department and the Security Forces as well as<p align=left>Column: 788<p> the support and cooperation of all Singaporeans of all races.&nbsp; We can understand and appreciate therefore the extension of powers to&nbsp;SAF servicemen in their deployment for air and sea operations. Air and sea operations are by nature external operations for which SAF servicemen are trained and geared up for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, empowerment of SAF servicemen for land operation is not the same.&nbsp; In the amendment, SAF servicemen will be empowered to search, arrest and detain persons within Singapore in land operations.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;clearly a new domestic military role.&nbsp; It is a big&nbsp;psychological change which may be difficult to accept.&nbsp; In the domestic context, we are all familiar with the neighbourhood policemen -&nbsp;our men in blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&nbsp;could&nbsp;be quite frightening for a layman to be confronted by a soldier in army camouflage with an array of powerful weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore have the following questions for the Minister for Defence.&nbsp; Currently, the SAF servicemen work side by side with the police officers in land operations.&nbsp; They complement each other and in emergency, the Minister for Home Affairs can extend the police powers to the SAF servicemen.&nbsp; This system seems to be working out well so far.&nbsp; Why do we need to change this?&nbsp; As they say, \"If ain't broke, why fix it?\"&nbsp; If we need more manpower to do police patrols at vital installations like the Airport, why not increase police personnel by sending more National Servicemen to join the Police Force, instead of enlisting&nbsp;the SAF?&nbsp; Traditionally, the SAF is for external defence and the Police&nbsp;is in charge of law and order within the country.&nbsp; In a way, it is a separation of powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the empowerment of SAF servicemen in domestic operation distort this fine balance of power?&nbsp; We can trust the current Government Ministers we all know&nbsp;are people of integrity.&nbsp; I know we <p align=left>Column: 789<p>can trust Minister Teo Chee Hean who will absolutely abide by the rules.&nbsp; But what if the PAP were to lose power one day, and I hope not, and another set of leaders take over the country and the government?&nbsp; Will such concentration of powers in the SAF lead to potential abuses under a different government?&nbsp; Will there be a chance of a military backed government?&nbsp; When the SAF personnel operate in internal land operation, will they be subject to civil law or military law?&nbsp; If there were abuses of misconduct, would they be charged in civil court or would they be court-martialled?&nbsp; Even the SAF servicemen need to know under what laws are they operating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, SAF personnel are mainly males.&nbsp; May I ask if they will be allowed to search female persons in public?&nbsp; In the London underground, a person was shot by mistake, suspected wrongly of being a terrorist.&nbsp; Would there be clear rules of engagement for SAF personnel and how well will they be trained to handle tricky and delicate situations,&nbsp;bearing in mind that mishaps cannot be ruled out?&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; are we expecting too much of our young SAF National Servicemen?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do appreciate that the intention behind these amendments is benign.&nbsp; However, I have some concerns regarding the proposed section 201C relating to the deployment of the army for land operations as it appears to contain some rather drastic powers given to the Minister for Defence.&nbsp; Under section 201C, a relevant event, as defined by subsection 10, must occur or be likely to occur before deployment.&nbsp; Section 201C gives the power to declare that such an event has occurred to the Minister for Defence.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 790<p>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to ask the Minister if he could clarify the constitutional status of section 201C.&nbsp; The Constitution currently prescribes that it is the President who will issue any proclamation of emergency.&nbsp; Such an emergency is defined under Article 150 of the Constitution as a grave situation where&nbsp; the security or economic life of Singapore is threatened.&nbsp; The existing SAF Act itself, under section 198, envisages that it is the President who will decide whether emergency powers should be&nbsp;in force.&nbsp; Looking at the triggering events in this Bill, under subsection 10 are situations listed such as a terrorist attack and damage or disruption to the operation of infrastructure, which would seem to overlap with the emergency situations defined by the Constitution since these events too threaten the security and economic life of Singapore.&nbsp; As the President is not intended to be involved under this Bill, does this undermine the Constitution?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Sir, the Minister in charge has very wide powers.&nbsp; Section 201C provides for the Minister to consult a committee before ordering deployment.&nbsp; This committee is to be appointed by the Prime Minister.&nbsp; However, section 201C(7) provides for situations when the Minister need not consult the committee, that is, if he is satisfied that the emergency is sudden and extraordinary such that it is not practical to consult.&nbsp; If the Minister orders deployment without consulting the committee, his order can continue for 72 hours after which it will lapse unless the committee confirms it.&nbsp; Sir, if the ground situation is indeed very grave, should the Prime Minister not be a critical decision maker, instead of asking the Minister to decide after consulting a committee?&nbsp; Should the Prime Minister not make the decision?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, although it may be far-fetched to imagine it now, we may one day have a Minister in charge who has<p align=left>Column: 791<p> ambitions to overthrow the Government and take control, and in answer to the preceding Member, Dr Ong, it could very well come from this ruling party in years to come, we can never say.&nbsp; The proposed section 201C would allow this Minister to deploy the army for 72 hours without seeking approval from anyone.&nbsp; Once the three days have passed, it may be the point of no return.&nbsp; As such, Sir, I have grave concerns about the powers given to the Minister under section 201C and would urge the Government to review this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to seek clarification on one of the relevant events in subsection 10 of section 201C and, that is, injury or threat to life of such person as the Minister proposes to specify in his order.&nbsp; It seems very drastic to mobilise the army to protect an individual.&nbsp; The Explanatory Statement to the Bill mentions that such individuals include foreign dignitaries.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify who else the Government has in mind for this triggering event?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First of all, let me recap why such a Bill is necessary.&nbsp; The situation has indeed changed from the past.&nbsp; The current regulations and laws provide for a situation, say,&nbsp;of riots or civil disorder, and this is envisaged under the Public Order (Preservation)&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; This is the question that Dr Ong Chit Chung asked.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Act, the Minister for Home Affairs is required to make a proclamation that there exists in an area in Singapore&nbsp;a state of danger&nbsp;of public order and&nbsp;is intended for a different set of circumstances -&nbsp;civil disorders, riots, imposition of curfews, rather than for the type of security operations that the SAF is <p align=left>Column: 792<p>now in and will be conducting against terrorism.&nbsp; The other situation is one where the Home Affairs Ministry or the Police calls the SAF in to help protect lives and property in specific ad hoc circumstances, for example, by calling in our Special Operations Force as in a hostage rescue situation.&nbsp; But the issue at hand here is that the current legislation is not well-suited to the circumstances at hand and also does not provide enough safeguards in the event that the SAF is deployed.&nbsp; For example, SAF servicemen who are deployed do not have the Police powers&nbsp;of search, arrest and seizure.&nbsp; The SAF servicemen cannot conduct searches, maintain road blocks, seize objects independently without the presence of a police officer.&nbsp; And also, for security operations in the air and sea, today, there&nbsp;is no specific domestic legislation for the Minister for Home Affairs to call on the SAF to do those operations and acts specified in the SAF (Amendment) Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

So this Act is put in place to achieve both purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also bear in mind that, unlike in bigger countries where, in a given city, you can draw upon state or federal authorities to come to your assistance, whether it is the police at the state and federal levels or the fire service and other security-type agencies, Singapore is a relatively small country.&nbsp; There is no state or federal authority.&nbsp; We only have one level of authority in the police force.&nbsp; There is no neighbouring police force in a neighbouring county, city or state, or federal police force from which we can draw reinforcements and<p align=left>Column: 793<p> resources if we face a situation where we need additional resources.&nbsp; So we have to optimise the resources that we have at hand in order to be able to protect our security in the best possible and most efficient way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act provides for important safeguards.&nbsp; Let me deal with some of the concerns that Members have raised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about how the superior officer&nbsp;is empowered and&nbsp;whether I could&nbsp;confirm that&nbsp;the superior officer or the&nbsp;superior specified in 201E(1)(b) is indeed the&nbsp;superior stated in 201E, paragraph 5, and I do confirm that that is indeed the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah is concerned about the term \"could\" rather than \"likely\".&nbsp; Sir, could a terrorist attack occur, say, in a place like Jurong Island?&nbsp; Is it likely to occur in Jurong Island today or tomorrow?&nbsp; What are the consequences if an attack were to occur in a place like Jurong Island?&nbsp; I think the consequences would be quite catastrophic, the damage would be quite immense, and it would not affect just Jurong Island because of the types of activities that are carried on Jurong Island, and the impact may be beyond Jurong Island.&nbsp; So, even though in a case like Jurong Island, if you&nbsp;ask, \"Is it likely to be attacked today or&nbsp;tomorrow?\",&nbsp;I would say I could not honestly answer that is likely to be attacked today or tomorrow.&nbsp; Could it be attacked?&nbsp; I would say it could be attacked.&nbsp; What is the consequence if it is attacked?&nbsp; The consequence could be quite catastrophic.&nbsp; In such a circumstance, I think that it is wise to provide the security that we do indeed provide today for Jurong Island.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer wanted to know how a person knows that an event&nbsp;has been gazetted.&nbsp; I think if such an event occurs, if there is&nbsp;no security implication<p align=left>Column: 794<p> related to it, we will certainly publicise it beyond the <I>Gazette</I>, if necessary.&nbsp; But more importantly, Mr Michael Palmer wants to know how we would identify such a military personnel who is on duty.&nbsp; And I do agree with him that it is necessary to provide such identification.&nbsp; So SAF personnel on security operations will wear an identification, like an armband that says, \"Military Security\", much like a military policeman wears today.&nbsp; In addition, we will issue a military security identification card to SAF personnel conducting security operations.&nbsp; This card will have a photograph of the serviceman, his name and NRIC number.&nbsp; The card would be issued to the SAF personnel for the duration of the operation.&nbsp; Unlike a police warrant card, which has wider powers, the military security identification card gives SAF personnel limited powers for security operations duty in a defined area and allocated period of time to conduct specific tasks, as authorised by the Minister for Defence.&nbsp; The armband and military security identification card would provide the public assurance that the SAF personnel are conducting authorised security operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not specified in this amendment Bill, there are indeed current laws against impersonating an SAF officer.&nbsp; In fact, there have been people prosecuted for personating SAF personnel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also currently sufficient legal safeguards in place against the SAF Servicemen who may misconduct themselves in such operations.&nbsp; SAF Servicemen are in the privileged position of being subject to both military law and the laws that you and I are subject to, and it is actually up to the Attorney-General whether he chooses to prosecute&nbsp;SAF personnel under the laws that you and I are subject to or whether he chooses to hand prosecution over to the military prosecutor before a Court Martial.&nbsp; So, in fact, if you like, the rules under which military personnel operate are tighter than<p align=left>Column: 795<p> the rules under which normal civilians function.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the constitutional provisions.&nbsp; I think there are no constitutional impediments for such a law to be passed.&nbsp; There is, in fact, a provision for emergency powers under section 198 under the SAF Act, and the powers proposed by these amendments are narrower in scope and for specified threats which may not warrant a declaration of emergency.&nbsp; When you have a declaration of emergency by the President, it is really an extreme circumstance.&nbsp; But if you have a S2006 conference, do you declare an emergency in Singapore?&nbsp; I think it is not the kind of situation where we say there is an emergency in Singapore just because we are holding a World Bank Conference or just because we have an ASEAN Summit.&nbsp; It does not warrant the declaration of an emergency.&nbsp; In fact, when an emergency is declared, the emergency powers under section 198 of the SAF Act give the SAF more wide-ranging powers than those envisaged under the proposed amendments.&nbsp;For example, when an emergency is declared, the SAF may enter, inspect, occupy, take possession of, evacuate, use, transfer, confiscate or destroy any private and public property and order any person to do any work and render any service.&nbsp; So, that is quite an extreme situation in Singapore before we would want to request for the President to declare an emergency and for the SAF to invoke such powers.&nbsp; So what we are actually asking for is a much more limited set of powers for the SAF in a very controlled and carefully specified way, and the&nbsp;place, time and duration, so that we are able to carry out operations in a way and still assure the public that their interests are well-protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked quite an improbable question whether the law will then allow a Minister for Defence to do something which is obviously illegal.&nbsp; I think if the Minister for Defence, whether<p align=left>Column: 796<p> in this Government or in any future government, had such an intention, he really does not need a law for him to carry this out.&nbsp; In fact, the law here is to try and make sure that the powers that the Minister for Defence has in these circumstances are well-defined and well-conscribed, and what he can do and cannot do are also well-specified.&nbsp; And if I may inform this House, one of the reasons why I wanted to move this&nbsp;Bill is, in fact, to make sure that, as the SAF takes part in support of the Home Team in security operations in Singapore, these are well-defined, so that there is no ambiguity that these limitations on the Minister for Defence and the SAF are specified in the Act, so that there is no doubt that there are no other areas into which the Minister for Defence or the SAF can stray into which they ought not to be straying into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This Bill will amend the Environmental Pollution Control Act (EPCA) for&nbsp; the National Environment Agency (NEA) to:</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 797<p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; establish a mandatory labelling scheme for the purposes of energy conservation; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; increase the maximum allowable composition sum for offences under the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Impetus for a mandatory energy labelling scheme</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I had announced in March this year, the NEA will be the lead agency for energy conservation and efficiency.&nbsp; Improving energy efficiency is an important aspect of sustainable development for Singapore.&nbsp; Singapore is reliant on imported fossil fuels for much of its energy needs at present, and energy efficiency can help to reduce the amount of energy we need.&nbsp; At the national level, this will reduce the environmental impact of our energy use, bring down our energy cost, and even improve our energy security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a consumer, using more energy-efficient equipment and appliances is a way to reduce energy consumption and save significantly on the electricity bill in the long term.&nbsp; For example, a consumer that uses an air-conditioner that is rated at 3-ticks instead of 1-tick under the energy labelling scheme saves about $500 a year in energy costs.&nbsp; This is significant, compared to the upfront cost of an air-conditioner of about $2,000.&nbsp; This would also reduce carbon emissions by about 1,400 kilogrammes a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the upfront cost differentials, consumers do not always choose the appliances that will save them the most in the long run.&nbsp; The cost savings from energy efficiency are not immediately obvious to the consumer, and thus, consumers only focus on the upfront price tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 798<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address this market failure, the Government can help to bridge the information gap, by ensuring that consumers are provided with information on the energy consumption of appliances.&nbsp; NEA, therefore, introduced the voluntary energy labelling scheme</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

A mandatory energy labelling scheme will ensure that consumers can compare energy consumption across all models of all appliances on the market.&nbsp; Similar schemes in the US, the EU and Australia, have helped to lower energy use in these countries.&nbsp; The experience with a voluntary scheme shows that the cost impact of energy labelling on manufacturers and importers is unlikely to be significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will insert a new Part on energy conservation into the EPCA for NEA to establish a mandatory energy labelling scheme (MELS) for registrable goods.&nbsp; The necessary subsidiary legislation to establish MELS for household air-conditioners and refrigerators will be gazetted by 1st July this year.&nbsp; The industry will be given a six-month grace period to clear their existing stock and to comply with MELS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed amendments, manufacturers and importers will be required to register with NEA if they intend to supply registrable goods locally.&nbsp; They will also be required to register the models they wish to sell with NEA, as well as ensure that energy labels are properly attached to their appliances.&nbsp; As part of the registration of models, manufacturers and importers will need to submit documentation identifying the energy performance of the models according to the prescribed test <p align=left>Column: 799<p>standards.&nbsp; This will serve to ensure that the energy information provided on the labels is accurate and comparable across the various models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Renaming the Environmental Pollution Control Act</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the inclusion of the new Part on energy conservation, the existing title of the Act will not entirely reflect the new mandate of the Act, which goes beyond pollution control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Pollution Act will therefore be renamed the Environmental Protection and Management Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Amendment to the formulation for composition sums</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill would also amend the EPCA to increase the maximum allowable composition sum for offences under the Act.&nbsp; This is necessary to ensure that the penalties for pollution offences remain an effective deterrent.&nbsp; In particular, Sir, this amendment will allow the composition sums of construction noise offences to be raised to a more adequate level, to complement the recent tightening of construction noise limits gazetted earlier in March 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.02 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill as I believe that it is a giant step that we can take to help lessen the impact of our construction activities on the environment.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already, as stated by recent findings from a variety of sources like the inter-governmental panel for climate change, our climate is not faring very well and our future does not look very bright if we are <p align=left>Column: 800<p>to continue on our current path without reinforcing measures to help maintain the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I feel that we must temper our need to help the environment with a sense of pragmatism.&nbsp; I have no doubt as to the long term benefits that will be brought about by the implementation of&nbsp; the proposed changes in the Bill.&nbsp; But how will it affect our economic and social stability?&nbsp; For one, the NEA has proposed amendments to introduce stricter noise limits for construction sites at night and on&nbsp;weekends and public holidays.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is understandable that site&nbsp;works will cause inconvenience to those living in the area, we must consider the impact that such amendments will have on the construction industry.&nbsp; Our local construction industry was in the woods until recent months when it began to see some growth.&nbsp; But even this was unfortunately marred&nbsp;by the double&nbsp;impact of both the sand ban and stoppage of granite exports by Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a recent <I>Straits Times'</I> report, the price of sand rose to about $60 a tonne, up from about $20 before the ban, while granite was going for $70 a tonne, up from $25.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has warned that future new developments could be slow or delayed if sand and concrete become more difficult to obtain. This could translate to an additional cost in development.&nbsp; As such, the construction industry, with a bright sky, has&nbsp;suddenly turned hazy because of this unexpected turn of events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By implementing noise limits that&nbsp;are too stringent for the industry, we will be imposing yet another constraint on the construction companies. Deadlines and meeting schedules are always the bugbear for this industry.&nbsp; With fewer hours to work, they will find themselves like a tight<p align=left>Column: 801<p> rope walker&nbsp;trying to cross the thin steel wire on a very windy day.&nbsp; There are so many unforeseen elements that a contractor has to contend with, such as material supply, manhours lost and weather, not to mention, the proposed shorter working hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a&nbsp;time when our economy is picking up, we need to get many projects to be built on a fast track. Working round the clock and on public holidays is the industry's way of making up for any time lost. Hence, I feel that we consider how to balance the needs of the public and the requirements of the construction industry.&nbsp; We must, in a sense, put a collar around&nbsp;the neck but not tighten it such that&nbsp;it&nbsp;becomes a noose that can suffocate the entire industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there are certain works, such as electrical cabling and water-pipes, which&nbsp;should be given a special waiver from the restrictions. Activities like launching of pre-cast beams for bridges and continuous 24-hour concrete casting for rough foundations, ball piles and damper walls should be considered for this waiver as well as this is a technical requirement.&nbsp; I am sure the Minister&nbsp;understands what I am saying because he himself is a civil engineer by training.&nbsp; Any inconvenience rendered by such works should be seen in the context of the larger picture.&nbsp; If these public works are not completed on time, a much larger inconvenience will result and it will invariably be the people who will lose out.&nbsp; Perhaps, a taskforce consisting of industry players and Government agencies should be formed to work out the waiver list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area I am concerned with is how long a company's record of offences will exist in the records.&nbsp; Are there any plans for a reward system that can offset a company's record of offences after a <p align=left>Column: 802<p>certain period of time, perhaps maybe 12 months, if no offences are committed during that period?&nbsp; This system is already in place in the form of the police's&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver Improvement Points&nbsp;System (DIPS) which it uses to discipline errant drivers.&nbsp; I feel that such a system reaps a good amount of benefits when applied in any context. We should not only always use a stick and forget to offer a carrot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not provide companies with the opportunity to start anew on a clean slate, they will be penalised unnecessarily in a matter of time.&nbsp; The truly recalcitrant&nbsp;offenders will always be there to face the music but it is the accidental offenders whom I think we should offer help.&nbsp; Also, the Minister should consider whether increasing fines is the only way to try and solve a problem.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry to seriously review this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Although Singapore is a small country, this Bill will help us play our part in conserving energy, and in creating a better living environment for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Mandatory energy labelling</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a voluntary Energy Labelling Scheme has been in operation since 2002. &nbsp;To date, less than 25% of refrigerator and air-conditioner models in the market have been labelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturers and retailers have obviously not shown much enthusiasm to this scheme, and for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Fridges and air-conditioners are energy guzzlers, and energy labelling will no doubt highlight this fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 803<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the passing of the amendments to this Bill, energy labelling will become mandatory.&nbsp; This Bill will create a leveller, enabling consumers to choose products which are more energy-efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What timeline are we looking at to reach a higher percentage for energy labelling of refrigerators and air-conditioners in the market?&nbsp; How else will the Ministry engage in an awareness programme to promote a switch to energy-saving products?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage importers and manufacturers to register with NEA, would NEA be giving any form of grants or incentives to expedite a swifter change to energy-saving goods?&nbsp; Suppliers are given a grace period of&nbsp;six months to clear their existing stocks.&nbsp; Would the NEA consider some form of rebates to help expedite this process?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this&nbsp;Bill will subject offenders who fail to label their goods or mislead with information to fine and both fine and imprisonment respectively.&nbsp; How will NEA be tracking for compliance and would there be any recourse for the supplier who may&nbsp;have failed to comply because of extenuating circumstances?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the intent of the Bill is noble as it seeks to protect and manage, it is just as important that there is a proper process to manage the suppliers.&nbsp; The Bill must not just come on, on the suppliers from a punitive approach.&nbsp; That must be the last resort.&nbsp; At all times, the process to convert suppliers to comply must convey education, persuasion and seriousness that leads to meting out fines and imprisonment.&nbsp; The latter should be the last resort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot, and I am confident that their consumer instincts will prevail in selecting the most energy-efficient products.&nbsp; Their pragmatism will guide them not only in the prices<p align=left>Column: 804<p> of these products, but also their potential to save consumers on their electricity bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Construction noise control</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in past sessions in this House, I have highlighted the problem of noise pollution caused by construction activities near to or in the housing estates.&nbsp; As a highly urbanised country, we can accept the inevitability of construction activities so close to our homes.&nbsp; With tight deadlines, building contractors are often forced to extend their activities into the night and even Sundays and public holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as I have highlighted in the past, the noise from these construction activities tend to affect residents adversely.&nbsp; I am therefore glad to support the amendments to this&nbsp;Bill as they relate to the penalties for noise pollution.&nbsp; The higher penalties of fines and compositions will no doubt motivate contractors to look into more effective ways to control noise pollution from their activities.&nbsp; However, to cushion the pressure of cost and time constraint, as raised by hon. Member Lee Bee Wah, I urge NEA to consider partaking in subsidising the measures to control noise pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must not just be looking at the inconveniences faced by the contracts because of such measures.&nbsp; At the same time, I think we must also consider the plight of residents having to live through the day and night and even on weekends with the noise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides depending on complaints to track recalcitrant contractors, what other measures are being taken to educate contractors on noise pollution?&nbsp; Where the construction activities coincide with school examination periods, especially during the PSLE, 'O' and&nbsp; 'A'&nbsp;&nbsp;levels and university examinations,&nbsp;would <p align=left>Column: 805<p>the Ministry consider barring construction activities from being carried out during the night and on weekends as well as public holidays?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractors will find that it makes business sense, in terms of dollars and cents, to keep the noise level down.&nbsp; This will also create a more favourable image, understanding and acceptance of the other inconveniences that residents may have to put up with as a result of their construction activities, such as dust, detours and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Environmental Pollution Control (Amendment) Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.15 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the light of the rising concerns on global warming and our efforts to promote energy-efficient buildings, this move to introduce mandatory energy labelling for household appliances is indeed timely, and I support the Bill.&nbsp; The Government has been pushing hard for building owners to use energy-efficient equipment as well as adopt energy-efficient designs to cut down on their consumption of electricity.&nbsp; This has gradually got the desired effects, as we see more buildings, including industrial buildings, getting the Green Mark.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While not everyone may appreciate the issue of global warming, I am sure when this is translated in terms of monthly electricity bills, it will get the required attention.&nbsp; Household energy consumption, which accounts for 18% of the total electricity consumed in 2005, when seen in the context of a growing population in Singapore, the final figure will add up to a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 806<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, there are many options for households to cut down on their monthly bills.&nbsp; Many electronic devices draw power whenever they are plugged into an outlet, even when they are turned off or are fully charged, such as adapters that come with rechargeable battery-powered cordless phones, cell phones and digital cameras.&nbsp; Leaving electronics on standby, such as TVs, cable boxes and computer monitors, also waste energy.&nbsp; So we have to monitor how we use these electronics and appliances to cut down on our consumption of electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with the introduction of&nbsp;energy labelling on appliances, households will have yet another option to cut waste.&nbsp; To help the consumers, the National Environment Agency must ensure that the energy-efficient labels attached to the products or their packaging convey easy to understand information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would even go a step further and ask NEA, instead of just stating that the product is energy-efficient, they should also indicate how much energy it consumes.&nbsp; The label must have the energy consumption figure to show the units of electricity use in kilowatt hour (kWh) to allow comparisons between models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way, a consumer can make an informed decision and decide whether he needs to buy the product that consumes 80 watts per hour or he can make do with one that uses just 50 watts per hour, or even after looking at the monthly energy cost, decide not to buy.&nbsp; This is an informed choice for a buyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I will also ask NEA to look into extending the mandatory labelling to more appliances, such as washing machines and hot water dispenser appliances.&nbsp; These are the essentials at homes.&nbsp; NEA should also give information on how much water they consume.&nbsp; This will again help consumers to make an informed decision<p align=left>Column: 807<p> on which model or brand is most suitable for their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to educate our population on the consumption characteristics of these appliances, so that they will begin to ask themselves the questions:&nbsp; Do I really need this huge refrigerator?&nbsp; Or can I make do with just a smaller sized unit?&nbsp; For washing machines, I understand that in view of the different technologies used, the front-loading and the top-loading machines use very different quantity of water. Many of the consumers do not know this fact, as many go for top-loading machines as these are at least 50% cheaper in terms of the purchase price.&nbsp; For longer life, frequently used, high energy consuming products, the savings in energy cost over the product lifetime can be especially significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in Europe, the EU Energy Label is a compulsory notice that is applied to all white goods, ie, beyond the home appliances sold within the EU.&nbsp; They include office equipment, such as printers, copiers, fax machines, computers, scanners and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA should launch a public education campaign to create awareness, especially with the widespread use of computers in the homes.&nbsp; I am sure many would be interested which make of computer is more energy-efficient, or is a notebook more energy-efficient than a desktop?&nbsp; One report I read comparing the 30-watt for a powerful notebook, including LCD screen, with the 120-watt desktop PC plus the 80 watt CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) screen, savings could really be up to 80%.&nbsp; And even in the notebooks intended as \"desktop replacement\", with a larger screen, up to 16-17 inches, and less aggressive power management settings, the savings are still well above 50%.&nbsp; I am sure many parents will be keen to know about this, because our teenagers are putting on their appliances three at one time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 808<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last concern I have is that NEA should help our suppliers with this energy labelling,&nbsp;to cut down as much as possible the cost, and&nbsp;not to add additional cost to our suppliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with energy labelling, Singaporeans will find that they now can buy smart, save on electricity bills, get the most out of their appliances and, at the same time, save the earth.&nbsp; Buying more energy-efficient appliances means less heat, longer product life, lower air-conditioning cost and might even save valuable space at home.&nbsp; And I like this.&nbsp; The high product energy efficiency is both an indication of high quality and also advanced product technologies too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Minister will do more education campaigns on this.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.22 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am pleased that there is a change in the name of the Environmental Pollution Control Act to the Environmental Protection and Management Act, and I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name change is timely and it will reflect the enlarged scope of the law which will extend beyond just controlling pollution to encompassing protection and management of the environment.&nbsp; It puts the Government on a more proactive mode when it comes to issues relating to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am entirely in agreement with the proposal to mandate energy labelling of appliances, especially refrigerators and air-conditioners.&nbsp; After all, they account for the highest energy consumption in the domestic sector.&nbsp; In fact, in today's modern homes, air-conditioners and refrigerators are becoming standard fixtures.&nbsp; We can all clearly see where<p align=left>Column: 809<p> Singapore is heading in the near future with our Government aggressively pushing towards realisation of a new global city that we aspire to be.&nbsp; The demand for electrical appliances will be tremendous; so will be the usage of electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my main concern on this Bill is how this is going to affect the ordinary man-in-the-street.&nbsp; I am referring, in particular, to the mandatory labelling of electrical appliances and its impact on households, especially for those in the lower-income bracket.&nbsp; What is the cost of this mandatory labelling of electrical appliances for the suppliers and distributors?&nbsp; Will the amendments result in cost increase for the consumers?&nbsp; Does the Ministry have in place a mechanism for keeping labelling cost to the minimum for suppliers, so that the suppliers cannot find an excuse to raise prices of appliances that carry the energy- saving label?&nbsp; In fact, if the cost of labelling is marginal, I am surprised that there was reluctance by major appliance suppliers to voluntarily offer their products to the labelling scheme.&nbsp; Was cost a factor that restrained them from coming forward?&nbsp; Being a commercially-oriented enterprise, I am sure there is a marketing advantage for these suppliers if they got their products labelled promptly and to exploit the certification to their advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point I would like to raise is whether there is a duration of lifespan for this label.&nbsp; For example, an air-conditioning unit condenser which is 8-10 years old will not be as energy-efficient as when it was first&nbsp; bought.&nbsp; I believe appliances, like human beings, also go through mid-life crisis and they do need some form of reconfiguration.&nbsp; Therefore, should this label be subjected to automatic expiry date?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is that there are many shops which buy and sell old appliances, and we<p align=left>Column: 810<p> should make it explicit to consumers that buying such appliances with labels does not imply the energy consumption as efficient as it was&nbsp;just as&nbsp;it came off the manufacturing line.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the second-hand air-conditioner and refrigerator retailers be subjected to this Bill?&nbsp; If they are included, how is the Ministry going to mandate this group?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to boldly propose that the Ministry take one more step further, which means why not go ahead to enforce only appliances with certain energy efficiency level to be allowed into our market.&nbsp; We need to bear in mind that as the population increases, as we propel our economy to the next level of growth, our energy consumption is definitely going to see an exponential increase.&nbsp; We need to do more to cap on our energy usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will perhaps be more appropriate at this moment for the Ministry to increase its efforts on publicity programmes now to create greater public awareness on choosing the energy-efficient label.&nbsp; This campaign should also educate the public on how to decide whether it is cheaper to repair an old appliance or just replace it completely with a new and more energy-efficient model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government should also promote renewable source of energy, such as solar energy for households as well as look into its wider application in public housing estates.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t<p align=left>Column: 810<p>\r\n<div align=center><b>\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::810-->\r\n</b>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Members who have stood up to support this Bill.&nbsp; I am thankful for the support that they have given in their speeches, especially the strong support towards energy labelling.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address some of the questions raised by the Members.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will start with my fellow civil engineer, Ms Lee Bee Wah, on some concerns about whether or not with the tightening of noise limits and the penalties, we will therefore become too stringent with respect to the construction industry.&nbsp; I would like to inform the House and the hon. Member that before we started on this process, we consulted the industry widely.&nbsp; We went through a whole series of consultations with the Singapore Contractors Associations, the Real Estate Association, the Institute of Architects, the Institute of Engineers Singapore, and other bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone that is involved in the construction industry has been consulted, and they all agree that the limits that we have arrived at are actually workable.&nbsp; We have to do this primarily because the number of complaints has been increasing.&nbsp; So the balance that we have reached is quite good between the industry and also the demand from the public.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, the Member's concern about exemption is a valid one.&nbsp; For some type of construction works, they would require an extended period in terms of the work.&nbsp; For example, as she rightly pointed out, when you have to concrete a large raft foundation, it will go beyond 12 hours or even 24 hours.&nbsp; We will examine the requests on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; The manner in which we<p align=left>Column: 812<p> will implement these noise limits and the penalties will be very judicious, because we understand that we must also help the industry to adjust to these new noise limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member suggested a task force on a waiver list.&nbsp; What we will do is that we will look at the waivers request on a case-by-case basis, and we will consult the industry, because we cannot assume that the NEA has the expert knowledge on the industry.&nbsp; So we will consult with our colleagues in the BCA and other agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point is that these noise limits will come into effect on 1st October 2007.&nbsp; So, for existing projects, they will not be affected.&nbsp; For the new projects, they can therefore factor in the new noise limits and the penalties into their budget.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; they can make some adjustments.&nbsp; If we look at the noise limits, it is only during the weekends and public holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a request for us to have a blanket freeze during such periods.&nbsp; We thought it was not the right thing to do as far as our construction industry is concerned.&nbsp; So the limits that we have reached is a good balance between the needs of the industry and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether increasing fines is the only way to go.

&nbsp;Is it 1 tick or 2 ticks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But her other point about whether or not we want to extend this beyond, I think we will move slowly.&nbsp; As she has rightly pointed out, household energy consumption is about 18% to 20% and among that, refrigerators and air-conditioners are the guzzlers.&nbsp; So if we can help households to reduce their energy consumption for these two types of appliances which are quite pervasive in Singapore, then I think we would be able to achieve a lot.&nbsp; We will monitor this <p align=left>Column: 815<p>very closely.&nbsp; Eventually, if some products come to the market which are becoming more popular, then we will address that.&nbsp; For example, not many homes would have dryers, which are basically energy guzzlers.&nbsp; But once that becomes popular in Singapore -&nbsp; we will look into it and see whether we want to introduce energy labelling for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the Member that we will not want the cost of registration to be excessive.&nbsp; In fact, we have worked out a cost which is quite reasonable.&nbsp; It is not the aim of NEA to profit from this.&nbsp; We will just cover cost, and the registration will be for three years.&nbsp; So I would like to assure the Member that we will continue to help the industry to make sure that we can do this without increasing the costs excessively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim raised a valid question which I thought was also alluded to by Mdm Phua about the impact on households.&nbsp; Due to the popularity of some models, the unit cost for testing is actually quite low.&nbsp; So the question that he raised as to why is it, after so many years of voluntary scheme, not many manufacturers are on board, perhaps it is just inertia.&nbsp; But now, making it mandatory, and after looking at it for the last three years, you realise that it is not that difficult.&nbsp; In fact, some of the models already come with the energy information from where they have been imported.&nbsp; We are quite open.&nbsp; We are not insisting that they all must be tested by a certain company in Singapore.&nbsp; We accept based upon whatever information they can deliver from the suppliers on their side.&nbsp; So we will make it as easy as possible.&nbsp; But we must be able to see a certificate which is internationally recognisable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration, as I mentioned earlier, is for three years and it is renewed after that.&nbsp; As for second-hand goods, I am not sure whether Dr Lim is privy to such thing.&nbsp; But I think the market for such<p align=left>Column: 816<p> goods is not that high.&nbsp; It is not cost-effective for you to do labelling for second-hand goods.&nbsp; It is more cost-effective to do it for new products.&nbsp; And what will happen is that the labelling has to be renewed every three years, not for that product, but for that model.&nbsp; Because three years later, for example, we may have more information and therefore, we have to renew that.&nbsp; We do not see a need for labeling of second-hand air-conditioners and refrigerators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree on public education and&nbsp;will start immediately after this.&nbsp; We have to go out and explain, not only to the suppliers but also to the consumers.&nbsp; But Dr Lim raised a very good point about minimum energy, which I thought was also mentioned by Mdm Cynthia Phua on energy consumption.&nbsp; Eventually, that is the way to go.&nbsp; But we will look at energy labelling first as a step and making that&nbsp;mandatory.&nbsp; We will study this.&nbsp; And if, supposing as a result of the information, the less efficient models are weeded out of the market, then there is really no need for us to have a minimum energy performance standard.&nbsp; But we will keep an open option and we will study this as we go along, depending on how the market reacts. Ultimately, the behaviour is what is mentioned by Mdm Phua.&nbsp; We want the public to take a long-term view and buy products which are more energy-efficient and therefore more cost saving on their part.&nbsp; And suppliers will react to that and they will not bring in the less efficient products.&nbsp; So we will continue to monitor this and see whether there is a need for us to introduce minimum energy information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim also mentioned about renewable solar panels.&nbsp; As you know, there is a committee now under the National Research Foundation which is looking into that.&nbsp; There is no prohibition against people putting in solar panels for their water heaters.&nbsp; It is really left to the consumers.&nbsp; But over the longer term, we<p align=left>Column: 817<p> will wait for the NRF work on clean energy.&nbsp; If it is viable and it is something that can be done, we will certainly consider that and encourage the public to adopt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think I have addressed most of the concerns.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just like to appeal to the Minister that under energy labelling, although the efficiency tick is easily understandable,&nbsp;the consumption figure would also be relevant.&nbsp; It will give the consumers an informed choice as well.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Sir, allow me now to explain the proposed amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Consolidation of functions on nuclear issues</I></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent reports have pointed to the increased likelihood that countries in the region will develop nuclear power plants to boost their energy resources.&nbsp; There has also been a surge of activities under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) relating to nuclear safety and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of these developments, Singapore should rapidly build up its institutional and human resource capabilities with respect to nuclear safety, security and emergency response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Centre for Radiation Protection (CRP) under the HSA is the national regulatory authority for ensuring the safe use of ionising and non-ionising radiation in Singapore.&nbsp; The CRP administers and enforces the RPA and its subsidiary Regulations, which regulate irradiating apparatuses and radioactive materials through a system of licensing, notification, authorisation, inspection, and enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><p align=left>Column: 819<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the responsibilities for nuclear safety, security and emergency response are divided between HSA and NEA.&nbsp; To avoid duplication of resources as well as to enhance coordination in technical issues relating to radiation and nuclear science, the Ministry of Health (MOH) (which oversees HSA) and my Ministry will transfer the roles and functions of CRP, as well as the administration of the RPA, from HSA to NEA.&nbsp; The transfer of the CRP is targeted to take effect on 1st July 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is therefore required to give effect to the consolidation of functions, duties and powers from HSA to NEA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Impetus for ratification of the additional protocol</I></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill also prepares for Singapore to ratify the Additional Protocol (AP) of the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the IAEA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AP is a supplementary agreement that builds on the agreements that non-nuclear-weapon state parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have individually concluded with the IAEA.&nbsp; It was developed in 1997 to strengthen IAEA's ability to verify non-nuclear-weapon state parties' compliance with the NPT.&nbsp; Singapore ratified the NPT in March 1976 and signed the Additional Protocol with the IAEA in September 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Additional Protocol, a signatory state is obliged to provide IAEA with information covering the management, import and export, as well as storage of radioactive materials in the state.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.46 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to amend the Radiation Protection Act.&nbsp; I am pleased that the roles and the authority on this important area are now clearly defined and centralised to one&nbsp;agency.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The global political terrain is fraught&nbsp;with many challenges, and law-abiding civil societies may find themselves suddenly robbed of their peace and tranquility, and mayhem becomes the order of the day.&nbsp; The use of \"dirty bombs\" is an issue that we have to constantly keep at the back of our minds when we are handling radioactive materials, which can be easily exploited under the hands of&nbsp;fanatics and the misguided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centralising to a single agency in National Environment Agency (NEA) to handle radiation materials and manage the environmental concerns brought about by such will streamline all processes for control and licensing.&nbsp; Radioactive materials are used across a broad platform of industries and medical institutions, including some research facilities.&nbsp; There have been incidents in the US where radioactive materials from research facilities have been stolen.&nbsp; This can culminate in dire consequences, not the least of which is environmental contamination.&nbsp; We need to have stricter<p align=left>Column: 822<p> controls to ensure public safety is protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My key concern is:&nbsp; What is the relationship of this new agency, ie, NEA, with Health Sciences Authority?&nbsp; Will the Health Sciences Authority still play a role in providing advice on health issues?&nbsp; Can the agency deal effectively with the health issues concerned if there is no input from the medical experts from HSA?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need not look back very far to remind ourselves of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died within three weeks of being contaminated with alpha radiation from polonium-210, the most common isotope of the element polonium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also important if the Minister can share with the House how will the new amendment affect the current radiation control measures in medical institutions and research centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like&nbsp;to speak on nuclear energy in the broader context.&nbsp; Nuclear energy is certainly an attractive proposition, if only they are used for peaceful means.&nbsp; But the technology is like a knife, which&nbsp;can be used to save lives when it is in the hands of the surgeon, but it can maim and kill when it is in the clutches of a murderer.&nbsp; Likewise, there is no telling when and how the power of nuclear energy will be exploited for non-peaceful means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Australia's Prime Minister John Howard has spoken in favour of the International Energy Agency's report on how to meet the country's energy needs.&nbsp; The report had said that the country could build as many as 25 reactors by 2050 and these could supply up to a third of the nation's energy needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also deeply concerned about the nuclear safety issue, as our neighbouring countries, both Indonesia and Malaysia, are exploring to build nuclear power plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 823<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we need to gather sufficient knowledge and expertise in this field, especially if our neighbouring countries are taking that route.&nbsp; The incident of&nbsp;the radioactive contamination of the atmosphere at Chernobyl in Ukraine in April 1986 is a prime example of what can happen when nuclear energy is not properly controlled. &nbsp;In the case of the Chernobyl disaster, many people died, a large number of people required treatment for radiation, and the area had to be evacuated and vacated for a long period after.&nbsp; The combined loss in human and economic terms is not something to be taken lightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US was not spared either.&nbsp; There was the Three Mile Long Island Nuclear Generating Station incident which was caused by a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979.&nbsp; This happened when the core of a nuclear reactor ceased to be properly controlled and cooled due to the failure of control or safety systems.&nbsp; Fortunately, in this accident, there was no loss of lives but it required a massive evacuation of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are reminders of the severity of the impact that any nuclear catastrophe can cause within a wide radius of the accident area.&nbsp; What is sometimes overlooked is the need to have proper maintenance and prevention to ensure that any nuclear accident can be prevented and, if they occur, there are adequate measures to respond effectively and swiftly. &nbsp;This would involve a whole gamut of experts, from the field response team to the experts to treat exposure to radioactive contamination.&nbsp; Is NEA equipped to handle nuclear contamination?&nbsp; Is NEA seeking technical assistance from other countries which have the know-how to assist us?&nbsp; What is the role of NEA in a \"dirty bomb\" incident?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 824<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we may some day also be forced to look at nuclear alternative as the demand for energy rises, and so too the prices of fossil fuel.&nbsp; But, for now, for us, I believe we are&nbsp;better off exploiting biofuels as well as solar energy as alternative energy sources.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, Dr Lim has raised some questions of concern and I share his concern about building up local knowledge in terms of nuclear energy, as we have heard reports about countries in the region wanting to go the nuclear way.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that we will do our best and, to answer his last question first, as to whether or not we have the capacity, we are ramping up our capability as quickly as possible.&nbsp; For example, NEA is building up its capacity to carry out what we call \"terrain decontamination\" as a new function, something we have not done before but we need to know how to do this.&nbsp; In the event of an incident, of course, the Singapore Civil Defence will be the first to carry out their response to save lives and mitigate the impact.&nbsp; But once the area is secured and the situation is stabilised, NEA will then move in and carry out what we call \"terrain decontamination\" to restore the affected areas.&nbsp; It is this sort of new skill sets that we have to build up, in light of what Dr Lim has mentioned, and therefore we take this very seriously.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim has also asked about whether the existing controls on radioactive materials would be affected.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that the amendment will not affect the radiation protection and radioactive materials used in medical institutions and research facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he also asked the question as to whether or not the health <p align=left>Column: 825<p>aspects would continue to be addressed.&nbsp; I would like to inform him that MOH is still in charge in terms of this particular aspect of it, and we will continue to consult MOH and HSA on the health-related issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim also raised about the possibility of going nuclear.&nbsp; At the moment, I do not think so.&nbsp; But at the same time, it is important for us to build up knowledge on this area.&nbsp; While I agree with him that renewables are the way to go, we must keep all options on the table, in terms of understanding the environment around us and what are the things that we can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I agree with him, in terms of energy safety and security.&nbsp; But as I said earlier, this particular Act is to allow us to be ready to play our role, once we have agreed on the Additional Protocol.&nbsp; In fact, it will put Singapore in a better standing in the international community where we will continue to play our part, together with IAEA, to monitor the proliferation of radioactive materials in this region.&nbsp; So I would like to assure Dr Lim that, this being a new role, NEA will quickly ramp up its capabilities and we will continue to consult with the agencies.&nbsp; As to whether or not we will consult<p align=left>Column: 826<p> people beyond Singapore, a lot will depend upon the type of functions that we have to do.&nbsp; At the moment, since we are not going the nuclear way, there is no reason for us to consult in those areas of nuclear energy, etc.&nbsp; But, certainly, in terms of nuclear safety and understanding of the processes, we will build up that capability as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think I have addressed most of the issues.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp; [Assoc.

Since the launch in December 2006, the network coverage has expanded from 900 to approximately 2,800 hotspots.&nbsp; By September this year, Wireless@SG will provide 5,000 hotspots offering free 512 kbps Internet access in public areas throughout Singapore including Orchard Road, the Central Business District as well as in HDB town centres and community clubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 400,000 subscribers had signed up for Wireless@SG with the three operators although only 82,716 (or 23%) of these are active users.&nbsp; To promote usage, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, or IDA, will be embarking on a Wireless@SG Education and Awareness Programme to help users make better use of wireless broadband via their existing WiFi devices.&nbsp; As the network deployment continues to gather pace, we can expect the number of active users to increase.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>Bugbears faced in deployment</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On bugbears, IDA has been working with the three operators as well as other relevant stakeholders, to ensure a smooth roll-out.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there have been a few glitches, but this is to be expected in a deployment of such scale.&nbsp; IDA and the operators are ironing out these glitches as they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One issue relates to site access.&nbsp; Some building owners have been reluctant to grant the operators access to, or use of building facilities and facades as they are concerned about the security, safety, business and aesthetical concerns of installing transmitters and receivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue has to do with rental costs.&nbsp; Some commercial property owners have demanded rents from Wireless@SG operators that are similar to the rents levied on mobile cellular operators for the use of the building fa&ccedil;ade and other facilities to mount their equipment. &nbsp;Such rents drive up network deployment costs for the Wireless@SG<p align=left>Column: 829<p> operators.&nbsp; These issues may result in spotty coverage, reducing the pervasiveness of Wireless@SG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, we do not think that these issues are insurmountable.&nbsp; Where appropriate, IDA has been working with the operators to engage commercial building owners on the benefits of offering Wireless@SG to their customers.&nbsp; As usage becomes more and more pervasive, it would make good business sense for commercial building owners to have their buildings covered by Wireless@SG.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take shopping centres, for example.&nbsp; As they depend on customer traffic, such building owners may find it&nbsp; advantageous to leverage on&nbsp; Wireless@SG services to draw in new customers who are mobile and Internet-savvy, as well as retain their existing customers. IDA will also continue to work with Wireless@SG operators to offer compelling service offerings that would be of benefit to both businesses and consumers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Future expansion plans</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With rapid advancements in wireless technology, it is clear that Wireless@SG will continue to evolve.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that IDA continues to monitor the wireless broadband technologies and standards closely.&nbsp; In particular, IDA is looking at different emerging high-speed technologies, such as WiMAX and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), as well as the availability of end user devices that could capitalise on these networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our plans for future expansion programme will be guided by the same principles that underpin the Wireless@SG initiative, which is to achieve greater pervasiveness, higher speed, better quality, and affordable wireless broadband access to support mobility.&nbsp; We will also be guided by the experiences that we have gained from this first phase of the initiative.&nbsp; IDA will begin planning for Phase 2 of Wireless@SG from 2008, when the direction for emerging next-generation wireless broadband technologies is clearer.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 829<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This generated public interest in HDB's Joint Singles Scheme, where HDB requires a single to pair up with another single before they could rent a one room flat from HDB.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB's rental flats are heavily subsidised; they are meant primarily for low income citizen families who do not have other housing options.&nbsp; However, low income singles who need subsidised rental housing may apply to share a rental flat with another single under the Joint Singles Scheme, if both are 35 or older.&nbsp; For singles who are unable to pair <p align=left>Column: 831<p>up with their relatives or friends, HDB assists by making available a list of single persons who are also searching for flatmates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat-sharing arrangement allows our limited rental flats to help as many needy singles as possible.&nbsp; Currently, there are 7,200 rental flats that are shared by two flatmates under the Joint Singles Scheme(1).&nbsp; In addition, flat-sharing facilitates mutual care and support, which is especially important for the elderly singles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can HDB reduce conflicts between flatmates?&nbsp; HDB will facilitate replacement of flatmates if they are unable to get along. &nbsp;After one party moves out, HDB allows the remaining tenant a grace period of six months or more to find a replacement flatmate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, MND will embark on a review with MCYS to study the appropriate housing for the poor elderly, taking into consideration not just their physical but also their social and emotional needs.&nbsp; But I would like to stress that the family must continue to play a key part in supporting the elderly.&nbsp; Heavily subsidised rental housing should only be for those who do not have family support nor the financial means to help themselves.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When the ASEAN Transport Ministers met in January this year, it was agreed that our officials should step up consultations and target for the agreement to be signed by year-end, in time for the implementation of the roadmap's first major milestone of December 2008.&nbsp;

Where the injury is more serious, the Ministry will make an assessment of the compensation amount, which is based on the permanent incapacity suffered by the worker. &nbsp;This takes on average about five months, including the time for the injury to sufficiently stabilise and for a medical practitioner to determine the extent of the permanent incapacity.&nbsp; This is an improvement from the seven months in 2005.&nbsp; The shorter time is a result of more efficient processes implemented by MOM, including closer collaboration with the hospitals for the timely submission of the medical reports.&nbsp;

To address problem gambling, the Government had announced a national framework which included the setting up of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).&nbsp; Since its formation in August 2005, the Council has worked with MCYS to develop a three-tier framework to address problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first tier involves training workers in the community and social service sector to identify individuals or families facing problem gambling issues and motivate them to seek specialised help.&nbsp; So far, a total of 192 staff from over 100 social sector agencies, including the various Family Service Centres and CDCs, have undergone this training.&nbsp; Further rounds of training have been planned for the rest of 2007.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second tier of help is provided by specialised community-based centres operated by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society and Care Corner Counselling Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two social services agencies were appointed by NCPG and MCYS in September 2006 to pilot intervention services for pathological/problem gamblers (PPGs) and their families at the community level.&nbsp; This involves counselling for gamblers with moderate problems who do not require medical treatment services at the Community Addictions Management Programme (CAMP), organising support groups for PPGs and their families, as well as linking them up with other social services where necessary.&nbsp; From September 2006 to February 2007, the two pilot centres saw a total of 102 cases of problem gamblers, or affected family members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the third tier, CAMP at the Institute of Mental Health provides medical treatment to persons with multiple addictions and psychiatric issues.&nbsp; CAMP saw 66 new cases in 2006 and 10 new cases from 1st January to 31st March 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG also emphasises preventive education measures.&nbsp; The Council aims to raise awareness of problem gambling through the mass media as well as through ground-up initiatives by community groups that bring messages on problem gambling to the<p align=left>Column: 839<p> heartlands.&nbsp; The Council is also working with youth and social service groups to raise awareness of students and youths about problem gambling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Honourable MP has also asked if problem gamblers are victims of unlicensed moneylenders, or as they are more commonly known, loan sharks.&nbsp; The 2005 MCYS study cited earlier found that 1.4% of all respondents had borrowed from loan sharks.&nbsp; Of these, 79% admitted to having borrowed from loan sharks to pay off gambling debts.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence provided by Police and Prisons of arrested loan sharks also suggests that a substantial proportion of those who borrowed from loan sharks were gamblers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 23rd January this year, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs, in answer to a question from the Honourable Mr Wee Siew Kim informed the House that the Police has in place a comprehensive range of measures against unlicensed moneylenders.&nbsp; The key ones include enhanced penalties in the Moneylenders Act, confiscation of assets of unlicensed moneylending syndicates, use of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act against syndicate members whenever necessary, and the formation of a dedicated Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Taskforce in the Criminal Investigations Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, the NCPG and MCYS will continue to work with its partners to build capability in social services to address gambling addiction.&nbsp; NCPG will also continue its preventive and public education work to raise awareness of problem gambling.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 839<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Following the discovery of the remains of the Fort, on-site studies were conducted to ascertain the full extent of the underground Fort.&nbsp; The studies have since shown that part of the old Fort is located outside the Katong Park boundary and extends into State Land that is currently zoned for Residential use.&nbsp; A Working Committee has therefore been set up involving NParks, URA and PMB to assess the options that will best meet the needs of long-term protection and development of the site.&nbsp; This assessment will need to take into consideration not only the historical significance of the site, but also the status of the affected State Land and the overall planning for Katong Park. &nbsp;In the interim, as per standard archaeological practice, the partially exposed structures on the site have been covered up to protect it from damage by the elements or human interference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 841<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and drainage sanitary/sewerage system requirements by the Public Utilities Board.&nbsp; Such statutory requirements also apply directly to owners of properties that are let out for occupation by foreign workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The existing types of foreign worker housing include purpose-built dormitories and approved factory-converted dormitories.&nbsp; Foreign construction workers can, in addition, stay in workers quarters within construction sites and other approved plots of land.&nbsp; Other than non-traditional source workers in the construction industry, foreign workers can also stay in HDB flats or private residential units subject to prevailing guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guidelines include limits on the number of occupiers per unit, to prevent overcrowding and preserve the residential character of the premises and surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As announced during the Ministry's Committee of Supply Debate, MOM intends to require employers to show that they are able to house their foreign workers in acceptable accommodations, before approving their applications for the foreign workers' work permits.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 855<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (b) what are the measures that have been adopted to give effect to Singapore's international obligations under the International Labour Organisation Convention 100 on equal remuneration.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attached table provides the 2006 wage data for men and women in various age groups.&nbsp; In 2006, the median gross monthly income(3) for full-time employed female residents was 86% that of males.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a pattern is not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; Countries like Norway (85%), Denmark (82%), the United States (76%), Japan (65%) and Canada (64%) also experience a wage disparity between male and female workers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This disparity reflects remuneration based on factors such as experience, skills and qualifications, and not necessarily gender discrimination. In fact, for Singapore, at the start of their careers, within the age group 25 to 29, females actually earned more than males in three major occupational groups, namely, managers (6.4% more), professionals (2.5% more), and sales and service workers (27% more)(4).&nbsp; After this, however, more women tend to leave the workforce earlier or disrupt their careers for family and other reasons.&nbsp; This affects their length of working experience which can account for the lower salaries for females compared to their male peer cohorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these women choose to return to the workforce in response to a healthy labour market, we may well see the wage gap widen compared to male workers who have been in the workforce for longer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore ratified the ILO Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration in May 2002.&nbsp; The Convention requires ratifying states to ensure the application of the principle of equal remuneration to all workers by means of either a) national laws or regulations; b) legally established or recognised machinery for wage determination; c) collective agreements between employers and workers; or d) a combination of these various means.&nbsp; In Singapore, after consultation with tripartite partners, we have adopted the approach of fulfilling our obligations under this Convention through collective agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We issued a Tripartite Declaration in 2002 to reiterate and uphold the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value and the tripartite partners drafted a precedent clause which affirmed this principle. MOM is working closely with the Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC) and our tripartite partners SNEF and NTUC, to encourage companies and unions to implement the principle of equal remuneration by incorporating this clause in their collective agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of equal remuneration is also recognised as a key component of fair employment practices by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). &nbsp;It has also been incorporated in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices which was issued by TAFEP on 3rd May 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 857<p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B><u>Table: Median Gross Monthly Income of Full-Time Employed Female Residents as a Percentage of Full-Time Employed Male Residents, June 2006</u></B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B><u>(Exclude NSmen and Contributing Family Workers)</u></B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: medium none;

The length of stay, and hence period of work pass validity, for P, Q and S pass holders is largely determined by their employers.&nbsp; There is no stipulated maximum employment period.&nbsp; In contrast, there is a cap on the period that R pass holders can work in Singapore.&nbsp;

In the first year of its operations, the Budget Terminal handled about 1.36 million passengers.&nbsp; It is now handling about 130,000 passengers a month, utilising approximately 60% of its annual handling capacity of 2.7 million passengers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are two carriers operating at the Budget Terminal, namely, Tiger Airways and Cebu Pacific Air.&nbsp; The other Low Cost Carriers, like Jetstar Asia and Thai Air Asia, operate from Terminal One.&nbsp; The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore is constantly speaking with prospective carriers to use the Budget Terminal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low Cost Carriers currently account for about 15% of total passenger flights at Changi Airport.&nbsp; Passenger traffic by Low Cost Carriers at Changi grew by 47% in 2006.&nbsp; We anticipate traffic in this market segment to carry on growing strongly, in view of the robust demand for budget travel in the region and further liberalisation of market access among ASEAN countries.&nbsp; Hence, we can expect continued strong traffic growth at the Budget Terminal in the coming years.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;
