access  to  all\r\n\r\nresidents  in  light of our ageing population,  will  his\r\n\r\nMinistry consider (a) extending the Programme to all  HDB\r\n\r\nblocks  without  the  need to  vote;  (b)  if  voting  is\r\n\r\ninsisted  upon,  setting it at a simple  majority  rather\r\n\r\nthan  the current \"YES\" vote of 75%; and (c) if  the  75%\r\n\r\n\"YES\"  vote  is insisted upon, conducting  a  re-poll  of\r\n\r\nthose  blocks  with lower than 75% as this may  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reached not because of \"NO\" votes but because  some\r\n\r\nresidents have not voted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Lift Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  (LUP) was introduced in 2001 to provide  flats\r\n\r\nin  high-rise  HDB blocks built before 1990  with  direct\r\n\r\naccess  to  a  lift,  as long as it  is  technically  and\r\n\r\neconomically feasible.  It was implemented in response to\r\n\r\nrequests from Members of Parliament for more and  earlier\r\n\r\nlift  upgrading  works to provide greater convenience  to\r\n\r\nthe residents, especially the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lift upgrading is very costly and heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised by the Government, one of the requirements  is\r\n\r\nthat  all benefitting residents must vote and co-pay  for\r\n\r\nthe programme.  This is to give HDB residents a sense  of\r\n\r\nownership  of  the programme and ensure  that  those  who\r\n\r\nstand  to  benefit consider carefully  the  need  or  the\r\n\r\ndesirability for the upgrading works in their block.  The\r\n\r\nsame  principles have been successfully  applied  to  the\r\n\r\nMain Upgrading Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the Government has a clear\r\n\r\nmandate from those who benefit and have to co-pay  before\r\n\r\nproceeding  with the upgrading works.  Under the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Act, the legal requirement is to have  at\r\n\r\nleast  75% of those who are eligible to vote to agree  to\r\n\r\nthe  lift upgrading works before they can be carried out.\r\n\r\nThis  is clearly indicated in the LUP brochures given  to\r\n\r\neligible  households.  As every single vote is important,\r\n\r\nall eligible HDB residents are encouraged to come forward\r\n\r\nto  vote  during the LUP polling.

Would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider lowering this requirement because,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, what we want is 100% lift access for\r\n\r\nour population which is ageing?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, there are actually two\r\n\r\npoints.   Let  us  deal with the first point  about  100%\r\n\r\nbarrier-free access.  In my earlier reply, I said that we\r\n\r\nwould  aim  to  provide convenient  access  where  it  is\r\n\r\ntechnically and economically feasible.  I do not  believe\r\n\r\nit  is  tenable to aim for 100% access at all  costs  and\r\n\r\ndisregarding  the  technical  aspects  and   indeed   the\r\n\r\npreferences  of  the residents in any  particular  block.\r\n\r\nYou  must understand that HDB blocks have been built with\r\n\r\na  variety of housing forms.  Not all blocks are standard\r\n\r\nblocks  with  common corridors.  There  are  blocks  with\r\n\r\nstaggered configurations, in which at the time they  were\r\n\r\nbuilt the priority was given to privacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a simple exercise of saying that there\r\n\r\nwill be 100% access for everybody at all costs regardless\r\n\r\nof the preferences.  There are still residents in some of\r\n\r\nthese  blocks  who prefer not to have a new  lift  shaft.\r\n\r\nSome  of them claim that it obstructs their view and some\r\n\r\nof  them do not feel that it is an essential item.  It is\r\n\r\na convenience and not something which they are willing to\r\n\r\npay that amount for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next figure, which is the second point, is the\r\n\r\n75%  level.   I think we can argue whether it  should  be\r\n\r\n51%,  65%, 75%, 90% or 100%.  But the point is that  once\r\n\r\nParliament has passed a law, in effect, setting a certain\r\n\r\nthreshold,  then that threshold has to be respected.   If\r\n\r\nyou  say that we should make it 74.5%, then you set a new\r\n\r\nthreshold.   But  once that new threshold  is  set,  that\r\n\r\nthreshold has to be implemented and implemented  exactly,\r\n\r\nfairly and transparently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I empathise with the residents in the block\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But there are clear legal principles involved\r\n\r\nhere which I think should be best adhered to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, as I see it, LUP and MUP are\r\n\r\nquite different.  Under MUP, we add in extra rooms,  etc,\r\n\r\nso  as to enhance the value of the flat.  But under  LUP,\r\n\r\nfor  those  blocks  of  flats which are  technically  and\r\n\r\neconomically feasible, should not MND consider looking at\r\n\r\nthe  policy to see whether there is a need to set a \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nvote  at  75%,  because the objective  of  LUP  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from MUP?  The objective of LUP is to  improve\r\n\r\naccessibility.   So  for  blocks  of  flats   which   are\r\n\r\ntechnically  and economically feasible,  maybe  a  simple\r\n\r\nmajority would be good enough for LUP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in both\r\n\r\nMUP and LUP, we have set a 75% threshold.  So there is no\r\n\r\ndifference  in that respect.  I think it is important  to\r\n\r\nunderstand why we have set a 75% threshold.  Once a  poll\r\n\r\nis  conducted  successfully, even those who  are  not  in\r\n\r\nfavour of upgrading, whether it is MUP or LUP, will  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  for  it.   This is not a trivial  exercise.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  there  should  be  polling  so  that  this\r\n\r\nreflects  the desire of the vast majority and  they  will\r\n\r\nthen  have  a  sense  of ownership and  a  stake  in  the\r\n\r\ndecisions which are being made by the community.  I think\r\n\r\nthis is the correct direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, you want to ensure that that\r\n\r\nmajority   is   a  significant  majority  because   their\r\n\r\ndecisions  will have a financial impact on  the  minority\r\n\r\nwho  may  not  be  in  favour of  upgrading.   For  those\r\n\r\nreasons, I think it is safe and reasonable to set it at a\r\n\r\nsignificantly  high  level and 75%,  as  far  as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, is the right level at this point in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LABOUR SUPPLIERS OF FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Deployment)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  (a)  whether  labour suppliers  who  have  been\r\n\r\npermitted to bring in foreign workers for one job can  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to deploy them for another; (b) if  deployment\r\n\r\nis  not  permitted,  how  many  such  breaches  have  his\r\n\r\nMinistry dealt with in the past three years; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(c)  are  there  plans  to  step up  enforcement  actions\r\n\r\nagainst such breaches.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, work permits are issued to foreign  workers\r\n\r\nto  work  for  the  employers stated in the  application.\r\n\r\nEmployers  of  work  permit holders are  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeploy   their  foreign  workers  to  work  for   another\r\n\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who breach this work permit condition will\r\n\r\nbe  prosecuted  under the Employment of  Foreign  Workers\r\n\r\nAct.

However, some employers  have\r\n\r\nresorted  to housing their foreign workers in overcrowded\r\n\r\nand   unsafe   living   conditions.    The   problem   is\r\n\r\nparticularly pronounced in the construction sector  which\r\n\r\nis also the largest employer of non-traditional source of\r\n\r\nforeign workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arrest this problem, the Government has announced\r\n\r\nin  June  this  year that construction companies  housing\r\n\r\ntheir  foreign workers off-site would have to house  them\r\n\r\nin  approved and purpose-built dormitories.   From  2004,\r\n\r\nthis  will  be  spelt out as a work permit condition.

And to\r\n\r\nmake  up  part of the loss in revenue, we have  to  raise\r\n\r\nindirect taxes; in other words, the GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut corporate and top personal income tax\r\n\r\nrates to 22% for the Year of Assessment 2003, and we will\r\n\r\nlower  them  further to 20% within three years.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we announced that we would raise the GST rate\r\n\r\nfrom 3% to 5% on 1st January 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Singaporeans adjust to the higher GST, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  implemented a comprehensive  offset  package.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  the Economic Restructuring Shares  (ERS),\r\n\r\nrebates  on  rental  and  service &  conservancy  charges\r\n\r\n(S&CC), plus full absorption by the Government of GST for\r\n\r\nsubsidised  healthcare and state  education  charges.

And  you\r\n\r\ncan  see that the offset package costs $4.1 billion,  and\r\n\r\nis  enough  to offset the additional tax that nearly  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to pay for at least five years and,  in\r\n\r\nmany cases, 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021205/20021205-HA-0751987.htm\">Annex - GST Offset Package</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Budget Statement, expectations\r\n\r\nwere that the US economy would pick up this year, and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy would also complete its recovery  from\r\n\r\nthe  sharp downturn in 2001.  As events have turned  out,\r\n\r\nboth  the  US and the Singapore economies have done  less\r\n\r\nwell  than expected.  The US economic recovery  has  been\r\n\r\nweak  and  below  expectations, even though  the  US  has\r\n\r\navoided  entering a second recession.  As Alan  Greenspan\r\n\r\nrecently said, the US economy was \"going through  a  soft\r\n\r\nspot\".   Likewise, the Singapore economy is now projected\r\n\r\nto  grow  only by 2-2.5% for 2002 as a whole, at the  low\r\n\r\nend of the 2-4% that we had projected in May.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, prospects for 2003 are still\r\n\r\nuncertain.   The  risks are not only economic,  but  also\r\n\r\nsecurity  and political, eg, the impact of another  major\r\n\r\nterrorist attack, or of a war in Iraq.  The EU and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese  economies are slowing down.  In  the  US,  most\r\n\r\nanalysts  expect a gradual recovery, supported by  steady\r\n\r\ngrowth in consumer spending and a more substantial  pick-up  in  corporate investment in the second half of  2003.\r\n\r\nIn  recent  weeks, US economic indicators have  improved,\r\n\r\nand  the mood has become more optimistic.  However,  some\r\n\r\nrespected  analysts still worry that  the  US  could  yet\r\n\r\nexperience a second recession next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been affected not only by the slow US\r\n\r\nrecovery,  but  also by the problems in  Southeast  Asia,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  terrorist  attack  in  Bali.   Hence  the\r\n\r\ndownward  revision of this year's growth estimate  to  2-2.5%.   However, early indications are that we will enjoy\r\n\r\npositive growth in the fourth quarter. Our exports to key\r\n\r\nmarkets  are  growing, albeit slowly.   Non-oil  domestic\r\n\r\nexports  rose by 6% in October, and improved  further  in\r\n\r\nNovember, according to preliminary estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector has also continued to grow.\r\n\r\nOutput  rose  by 12% in October, similar to  the  11%  in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  driven  by  an increase  in  semi-conductors,\r\n\r\npetrochemicals  and pharmaceuticals.  On a month-on-month\r\n\r\nbasis, manufacturing output increased by 1.3%, the  first\r\n\r\nincrease since May 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2003, MTI has forecast growth of 2-5%, although\r\n\r\nwe cannot yet be certain how things will turn out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a fiscal point of view, the tax changes\r\n\r\nannounced  in  May  remain appropriate despite  the  less\r\n\r\nvibrant  economic conditions today.  We should  not  hold\r\n\r\nback  on  our  restructuring on account  of  the  adverse\r\n\r\nclimate; indeed, this makes it even more important for us\r\n\r\nto  press  on  and  strengthen  our  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nresilience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To individuals, because of the ERS and other\r\n\r\nrebates,  the GST increase should not cause  hardship  to\r\n\r\nany  Singaporean, or result in consumers cutting back  on\r\n\r\nspending.   To the Government, the combination of  direct\r\n\r\ntax cuts to 22% and a GST\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  to 5% plus the first tranche of the ERS  shares\r\n\r\ntogether result in a revenue loss of $1.2 billion in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  year (2003). Therefore, the overall effect of  the\r\n\r\ntax  changes  and offsets on the economy is expansionary,\r\n\r\nrather than contractionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested that the Government should defer\r\n\r\nthe GST increase completely for 12 months or longer.  But\r\n\r\nthis   approach   risks  leaving  the   Government   with\r\n\r\ninsufficient  funds  for  urgent  needs,  especially   in\r\n\r\neducation, healthcare and defence.  And if later we  have\r\n\r\nto  defer the increase again, the Government may wind  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  structural  deficit, which  would  have  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences  for the exchange rate, for  inflation,  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  value  of Singaporeans' CPF  savings.   I  have\r\n\r\ntherefore decided against deferring the GST increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am also mindful of the current mood of\r\n\r\napprehension and uncertainty among Singaporeans,  because\r\n\r\nof  the  economic  troubles this year  and  the  security\r\n\r\nconcerns in the region.  MTI's recent downgrading of this\r\n\r\nyear's  growth estimate, and the NWC's recommendation  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  wage  freeze for another  six  months,  also\r\n\r\ncontribute to the sense that things are not yet  back  to\r\n\r\nnormal.  We do not want to add to the burdens and worries\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans at a difficult time.  The  psychological\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the  GST increase could result  in  consumers\r\n\r\ncutting  back  on  spending  and  business  putting   off\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty over economic prospects for next\r\n\r\nyear, as to whether and how soon the US and the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomies will recover, reinforces the need for  caution.\r\n\r\nAlthough,  on balance, another downturn does  not  appear\r\n\r\nlikely, the possibility of one occurring still cannot  be\r\n\r\nruled out and it would be prudent to be cautious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to phase in the increase of\r\n\r\nthe  GST  rate, and implement it in two steps instead  of\r\n\r\none.   The  GST rate will go up from 3% to  4%  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2003, and then from 4% to 5%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a phased introduction will have more\r\n\r\nimpact than proceeding with the full tax increase  to  5%\r\n\r\nand  enhancing the offset package. Many Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nnot  made the link between the benefits they will receive\r\n\r\nfrom  the offsets, and the additional GST they will  have\r\n\r\nto pay.  Phasing in the tax increase is a more direct and\r\n\r\neasily understood signal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the phased introduction of the GST, I have\r\n\r\ndecided   to   maintain  unchanged  the  offset   package\r\n\r\nannounced  in  Budget 2002.  I am happy to announce  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will receive the original amount of Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring  Shares  in  January  2003,  and  the  same\r\n\r\nschedule of rental and S&CC rebates as announced earlier.\r\n\r\nI  have  also  decided that the increase  in  the  Public\r\n\r\nAssistance  rates  and the Singapore  Allowance  paid  to\r\n\r\nGovernment pensioners will proceed in January 2003 by the\r\n\r\nfull  amounts  originally planned. The  details  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced next week.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower GST increase will cost the Government $163\r\n\r\nmillion   in   FY2002   and  $488  million   in   FY2003.\r\n\r\nEffectively, the Government will be putting an additional\r\n\r\n$650  million  into  the  hands of  Singaporeans.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the Government is not likely to have any  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  in  FY2003.  At best, we will be  able  just  to\r\n\r\nbalance the budget. All Ministries will have to economise\r\n\r\non spending and trim back on non-essential programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the phasing in of the GST will lessen the\r\n\r\nburden  on  Singaporeans, and help  them  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties that we are now facing.  This change  is  a\r\n\r\nfine-tuning to the original tax restructuring plans.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is making a tactical course correction  while\r\n\r\nstill  heading  for  the  same  destination.   We  remain\r\n\r\ncommitted  to bringing down top direct tax rates  to  20%\r\n\r\nwithin  three  years,  and  to offer  a  more  attractive\r\n\r\nbusiness  environment to bring talent and investments  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am now submitting an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe GST (Amendment) Bill, to provide for the GST rate  to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised in two steps, from 3% to 4% from 1st January  2003\r\n\r\nand  from 4% to 5% from 1st January 2004.  I will ask the\r\n\r\nHouse to consider the amendment in the Committee Stage of\r\n\r\nthe Bill later this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  very pleased to hear from the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance that he has decided  to\r\n\r\nphase-in the increase in GST from 3% to 4%, and after one\r\n\r\nyear,  from  4% to 5%.  I believe this decision  will  be\r\n\r\nwell  received by the people and this House.   Even  with\r\n\r\nthis  phased-in approach of a 1% increase, may I ask  the\r\n\r\nDPM whether it would still have a dampening effect on the\r\n\r\neconomy,  in view of the fact that the economic prospects\r\n\r\nare  currently uncertain.  I am very concerned whether  a\r\n\r\nGST increase would have a further dampening effect on the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is with regard to the point made\r\n\r\nby  DPM  that  there  will  be deficit  budgets  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  two  years.  I think that was  what  he  said.\r\n\r\nWould  it also impact the Government's coffers,  and  how\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Government  intend to deal  with  the  deficit\r\n\r\nbudget?  Is it going to come from the national reserves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask a question that I asked\r\n\r\npreviously  in  this House, whether the Government  would\r\n\r\nconsider  reintroducing  the  Economic  Downturn   Relief\r\n\r\nScheme  that  had  been stopped at the end  of  November.\r\n\r\nThis   scheme  is  useful  because  with  the  continuing\r\n\r\neconomic   downturn,   more   people   will   be   facing\r\n\r\nunemployment.  With the scheme re-introduced, there would\r\n\r\nbe some form of relief for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee asked whether this 1% increase in GST will still be a\r\n\r\ndampener.   I do not believe so because, if you  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  sums,  it  is quite clear that, in  fact,  far  from\r\n\r\ndampening  the  economy,  we are  administering  a  major\r\n\r\nstimulus to the economy.  First of all, the reduction  in\r\n\r\npersonal and corporate income taxes is going to pump $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion into the economy.  This will be offset by the GST\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease, which will now only raise $650 million.  On the\r\n\r\nother hand, we are going to put into the economy, through\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Restructuring Shares on 1st January  2003,\r\n\r\nabout $1.2 billion.  So, actually on a net effect, if you\r\n\r\nadd  up these sums, we are putting $1.8-1.9 billion  into\r\n\r\nthe  economy next year.  Far from dampening the  economy,\r\n\r\nthe   overall   impact   is   highly   expansionary   and\r\n\r\nstimulative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we have a deficit, how would it be\r\n\r\nfunded?   I  think,  best of all, it is  not  to  have  a\r\n\r\ndeficit,  then we do not have to worry about funding  it.\r\n\r\nI  did  not say that we would have a deficit.  I said  we\r\n\r\nare not likely to have a budget surplus and, at best,  we\r\n\r\nwould be able to just balance the budget, and we will try\r\n\r\nhard to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, should we re-introduce the EDRS? The EDRS\r\n\r\nwas   introduced  last  year  as  a  one-year   programme\r\n\r\nspecifically  to  deal  with  the  very  sharp   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   People were out of work.  They  needed  help.\r\n\r\nIt  was  something of an emergency.  We had a package  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  that.   As Members know, over  the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths,   applications  to  the  EDRS  have  tailed   off\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   I  think  the  most  urgent  cases  have\r\n\r\nalready  been seen to, and people have other  sources  of\r\n\r\nassistance  available to them - from the CCCs,  CDCs  and\r\n\r\nwelfare organisations.  So the EDRS demand has tailed off\r\n\r\nand  we  decided,  at the end of the  one-year,  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  let it lapse.  Because if we do not let emergency\r\n\r\nprogrammes lapse, when emergencies pass, the next time we\r\n\r\nhave   an  emergency,  we  have  to  pile  on  additional\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and  eventually end up with  more  and  more\r\n\r\nitems meant to deal with previous problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the position stands now, we are not in a\r\n\r\nrecession.  Our economy is growing.  It has been  growing\r\n\r\nin  the second quarter and third quarter.  I think it  is\r\n\r\ngrowing  in  the  fourth quarter, and  people  are  being\r\n\r\nlooked  after.   Going  forward,  we  will  monitor   the\r\n\r\nsituation.   If  we have another sharp downturn,  another\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis, we will look at the need for  an  EDRS.\r\n\r\nBut, as of now, I do not believe that we need one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nI  think  the new announcement would be most welcomed  by\r\n\r\nthe people and the business sector, and I believe this is\r\n\r\na  very clear and unmistakable signal that the Government\r\n\r\nis  hearing  the voice of the people, and addressing  the\r\n\r\npeople's concern.  Not only is the phasing in of GST,  it\r\n\r\nis  also having the offset package remaining.  I think it\r\n\r\nis  a double blessing, and I believe it will boost public\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  market confidence as  well.   We  should\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Government for making such a  bold  move\r\n\r\nand  I  would ask whether the Deputy Prime Minister would\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  monitor  the  situation  and  adjust,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  with  other measures  to  move  the  business\r\n\r\nsector, and have more money in circulation in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to track the state of the economy very closely.\r\n\r\nThis is a time of considerable uncertainty.  It does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that all the signals are black.  Two or three weeks\r\n\r\nago,  I  think, the mood was significantly gloomier,  but\r\n\r\nlooking  at  what  has been coming  out,  the  data,  the\r\n\r\nindicators  from  America, there has been  a  significant\r\n\r\npick  up  in performance and in sentiments, and similarly\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  from  our own indicators.   How  it  goes\r\n\r\nforward  next year it is very difficult to say.  Normally\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Ministry  of  Trade and  Industry  puts  up  a\r\n\r\nforecast for next year they plus or minus 1% and you more\r\n\r\nor less know where it will arrive.  This year, they set 2-5%,  which means it is really a very wide uncertainty and\r\n\r\nit  is  an  educated guess of how things will  turn  out,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  just does not depend on the economic  trend,\r\n\r\nbut   also   on  the  security  situation  and  political\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   So  we  will keep  on  tracking  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  very closely, and if there is a need  to  make\r\n\r\nfurther adjustments, you can be sure that we will not  be\r\n\r\nslow in noticing it and doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  first allow me to applaud the Government's decision\r\n\r\nto  stagger  the GST increase.  In fact,  the  views  and\r\n\r\nconcerns  of workers have been adequately addressed.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, I am also glad that the ERS shares will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaid  accordingly as announced earlier.  But I  have  one\r\n\r\nother request, which is that the Government will consider\r\n\r\nand monitor the economic conditions.  And, if there is  a\r\n\r\nneed,  make a further review whether there is a  need  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  GST further to 5% in 2004, but definitely  the\r\n\r\neconomic  condition in 2003 has to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nI  am  also glad that the workers' views and points  have\r\n\r\nbeen carefully considered by the Government and I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  they have been put aside by the Government.   They\r\n\r\nare  very  happy and I wish to thank, on  behalf  of  all\r\n\r\nworkers, the Government's decision and to bring  about  a\r\n\r\nrelief to workers during these difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah  Nandan for his full support for this move.  Next\r\n\r\nyear  is 12 months from now, but we have to plan  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  that we are going to proceed with the second phase\r\n\r\nof  the  increase  because next year the  increase  would\r\n\r\nalready  be  twelve months late.  But  I  understand  his\r\n\r\nconcerns.  We will track what is happening in the economy\r\n\r\nnext  year,  very closely, and if need be, we  will  make\r\n\r\nmany adjustments to the economy to keep it on track.  But\r\n\r\nthe GST programme, we have made rephasing, and we have to\r\n\r\nbe  very  careful that the rephasing does not  become  an\r\n\r\nindefinite postponement, which would cause us  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst  I would like to congratulate Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nLee  for having taken this approach.  In fact, there  was\r\n\r\nsome betting going on that, knowing the character of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it  would be quite out of question  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  actually  consider  any  relent  of   the\r\n\r\ndecision  already  taken.  But the very  fact  that  this\r\n\r\nphase-in  had come in, I think that for some  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  gone on to this bet, some are going to win and some\r\n\r\nare  going to lose.  The phase-in only demonstrates  that\r\n\r\nwe  are really remaking Singapore and that we are mindful\r\n\r\nthat  the audience is a very different audience, and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is actually putting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe ears to the ground to really respond to the needs and\r\n\r\ncalls of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am very happy to note that the\r\n\r\nfull  package of the enhancement will be implemented with\r\n\r\neffect  from  2003.   But if the economy  does  not  turn\r\n\r\naround for the better, say, in 2004 and the other 1%  has\r\n\r\nto  be  phased  in,  and  there  are  cries  for  another\r\n\r\nenhancement package to offset the additional increase  of\r\n\r\n1%, would the Government consider the request?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,\r\n\r\nI would not advise anybody to bet against the Government.\r\n\r\nSecondly, on the hypothetical question, we will  have  to\r\n\r\nwait  and  see.  We are not magicians who  can  show  you\r\n\r\nempty  pockets and put our hands in it and  produce  more\r\n\r\nmoney, but we will have to wait and see what the state of\r\n\r\nthe   economy  is  next  year.   As  always,  making   an\r\n\r\nadjustment to the GST increase would be our last  choice.\r\n\r\nWe  will  try  to  do many other things first  before  we\r\n\r\nconsider that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I just have two questions in  relation  to\r\n\r\nthis  revised package.  There was a story in  the  papers\r\n\r\nabout  the  VWOs  and  how GST is imposed  on  the  funds\r\n\r\nraised.   I  would  like  to know how,  since  1999,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment grant has stopped to offset such GST hikes  on\r\n\r\nthe  donations  raised  by the  VWOs.   In  this  current\r\n\r\nclimate when I think the charity dollar is stretched even\r\n\r\nmore,  how can the VWOs be helped where GST is concerned?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  is it possible, perhaps in the year  2004,  to\r\n\r\nconsider  splitting the GST into taxes on essentials  and\r\n\r\nnon-essentials, similar to what is practised in  Britain?\r\n\r\nI  am also looking at the offset package grant to CCCs  - $15 million spread over five years, which means about  $3\r\n\r\nmillion - for quite a number of people.  There is already\r\n\r\na  lot  of generosity, but I still wonder whether in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent climate it is perhaps still not too sufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nVWOs  is  a separate issue.  The transitional arrangement\r\n\r\nwas made for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  when  we  first introduced GST and this  transition\r\n\r\narrangement  is phasing out.  If we need  to  assist  the\r\n\r\nVWOs  it  is  best  for us to assist them  directly  with\r\n\r\ngrants and other forms of assistance, rather than putting\r\n\r\nit  into the tax system of the GST.  That is what we have\r\n\r\ndone  with  the foreign worker levy because  we  used  to\r\n\r\nexempt  them from the foreign worker levy, now we subject\r\n\r\nthem  to the levy but we give them a grant, and it is  up\r\n\r\nto  them whether they want to employ a foreign worker  or\r\n\r\nthey  want  to get a labour-saving equipment, or  whether\r\n\r\nthey  want to find a Singaporean and do double the  work,\r\n\r\nit is up to them.  So I think that should be our approach\r\n\r\nto VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether to split between essentials and non-essentials, this is an issue which we have discussed many\r\n\r\ntimes when we first introduced the GST and again when  we\r\n\r\nraised the issue of GST this year.  And we have taken the\r\n\r\napproach  of  having the GST applied to all  products  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  whether  essentials,  non-essentials,  goods,\r\n\r\nservices, high-end, low-end, everything.  And there is  a\r\n\r\nreason for this.  The reason is that we want to find  the\r\n\r\nbest way to help the lower income people bear the tax and\r\n\r\nto  make  ends meet in Singapore.  We impose the GST,  it\r\n\r\nimposes  a burden on them.  What is the best way to  help\r\n\r\nthem  ease this burden?  It is to identify who the  lower\r\n\r\nincome groups are and target the assistance at them.   So\r\n\r\nthe  ERS,  the S&CC package, plus the rental package,  if\r\n\r\nyou  add  it all together, in fact, the people living  in\r\n\r\nthe one and two-room flats get the most, three-room a bit\r\n\r\nless, and four-room, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentials are not just bought by poor people.\r\n\r\nEverybody buys essentials.  Let us say food.  Poor people\r\n\r\nbuy food, middle income people buy more food, rich people\r\n\r\nbuy even more food.  So if you decide to exempt food, for\r\n\r\nevery  one dollar which helps the lower income, you  have\r\n\r\nto  spend nine dollars helping the non-lower income.   So\r\n\r\nthe  expense of this tax expenditure is much more and the\r\n\r\nresult is that revenues are less, and the result of  that\r\n\r\nis  to keep your revenues even, we will have to push  the\r\n\r\nGST rate, instead of being 5%, it will have to be 6%, 7%,\r\n\r\n8%, or if you take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  British  example, because you said the British  have\r\n\r\nsuch exemption, 17% GST.  So it is not a good way to help\r\n\r\nlower income people.  Therefore, we have decided we  will\r\n\r\nhave  a GST which covers everything and if we have target\r\n\r\ngroups  which need assistance, let us help them directly.\r\n\r\nI think that is the best way to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema says why not be a little bit more\r\n\r\ngenerous.   ERS is good, more is better.  Well,  more  is\r\n\r\nalways  better  but, in fact, we have been  quite  a  lot\r\n\r\nbetter already because although we say ERS is five years'\r\n\r\nworth  of GST for everyone, actually for the lower income\r\n\r\nit  is, in many cases, 9-10 years' worth of GST.  So,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  you are well looked after, and if you are  an  old\r\n\r\nperson,  10 years is a long time.  So, this is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  already seen to.  If  it  is  still  not\r\n\r\nsufficient because conditions are very hard, I  think  we\r\n\r\ncan  do more, but we should target it specifically rather\r\n\r\nthan go on the basis of essentials and non-essentials.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to take the\r\n\r\nopportunity to applaud the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee,\r\n\r\nfor  this  phased increase in GST.  I had actually  hoped\r\n\r\nfor a full deferment until the economy recovers or for at\r\n\r\nleast  one  year but, as the saying goes, \"if you  cannot\r\n\r\nget  a big fish, at least ikan bilis is still better than\r\n\r\nnothing.\"  In a sense, it is better than a full  increase\r\n\r\nof  2%,  and  I  think many Singaporeans will  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat, especially those from the retail sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to say also that we from the\r\n\r\nOpposition  do not mean that we are always  opposing  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake of opposing, and in this case if the Government\r\n\r\nhad  actually listened to the people and deferred it,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  appreciative and  support  it.   If  the\r\n\r\neconomy  turns  for the worse next year,  and  if  things\r\n\r\nbecome  worse,  I hope that the Minister  would  consider\r\n\r\ncutting the increase back to 3% or even lower, or to have\r\n\r\nadditional  off-budget measures to help  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ntide over the difficult period next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just\r\n\r\nthank  Mr Steve Chia for his support for my $650  million\r\n\r\nikan bilis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me\r\n\r\njoin  my  other colleagues in thanking the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and Minister for Finance and the Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for listening to the voices of the  people  in\r\n\r\nasking  the  Government  to take into  consideration  the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic downturn and the hardship that they  are\r\n\r\nfaced with.

I  would  like to ask,  and  I  am  sure,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that the small businesses, the  retailers,\r\n\r\nare  the people who would be very happy because now, with\r\n\r\nthe smaller increase, their sense of consumers not buying\r\n\r\nenough would be somewhat abated.  But I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to continue to look into this area:   how\r\n\r\nto  help  the  small businesses and retailers.   And,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Minister for Finance that for those who  are  having\r\n\r\ntransactions  with  the Government, or  who  provide  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with goods or services, or  do  any  form  of\r\n\r\nconstruction  or  public works for  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could also consider expediting  payments  for\r\n\r\nthem,  for  instance.  I am not suggesting that  payments\r\n\r\nare  slow  but,  I think, many are faced with  cash  flow\r\n\r\nproblems  and  for those dealing with the Government,  if\r\n\r\nthe  payments  are  made much more  promptly,  that  will\r\n\r\ncertainly help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, can I suggest that we take all\r\n\r\nthe questions at one shot?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhad said previously in the House that one of the ways for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  ensure that the Budget  is  properly\r\n\r\nbalanced is not merely to increase tax, but also to watch\r\n\r\nout  for  its expenditure.  I was heartened to hear  from\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister earlier that  he  would  take\r\n\r\nsteps to ensure that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure is properly controlled.  But I think it takes\r\n\r\nmore than reassuring words from the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that this is carried out.  I am  afraid  that\r\n\r\nyears  of  strong  economic growth and  years  of  strong\r\n\r\nsurpluses  may  have set the free and easy  mentality  in\r\n\r\nsome  of our Ministries.  I do not wish to repeat what  I\r\n\r\nsaid during the Budget debate because I have no new seven\r\n\r\nwonders to reveal today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was quite taken aback, like many other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  when  we  heard that  the  Land  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority was building a $500 million headquarters and  I\r\n\r\nthink because of the public ruckus, the whole project has\r\n\r\nbeen  shelved.  But I was also very concerned last  month\r\n\r\nwhen  I  read  that for the opening of  the  Esplanade  - Theatres on the Bay, we spent something like $13  million\r\n\r\nand was all blown away in 23 days.  And yet, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the Government announced the increases in hospital\r\n\r\ncharges, raising more money from the sick to the tune  of\r\n\r\n$12 million a year.  So I want to ask: sometimes have  we\r\n\r\ngot  our priorities correct?  Therefore, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Deputy Prime Minister, in spite of what  he  has\r\n\r\ntold  us  and his reassurance to the House, what concrete\r\n\r\nsteps  can  really be taken by the Government  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of Government is well controlled  and,  if\r\n\r\nnot  in  a  crisis,  can  it  be  reduced  even  further?\r\n\r\nBecause,  like  all businesses, when we are  faced  in  a\r\n\r\ndifficult   situation,  one  of  the  things   that   all\r\n\r\nbusinessmen do is to cut back on expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I respond\r\n\r\nfirst  to Mdm Halimah.  She talked about the problems  of\r\n\r\nsmall  businesses and retailers.  We are very much  aware\r\n\r\nof  it.   I  think  it  is not just because  of  the  GST\r\n\r\nincrease.  Even this year, without any GST increase, they\r\n\r\nhave been having quite a slow and difficult time.  It  is\r\n\r\npartly a structural problem because there are too many of\r\n\r\nthe  businesses which are in HDB estates, ie,  there  are\r\n\r\nwhole  rows  and many of them are selling similar  goods.\r\n\r\nIt  is partly a matter of change in habits and customs of\r\n\r\nour  younger  generation.  Instead of  people  with  two-income households, instead of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshopping in the wet market every day, they will shop once\r\n\r\na  week  in  the  supermarket and put the  stuff  in  the\r\n\r\nfreezer,  and  they  are going for a different  range  of\r\n\r\ngoods and different range of services.  Or they may  even\r\n\r\ngo  to  JB, or some place, to shop instead.  So it  is  a\r\n\r\nstructural  problem and it is one which is being  studied\r\n\r\nby  one  of the Economic Review Committee working groups.\r\n\r\nThey have some ideas to ameliorate the difficulties.  But\r\n\r\nI  do  not think there is any quick solution to make  the\r\n\r\nsector bloom and prosper again overnight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for transactions with the Government and\r\n\r\nexpediting payment, I agree with Mdm Halimah that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that Government be a prompt paymaster.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot  aware of any complaint that the Government has  been\r\n\r\nslow.   If  Mdm  Halimah, or any of  the  Members,  comes\r\n\r\nacross any such cases, please let me know and I will look\r\n\r\ninto  it.   It  is  our  practice to administer  and  pay\r\n\r\npromptly.  It is most important to our reputation that we\r\n\r\ndo  because, if we start paying slowly, then  whoever  is\r\n\r\nproviding the services will start factoring in  that  and\r\n\r\nthe interest cost in his next tender to us.  Then we will\r\n\r\nhave  a  problem.  I was just discussing  with  my  staff\r\n\r\nyesterday evening and they told me that in fact  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  companies prefer to do business with the Government,\r\n\r\nprecisely because of this reason, they can be sure to pay\r\n\r\nyou  and they would not drag the matter.  Whereas if  you\r\n\r\ndo  business  with the private partner, if he  runs  into\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties, you have a  problem.   And  they\r\n\r\nhave  confidence that the Government will  not  run  into\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties, and it is my job to make sure the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  run  into financial  difficulties,\r\n\r\nwhich  is why we are proceeding with the GST increase  to\r\n\r\nfour percentage points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with what Mr Tan said, that it is\r\n\r\nnot just what I said, but also how we practise it and how\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  internalise with  the  need  to  be\r\n\r\nparsimony and to be careful with money, and to  spend  as\r\n\r\nif  it  is effortless for MOF to produce the next dollar,\r\n\r\nand  we are in different circumstances and we have to  be\r\n\r\nvery careful.  As I said, we are going to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave a very tight Budget next year and the Ministries are\r\n\r\ngoing to cut back both on substantive programmes as  well\r\n\r\nas  on frills.  On education, for example, they have been\r\n\r\nplanning on a certain percentage of GDP to spend.  But we\r\n\r\nhave also been expecting a certain rate of growth of GDP,\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  have  5-6%  growth  per  year,  therefore,\r\n\r\neducation  will  have 5-6% more to spend per  year,  plus\r\n\r\nextra  percentage  on that because we  think  this  is  a\r\n\r\npriority  area.  Now, our base has shrunk.   The  GDP  is\r\n\r\ngrowing  less rapidly.  Educational need has not  shrunk.\r\n\r\nYour   children  still  need  good  schools,   computers,\r\n\r\nlaboratories.   You  still want  more  people  to  go  to\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  more people can benefit  from  going  to\r\n\r\nuniversity.  All these cost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we afford as much of this as possible while\r\n\r\nliving  within our means?  They will have to cut  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  things like travel and perks, and non-essential\r\n\r\nthings, that is, when you renew your computer, and so on,\r\n\r\nevery  two  years, it may be every three or three  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  years.  When you are renewing your school building,\r\n\r\ninstead of 20 years, it may be 25 years.  We will have to\r\n\r\nlive  within our means.  These are adjustments  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  make.  When they opened the Esplanade building,\r\n\r\nthey also have to live within their means and decide what\r\n\r\nthey  are  going  to  do.  The Esplanade,  which  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nraised, is an issue.  Before we had the opening ceremony,\r\n\r\nwe  considered this matter and we discussed it  carefully\r\n\r\nwith  MITA because, in fact, we are doing this at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the economy is down, the mood is down.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  be  extravagant because we  cannot  afford  the\r\n\r\nmoney.   Anyway,  it is a wrong signal  to  send  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  And MITA understood this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, they said, \"We are making a very\r\n\r\nbig step.  We spent a lot of money building it.  It is  a\r\n\r\nlong  term  investment.   The purpose  is  not  just  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans    but   really   to   register    ourselves\r\n\r\ninternationally.\"  So we become one of  the  spots  where\r\n\r\npeople   believe  and  know  that  there   are   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  a  place  which people want to come  to  perform.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  you  need a series of events  to  launch  the\r\n\r\ntheatre as well as the concert hall and to make ourselves\r\n\r\nknown  to Singaporeans and internationally, and it  costs\r\n\r\nmoney.   The  fireworks cost money, yes.   I  would  have\r\n\r\npreferred  far  fewer  fireworks.   But  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nfireworks  which are the most expensive  thing.   If  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  have Jose Carreras here, that costs money.   If\r\n\r\nyou  want orchestra here, that costs money.  A lot of  it\r\n\r\nis  sponsored,  but some of it are operating  cost.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  it  costs a certain  amount  to  have  the\r\n\r\nfestival  which  went to the opening  ceremony.   But  Mr\r\n\r\nTan's  point is well taken and it is a message which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Finance  reiterated  to  all  Ministries,\r\n\r\nincluding  ourselves,  regularly, and  especially  before\r\n\r\nnext year's Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY (FY 2002) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the\r\n\r\nsecond and third readings of the Supplementary Supply (FY\r\n\r\n2002)  Bill  for  FY  2002/2003  may  be  proceeded  with\r\n\r\nimmediately  after the conclusion of the  proceedings  on\r\n\r\nthe   Supplementary  Estimates  of  Expenditure  for   FY\r\n\r\n2002/2003. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>1ST APRIL, 2002 TO 31ST MARCH, 2003</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(PAPER CMD. 10 of 2002)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply\r\n\r\n[Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>1.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for the financial year 1st  April,  2002  to\r\n\r\n31st March, 2003, contained in Paper Cmd. 10 of 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the sum of $1,200,000,000 for Head Z\r\n\r\nstand part of the Supplementary Main Estimates\", put  and\r\n\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the sum of $1,200,000,000 shall be\r\n\r\nsupplied  to the Government under the Head of Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  the Public Services shown in the  Supplementary Main\r\n\r\nEstimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April\r\n\r\n2002  to  31st March 2003 contained in Paper Cmd.  10  of\r\n\r\n2002\", put and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee\r\n\r\nand took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report\r\n\r\nthat  the  Committee  of  Supply  have  come  to  certain\r\n\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution reported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $1,200,000,000 shall be supplied to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  under the Head of  Expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nPublic Services shown in the Supplementary Main Estimates\r\n\r\nof  Expenditure for the financial year 1st April 2002  to\r\n\r\n31st March 2003 contained in Paper Cmd. 10 of 2002\",  put\r\n\r\nand agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That  Parliament  doth agree with the Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nsaid resolution.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution accordingly agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY (FY 2002) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second and Third Readings read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for\r\n\r\nadditional expenditure of $1.2 billion to fund the  first\r\n\r\nallocation of the Economic Restructuring Shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in my Budget Speech in May this year,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  giving  out  Economic  Restructuring\r\n\r\nShares  to  help  Singaporeans adapt  to  the  structural\r\n\r\nchanges  in the economy, especially the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nGST  rate.

Businesses  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired   to   issue  a  new  tax   invoice   in   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Zero-rating of Co-location Web-hosting Services and Managed Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a co-location arrangement, a service provider\r\n\r\nwill  generally require the customers to bring  in  their\r\n\r\nown  server  platforms and place them at his  facilities.\r\n\r\nWhere  a local service provider provides web-hosting  and\r\n\r\nmanaged  services to an overseas customer in such  a  co-location arrangement, the services are standard-rated  if\r\n\r\nthe  server belonging to the overseas customer is located\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,   and  zero-rated  if   located   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-rating the entire web-hosting services and\r\n\r\nmanaged   services   provided  to  an  overseas   person,\r\n\r\nregardless  of where the server is located, will  promote\r\n\r\nSingapore as an e-commerce hub.  Hence, clause  4  amends\r\n\r\nsection 21 of the Act to provide for zero-rating  of  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of services to an overseas person in relation  to\r\n\r\ncomputer server equipment belonging to that person  which\r\n\r\nis co-located in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clarification of Comptrollers' Powers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, business transaction information and\r\n\r\ndata  are stored in computers, electronic media and other\r\n\r\nalternative media.  However, the Comptroller of Goods and\r\n\r\nServices  Tax's  powers  to  access  and  to  seize  such\r\n\r\nelectronic   records  may  be  limited   based   on   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the current legislation.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nclause  7  amends section 84 of the Act  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\npowers vested in the Comptroller to access and seize such\r\n\r\nrecords kept in electronic and other alternative media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to put on\r\n\r\nrecord  my  support for the Government on  the  phased-in\r\n\r\napproach to the GST implementation.  This phased approach\r\n\r\nto  increase from 3% to 4%, and then from 4% to 5%,  will\r\n\r\nlessen  the impact on the lower income group and  lighten\r\n\r\ntheir burden - the so-called psychological impact on  the\r\n\r\npeople.   It also took into account the changing economic\r\n\r\nconditions  and reflects the Government's sensitivity  to\r\n\r\nour people's plight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to join the other hon. Members who\r\n\r\nhave spoken earlier in congratulating the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  adopting  this  phased\r\n\r\napproach.   I  see  great value in  the  sensitivity  and\r\n\r\nfinancial   prudence   of  the  Government.    It   gives\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  the people when dealing  with  Government\r\n\r\nbodies.  In particular, I like very much the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's message that Government bodies would  have  to\r\n\r\ncut  back  on their spending, so that the Government  can\r\n\r\nmaintain a balanced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget.  This financially prudent policy of living within\r\n\r\nour means is an excellent one to adopt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very clear signal of the style of the\r\n\r\nGovernment:  that  it is a level-headed and  clear-minded\r\n\r\none which is at the same time sensitive to the worries of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  It will strengthen the public's  confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  Government.  At the same time, the  decision  to\r\n\r\nretain  the entire relief package, while only phasing  in\r\n\r\nthe  GST increase, shows that the Government is also very\r\n\r\ngenerous in this instance to retain the measures to  help\r\n\r\nthe  poorer people. Therefore, the Government has a  feel\r\n\r\nfor the poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by reiterating my\r\n\r\nsupport for the proposed amendment and the choice of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  adopt the phased-in GST approach.   I  am\r\n\r\nvery gratified to note with pride that we have a rational\r\n\r\nand responsive Government in charge which is also closely\r\n\r\nattuned to the plight and worries of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  first,  like other hon. Members of  this  House,\r\n\r\nthank the Minister for Finance for having listened to the\r\n\r\npeople and modifying the planned GST hike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, like education and many other\r\n\r\nissues before this House, the GST hike, which is what the\r\n\r\nBill  is  concerned with, is, in my view,  not  \"if\"  but\r\n\r\n\"when\" and \"how\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the \"if\", the Minister for Finance has already\r\n\r\ngiven  this  House  and the people of  Singapore  several\r\n\r\nreasons  for the need to raise GST, such as the  need  to\r\n\r\nattract  and retain talent, as well as the fact  that  we\r\n\r\nare increasingly facing an ageing population and that the\r\n\r\ntax  base  will  diminish concurrently as the  burden  on\r\n\r\npublic  finances  to  fund  health  care  rises.    These\r\n\r\nfactors,  coupled  with the anticipated  slower  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth in the medium term, produce compelling reasons why\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs  to broaden its tax  base  and  increase\r\n\r\nindirect taxes like GST whilst reducing direct taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to note that with the\r\n\r\nincrease  in GST from 3% to 5%, our rate remains  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  lowest among nations that have implemented GST.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the standard GST or VAT rate is 17 1/2% in  the\r\n\r\nUK,  12  1/2%  in  New Zealand, 10% in  Korea,  5-10%  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan, 5% in Japan, and 7% in Thailand.  The hike to  5%\r\n\r\nis, thus, not misaligned from this perspective.  In fact,\r\n\r\nit is clear that almost all agree that the GST rate would\r\n\r\nhave to go up.  No question about this.  The question  is\r\n\r\nwhen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the \"when\", coming after a series of price hikes\r\n\r\nin  transport fares, utilities, parking charges and  even\r\n\r\ngarbage collection fees, the ground feel is naturally one\r\n\r\nof consternation, sharply heightened by the poor economic\r\n\r\nconditions  and the spectre of even more unemployment  in\r\n\r\nthe  streets.  Although the Government has said that  the\r\n\r\noffset  package will more than cover the increase in  GST\r\n\r\nand  that  it  will  be expansionary,  many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nremain unconvinced, as the Minister for Finance has noted\r\n\r\nearlier.   One Singaporean, in an unpublished  letter  to\r\n\r\nthe  press,  noted that whilst more than  a  million  CPF\r\n\r\naccount   holders  have  withdrawn  their  New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares,  stallholders have at the same  time  reported  a\r\n\r\ndrastic  drop in businesses by up to 80%.  Hence,  he  is\r\n\r\nsceptical that the offset package will be expansionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have had quite a number of residents who\r\n\r\nhave asked me to appeal to the Town Council and Singapore\r\n\r\nPower,  amongst others, to ask for deferment  of  payment\r\n\r\nuntil  they  have encashed their NSS or ERS.  Thus,  many\r\n\r\nlower income residents are in fact using the NSS and  ERS\r\n\r\nas  a lifeline to tide over their financial difficulties,\r\n\r\nand  pay  for essential household bills, school fees  and\r\n\r\ntextbooks.   The  expansionary impact of the  GST  offset\r\n\r\npackage is thus likely to be less than expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the oft-cited view that there is never a good\r\n\r\ntime  to  raise taxes.  Indeed, they say that  death  and\r\n\r\ntaxes are the only two certainties in life.  One argument\r\n\r\nfor  a  2003  hike  is that foreign investors  will  lose\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government's ability to keep its  word,\r\n\r\nsince the hike was already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced  in  the 2002 Budget Statement  as  part  of  a\r\n\r\npackage  of  measures  to  restructure  our  tax  regime.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   any   delay  could  be  construed   by   the\r\n\r\ninternational community as succumbing to people  pressure\r\n\r\nagainst  the  long-term interest  of  the  country.   And\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government is not populist, we will have  to\r\n\r\ndo  what we say we will do.  Sir, this Government is  not\r\n\r\none that reneges on its word.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am proud to note that when the GST was first\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1993, this Government promised to hold  the\r\n\r\nGST  rate  at  3%  for five years and  it  has  kept  its\r\n\r\npromise.   On the other hand, breaking a similar  promise\r\n\r\nnow,  ie, deferring the planned hike, would be easier  to\r\n\r\ndo  because of the political backlash of being a promise-keeper.   Nonetheless, Sir, I am delighted,  and  so  are\r\n\r\nmany  other  Singaporeans, that after  habitually  saying\r\n\r\n\"The  answer is no\" and \"The answer is still no\" on  many\r\n\r\noccasions, this Government is now finally saying \"Let  us\r\n\r\nconsider  because  of  the  changed  circumstances\"  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, it has modified the planned hike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this means the Government is\r\n\r\nbowing  to populist pressure.  Rather, it shows that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not afraid to bend, if it is satisfied that\r\n\r\nthere  are  good reasons to do so and, indeed, there  are\r\n\r\ngood reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the votes - and, as Mdm Ho noted\r\n\r\nearlier,  the bets - were split as to which  of  the  two\r\n\r\noptions was preferred.  Nonetheless, I feel - and I think\r\n\r\nthe  Government feels that too - that there  could  be  a\r\n\r\ntilt towards the phased-in scheme, which I am pleased the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has announced the  Government  has\r\n\r\nopted for.  Phasing in shows that the Government is  firm\r\n\r\nin its policy, yet flexible in responding to the economic\r\n\r\nand  political  environment.   Most  would  welcome  some\r\n\r\nreprieve,  real  or imagined, from the full  increase  in\r\n\r\nrate.  As one retailer noted, \"every bit helps\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to highlight that some\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, particularly those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are not registered for GST, feel that due to the poor\r\n\r\neconomic conditions and strong competition, they  may  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  absorb the 1% increase in GST,  thus  further\r\n\r\nsqueezing  their  already razor-thin  margins,  as  their\r\n\r\nclients  would  say,  \"Since it is only  1%,  you  should\r\n\r\nabsorb it.\"  In fact, a few businessmen actually told  me\r\n\r\nthat  their preference was for the Government to increase\r\n\r\nthe  rate to 5% straightaway, and then provide additional\r\n\r\nhelp  to those in need.  They feel that there is not much\r\n\r\ndifference between a 1% and 2% hike, and we might as well\r\n\r\ntake  the  pain straight and face up to the realities  of\r\n\r\nthe  harsh economic conditions and aggressive competition\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the option of increasing the GST to the full 5%,\r\n\r\nbut  with more help to low income families, could have  a\r\n\r\nhigher  political cost, since there would be  groups  who\r\n\r\nwill  not  benefit  significantly or  directly  from  any\r\n\r\noffset package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the current experience has shown that\r\n\r\neven though theoretically many individuals should not  be\r\n\r\nworse off due to the two-percentage point GST increase as\r\n\r\nthe  relief  package should cushion the  blow,  many  are\r\n\r\nstill upset as they perceive this to be yet another hike.\r\n\r\nMany  also  tend  to  divorce the  GST  hike  and  relief\r\n\r\npackage,  and feel that the two are separate matters.   I\r\n\r\nam  pleased to note that the Government has taken heed of\r\n\r\nthese sentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the \"how\", as the Government has chosen the\r\n\r\nphased-in  scheme, I urge the Government to give  careful\r\n\r\nthought to mitigating the pain, especially on two groups:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) smaller businesses which do not benefit from the\r\n\r\nlower direct tax regime and will find themselves squeezed\r\n\r\nby consumers because of weak demand to absorb all or part\r\n\r\nof the increase; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) lower income groups struggling to eke out an\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must continue to find ways to help\r\n\r\nsmall businesses to lower their costs, as many which  are\r\n\r\nyet to be profitable would not benefit from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  cuts, while those who are struggling  and\r\n\r\nmaking   marginal   profits   will   also   not   benefit\r\n\r\nsignificantly  from the new tax regime.  Rental  rebates,\r\n\r\nlower   property   taxes,  grants   for   upgrading   the\r\n\r\nbusinesses, or even attractive financing packages,  could\r\n\r\nbe   further  extended  to  such  businesses  which   are\r\n\r\nstruggling in the current economic conditions  but  which\r\n\r\nare otherwise fundamentally sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower income group is struggling due to the poor\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions as well as the structural change  in\r\n\r\nthe  employment  landscape which  renders  many  who  are\r\n\r\nunskilled  redundant  in the labour  market.   They  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  need  help as long as the economic  outlook\r\n\r\nremains bleak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted earlier, many are in fact using their NSS\r\n\r\nand  ERS  as  lifelines to tide them over  the  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   We need to continue to  help  this  group\r\n\r\nremain  employable through retraining as well as  through\r\n\r\njob creation.\r\n\r\nAt  the end of the day, Sir, the groundswell against  the\r\n\r\nGST hike stems most acutely from the fact that we are  in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of a recession, and the livelihood of ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens are at risk.  There is really never a good  time\r\n\r\nto  raise taxes, but the people of Singapore will need to\r\n\r\ntake  a  calm  and  rational look at  the  grim  economic\r\n\r\nrealities  affecting the long-term future of our  country\r\n\r\nthat is at the core of the Government's tax policy.   But\r\n\r\nthe immediate pain, though alleviated through the phased-in  approach, still cannot be lightly dismissed.  I would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government  to consider additional  off-Budget\r\n\r\nrelief measures to help Singaporeans and businesses  tide\r\n\r\nover their cash flow difficulties if the economy worsens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying the when and how of the GST implementation\r\n\r\nwould  clearly help to restore the people's faith in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and,  barring  any  other  Government  policy\r\n\r\nannouncements, will be a good note on which  to  end  the\r\n\r\nyear.   It  will  certainly add cheer to  the  Hari  Raya\r\n\r\nfestive season tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there has been a great deal of  debate  by\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore  and  politicians  about  the\r\n\r\nproposed increase in the Goods and Services Tax  from  3%\r\n\r\nto  5%  as proposed in clause 3 of the Goods and Services\r\n\r\nTax  (Amendment) Bill which seeks to amend section 16  of\r\n\r\nthe  Goods  and Services Tax Act.  The Hon. Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has kindly proposed an amendment which I am sure\r\n\r\nis most welcomed by this House and the people residing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposal of an increase to 5% is\r\n\r\nsubstantially  more  than 66% increase  and  the  general\r\n\r\nsentiment   coming  from  our  citizenry   is   that   of\r\n\r\nunhappiness.    Now,   it  is   an   increase   of   33%.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the economic climate in the  recent  past,\r\n\r\npresent  and  in  the  immediate  future  is  bleak   and\r\n\r\ntherefore the difficulty in being able to support such  a\r\n\r\nproposal.  In a recent local radio survey, around 80%  of\r\n\r\nthe  listeners were against the increase in GST  at  this\r\n\r\ntime.    Only   20%  supported  such  a  proposal.    The\r\n\r\npsychological impact of the proposed increase is  one  of\r\n\r\nhopelessness on the part of citizens once the  Government\r\n\r\ndecides  to  go  ahead with an increase in  any  form  of\r\n\r\ntaxation.   The  spirit of the people and the  nation  is\r\n\r\ndown  and our Government must take serious note  of  this\r\n\r\nand  not just pay lip service to it, as perceived by many\r\n\r\npeople.   Today,  as  a  result  of  the  amendment,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be perceived to be more caring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership must be compassionate and\r\n\r\nmust feel for the sentiments of its people and not be too\r\n\r\nlogical  and pragmatic all the time.  Even a logical  and\r\n\r\npragmatic  Government,  as  seen  today,  may  not,  when\r\n\r\nanalysed  in future, turn out to be correct and  accurate\r\n\r\nin  their  decisions.  The Government's main argument  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the proposed increase in GST is that it  needs\r\n\r\nto  balance the budget.  It is easy and convenient to say\r\n\r\nthat the budget of the nation needs to be balanced.   The\r\n\r\nissue  is  whether that is a top priority when times  are\r\n\r\nbad.   This  move  may  cause the budgets  of  the  other\r\n\r\nsectors  of  our  society, namely, that of  lay  persons,\r\n\r\nretailers, manufacturers, service providers, etc, to have\r\n\r\ndifficulty in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbalancing  their respective budgets.  Which  then  is  to\r\n\r\nprevail?   Only the Cabinet can decide this.   They  have\r\n\r\nthe  power  to do so, not the citizenry. Cabinet  members\r\n\r\nwould  have,  hopefully,  given serious  and  independent\r\n\r\nthoughts to this proposed increase, be it 1% or 2%.   Was\r\n\r\nit  an  unanimous decision or were there differing  views\r\n\r\namongst Cabinet Ministers and even senior civil servants?\r\n\r\nIt  would be interesting to get a revelation of the minds\r\n\r\nof  different  Cabinet Ministers on  this  topic  of  GST\r\n\r\nincrease.   It may not be the practice to give individual\r\n\r\nCabinet  members'  views but such  a  practice  could  be\r\n\r\nrevealed  to see how the Cabinet works and how they  came\r\n\r\nto  the  conclusion  that there should  be  an  increase,\r\n\r\nalbeit  it is now in two phases of 4% in 2003 and  5%  in\r\n\r\n2004 and subsequent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government may want to balance the national\r\n\r\nbudget  purely  to have a clean record  of  never  having\r\n\r\nfailed  to  have balanced budgets these past  few  years.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  may  be preferable not to have  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget  in  a  year  where  the nation  has  fared  badly\r\n\r\neconomically.   Citizens generally are taking  home  less\r\n\r\nthis  year.  So should not the State too take home  less?\r\n\r\nIt  would assist the spirit of the citizens for  them  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  our  Government  does  care  and  is  not   a\r\n\r\ngovernment   that   is  purely  and   coldly   efficient,\r\n\r\nespecially  during poor economic times. We  must  give  a\r\n\r\nboost  to  our national spirit and not create unhappiness\r\n\r\nwith  more  taxes when there is sadness and gloom  facing\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet has decided, the people and Members of\r\n\r\nParliament can debate in detail all the pros and cons  of\r\n\r\nan increase in GST.  However, it makes little difference.\r\n\r\nAll  I  can do is register my point for what it is worth.\r\n\r\nI propose that the clause proposing an increase in GST be\r\n\r\ndeleted  from the proposed amendment and let there  be  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  an increase in GST only if times are  better,\r\n\r\nand only in the second half of 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this reservation, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  other proposed amendments, namely, clauses 2,  4,  6\r\n\r\nand 7.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of this GST (Amendment) Bill was postponed  last\r\n\r\nweek,  I,  like  many  others, felt  that  something  was\r\n\r\nbrewing.  While I would say that there were some  of  us,\r\n\r\nincluding myself, who were hoping that the increase of 2%\r\n\r\nwould  be  fully deferred for at least six  months  to  a\r\n\r\nyear, I must say that the change in plans to increase  it\r\n\r\nby  only  1% next year and another 1% in 2004 come  as  a\r\n\r\npleasant surprise to us.  While I would not say that what\r\n\r\nthe Government is forgoing is ikan bilis, I would like to\r\n\r\nsay that perhaps we should be grateful for little mercies\r\n\r\nthat do come our way sometimes from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has changed since the Government first\r\n\r\nannounced  the  GST  increase during the  Budget  debate.\r\n\r\nUnemployment has now reached an all time high of 4.8% and\r\n\r\nthis  is  expected to rise to as much as 5.5% very  soon.\r\n\r\nThere  are  therefore now more Singaporeans without  jobs\r\n\r\nthan in March.  Without jobs means without any source  of\r\n\r\nincome.  Like  every  one else, all the  people  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed have to face the other increases such  as  the\r\n\r\nbus and MRT fares, hospital charges, utilities bills, car\r\n\r\npark charges, etc, that we have to put up with this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the employed are of course not much better off.\r\n\r\nIf  they are not already faced with uncertainty of losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs tomorrow, they have now been told by the  NWC\r\n\r\nand  the  NTUC to be prepared for further wage  cuts.  We\r\n\r\nstill do not know what the economic outlook will be  like\r\n\r\nnext  year.   Our forecasts for economic  growth  are  as\r\n\r\nreliable  as  the  weatherman's, and had  to  be  revised\r\n\r\nseveral  times  this  year.  Singaporeans  are  therefore\r\n\r\ntightening  their  belts and they want to  save  whatever\r\n\r\nmoney  they  can save for a rainy day and for some,  that\r\n\r\nrainy day has probably arrived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a bit concerned whether in fact there will\r\n\r\nbe a kind of retraction of the economy even though we are\r\n\r\ntold  that the Government is pumping in more money during\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  period.  We must not under-estimate  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  a negative multiplier effect on the  economy.\r\n\r\nOur\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretail  sector  has  already been suffering  for  several\r\n\r\nyears.  Whether you are a big store in one of our Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad  shopping  malls or a shop in an  HDB  estate  or  a\r\n\r\nmarket  stall, you would, in all probability,  have  been\r\n\r\nsuffering from a declining business.  If we just  take  a\r\n\r\nlook at the frequent changes in the tenants of shops,  we\r\n\r\ncan  get  a  feel of how difficult it must  be  for  each\r\n\r\nprevious tenant.  If Singaporeans now tighten their purse\r\n\r\nstrings further, the situation is likely to worsen in the\r\n\r\nmonths ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make the point that one million\r\n\r\npeople  have already cashed in their New Singapore Shares\r\n\r\nand  they  did so in spite of knowing that they would  be\r\n\r\nforgoing  an  annual  3% Government-guaranteed  dividend,\r\n\r\neven  more if there is strong economic growth.   This  to\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, is a pity.  We can empathise with them because,\r\n\r\nif  what  we know on the ground is correct, many  did  so\r\n\r\nbecause  they  need the money today to pay for  household\r\n\r\nexpenses  or  to  settle  their  arrears  such  as  their\r\n\r\nutilities  bills and other expenses, in other  words,  to\r\n\r\npay  for  very  basic needs.  It is a reflection  of  how\r\n\r\ntough  life  must be for them.  A lot of the money  which\r\n\r\nwas given out would eventually go back to Government,  in\r\n\r\nfact, very quickly.  So I am really concerned whether  in\r\n\r\nfact  there  would  be  any expansionary  effect  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy in spite of the Government giving away the amount\r\n\r\nthat it has announced that it is giving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nagain reinstating the EDRS very quickly, in spite of what\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister told us that in  a  difficult\r\n\r\nsituation, we need to give out such schemes, but  if  the\r\n\r\nemergency  is  no longer there, we need to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\nscheme  and  reinstate it at a later  date.   What  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned is the fact that we do have 100,000-odd  people\r\n\r\nwho are unemployed now and there is no guarantee that the\r\n\r\nemployment  situation is improving.   I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nstrongly urge the Government to consider reinstating  the\r\n\r\nEDRS because I am sure that there will still be a lot  of\r\n\r\nunemployed people who will be coming to MPs during  their\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people sessions looking for help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I do not have very much to\r\n\r\nadd other than to just expand on a few points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the DPM for what he has spoken about as far\r\n\r\nas  the  amendment in the Bill is concerned.   Like  some\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House, it would have been good  to  defer\r\n\r\nthe  2% and review the whole thing in the year 2004,  the\r\n\r\nreason  being that for quite a number of us, we  are  not\r\n\r\nsavvy enough to totally understand how increasing GST  by\r\n\r\n2% can improve the economy or help to balance the budget,\r\n\r\nand why that becomes very pertinent.  Perhaps, there is a\r\n\r\ngreater  need  to  try and be more communicative  to  the\r\n\r\npopulation at large so that they can be in sync with what\r\n\r\nGovernment's intentions are and understand why the 2%  is\r\n\r\nimportant, and now the reduced rate of 1%.  I know it has\r\n\r\nbeen said many times but I think I am quite naive in this\r\n\r\narea of money matters and I am sure there are many others\r\n\r\nout  there  like me.  It would be good to have a  greater\r\n\r\nand clearer explanation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the point that I raised earlier on\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs,  I appeal that we do reconsider the  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  they are concerned, especially when they have  big\r\n\r\nitem  expenditures  and  are no longer  entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance's grant to offset the GST.  From 1994\r\n\r\nto  1999, they have been receiving a $2.7 million  grant.\r\n\r\nThis  has  helped  about  42 to  60  VWOs.   What  a  GST\r\n\r\nimposition really means is that for recovering $7 million\r\n\r\nin terms of donations, it can come up to $200,000 in GST,\r\n\r\nwhich  can  stall quite a number of their  programmes  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  plans.  So I appeal that we do not  forget  the\r\n\r\nVWOs in this instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that, as I mentioned earlier, it\r\n\r\nis  not  that  I  am asking for a more generous  package.\r\n\r\nThere  are  quite a number of people in crisis.   I  have\r\n\r\nasked earlier in the House about the number of people who\r\n\r\nare  receiving  aid for the period from April  2000-March\r\n\r\n2001.  The figure that was given - thanks to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Community Development and Sports - was 5,265.  For the\r\n\r\nsame  period, April 2001-March 2002, it has already  gone\r\n\r\nup to 14,950.  For that year, about 15,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  have  received  $15  million  in  different   aid\r\n\r\npackages.   It  is  good that they are already  receiving\r\n\r\nquite  a  lot of help. Nevertheless, add into this,  like\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr Tan has mentioned, 100,000 people are unemployed\r\n\r\nwho are not sure when they are going to get the next job,\r\n\r\nI  think these are the people in crisis.  Although it  is\r\n\r\nan  increase of only 1% and in, real terms, it may not be\r\n\r\nvery  much,  I  think  we need to monitor  how  they  are\r\n\r\naffected,  and to work out how the criteria schemes  that\r\n\r\nwe  use  currently to help these people  can  perhaps  be\r\n\r\nbroadened and to monitor the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some programmes on the ground such as IUP,\r\n\r\netc,  that  are  perhaps imminent in some constituencies.\r\n\r\nIn  this present situation, I think people will be  quite\r\n\r\nperturbed to have new initiatives coming where they  have\r\n\r\nto  take money out of the pocket and perhaps have to face\r\n\r\nthe  GST  hike  which  will  be  incorporated  into  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Perhaps it is also a good  time  to  review\r\n\r\nwhether it is necessary to go ahead with such programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it is wonderful that institutions like NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice  will absorb the GST, but it also begs  another\r\n\r\nquestion.  What about the small-time retailers in the HDB\r\n\r\nheartlands?  They may not be in a situation to absorb the\r\n\r\nGST hike.  Maybe we need to keep an eye and also see that\r\n\r\nthey too can survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier, I applaud DPM Lee for the steps  taken  to\r\n\r\nphase  in  this GST increase.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nstate again that I still believe that the GST should  not\r\n\r\nbe increased totally, not even by 1%.  But, as I said, it\r\n\r\nis still better than a 2% increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the efforts and plans to cut\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure and spend wisely.  I think this is\r\n\r\na very good move and a great emphasis has to be done.  As\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  had said earlier, the economic recovery outlook\r\n\r\nwas fair when this idea was first proposed and debated in\r\n\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  assumption was that the ERS and offset packages will\r\n\r\nmore  than neutralise this GST increase of 2%.   However,\r\n\r\ninstead  of looking brighter, the economy may be  turning\r\n\r\nfor  the  worse and getting uncertain.  This is  probably\r\n\r\nthe  worst  economic  period we are going  to  see  since\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is affected by this economic slowdown.\r\n\r\nBut,  like what Mdm Halimah said earlier, the groups that\r\n\r\nare  most  affected are the SMEs, the retailers  and  the\r\n\r\nsmall business owners, and their continued survival  will\r\n\r\nimpact  on the level of unemployment and wealth  creation\r\n\r\nin  this  society.  With a drastic decline in consumption\r\n\r\npower  and  still  very high business  cost,  the  retail\r\n\r\nindustry  is  the  worst  off and  hardest  hit  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I appreciate the Government's plan not to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  GST fully to 5% now.  The  upturn  in  the\r\n\r\nNODEX  does  not indicate a change of business  sentiment\r\n\r\nfor   the   better.   Even  as  we  speak,  the  economic\r\n\r\nindicators  in the US are beginning to turn  down  again.\r\n\r\nOn  balance,  the Government has not put  additional  and\r\n\r\nundue burden of 2% increase at this difficult time on our\r\n\r\nsmall  retailers.  I can only hope that this 1%  increase\r\n\r\nin  GST  will  not be the straw that breaks  the  camel's\r\n\r\nback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional cost of doing business will have to\r\n\r\nbe  absorbed most likely by the small businesses that are\r\n\r\nnot  GST-registered.  This may cause some of these  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  especially some of the new businesses  which\r\n\r\nare already suffering, to consider closing down and cause\r\n\r\nhigher unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate DPM Lee's understanding of the problems\r\n\r\nin the retail sector.  The retail sector is very fragile.\r\n\r\nConsumer  confidence  is very fragile.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nretailers  still  struggling  to  survive  and  many  are\r\n\r\nseriously thinking of closing shop.  If forced to survive\r\n\r\nin  this harsh environment, many will be forced to review\r\n\r\nthe  one  area of expenditure over which they  have  some\r\n\r\nmeasure  of control, and that is labour cost.   With  the\r\n\r\nretail sector employing more than 75,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers,  any untimely increase of the GST to  2%  during\r\n\r\nthis period of economic recession will definitely lead to\r\n\r\nfurther job losses and cause more unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe to the Government and civil servants, this is\r\n\r\njust  an  increase in the statistics.  But to the  person\r\n\r\nwho   is   retrenched,  it  means  job  loss,   financial\r\n\r\ninsecurity and lots of bills will go unpaid.  It  affects\r\n\r\nnot  just  the  employee  but his  immediate  family  and\r\n\r\nfriends  who will then pull back and tighten their  belts\r\n\r\neven  further.  And, irrationally, the retrenched  worker\r\n\r\nwill  remember that he is jobless because the company  is\r\n\r\nforced  to  cut costs, because times are bad and  GST  is\r\n\r\nstill  increased.  But, now, I am happy to say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has listened to the cries of the people.   My\r\n\r\nonly hope is that the GST rate will stay at the 4% level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the economy and save jobs, demand should be\r\n\r\nstimulated  in  this difficult time.  Thus,  keeping  the\r\n\r\noffset packages and giving out the ERS shares is one step\r\n\r\nin  this  right direction.  It is expansionary  and  will\r\n\r\nhelp   to  boost  the  economy.   The  priority  in  this\r\n\r\nuncertain time should be, first, saving existing jobs and\r\n\r\nthen creating more of others.  I thank the Government for\r\n\r\nnot forgetting that this is what it pledged to the people\r\n\r\nat the November elections last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not help that the economic tax restructuring\r\n\r\nmay  create some new high-tech jobs but, in the  process,\r\n\r\ncause many more traditional jobs especially in retail, to\r\n\r\nbe  lost.   As  it is, there is already a high  job/skill\r\n\r\nmismatch  in  Singapore.  Let us not  make  it  worse  by\r\n\r\ncausing   more   traditional  jobs   to   be   lost   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, while more foreign workers are employed  to\r\n\r\nfill the high-tech new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though not completely satisfied or ideal, I\r\n\r\nwill  reluctantly support the Government  in  phasing  in\r\n\r\nthis GST increase and hope that it will be reviewed after\r\n\r\none year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not here when the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nannounced that the full 2%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  in GST will not be implemented, but  rather  to\r\n\r\nphase  in 1% increase first, and the other one percentage\r\n\r\npoint I do not know when.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Anyway, with the 1% increase, I\r\n\r\nstill  think that the majority of Singaporeans  shall  be\r\n\r\nentering  the New Year with long faces.  If there  is  no\r\n\r\nincrease, then it will be a big welcome for the New Year.\r\n\r\nEven   now,   many  Singaporeans  are  already  suffering\r\n\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing is that if the Government is not\r\n\r\nvery certain whether to increase it by 2% or 1%, why does\r\n\r\nit  want  to  go  on  with  the  increase  at  all?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment complains that it would lose revenue.  I think\r\n\r\nit  is something like $1.3 billion from the reduction  in\r\n\r\ncorporate and personal income tax.  But now, probably  it\r\n\r\nhas changed its mind and said that it can absorb some  of\r\n\r\nthe  losses.   Therefore, not a 2% increase but  only  1%\r\n\r\nincrease in GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the Government has got huge surpluses\r\n\r\nand  it is definitely not in deficit.  But as Jennie Tay,\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Retailers' Association, has  said,  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  businesses  in  Singapore  are  already   in\r\n\r\ndeficit.  In  fact,  during my meet-the-people  sessions,\r\n\r\nmany of the residents have come to tell me that they have\r\n\r\nlost their jobs and that they cannot pay their children's\r\n\r\nschool  fees  and their utilities bills.   As  a  result,\r\n\r\ntheir lights and water supply were cut off.  I am certain\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be many others with a similar  fate  in\r\n\r\nother  constituencies.  Those families, with  lights  and\r\n\r\nwater  supply cut off, are not living in the first world,\r\n\r\nas  the PAP has touted.  But they are still living in the\r\n\r\nthird  world  without  the  benefit  of  electricity  and\r\n\r\nrunning  water from the taps in their homes.   At  least,\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore  was in the third world, residents  could\r\n\r\nstill  go to the roadside standpipe to take water.  These\r\n\r\ndays,  there is no public water supply.  They must go  to\r\n\r\ntheir neighbours for water which can be very embarrassing\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy, of course, that the 2% GST increase\r\n\r\nhas not been implemented,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  only  1%.   Still,  1% is 1%  more  than  is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in Singapore have lost their jobs. It\r\n\r\nwas  reported  in  the papers that about  4.8%  or  about\r\n\r\n100,000  of  our workers are unemployed and the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  does  not look good and the situation  is  not\r\n\r\nimproving.  There is talk of double dip this  year.   The\r\n\r\nwar   in  Iraq  is  looming  and  oil  prices  may   rise\r\n\r\ndrastically, which does not help the US economy  at  all,\r\n\r\nand  which is not good for us because our businesses  are\r\n\r\ndependent on the US economy.  The economies of the region\r\n\r\nare  also in dire straits and, in the circumstances, they\r\n\r\ndo not help us either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have written to the press and say that\r\n\r\nthis  GST increase does not help us at all.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  time, the people must be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nspend  and  not  save.   And  if  the  GST  increase   is\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  full,  there will  definitely  be  price\r\n\r\nincreases  in  goods and services.  With higher  consumer\r\n\r\nprices, of course, people will spend less.  In these hard\r\n\r\neconomic  times, people should be encouraged to spend  so\r\n\r\nas  to  revive  the economy, and not to spend  less.   It\r\n\r\nwould appear that if the GST were to be increased by  1%,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is, in fact, making things worse and  not\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all of our retailers, from statistics taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Straits Times in a recent poll, complained  that\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are  poor  and the  rentals  are  high.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment, being the biggest land owner in Singapore, is\r\n\r\nnot  setting  an example of lowering rentals of  business\r\n\r\npremises.  In fact, the Government's policy appears to me\r\n\r\nto be just to accumulate wealth for itself.  The question\r\n\r\nis:   what  is  the point of accumulating so much  wealth\r\n\r\nwhen  it  does not use it in time of need for the people?\r\n\r\nThe  people are definitely in need of assistance now  and\r\n\r\nthe Government should show some care and compassion.  And\r\n\r\nI  would  advocate that the Government not only continues\r\n\r\nwith the various relief programmes, pay out the ERS,  and\r\n\r\nas announced now, it has put on hold 1% of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase, something of course  is  better  than\r\n\r\ncompletely nothing, so 1% is some improvement on  the  2%\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if the 2% implementation of the GST\r\n\r\nwas  postponed for one year, it would definitely help the\r\n\r\neconomy,  and  especially  the  retailers  will  be   the\r\n\r\nhappiest  people  in  Singapore.   If  there  is  a  hike\r\n\r\nrestraint, to a certain extent it will ease the  flow  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to Johor Bahru to do their shopping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent the Government has heeded the plea of\r\n\r\nthe  people  this  time, but the point  I  think  I  made\r\n\r\nearlier  is  that if the Government is unsure of  itself,\r\n\r\nwhy does it want to increase the GST at all?\r\n\r\n<br>2.18 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers for their contributions.  May I now pick out some\r\n\r\nof the points which they raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor talked about small businesses and the\r\n\r\nneed  to  give them rental rebates.  I agree.  These  are\r\n\r\nthings  which  are  being done by JTC  and  HDB.   It  is\r\n\r\nseparate from the GST package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan talked about why balance the\r\n\r\nbudget.  I think this is quite a fundamental point.   Why\r\n\r\ndo  we  need  to  live within our means  to  balance  the\r\n\r\nbudget?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's fiscal stance is one which we have\r\n\r\nto   fit  to  the  state  of  the  economy  and  to   our\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  We can live beyond our means for a   time\r\n\r\nor in an emergency, but eventually the chickens come home\r\n\r\nto roost and we have to pay for what we have spent.  When\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is  in a recession, and there  is  a  major\r\n\r\ndownturn, then it is right for us to run a budget deficit\r\n\r\nbecause  you cannot raise the same amount of  taxes,  you\r\n\r\nare  going  to squeeze businesses, you need to  stimulate\r\n\r\nthe economy, get it going again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the economy is at an even keel, it is not in a\r\n\r\nrecession,  if  you routinely run a budget  deficit,  you\r\n\r\nwill have a very serious problem because soon you will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborrowing  money, your credit will not be worth  what  it\r\n\r\nsays  it  is,  and  as I have explained  just  now,  your\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar will go down, inflation will go up, your\r\n\r\nsavings,  the value will go too, because your CPF  is  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollars, and if the dollars  are  worth  less,\r\n\r\nyour  savings will be worth less.  So when we live within\r\n\r\nour  means, and try and maintain a balanced budget,  say,\r\n\r\nnext year, it is because we think that is about the right\r\n\r\nlevel   to   manage  the  economy  and  to  provide   the\r\n\r\nstimulation which is needed, not more, not less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we are not running a surplus, contrary to\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr Chiam said.  We are running a deficit this year.\r\n\r\nWe also ran a deficit last year.  But next year, I think,\r\n\r\nat  best, we can do a balanced budget, if you have  heard\r\n\r\nwhat I said.  I said I do not think we are going to get a\r\n\r\nsurplus, at best, we aim for a balanced budget.  We  try,\r\n\r\nbut we will have to see the circumstances in order to  do\r\n\r\nit.   If we go on the basis that we can spend because  we\r\n\r\nhave  reserves, I think the reserves will soon  be  gone,\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans will be much the sadder for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we do have to be sympathetic and we have to feel\r\n\r\nwith  our hearts as well as think with our minds, but  it\r\n\r\nis necessary to be logical and pragmatic and I am sure Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan, as a lawyer, will agree that logic is  not\r\n\r\nirrelevant, and that is why we have to work out a package\r\n\r\nwhich  makes sense, which is what we have proposed  -  to\r\n\r\nphase in the increase but not to postpone it altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon was generally supportive of the\r\n\r\nchange we made and I am grateful to him for skipping many\r\n\r\npages of his speech.  We too know how to be grateful  for\r\n\r\nsmall  mercies.  I should like to correct one point which\r\n\r\nMr Tan made which was that unemployment is up 4.8%, it is\r\n\r\na record, and it is 100,000 people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is not a record because we have\r\n\r\nbeen  more than 4.8% before, for example, in the  1985/86\r\n\r\nrecession, we went all the way up to 6%.  Secondly, it is\r\n\r\nnot  100,000 unemployed.  It is 72,000 people unemployed.\r\n\r\n4.8% is a seasonally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadjusted  percentage, but the actual number of people  is\r\n\r\n72,000 unemployed.  Mr Chiam also quoted 100,000.  72,000\r\n\r\nis  more  than we would like to have, but we  should  not\r\n\r\nexaggerate  the extent of our problem and talk  ourselves\r\n\r\ninto a gloom and a funk.  The saving grace for us is that\r\n\r\neven  though  people are unemployed, the  work  is  still\r\n\r\navailable,  jobs  are  still available.   We  still  have\r\n\r\nforeign workers here because employers are unable to find\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to go and do the jobs.  And particularly the\r\n\r\nsmaller  and  medium enterprises who  would  like  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness on a small scale, they find it very hard to  get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to go and work for them.  Maybe  the  hours\r\n\r\nare  a bit irregular, maybe the wages are a bit low,  but\r\n\r\nif  you  are  unemployed, and a job  is  available,  then\r\n\r\nbetter  to have the job rather than not to do it at  all.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think our solution for the unemployment  problem,\r\n\r\nwhile we have to help those who are in a desperate state,\r\n\r\nat  the same time, we have to encourage all of the people\r\n\r\nwho  are out of work to look for work and to take up  the\r\n\r\njobs which are available and some of them which they  can\r\n\r\ndo, even if it is not ideal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So although Mr Tan talked about reinstating the\r\n\r\nEDRS, as I had explained earlier, I think that we do  not\r\n\r\nneed  to  do it for now because we have enough  means  to\r\n\r\nhelp the unemployed and the people who need help.  But if\r\n\r\nthere  is  another crisis we will examine  the  situation\r\n\r\nand, if it is necessary, we will re-introduce the EDRS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema talked about reviewing the HDB upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme because that would be additional expenditure by\r\n\r\npeople  at this time.  I think it is something which  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development will be considering and\r\n\r\nwhich  many MPs will be considering when the propositions\r\n\r\nare put to them because finally to do the upgrading, main\r\n\r\nupgrading or lift upgrading, the residents have  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  it and have to agree to want it.  And if they do not\r\n\r\nwant  it, it does not proceed.  If the MP says it is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  even to put it to the residents,  you  do  not\r\n\r\nproceed.   But some residents still want it, and  if  you\r\n\r\nwill remember\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier  this  afternoon,  we  were  talking  about  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading  and some MPs were pressing us to proceed  even\r\n\r\nthough  the  residents did not vote for it.  So  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  are  contradictory pushes in different directions,\r\n\r\nbut overall we will have to see how many of the upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes  we  can afford because it is not  just  money\r\n\r\nfrom the people, it is money from the Government, and  in\r\n\r\ntough times we have to consider how many we can afford.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema, Steve Chia and other MPs talked about the\r\n\r\nsmall retailers and their problems.  I think Dr Amy  Khor\r\n\r\nalso  made  the same point.  As I had explained  earlier,\r\n\r\nthey  do  have a structural problem which will take  some\r\n\r\ntime  to  be worked out.  The Members are concerned  that\r\n\r\nthe  extra  one percentage point on the GST  will  affect\r\n\r\nthem.   I think it may, to some extent, but on the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  they are not totally negatively affected.  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1% applies to all businesses - big and small.\r\n\r\nThe  big  ones have to pay, the small ones have  to  pay,\r\n\r\nmost of it, but not all of it.  And the reason is because\r\n\r\nthe small ones whose turnover is less than $1 million  do\r\n\r\nnot  pay  GST on their own part of their business.   They\r\n\r\nare GST exempt.  So in fact when you raise the GST by one\r\n\r\npercentage point the big shops are affected more severely\r\n\r\nthan  the  small shops.  So, relatively speaking,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  off for the small shops than before.  Of  course,\r\n\r\neverybody  would feel happier if we did not  have  to  do\r\n\r\nthis  at  all.  But if we do have to do it, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nburden on the small shop is less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not quite sure how Dr Amy Khor intended me to\r\n\r\nrespond  when she said that 1% they cannot  pass  on,  2%\r\n\r\nthey can pass on.  Does that mean she prefer to have a 2%\r\n\r\nincrease and that would solve the retailers' problem?   I\r\n\r\ndo not think so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Some businessmen prefer\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Some businessmen prefer that!\r\n\r\nWell,  if she thinks that is a better solution,  when  we\r\n\r\nmove the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment in the Committee stage I think we can look into\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  She might want to express her views  again.\r\n\r\nWe could even take a vote.  But I think 1% is better than\r\n\r\n2%.   There is some inconvenience.  The businessmen  have\r\n\r\nalso  expressed  it,  that  they  have  to  adjust  their\r\n\r\nsettings, their pricings, twice, but it cannot be helped.\r\n\r\nThese are trade-offs they have to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam talked about showing care and\r\n\r\ncompassion  and how the poor in Singapore are not  living\r\n\r\nin  the  first  world.  I think Mr Chiam will  know  that\r\n\r\nwhile   we  need  to  improve  the  conditions  for   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   and  especially  for  poor  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nsomebody living in Singapore, however poor, is in a much,\r\n\r\nmuch  better position than somebody living in China poor,\r\n\r\nor in Indonesia poor, or in India poor, or poor in nearly\r\n\r\nany  better part of the world, including in America.   We\r\n\r\nhave  gone  into  this before.  You  may  not  have  your\r\n\r\nrunning  water every day if you do not pay,  but  you  do\r\n\r\nhave  your running water available.  You do have a  house\r\n\r\nover  your head.  Your children have schools.   You  have\r\n\r\nmedical  care provided for you.  You have a  Medifund  if\r\n\r\nyou  cannot afford hospital charges.  Your MP looks after\r\n\r\nyou and come New Year, the MPs and the residents arrange,\r\n\r\nand  you  have hong baos and hampers, and I  am  sure  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  also arranges those.  We have a community in which\r\n\r\nthe poor are part of our community and we look after them\r\n\r\nand  we carry them along with us and help them to upgrade\r\n\r\nas the rest of Singapore upgrades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we say that this system has failed, I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  look  at the reality and do a  reality  check\r\n\r\nrather  than  just read off some speech  which  does  not\r\n\r\ncorrespond to what is happening on the ground.   We  have\r\n\r\nmade  a  significant move to phase out the GST - 4%  this\r\n\r\nyear, 5% on 1st January 2004.  I would not hold out hopes\r\n\r\nto  Members  that come 1st January 2004 we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  rethink and reconsider again.   I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nsubject will be discussed, but I should put down my cards\r\n\r\nclearly  to Members so that there is no misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThis is an adjustment which we are making this time so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we will take it in small steps.  1% is a small step\r\n\r\nnext year.  1% in 2004 is another small step.  We have to\r\n\r\ndo  it.  We will have to adjust other things if there are\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in the economy next year,  but  this  is  a\r\n\r\nstructural change which will help us to get out  of  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  which  will help us to create  more  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help us to recover and to grow in  the  long\r\n\r\nterm.   That is why I ask Members to support this  policy\r\n\r\nand to support the amendment I am going to propose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has given notice of an amendment  to\r\n\r\nthis clause.

The Bill  also  makes  several\r\n\r\namendments to update the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registration of Criminals Act provides for the\r\n\r\nregistration of criminals.  The Act enables the Police to\r\n\r\nrecord   into  the  Register  of  Criminals,  registrable\r\n\r\nparticulars  such as the photograph, finger  impressions,\r\n\r\nand  conviction records of persons convicted  of  serious\r\n\r\ncrimes  like  robbery,  assault and  housebreaking.   The\r\n\r\nRegister  of Criminals is a very useful tool  which  aids\r\n\r\nPolice  investigations.  The registrable particulars  are\r\n\r\nespecially  useful  in  helping the  Police  to  identify\r\n\r\nsuspects.   For example, finger impressions  lifted  from\r\n\r\ncrime  scenes  are  matched  against  finger  impressions\r\n\r\nrecorded  in  the Register, thus helping  the  Police  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  down the list of suspects.  The court also  makes\r\n\r\nuse  of  these criminal records when sentencing a  repeat\r\n\r\noffender.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Setting up of DNA Database</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we want to set up a DNA database? Sir, the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of a DNA database of criminals will  greatly\r\n\r\nenhance  the  Police's investigative  capabilities.   The\r\n\r\nprobability of two persons having identical DNA  profiles\r\n\r\nis  extremely low, and could be as remote  as  one  in  a\r\n\r\nbillion,  depending  on the race  of  the  person.   Body\r\n\r\nsamples,  such as blood, semen and tissue samples,  found\r\n\r\nat the crime scenes can be used to profile the DNA of the\r\n\r\nperson  to whom the body sample belongs.  Through  a  DNA\r\n\r\ndatabase  of criminals, Police will be able to  determine\r\n\r\nif a body sample found at the crime scene belongs to an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nex-criminal.   When  a  suspect is found,  it  will  also\r\n\r\nenable  the Police to match the DNA profile with that  of\r\n\r\nthe  suspect  to  help  narrow down  the  list  of  crime\r\n\r\nsuspects.   This  is especially useful  in  investigating\r\n\r\ncrimes with very few leads for the Police to work on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of DNA profiling to enhance forensic\r\n\r\ncapability  in  solving crime is not  new.   Foreign  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies, such as those in the  US,  UK  and\r\n\r\nAustralia,  have been using DNA profiling for many  years\r\n\r\nand DNA databases have been set up in these countries  to\r\n\r\naid police investigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill gives effect to the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the DNA database and the taking of  body\r\n\r\nsamples for the purpose of DNA profiling.  Clause 5  also\r\n\r\nspecifies  the  purposes  for  which  the  collected  DNA\r\n\r\ninformation may be used, namely, for forensic  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  other  DNA information and for any proceedings  for\r\n\r\nany offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of Body Sample</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a body sample? Sir, a body sample is\r\n\r\ndefined as a sample of blood, head hair with follicle and\r\n\r\na  swab  taken from a person's mouth.  Clause 5  empowers\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to prescribe the taking of any  other  body\r\n\r\nsamples, such as saliva and skin cells.  This is to cater\r\n\r\nfor  instances where it is not possible to obtain any one\r\n\r\nof  the three types of body samples from a person because\r\n\r\nthe  person  is a haemophiliac and suffering from  severe\r\n\r\nmouth  ulcers or is bald.  However, there would  be  very\r\n\r\nfew  cases where we would not be able to take any one  of\r\n\r\nthe three types of body samples from a person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Persons whom Body Samples may be taken from</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can Police take body samples from? Clause 5\r\n\r\nalso  empowers  the Police to take a body sample  from  a\r\n\r\nperson  who is arrested and accused of a crime  specified\r\n\r\nin the Act.  This ensures that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  is  able  to  compare the  accused  person's  DNA\r\n\r\ninformation with the DNA evidence found at the scene of a\r\n\r\ncrime.  A body sample may also be taken from a person who\r\n\r\nis  convicted  of  a  crime or is  currently  serving  an\r\n\r\nimprisonment  term.   However, those who  have  completed\r\n\r\ntheir  sentences when the Act comes into  operation  will\r\n\r\nnot be included as the Act will not apply retrospectively\r\n\r\nto this group of criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Who can give a Body Sample Voluntarily?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 also provides for persons who were at the\r\n\r\nscene  of  a crime, or are being questioned in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the investigation of a crime, to give body  samples\r\n\r\nvoluntarily.   In  practice, this provision  would  apply\r\n\r\nmostly to Police investigators who work at the scene of a\r\n\r\ncrime and is intended to eliminate their DNA from the DNA\r\n\r\nfound  at  the  scene.  The DNA from Police investigators\r\n\r\nwould  also be stored in the DNA database even after  the\r\n\r\ncase  is  closed.   This is because Police  investigators\r\n\r\nwould invariably investigate new cases and it is not cost\r\n\r\nefficient  or  effective  to re-take  body  samples  from\r\n\r\nPolice investigators for DNA profiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Who can take Body Samples?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 also provides that only trained persons,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  a  registered  medical  practitioner   or   an\r\n\r\nauthorised officer, who have received training in  taking\r\n\r\nbody  samples,  can  do  so.   In  practice,  all  Police\r\n\r\nofficers  would be trained on the proper and safe  taking\r\n\r\nof  body samples.  For example, Police officers would ask\r\n\r\na  person whether he is suffering from any blood disorder\r\n\r\nor  blood-related  disease.  If the  person  informs  the\r\n\r\nPolice  officer  that he is a haemophiliac  or  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  other  blood-related disease,  the  Police  officer\r\n\r\nwould take either a sample of the head hair with follicle\r\n\r\nor  a  swab from the person's mouth, rather than a  blood\r\n\r\nsample.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Act makes it a duty for every person\r\n\r\nlegally  bound  to  submit to having his  photograph  and\r\n\r\nfinger impression taken to do so.  Any such person who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  have  his photograph and  finger  impression\r\n\r\ntaken  shall  be  guilty  of an offence.   The  Act  also\r\n\r\nempowers the Police to use necessary force to obtain  the\r\n\r\nphotograph and finger impression.  Clause 5 extends these\r\n\r\nprovisions to make them applicable to the taking of  body\r\n\r\nsamples as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consent for the taking of Blood Samples</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must consent be sought before the taking of blood\r\n\r\nsamples?   Yes, consent must first be obtained  before  a\r\n\r\nblood  sample may be taken from a person who is  arrested\r\n\r\nand  accused of a crime.  However, there is no  need  for\r\n\r\nconsent to be obtained before head hair with follicle  or\r\n\r\na  swab from a person's mouth is taken for the purpose of\r\n\r\nDNA  profiling.  The difference in treatment  is  because\r\n\r\nthe  taking of blood from a person is more intrusive than\r\n\r\ntaking  of a head hair or a swab from the person's mouth.\r\n\r\nIf  a person refuses to give consent for his blood to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  and  offers  no good reason for the  refusal,  the\r\n\r\ncourt may order the person to give the blood sample.  The\r\n\r\ncourt may also draw inferences from the refusal and treat\r\n\r\nthe   refusal   as   corroboration,   or   amounting   to\r\n\r\ncorroboration, of any evidence against him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Persons Acquitted or Discharged</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to the body samples of persons\r\n\r\nacquitted or discharged?  Currently, the Act requires the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Criminals to destroy  the  photograph  and\r\n\r\nfinger  impression  of a person acquitted  or  discharged\r\n\r\nwithin  three  months  from  the  date  of  acquittal  or\r\n\r\ndischarge.  Similarly, clause 5 requires the Registrar to\r\n\r\nremove  the  DNA  information of a person  from  the  DNA\r\n\r\ndatabase   within  three  months  of  his  acquittal   or\r\n\r\ndischarge.    As  the  DNA  information  is   stored   in\r\n\r\nelectronic  form  in  the DNA database,  removal  of  the\r\n\r\ninformation  from  the  database  is  equivalent  to  the\r\n\r\ndestruction of a physical record like a photograph.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendments to\r\n\r\nfine-tune and to update the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments relating to the Keeping of Records</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Definitions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill introduces several new\r\n\r\ndefinitions,   namely   \"authorised   officer\",    \"other\r\n\r\nparticulars\" and \"photograph\". Currently, only police and\r\n\r\ncustoms  officers may exercise the powers under the  Act.\r\n\r\nThis  arrangement is not satisfactory because immigration\r\n\r\nofficers  have  to  seek  Police's  assistance  to   take\r\n\r\nregistrable   particulars   of   immigration    offenders\r\n\r\narrested.  Also, as the Health Sciences Authority will be\r\n\r\ncommissioned  to operate the DNA database, officers  from\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Sciences Authority must also be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ntake  body  samples.  The new definition  of  \"authorised\r\n\r\nofficer\"  has  thus  been amended to  cover  the  police,\r\n\r\nimmigration, customs and other law enforcement  officers,\r\n\r\nand  a person so appointed by the Commissioner of Police.\r\n\r\nWhile the power to take registrable particulars and  body\r\n\r\nsamples would be extended to all immigration officers and\r\n\r\nofficers from the Health Sciences Authority, in practice,\r\n\r\nonly  those  officers tasked with the  responsibility  to\r\n\r\ntake  registrable particulars and who have  received  the\r\n\r\nproper training will be allowed to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, \"registrable particulars\" means the\r\n\r\nparticulars  of  any  conviction,  sentence,  banishment,\r\n\r\nexpulsion  or  deportation, and  any  name,  description,\r\n\r\nphotograph,  or  finger  impression  of  any  person   so\r\n\r\nconvicted, sentenced, banished, expelled or deported,  as\r\n\r\nthe  case may be.  However, the Act also empowers prisons\r\n\r\nofficers  to  record a more detailed description  of  the\r\n\r\nprisoner  convicted of a crime, such as his sex,  age  or\r\n\r\napparent  age,  bodily  appearance,  height,  distinctive\r\n\r\nmarks  on  his  body and any other available  information\r\n\r\nthat helps to identify the prisoner.  Such information is\r\n\r\nvery  helpful in identifying a person, especially when  a\r\n\r\nvictim  is  trying  to identify the  culprit.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  a  new  definition  of  \"other  particulars\"  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to  enable  the authorised officers  to  record\r\n\r\ninformation   other  than  the  registrable  particulars.\r\n\r\nAlso, a new definition of \"photograph\" is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposed  to  enable  the  authorised  officers  to  take\r\n\r\nphotographs, including distinguishable body  marks,  such\r\n\r\nas  tattoos  and  scars, which would be very  useful  for\r\n\r\nidentifying criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Upgrading of Automated Fingerprint Identification System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police is upgrading the Automated Fingerprint\r\n\r\nIdentification  System, or AFIS in short,  to  allow  for\r\n\r\nelectronic   capturing  of  finger   impressions.    When\r\n\r\nupgraded,  the new AFIS will enable Police to search  and\r\n\r\nmatch   finger  impressions  more  quickly.    Currently,\r\n\r\nsections  8,  9 and 10 of the Act make reference  to  the\r\n\r\nsheet  of paper upon which the finger impression is made.\r\n\r\nWhen the new AFIS is implemented, finger impressions will\r\n\r\nbe  captured electronically, instead of onto a  sheet  of\r\n\r\npaper.  Clause 3 repeals and re-enacts sections 8, 9  and\r\n\r\n10  to  do away with the reference to the sheet of  paper\r\n\r\nupon which the finger impression is made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increase  in penalty for refusal to submit to  taking  of photograph and finger impression</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current penalty for refusing, without\r\n\r\nreasonable  excuse, to submit to the taking of photograph\r\n\r\nand  finger impression is a fine not exceeding $250 or  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  imprisonment term of one month.   This  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  changed since 1949 when the Act was first  enacted.\r\n\r\nClause  4  therefore increases the fine to a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$1,000 to take into account rises in income level and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the deterrent effect.  No change is proposed for\r\n\r\nthe imprisonment term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal  of registrable particulars of persons  aged  100 years or more</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Registrar would remove the\r\n\r\nregistrable  particulars  of  persons  whose   death   is\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Registration of Births  and  Deaths\r\n\r\nAct.   However,  as  foreign offenders  who  die  do  not\r\n\r\nregister under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act,\r\n\r\nthe Register still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontains  records of foreign persons who may have  passed\r\n\r\naway.   For example, the Register now holds 18  names  of\r\n\r\nforeign persons who are over 100 years old but the police\r\n\r\nis  not  able to determine if these foreigners are  still\r\n\r\nalive.   Clause  6  therefore empowers the  Registrar  to\r\n\r\nremove  the registrable particulars from the register  of\r\n\r\ncriminals  and DNA information from the DNA  database  of\r\n\r\nany  person  aged 100 years or older or whose  death  has\r\n\r\nbeen  registered  under the Registration  of  Births  and\r\n\r\nDeaths Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, technology advancements have opened new ways\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  fight crime.  The police must harness  these\r\n\r\ntechnological  advances to enhance  its  capabilities  to\r\n\r\nstay  ahead  of  criminals.  The  DNA  database  and  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of the AFIS will go a long way in improving the\r\n\r\npolice's ability to fight and solve crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, this proposed Bill, as the Minister stated, seeks to\r\n\r\namend  the Registration of Criminals Act.  That seems  to\r\n\r\nbe an innocuous enough Bill.  But the proposed amendments\r\n\r\nin the Bill actually go beyond mere registration.  It has\r\n\r\nprovisions that affect those who may be only suspected of\r\n\r\na  crime,  but  not yet charged, tried or convicted.   It\r\n\r\ninvolves criminal procedures to obtain blood samples  and\r\n\r\nother  body  samples  from  suspects,  as  distinct  from\r\n\r\nconvicted persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the application of the provisions to suspects,\r\n\r\nthe title of the Act is somewhat misleading.  My reaction\r\n\r\nto  this is one of unease, because in provisions relating\r\n\r\nto criminal procedure, it has always been the practice to\r\n\r\nenact  those  provisions in the Criminal Procedure  Code,\r\n\r\nwhere  there is a comprehensive code covering all aspects\r\n\r\nof criminal procedure and investigation.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nsomewhat   inappropriate  to  find  matters  of  criminal\r\n\r\nprocedure  dealing in an Act which has a  very  innocuous\r\n\r\ntitle called Registration of Criminals.  In any case,  if\r\n\r\nsomeone asked what does that suggest to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na   layman,   it   suggests  registration  of   convicted\r\n\r\ncriminals,  not  of  suspects.   So,  I  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nopportunity will be taken to re-enact such provisions and\r\n\r\nto  take them out of the Registration of Criminals Act in\r\n\r\ndue course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, naturally I would want to express my support\r\n\r\nin  the setting up of this new DNA database as a means to\r\n\r\ncombat crime.  I think it is a good idea.  But there  are\r\n\r\na  couple  of  concerns  that I  hope  the  Minister  can\r\n\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Minister has already explained\r\n\r\nthat in the case of blood and body samples, which involve\r\n\r\nan  invasive  procedure in obtaining  such  samples,  the\r\n\r\nconsent of the suspect must be obtained.  But, of course,\r\n\r\nhe  then  went  on  to  say that if the  consent  is  not\r\n\r\nforthcoming,  the  suspect  can  then  be  taken   to   a\r\n\r\nmagistrate and, there, the court can order the sample  to\r\n\r\nbe taken.  With that I have no objections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is the additional sanction provided\r\n\r\nin  the Act which is that if the suspect did not consent,\r\n\r\nadverse inferences could be drawn against him in terms of\r\n\r\nhis liability or his guilt relating to the taking of such\r\n\r\nsamples.   In  the  past, drawing of adverse  inferences,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  laid  down in the  Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode, requires a warning to be given to the suspect  that\r\n\r\nif  he did not give an explanation or a good reason,  the\r\n\r\ncourt  may draw adverse inferences against him.   But  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular  proposed amendment, there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nwarning enacted, as can be found, eg, in the CPC (section\r\n\r\n122).   Therefore, a suspect may not really know what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on.  There would be no means of putting him  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to be informed that adverse inferences could  be\r\n\r\ndrawn against him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that in the enacting, not so much of this\r\n\r\nBill,  but  in the enacting of the rules concerning  this\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Minister  would take the  chance  to  put  in\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating to warning, as far as  this  consent\r\n\r\nelement is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to raise a matter which I hope would\r\n\r\nhave been dealt with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill but which has not so far materialised.   In\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  debate earlier this year, a number  of  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers,  including  myself, had  brought  up  the  issue\r\n\r\nwhether  people who are convicted of minor crimes  should\r\n\r\nnot,  after  a  period  of time, have  their  particulars\r\n\r\nremoved  from the Register of Criminals.  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  have always been problems for  them  finding\r\n\r\njobs,  and  they were hardly given a chance by  employers\r\n\r\nand who are always, it seems to me, adversely affected by\r\n\r\nthe stigma of having been convicted of a crime, no matter\r\n\r\nhow minor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had explained that the removal of\r\n\r\nparticulars  from  the Register today in  the  Bill  only\r\n\r\nrelates  to those 100 years and above, and do not  really\r\n\r\ntake  into account this category of persons who have just\r\n\r\nbeen convicted of minor offences.  I hope the opportunity\r\n\r\nwill be taken to amend the Act relating to this group  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those concerns, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nRegistration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill introduces the\r\n\r\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests into the criminal  law.\r\n\r\nThe  DNA information, ie, the genetic information derived\r\n\r\nfrom  the forensic DNA analysis of a body sample is being\r\n\r\nintroduced to assist the law enforcement agencies and the\r\n\r\nprosecuting   authorities  to  investigate   and   obtain\r\n\r\nevidence  against  accused  persons.   There  is  also  a\r\n\r\nprovision  in the proposed section, ie, section  13(C)(3)\r\n\r\nwhich provides as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where it is shown that the appropriate consent\r\n\r\nrequired under subsection (1) for the taking of a  sample\r\n\r\nof  blood  from a person was refused without good  cause,\r\n\r\nthe court, in determining -\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether to commit that person for trial in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the crime of which  he  is  accused  of\r\n\r\ncommitting;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether there is a case to answer against that\r\n\r\nperson; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether that person is guilty of the crime with\r\n\r\nwhich he has been charged,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nmay  draw  such inference from the refusal as  it  thinks\r\n\r\nproper  and,  based  on  such inference,  may  treat  the\r\n\r\nrefusal as corroboration or amounting to corroboration of\r\n\r\nany relevant evidence against that person.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am in agreement with Assoc. Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  Tet  Yung who made the observation that this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore the introduction here of an\r\n\r\nalmost  or close to the concept of \"presumption of guilt\"\r\n\r\nin  a  sense, if the accused does not cooperate in giving\r\n\r\nhis DNA sample.  Because of these powers being conferred,\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement and prosecuting authorities must  ensure\r\n\r\nthere  are  enough  safeguards  and  proper  checks   and\r\n\r\nbalances  so  that there is no opportunity for  potential\r\n\r\nabuse  to the detriment of accused persons, and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is proper administration of justice according\r\n\r\nto the rule of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be prudent that proper warnings\r\n\r\nof  adverse inference be administered to the arrested  or\r\n\r\naccused person along the lines of section 122(6)  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code about adverse inference  and,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case, with the appropriate modifications of course.\r\n\r\nSection 122(6) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where any person is charged with an offence or\r\n\r\nofficially informed that he may be prosecuted for it,  he\r\n\r\nshall be served with a notice in writing, which shall  be\r\n\r\nexplained to him to the following effect:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You have been charged with/informed that you may be\r\n\r\nprosecuted for ...' and the charge is set out.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the question will be asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Do you wish to say anything in answer to the\r\n\r\ncharge?  If there is any fact on which you intend to rely\r\n\r\nin  your defence in court, you are advised to mention  it\r\n\r\nnow.   If  you  hold it back till you go to  court,  your\r\n\r\nevidence  may be less likely to be believed and this  may\r\n\r\nhave  a bad effect on your case in general.  If you  wish\r\n\r\nto  mention  any fact now, and you would like it  written\r\n\r\ndown, this will be done.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a precautionary measure that is very\r\n\r\nuseful,  and  the courts would take into cognisance  this\r\n\r\nfact whether the accused did give his defence or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 3 relating to\r\n\r\nsection  10(b)  of  the Act could  also  be  modified  as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(b) the Registrar shall cause the finger\r\n\r\nimpressions, photographs and registrable particulars that\r\n\r\nhe  had  received in respect of that person under section\r\n\r\n8(c) to be destroyed ...\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand I would add these words:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... and the Registrar shall notify in writing to\r\n\r\nthat person within 14 days\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure fairness to that person who has\r\n\r\nbeen  acquitted or discharged without a conviction  being\r\n\r\nrecorded   against  him.   It  is  also  to  ensure   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the Registrar of the Register of Criminals,\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure that he complies expeditiously  with  the\r\n\r\nduties under this Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest, as an alternative, that a\r\n\r\nprovision be added to require the Registrar to return the\r\n\r\nrecord   of   photographs  and  finger  impressions   and\r\n\r\nregistrable particulars to the person concerned.   If  he\r\n\r\nor  she  does  not  want them, then the  Registrar  shall\r\n\r\ndestroy them.  This was the case when the Registration of\r\n\r\nCriminals  Act  was  passed in 1949  in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil of the Colony of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 gives far-reaching powers to the\r\n\r\n\"authorised  officer in charge\" to take body  samples  of\r\n\r\npersons arrested and accused of a crime, or convicted  of\r\n\r\na  crime,  or  is  serving his term  of  imprisonment  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with a crime of which he has been  convicted.\r\n\r\nThese are provided for in the proposed section 13B of the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy of the DNA tests and the proper and\r\n\r\ncompetent  management  of  the  samples  taken  must   be\r\n\r\nobserved carefully, and it is the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Government authorities that there is absolutely\r\n\r\nno  abuse.   Are  we absolutely sure that DNA  tests  are\r\n\r\naccurate  enough?  Do we have enough competent  officers,\r\n\r\nboth  scientific and law enforcement officers,  to  carry\r\n\r\nout these tasks?  There must be proper training for these\r\n\r\nofficers,  so that the system is respected.   I  do  hope\r\n\r\nthat  investigating authorities would still rely  on  the\r\n\r\nage-old tool of proper and thorough investigation in  any\r\n\r\ncase, big or small, to arrive at the truth of any case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now refer to clause 6 (section\r\n\r\n13H), which provides as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Registrar shall remove from the register and\r\n\r\nfrom the DNA database the registrable particulars and DNA\r\n\r\ninformation of any person -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whose death has been registered under the\r\n\r\nRegistration of Births and Deaths Act (Cap. 267); or\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) who, the Registrar is satisfied, has attained\r\n\r\n100 years of age.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nThis  so-called concession is really of very little value\r\n\r\nto  the  person  whose  registrable particulars  and  DNA\r\n\r\ninformation  are  kept by the said  Registrar.   I  would\r\n\r\npropose  that  for  the  details about  the  \"registrable\r\n\r\nparticulars\" the age should be reduced from 100 years to,\r\n\r\nsay,  55, or use a different criterion, namely, to remove\r\n\r\nthe \"registrable particulars\" 10 years after the date  of\r\n\r\nconviction by a court of law (for non-custodial cases) or\r\n\r\n10  years from release from prison.  Most human beings do\r\n\r\nnot live beyond 80 years of age and, therefore, 100 years\r\n\r\nis not a practical age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal I am suggesting will give a more\r\n\r\nrealistic  approach to wanting to give a clean  slate  to\r\n\r\nthe  convicted  person and to remove the stigma  and  bad\r\n\r\nimage  that is connected to any form of criminal  record.\r\n\r\nEveryone  deserves a second chance in life and  hopefully\r\n\r\nthrough  such  amendments,  the  State  is  seen  to   be\r\n\r\ncompassionate  and caring to its citizens  who  may  have\r\n\r\ncommitted some crime at a younger age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nsecond  is  whether  when consent is  not  given  by  the\r\n\r\nperson,   then   should   an   appropriate   warning   be\r\n\r\nadministered.   The  third is whether we  have  competent\r\n\r\npersons  to  handle this and whether the  procedures  are\r\n\r\ntight to make sure that there will be no abuses and  that\r\n\r\nproper  procedures are followed.  The fourth is regarding\r\n\r\nthe  purging  of records of people who are registered  on\r\n\r\nthe  Register  of  Criminals.  Let  me  deal  with  these\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the procedure part of it, what we are doing now\r\n\r\nis  not  different from what is provided for in the  Act.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in  the  case  of  finger  impression  and\r\n\r\nphotograph,   these  are  clearly   laid   out   in   the\r\n\r\nRegistration of Criminals Act.  What we have added in the\r\n\r\nBill is the taking of body samples.  By body samples,  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  head  hair follicle or a buckle  swab  in  the\r\n\r\nmouth.   For these two body samples, they do not  require\r\n\r\nthe  consent of the person.  The Police could just do it,\r\n\r\njust  like  what  they do now for finger  impression  and\r\n\r\nphotograph.  It is only when the Police want  to  take  a\r\n\r\nbody  sample, like a blood sample, then consent  must  be\r\n\r\nsought because we consider taking of blood samples to  be\r\n\r\na  bit more intrusive.  But, in practice, it is not  like\r\n\r\nthe  case where you need to see a doctor, and he  puts  a\r\n\r\nsyringe into your vein and takes out whatever millilitres\r\n\r\nof  blood.   It  is  just  like what  you  do  for  blood\r\n\r\ngrouping, where the nurse uses a little needle  to  prick\r\n\r\nyour  finger and take a little sample of blood.  That  is\r\n\r\nall that is to do it.  It is not that bad.  For those who\r\n\r\ndo  blood grouping, and I am sure many of them would have\r\n\r\ndone so, this is not going to hurt them a lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the suspect refuses to give that consent, he\r\n\r\ncan  be  brought to court and the court may order him  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  blood sample.  And if he still refuses,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  appropriate warning will be given and inferences\r\n\r\nwill  be  drawn by the court for his refusal  to  provide\r\n\r\nthat blood sample.  But if the blood sample is not taken,\r\n\r\nthere  are two other methods, for example, the head  hair\r\n\r\nfollicle or the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuckle  swab,  or if not, it could be saliva.   It  could\r\n\r\nalso  be  skin  cells.   So let me settle  this  question\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is whether the procedures are tight enough. The\r\n\r\nprocedures  will certainly be very tight.   For  example,\r\n\r\nfor  the  taking of a blood sample, it will  be  properly\r\n\r\nrecorded.   It is sealed in a box and it will  be  stored\r\n\r\nproperly and brought to HSA.  Only HSA officers have  the\r\n\r\nkey  to  open that box and they will compare the list  of\r\n\r\nblood  samples with the names provided by the  Police  as\r\n\r\nrecorded  by  the  Police.  As I have said  earlier,  the\r\n\r\npeople who need to take the samples will be trained.   It\r\n\r\nis not a very difficult thing to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the purging of records, I have said before\r\n\r\nthat  we are reviewing the Registration of Criminals  Act\r\n\r\nto  see how we can consider some records as spent.   Then\r\n\r\nthe  court  may  no longer take cognisance  of  them  and\r\n\r\nPolice  may not use them.  But this is still under review\r\n\r\nand therefore I will not be able to give an answer today.\r\n\r\nBut at an appropriate time, when the review is completed,\r\n\r\nI will share more of that review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to returning the record of persons who are\r\n\r\nsubsequently  acquitted, as raised by Mr  Chandra  Mohan,\r\n\r\nthis  need  not  be  done.  The  records  are  stored  by\r\n\r\nelectronic means.  So, the only way is to delete them.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see  how they can be returned.  The Police  will\r\n\r\ntake  action  to  delete the record when  the  person  is\r\n\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was also asked by Mr Mohan whether DNA\r\n\r\ntest  is a good test.  I have already explained that  DNA\r\n\r\ntest provides the probability of an identical DNA only in\r\n\r\nthe  case of one in a billion.  In fact, depending on the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  multiple markers used, it can be one  in  250\r\n\r\nbillion.   It will be much more accurate than that  of  a\r\n\r\nfinger impression.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES (RELIEF FROM INCOME</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>TAX) (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion\r\n\r\nIncentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, or the EEI  Act,\r\n\r\nin  short.  The Bill gives legislative effect to two  tax\r\n\r\nchanges   which  were  announced  in  the   2002   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,   as  well  as  the  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur Investment Incentive Scheme.  It will  also\r\n\r\nmake  consequential amendments arising from other changes\r\n\r\nto the Income Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes serve to enhance the attractiveness of\r\n\r\nexisting  tax incentives, and make them more flexible  to\r\n\r\nbetter  meet  the  needs of businesses.  They  will  also\r\n\r\nsupport the development of the technopreneurial sector in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe each of the proposed amendments\r\n\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment  to  Development and  Expansion  Incentive  Tax Rates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 6 of the Bill amends the relevant\r\n\r\nsection  of the EEI Act to reduce the tax rate under  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Expansion Incentive (or  DEI  in  short)\r\n\r\nfrom not less than the current 10%, to not less than  5%.\r\n\r\nThe  DEI  was  introduced in 1996 to  replace  the  post-pioneer  incentive.  Currently, a company that  qualifies\r\n\r\nfor  the DEI is taxed at a rate of not less than  10%  on\r\n\r\nincome derived from qualifying activities.  The reduction\r\n\r\nof  the  DEI rate to 5% would allow our economic agencies\r\n\r\ngreater flexibility in administering the DEI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a company may currently have a mix of\r\n\r\nDEI  and Pioneer incentives for different projects at 10%\r\n\r\nand 0% tax rates respectively.  The company may now\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napply to EDB to convert its current incentives granted on\r\n\r\nthe  project basis to a single tax rate of, say, 5%  DEI,\r\n\r\non  a  company  basis  instead, for  all  its  qualifying\r\n\r\nactivities.   This will obviate the need for the  company\r\n\r\nto   keep  separate  accounts  for  different  incentives\r\n\r\nawarded  for  each qualifying activity, thereby  reducing\r\n\r\nthe  compliance  costs  for  businesses.   It  will  also\r\n\r\nprovide  the  company  with  greater  certainty  of   the\r\n\r\nbenefits when it invests in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Unlimited Flow-Through of Tax-Exempt Dividends</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clauses 2, 4, 7 through 10 and 13 of the\r\n\r\nBill  amend  the  EEI Act to provide for unlimited  flow-through  of  tax-exempt dividends for incentives  granted\r\n\r\nunder the EEI Act to the final shareholders, without  any\r\n\r\nminimum   shareholding  requirements.    Currently,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  a company receiving tax-exempt dividend  income\r\n\r\nunder  the EEI Act is able to pay an exempt dividend  out\r\n\r\nof such income to its shareholders only if:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it holds not less than 50% of the shares of the\r\n\r\ndividend  paying  company (unless a  lower  threshold  is\r\n\r\napproved); and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the exempt dividend is paid on shares of a non-preferential nature.\r\n\r\nIn  most instances, the second tier holding company would\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to  flow  through  the  exemption  to  its\r\n\r\nshareholders.   With the tax change, such dividend  would\r\n\r\nnow  flow through as tax-exempt dividend to all tiers  of\r\n\r\nshareholders, regardless of shareholding level.  This tax\r\n\r\nchange  enhances  the  tax benefits available  under  the\r\n\r\nvarious  incentive schemes and simplifies the  compliance\r\n\r\nrequirements  under  the schemes.   The  unlimited  flow-through  of  exempt  dividends  applies  to  all   credit\r\n\r\nbalances in the exempt dividend account of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above unlimited flow-through of tax-exempt dividends, these clauses also treat payment of\r\n\r\nexempt  dividends  as  having  been  distributed  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders in accordance with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproportion  of  their shareholdings in a  company.   They\r\n\r\nalso   provide  for  dividends  paid  on  shares   of   a\r\n\r\npreferential nature, to be deemed as interest  income  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of shareholders and, in certain circumstances,\r\n\r\nas interest expense in the hands of a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Technopreneurship Investment Incentive Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to clause 14 of the Bill. It inserts\r\n\r\na  new  Part XIIIC, comprising sections 97S to 97Z, which\r\n\r\ngive   legal   effect  to  the  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur Investment Incentive (TII).  The TII  eases\r\n\r\nthe  difficulty faced by high-tech start-ups in obtaining\r\n\r\ncapital  investment in their initial phase of growth,  by\r\n\r\nproviding  investors  of qualifying  start-ups  with  tax\r\n\r\nwrite-offs  for  qualifying losses  incurred.   Qualified\r\n\r\ntechnopreneur start-ups which are accorded TII status may\r\n\r\nallot  shares  to their investors, so long as  the  total\r\n\r\namount  paid to the company for all qualifying shares  by\r\n\r\neligible  investors  does not exceed  $3  million.   When\r\n\r\neligible  investors incur a loss from selling  qualifying\r\n\r\nshares or from the liquidation of the start-up within the\r\n\r\neligibility  period, they are entitled  to  deduct  their\r\n\r\nloss  amount  against their taxable  income,  subject  to\r\n\r\nterms and conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill seeks to make consequential\r\n\r\namendments  to  the EEI Act arising from changes  to  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Act.   Clauses 3, 5 and  12  relate  to  the\r\n\r\namendments to sections 37, 37B and 37C of the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nAct.  Clause 11 relates to the amendments to sections 13H\r\n\r\nand  43P  of the Income tax Act.  The above consequential\r\n\r\namendments are to provide for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) allowing the carry forward of unabsorbed\r\n\r\ndonations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) extending the application of the adjustment\r\n\r\nfactor  under section 37B of the Income Tax Act to income\r\n\r\nof the company subject to tax at different tax rates; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) expanding the definition of \"concessionary\r\n\r\nincome\"   under   the  provisions  governing   investment\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all, the above EEI Act\r\n\r\namendments  will  enhance our tax incentive  regime,  and\r\n\r\nmake   Singapore  a  more  attractive  place  for   doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.  -  [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDICAL REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>3.37 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make amendments to the Medical\r\n\r\nRegistration  Act  (Chapter  174  of  the  1998   Revised\r\n\r\nEdition).\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Registration Act provides for the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Singapore Medical Council  (SMC)  to\r\n\r\nregister and regulate medical practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Act are needed to set the\r\n\r\nrequirements   for  continuing  medical  education   when\r\n\r\ndoctors  renew their practising certificates, to  address\r\n\r\nthe  limitations  that the SMC faces in its  disciplinary\r\n\r\nprocesses   and   to   keep   pace   with   international\r\n\r\ndevelopments in professional regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the major\r\n\r\namendments that are being introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Compulsory Continuing Medical Education (CME)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of change in the practice of medicine is\r\n\r\nrapid, driven mainly by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndramatic  advances in biomedical research and technology.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there is greater acceptance of evidence-based  medicine, ie, medical practices that are supported\r\n\r\nby  rigorous  and comprehensive analyses of the  relevant\r\n\r\nbody  of  clinical  research or trial data.   This  helps\r\n\r\ndoctors  to  ensure that the care given  to  patients  is\r\n\r\nnecessary, beneficial and of good quality.  Our  patients\r\n\r\nand  the  general  public  also have  high,  and  rising,\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  the  quality of  healthcare  that  they\r\n\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative, therefore, for all doctors to\r\n\r\nmaintain the currency of their professional knowledge and\r\n\r\nto  stay  abreast of developments in medical science  and\r\n\r\npractice.  Continuing Medical Education (CME) is a  well-accepted  mechanism to achieve this.   There  is  a  long\r\n\r\nhistory  and  tradition of CME within our  local  medical\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Two years ago, the SMC launched  an  on-line\r\n\r\nCME  system for all registered medical practitioners  and\r\n\r\nworked with the College of Family Physicians, the Academy\r\n\r\nof  Medicine  and  the Singapore Medical Association,  to\r\n\r\nestablish a voluntary national CME system so as to better\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs  of  the  different  groups  of  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners through the provision of a diverse  variety\r\n\r\nof accredited CME activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all doctors have demonstrated\r\n\r\nparticipation   to   a   satisfactory   level   of   CME.\r\n\r\nNotifications  by  medical  practitioners  to  the  SMC's\r\n\r\nvoluntary  CME system showed that only 39% fulfilled  the\r\n\r\nminimum  CME requirements of 25 points per year in  2000.\r\n\r\nThe situation improved to 49.5% participation rate in the\r\n\r\nyear 2001.  It is likely that there were some doctors who\r\n\r\nparticipated  in CME but failed to notify.   Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nthe    voluntary   participation   rate   is   far   from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   Many developed countries, in  fact,  have\r\n\r\nmade  CME  compulsory  in their jurisdictions,  eg,  most\r\n\r\nstates in the USA, some states in Australia, New Zealand,\r\n\r\nthe  Netherlands and Hong Kong.  Canada and  the  UK  are\r\n\r\nactively  looking  into  doing  so  as  well.   We   have\r\n\r\ntherefore decided to make CME compulsory for all  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners from 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes an amendment that allows the SMC\r\n\r\nto  prescribe conditions for the grant and renewal  of  a\r\n\r\ndoctor's   practising  certificate,  including  mandatory\r\n\r\nparticipation in CME.  The SMC has decided  that  doctors\r\n\r\nshould  accumulate at least 50 CME points within a 2-year\r\n\r\ncycle    before   they   can   renew   their   practising\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening of SMC's Disciplinary Procedures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the SMC plays a critical role in\r\n\r\nthe  regulation  of  medical  professionals  and  medical\r\n\r\npractice  in Singapore.  SMC has established  an  Ethical\r\n\r\nCode  and  Ethical Guidelines that set the  standards  of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  expected of all  doctors  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSMC also has a well-established disciplinary procedure to\r\n\r\nassess and to deal with doctors who have been referred to\r\n\r\nthe  SMC.  In the main, these procedures are working well\r\n\r\nand  have  allowed the SMC to maintain high standards  of\r\n\r\nmedical professionalism in Singapore.  However, there are\r\n\r\na number of limitations that the SMC faces in its current\r\n\r\ndisciplinary processes.  These will be addressed  in  the\r\n\r\namendments to this Act so that SMC will be able to  carry\r\n\r\nout   its   regulatory   duties  more   efficiently   and\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Interim Orders Committee (IOC)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the complexities of medical practice\r\n\r\nissues and the time required to gather and review all the\r\n\r\nrelevant  evidence,  inquiries into disciplinary  matters\r\n\r\nmay  take up to two years to complete.  During that time,\r\n\r\nthe doctor under investigation is still able to practise.\r\n\r\nIn  some  situations, there may be compelling reasons  to\r\n\r\nsuspend a doctor from practising, even before the outcome\r\n\r\nof his disciplinary enquiry is known, in the interests of\r\n\r\npublic safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore propose that a new provision be created\r\n\r\nto  allow  for  the  establishment of an  Interim  Orders\r\n\r\nCommittee  (IOC).  The IOC will be vested with the  power\r\n\r\nto  summarily  suspend or restrict  a  doctor's  practice\r\n\r\nbefore  the outcome of an inquiry is known.  This inquiry\r\n\r\ncould be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheld  either  by  the Disciplinary Committee  (DC)  which\r\n\r\nlooks into the professional conduct of the doctor or  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Committee (HC) which considers the  physical  and\r\n\r\nmental fitness of the doctor to practise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that cases will\r\n\r\nonly  be  referred  to the IOC when there  is  compelling\r\n\r\nevidence  that  the doctor's continued practice  poses  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  public safety.  Such evidence  could  include\r\n\r\npsychiatric reports and court convictions.  Based on  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of the IOC in the UK, examples of cases  that\r\n\r\ncould  be  referred to the IOC would include  cases  like\r\n\r\nfailures  of care that indicate a serious lack  of  basic\r\n\r\nmedical  knowledge  or  skills; or doctors  with  serious\r\n\r\nhealth  problems  that  would  affect  their  ability  to\r\n\r\npractise   medicine,  such  as  severe  mental   illness,\r\n\r\nalcoholism or drug addiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight that a number of\r\n\r\nprovisions have been built into the Act to safeguard  the\r\n\r\nrights  of the doctor who has been referred to  the  IOC.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The members of the IOC will not participate as\r\n\r\nmembers  of  any  other committee  that  is  involved  in\r\n\r\nlooking into the complaint against that doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No interim order shall be made by the IOC\r\n\r\nunless  the  doctor  in  question  has  been  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to appear before the IOC and be heard  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  such an order should be made in his  case.   The\r\n\r\ndoctor  also  has  the right to be represented  by  legal\r\n\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Any doctor whose registration has been\r\n\r\nsuspended or made subject to conditions by the  IOC  will\r\n\r\nhave a right of appeal to the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The IOC is required to review its interim order\r\n\r\nafter  6  months to determine if it should be revoked  or\r\n\r\namended.   After this first review, the order is  subject\r\n\r\nto  further review every three months until the matter is\r\n\r\nsettled,  or the IOC decides that the order is no  longer\r\n\r\nnecessary,  or 18 months after the initial issue  of  the\r\n\r\norder.  Any extension of the order beyond\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n18 months will require approval by the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments to establish the IOC and to provide\r\n\r\nsafeguards  for  the  rights of the doctors  are  closely\r\n\r\nmodelled on the current legislation and system in the UK.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some other amendments to the\r\n\r\nAct   that   are  intended  to  strengthen  the   current\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  process.   We will empower  the  Complaints\r\n\r\nCommittee to inquire into matters of professional conduct\r\n\r\nthat were discovered in the course of investigations, but\r\n\r\ndid  not  form  part  of  the  original  complaint.   The\r\n\r\nComplaints Committee will also be allowed to continue  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  even  if a complaint had  been  withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThis  is consistent with the powers vested in the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittees under the Legal Profession Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMC will be authorised to refer, by its own\r\n\r\nvolition,   any   information  regarding   the   criminal\r\n\r\nconviction  of a registered medical practitioner  to  the\r\n\r\nSMC's Complaints Panel, without first having to receive a\r\n\r\nformal complaint against this practitioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, could you pause for a while to\r\n\r\nlet the Whip move the exempted business motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon Yang].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDICAL REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying,\r\n\r\nwe  will allow the SMC to refer any information regarding\r\n\r\nthe criminal conviction of a registered medical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractitioner to the SMC's Complaints Panel, without first\r\n\r\nhaving  to  receive  a  formal  complaint  regarding  the\r\n\r\npractitioner.   This will ensure that  doctors  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen convicted of offences in the criminal court are also\r\n\r\nreviewed  by the SMC to determine if there had also  been\r\n\r\nbreaches in professional conduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of a specialist is currently not protected\r\n\r\nby  law.  A new amendment will allow the SMC to institute\r\n\r\ndisciplinary proceedings against doctors who falsely hold\r\n\r\nthemselves out to be specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the amendments\r\n\r\nin  this  Bill  that seek to streamline the  registration\r\n\r\nprocesses of the SMC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, currently, any Singapore medical degree\r\n\r\nholder  is  entitled  to full registration.   A  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  will ensure that only those who have completed\r\n\r\ntheir  housemanship satisfactorily can progress  to  full\r\n\r\nregistration.   If  the  SMC  is  of  the  view  that   a\r\n\r\nparticular doctor has not fulfilled the requirements  for\r\n\r\nfull   registration  but  is  safe  to   practise   under\r\n\r\nsupervision,  the  SMC will be given  the  discretion  to\r\n\r\naward conditional registration for such cases.  Singapore\r\n\r\ndegree  holders who complete their housemanship  overseas\r\n\r\nwould  also  be granted conditional registration  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, foreign degree holders seeking registration\r\n\r\nwill  be  required to either complete their  housemanship\r\n\r\nlocally  or produce a certificate of experience  that  is\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the  SMC  as  evidence  that  they   have\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  completed  their  housemanship  overseas.\r\n\r\nThe  SMC will also be allowed to impose conditions on the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of  a  doctor who has been  struck  off  the\r\n\r\nregister,   such   as   placing  him  under   conditional\r\n\r\nregistration   rather   than  restoring   him   to   full\r\n\r\nregistration right away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment is to allow the SMC to release\r\n\r\ninformation   to   prescribed   persons   or   Government\r\n\r\norganisations  for  policy planning and  other  purposes.\r\n\r\nSuch  information includes names and biodata, information\r\n\r\non professional qualifications,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  well as employment data.  This is consistent with the\r\n\r\nprovisions  made  in  the Private Hospitals  and  Medical\r\n\r\nClinics Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity to touch on two related matters:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Schedule of the Medical Registration\r\n\r\nAct, which lists the basic medical degrees recognised for\r\n\r\nregistration  in Singapore, and secondly,  the  one-third\r\n\r\nquota  placed on the female medical student  intake  into\r\n\r\nthe National University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for these two policies to\r\n\r\nbe reviewed.  I am happy to announce that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  has  decided to expand the Schedule, which  lists\r\n\r\nthe   foreign  universities  and  medical  schools  whose\r\n\r\nmedical  degrees  are  recognised  for  registration   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Also, the one-third quota on the  intake  of\r\n\r\nfemale medical students into NUS will also be lifted with\r\n\r\neffect from academic year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members who have raised this,\r\n\r\nincluding Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr Lily Neo, and to  thank\r\n\r\nthem  also  for  their patience when  raising  these  two\r\n\r\nissues for review.  Good things come to those who wait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to the Medical Registration Act  would  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Medical  Council  to  maintain  the  high\r\n\r\nprofessional  standards  of  the  doctors  practising  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This will help ensure that Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to enjoy a good quality of medical care  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to have full confidence and trust in the doctors\r\n\r\nwhom they consult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to declare that I am a General Practitioner  and  I\r\n\r\nstand  to  speak  in support of the Medical  Registration\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I must say that I welcome the good\r\n\r\nnews  that  the quota on the admission of female  medical\r\n\r\nstudents to our university is to be removed at long last.\r\n\r\nThe  public and many Members of Parliament in this House,\r\n\r\nmyself  included,  had spoken for the  regulation  to  be\r\n\r\nrescinded.    Sir,  I  am  indeed  heartened   that   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has responded to the people's wish  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Backbenchers in this House had not spoken  in  vain.\r\n\r\nToday's  announcement removes the quota  of  33%  on  the\r\n\r\nadmission of female students into the Faculty of Medicine\r\n\r\nwhich NUS introduced in 1979.  The reason for introducing\r\n\r\nthe  quota  for  female  medical students  was  that  the\r\n\r\nattrition  rate for female doctors then was  16-19%.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   this  reasoning  is  not  valid   anymore   as,\r\n\r\ncurrently,  the attrition rate for male doctors  is  2.8%\r\n\r\nand  for female doctors is 4.2%.  This announcement  thus\r\n\r\nremoves this rejection of entry to qualify people on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  gender,  and will go a long  way  towards  our\r\n\r\nvision  of  making NUS a \"first world\" university.   Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore  prides itself on being a meritocratic  society\r\n\r\nand  the long overdue removal of this quota is definitely\r\n\r\na right step forward for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1993 policy of not recognising the degrees from\r\n\r\nover  176 previously recognised foreign universities will\r\n\r\nbe  reversed.   However,  I  believe  that  not  all  the\r\n\r\npreviously recognised universities will be reinstated for\r\n\r\nrecognition.   Why is the Ministry of Health half-hearted\r\n\r\nin  reversing  this policy?  As Singapore is  emphasising\r\n\r\nthe importance of life-sciences, and as we will need many\r\n\r\ndoctor-researchers,  would it not facilitate  our  future\r\n\r\nneeds   better  by  recognising  all  of  the  previously\r\n\r\nrecognised medical schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health's projections for ideal\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  doctors have been less than satisfactory  so\r\n\r\nfar.   How  sure are we that the Ministry of  Health  has\r\n\r\nbetter  projections  now to take into  consideration  our\r\n\r\nchanging needs and trends?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that there has been a shortage of\r\n\r\ndoctors  in  the  public sector for many years  and  this\r\n\r\npolicy change will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainly help solve this urgent problem.  Not  only  can\r\n\r\nwe  have the chance to get those Singaporean doctors  who\r\n\r\nhave  graduated from these foreign universities  to  come\r\n\r\nhome,  we  can  also  very  likely  attract  other   non-Singaporean   doctors  from  these   reputable   overseas\r\n\r\nuniversities.   This is especially significant  when  the\r\n\r\ncost to train a doctor in Singapore is so much higher  in\r\n\r\ncomparison   to  medical  schools  overseas.    Yes,   it\r\n\r\napparently  costs at least $400,000 here as  compared  to\r\n\r\nabout $170,000 to $250,000 at the universities of Sydney,\r\n\r\nOxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Ministry of Health be circumspect in\r\n\r\nassessing the shortage of doctors and solving the problem\r\n\r\nat the root cause of the shortage?  Finding and attending\r\n\r\nto the reasons for shortages would be more effective than\r\n\r\nmerely  increasing the numbers of doctors.  There is  now\r\n\r\nan  uneven distribution of doctors, with an abundance  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  in the private sector and a shortage, especially\r\n\r\nof  junior doctors, in the public sector.  Junior  public\r\n\r\ndoctors  have  been  facing problems like  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nwork-terms,  long  and  tedious working  hours  and  poor\r\n\r\ncareer  path developments.  Sir, their morale is low  and\r\n\r\nthey  often leave for private practice as a last  resort.\r\n\r\nAnd,  even  if  we  increase their numbers,  more  junior\r\n\r\ndoctors in the public sector will still leave in spite of\r\n\r\npoorer   prospects  outside  if  these  causes  are   not\r\n\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that, with the new policy in\r\n\r\nplace, our public hospitals should stop employing doctors\r\n\r\nfrom non-traditional sources like Burma, Indonesia, China\r\n\r\nand so on, whose medical degrees were never recognised in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  Singapore is known for its medical excellence\r\n\r\nand  this  had been built upon through years of excellent\r\n\r\ntraining  of  our  doctors from the best  centres.   This\r\n\r\nprestige status must be preserved at all costs.   To  me,\r\n\r\npublic  hospital's reflex response to recruit doctors  in\r\n\r\nthe last few years from these non-traditional sources and\r\n\r\nto  save  costs is not acceptable.  Sir, may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health whether the hundreds of doctors  from\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-traditional sources presently in our public hospitals\r\n\r\nare being tracked and monitored continuously in terms  of\r\n\r\ntheir performance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the new regulation concerning Compulsory\r\n\r\nContinuing   Medical   Education,  most   physicians   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  in general concurrence that  the  desired\r\n\r\ngoal  of  CME  is essential to improve medical  practice.\r\n\r\nBut  many  grouse that this has to come in  the  form  of\r\n\r\ncompulsion.   The proportion of doctors who  are  already\r\n\r\nkeeping themselves updated is definitely higher than  the\r\n\r\nquoted  figure  of  49.5% for the year  2001  of  doctors\r\n\r\nobtaining the minimum CME points.  This figure refers  to\r\n\r\nthose who have officially documented their CME activities\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore Medical Council.  The CME  programme\r\n\r\nhas  up till now been entirely voluntary and, hence, many\r\n\r\ndoctors do not formally record or report their efforts in\r\n\r\nCME  to the Singapore Medical Council.  The fact is  that\r\n\r\ncontinued  medical  education is part  and  parcel  of  a\r\n\r\ndoctor's life, and when one takes up medicine, continuous\r\n\r\nlearning becomes an inherent life-long practice.  I  dare\r\n\r\nsay  that  all  doctors do practise CME in some  form  or\r\n\r\nother and in varying degrees as a matter of necessity  in\r\n\r\nthe course of their clinical practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we want medical excellence amongst our medical\r\n\r\nprofession  but  we  must still  retain  some  degree  of\r\n\r\nrespect   and  compassion  for  human  expectations   and\r\n\r\nlimitations.  For doctors in the public institutions, the\r\n\r\nCME  requirement is fairly easy to achieve.  However, for\r\n\r\nsome  private  practitioners,  especially  the  solo  HDB\r\n\r\ndoctors  who  work  long hours on days  and  nights,  the\r\n\r\ntiming  and  format of CME become an issue.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nspare a thought and cater for their difficult situations.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Ministry of Health can  be  the  body  that\r\n\r\nfacilitates and formulates CME for them and ensures  that\r\n\r\nprofessional bodies cater to their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also beseech the Ministry of Health to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  implementation of this  programme  on  CME  is\r\n\r\nflexible, realistic and achievable.  Formal CME  lectures\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  as  effective as it  was  believed  to  be.\r\n\r\nInteractive CME sessions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   enhance  participant  activity  and  provide   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  practise skills may be  more  useful  to\r\n\r\neffect  change in professional practices.   High  quality\r\n\r\nprofessional  learning  opportunities  online  should  be\r\n\r\nreadily   available  for  self-directed  learning.    CME\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  meet the needs of the  nation  should  be\r\n\r\nincorporated.   For  example,  in  view  of  our   ageing\r\n\r\npopulation,  there should be programmes to  better  equip\r\n\r\nthe  medical profession here for the care of the  elderly\r\n\r\nin  the  community and, in their own homes, so  that  the\r\n\r\nelderly  can  avoid  tertiary  institution  as  much   as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether the Ministry of Health will set a\r\n\r\ncertain  budget  for  this Continuing  Medical  Education\r\n\r\nyearly?   At the end of the day, the quality of CME  will\r\n\r\ndepend   on   the   resources  put  in.    Although   the\r\n\r\npharmaceutical industry may be very willing  to  generate\r\n\r\ngoodwill  by helping the providers of CME with the  costs\r\n\r\nof educational programmes, the curriculum content and the\r\n\r\neducational  event  are  often-times  influenced  by  the\r\n\r\nfinancial support and the quality and value of  such  CME\r\n\r\nactivities may thus be closely linked with the  marketing\r\n\r\nof a particular pharmaceutical product.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister if there is a provision for\r\n\r\ndoctors  who,  due  to  unforeseen circumstances,  cannot\r\n\r\nfulfil the required points of CME in the prescribed time?\r\n\r\nWill  the Minister elaborate on the circumstances allowed\r\n\r\nin such cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Interim Orders Committee (IOC)\r\n\r\namendment  seeks  to put in place an IOC  to  suspend  or\r\n\r\norder  a  restricted  registration  for  a  doctor  under\r\n\r\ninvestigation.   This amendment applies  to  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhen   the   Complaints   Panel,  Complaints   Committee,\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Committee or Health  Committee  refers  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  the  IOC.  However, it does not  address  the\r\n\r\nissue  as to under what circumstances the matter  can  be\r\n\r\nreferred to IOC.  Furthermore, there can be a possibility\r\n\r\nthat  the doctor in question had been suspended  but  the\r\n\r\neventual  finding  of  the Complaints  Panel,  Complaints\r\n\r\nCommittee, Disciplinary Committee or Health Committee  is\r\n\r\nin the negative.  On the other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand,  as  suspension or orders had been granted  by  the\r\n\r\nIOC,   the   Complaints   Panel,  Complaints   Committee,\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Committee or Health Committee may  be  under\r\n\r\npressure  to make a positive finding.  As such orders  to\r\n\r\nbe  dished out by the IOC have grave implications on  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  in  question - being seen guilty even before  the\r\n\r\nfinding has been concluded, standing to lose patients and\r\n\r\npractice and living with the stigma attached to the order\r\n\r\n-  such  a  provision ought not to be introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place.  The truth is that the circumstances on  the\r\n\r\ncharge  may  be difficult to ascertain and controversial.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  a doctor that is accused of repeated  poor\r\n\r\nperformance  may  not be entirely at fault.   It  may  be\r\n\r\nbecause the doctor was frequently getting bad cases  that\r\n\r\nwere not curable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that such a drastic suspension measure\r\n\r\nhas  to  be taken by the complainant, the matter  can  be\r\n\r\nreferred to the High Court for an injunction against  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  in  question.   An  injunction  will  attract  an\r\n\r\nundertaking  from the complainant to pay damages  to  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  in  question, if the Complaints Panel, Complaints\r\n\r\nCommittee,  Disciplinary Committee or  Health  Committee,\r\n\r\nafter  its  investigation, arrives at  the  finding  that\r\n\r\nthere is no misconduct or incompetence on the part of the\r\n\r\ndoctor  in question.  This will ensure that there  is  no\r\n\r\nfrivolous application for injunction, or suspension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per the amendment, the IOC majority vote will be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to make an order.  This may not be  equitable\r\n\r\ngiven the grave implications.  If the IOC is to vote  for\r\n\r\nan  order,  it should be by way of an unanimous decision.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment also gives the IOC the power to  vary  the\r\n\r\norder  if  the  Complaints Panel,  Complaints  Committee,\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Committee or Health Committee recommends the\r\n\r\nsame.   This  again  seems  to  be  inequitable.   If   a\r\n\r\nvariation  is required, the matter ought to be  moved  to\r\n\r\nthe  High Court for a decision and not remain within  the\r\n\r\nIOC  Complaints Panel, Complaints Committee, Disciplinary\r\n\r\nCommittee or Health Committee level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to section 20 (clause 7) proposes to amend\r\n\r\nthat only those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  completed their housemanship satisfactorily can  be\r\n\r\ngranted full registration.  Sir, under what circumstances\r\n\r\nwould  housemanship be deemed unsatisfactory?  This could\r\n\r\nbe very subjective and there are assessors with different\r\n\r\nexpectations  and standards to demand of their  housemen.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, I would have expected that doctors  coming\r\n\r\nout  of  NUS, deemed a world class medical school,  would\r\n\r\nhave  produced high quality doctors.  There  is  also  no\r\n\r\nstipulated    maximum   period   for   this   conditional\r\n\r\nregistration.   So housemen can be forever  in  the  same\r\n\r\nposition  for as long as his seniors think they  are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  in their performances.  By  the  way,  will\r\n\r\nhospitals  that  are  short  of  doctors  now  use   this\r\n\r\nregulation  to tie these doctors to ease their  shortage?\r\n\r\nHow  will the Ministry of Health ensure the avoidance  of\r\n\r\nsuch  high-handed unfair practice?  What kind of recourse\r\n\r\ncan these housemen seek?  Furthermore, the amendments  do\r\n\r\nnot address how the Medical Council is going to decide on\r\n\r\nthe procedure of granting conditional registration.  Will\r\n\r\nthere be a committee?  Who will be on the committee?   Is\r\n\r\nit   the  whole  Medical  Council?   Will  a  meeting  be\r\n\r\nconvened?   There  are lots of uncertainties  as  to  the\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that Singapore Medical Council is to be\r\n\r\ngiven  sweeping powers, we must ensure that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfair  representation of doctors from both the public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors and from as many disciplines and groups.\r\n\r\nWe  must also ensure that the members of the Council  are\r\n\r\nof  a high calibre.  Could the Minister elaborate on  how\r\n\r\nthis is being ensured?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of my concerns and I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health would address them in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, I did\r\n\r\nnot  give notice to speak.  But having heard the Minister\r\n\r\nand also Dr Lily Neo, I thought I want to say something.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am very concerned about CME. I\r\n\r\nremember 20-odd years ago, when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  was in the College of General Practitioners, we mooted\r\n\r\nthis  idea  of CME.  I am indeed glad that  it  has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  now.   20 years is a long time.   But,  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  we set out the format for doctors to undergo  this\r\n\r\nCME  training.   It  is  true that  doctors  should  stay\r\n\r\nabreast of science and also the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can see some problems now because many\r\n\r\npractising doctors, especially general practitioners, are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  find  time to attend all these  lectures  and\r\n\r\ntalks.  At the moment, I notice that there are also  drug\r\n\r\ncompanies  trying to participate in these CME  exercises,\r\n\r\nand  I remember this has stretched as far as 20 years ago\r\n\r\nwhen  we  started  this,  where they  invited  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npractitioners to attend the talks that were given by drug\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  the lectures were given  by  doctors  and\r\n\r\nspecialists.  I thought that was very good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, as stated by the Minister, 39%\r\n\r\nmanaged  to fulfil the 25-point requirement, and  in  the\r\n\r\nyear 2001, 49.5% fulfilled.  I hope that the Ministry, or\r\n\r\nthe people who are in charge of this CME, would find some\r\n\r\neasier   format   for  the  hardworking   doctors,   both\r\n\r\npractitioners outside and also in the institution, to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the time to participate in this CME exercise.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  like Dr Neo said, it must be flexible  and\r\n\r\nachievable.   I am sure the Minister would take  note  of\r\n\r\nthat and make those recommendations to the people who are\r\n\r\nformulating all these CME exercises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first read the Bill, there is one particular\r\n\r\nclause  that  caught my attention and, that is,  the  new\r\n\r\nsections 49A and 49B which actually call for the  interim\r\n\r\nsuspension  order.  And like Dr Neo, I was a  little  bit\r\n\r\nworried because we might be actually prejudging a  doctor\r\n\r\nand subjecting him to some sentence before he is actually\r\n\r\nfound  guilty.  But having heard the Minister, I am quite\r\n\r\ncomforted  now.   He  said that this  particular  interim\r\n\r\norder   will  only  be  used  when  there  is  compelling\r\n\r\nevidence.   And  he also cited compelling  evidence  like\r\n\r\ndoctors who may be of unsound mind.  After some time,  we\r\n\r\ndoctors, through years of practice and ageing, may also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave undergone mental changes.  Some of them may also  be\r\n\r\na  bit of schizophrenic.  When you get all those cases, I\r\n\r\nwould agree with the Minister that you had better suspend\r\n\r\nthese  doctors  first  before  you  put  them  back  into\r\n\r\npractice,  or  even wait for the lengthy  procedure  that\r\n\r\nusually takes place when we investigate a doctor  who  is\r\n\r\nsubjected  to disciplinary procedures.  He also mentioned\r\n\r\nabout the safeguards for the rights of doctors, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot want to elaborate on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point was this full registration of\r\n\r\ndoctors or housemen who are Singapore degree holders.   I\r\n\r\nhonestly  do  not see much change.  In the past,  it  was\r\n\r\nalso the same.  The doctor who has completed six years of\r\n\r\nmedical school, goes through one year of housemanship and\r\n\r\nthen  he  gets  registered.  Of course, he  must  subject\r\n\r\nhimself to a review by his peers to make sure that he  is\r\n\r\nfully  qualified  because passing an examination  is  one\r\n\r\nthing,   but  doing  the  practical  aspects  of  medical\r\n\r\npractice  is another thing.  Therefore, I agree with  the\r\n\r\nMinister too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that he also mentioned that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more women being allowed to enrol into  medical\r\n\r\nschool.  I know that the original reason why they did not\r\n\r\nallow  was that many women, who took up medical  studies,\r\n\r\nfinally  did not end up practising, and that  is  a  sure\r\n\r\nwaste of manpower.  I remember also in the old House,  we\r\n\r\nhad  a lot of discussions on why women, who want to  take\r\n\r\nup  medicine,  should have a little less  priority.   But\r\n\r\nthrough the hard work of Dr Lily Neo and many Members  in\r\n\r\nthe House, the Minister has changed this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is enlarging the list of overseas\r\n\r\nmedical  colleges and universities.  Yes, we had actually\r\n\r\nmany  cases  of  very bright students who could  not  get\r\n\r\nplaces  in  the universities here and they had gone  into\r\n\r\nsome  of the overseas universities which were very  good.\r\n\r\nBut,   unfortunately,  they  did  not  get   recognition.\r\n\r\nDublin,   Adelaide,   for   example,   are   very    good\r\n\r\nuniversities.  But they did not fall into that  list  and\r\n\r\nthe  students  who graduated from those good universities\r\n\r\nfailed to get registration.  And that is a pity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  I hope that list would include such good universities\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  their comments.  Let me  respond  to  them.\r\n\r\nFirst,  on  the schedule for recognising the universities\r\n\r\nand the medical colleges.  Dr Lily Neo asked why not just\r\n\r\nrecognise all 176 universities in the pre-1993 list.   It\r\n\r\nis  already 10 years since 1993, and we have asked SMC to\r\n\r\ntake a look at all the universities from a fresh approach\r\n\r\nand  recommend  to  the Ministry which  universities  and\r\n\r\nmedical  colleges  should be put into  the  schedule  for\r\n\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to it. One is the quality of\r\n\r\nthe  medical schools and the universities.  And  secondly\r\n\r\nis  the compatibility of their training and curriculum to\r\n\r\nour  practice  here.  So not being on the list  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that the universities are not good.  They could  be\r\n\r\ngood,  but we also want the way they teach their students\r\n\r\nand  the  way  they  organise  their  curriculum  to   be\r\n\r\nreasonably compatible to ours.  There is really  no  need\r\n\r\nto  have such a long list, because our projection is that\r\n\r\nwe  would need to supplement our local output of  doctors\r\n\r\nby between 50-80 doctors who are foreign-trained, whether\r\n\r\nSingaporeans or foreigners.  We really do not need such a\r\n\r\nlong  list  of universities.  If we look at the  pre-1993\r\n\r\nlist, the bulk in the list are American universities.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  really  get  many graduates  from  the  American\r\n\r\nuniversities.  SMC should look at the list  and  identify\r\n\r\nthose  universities  and medical  colleges  that  we  are\r\n\r\nlikely to have Singaporeans or where we are likely to  be\r\n\r\nable to recruit foreign talent.  So, it is with a clearer\r\n\r\nobjective in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shortage of junior doctors, I agree with Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo that we should look at the root causes  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of junior doctors.  I think the way to approach\r\n\r\nit  is  really  to restructure the whole process  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals and in our clinics.  In the past, our hospitals\r\n\r\nand clinics had got used to using junior medical doctors,\r\n\r\nbecause they were bonded to us for a number of years and,\r\n\r\nwhen the numbers fluctuate,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen the establishment is not filled.  We have asked  the\r\n\r\nhospitals to actually look at the processes and  to  look\r\n\r\nat  employing experienced medical officers and  not  just\r\n\r\nuse  these people who are with us for the period  of  the\r\n\r\nbond, but use experienced doctors who may not want to  go\r\n\r\non  to  a  specialty but who are quite happy  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncareer  working  in  the hospitals  as  very  experienced\r\n\r\nmedical officers.  So, they have done so and they have  a\r\n\r\nresident  physician  scheme  and  it  is  becoming  quite\r\n\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the hospitals have recruited\r\n\r\ndoctors  from  some non-traditional sources.   They  have\r\n\r\nbeen very careful to make sure that these doctors are  of\r\n\r\nvery  high  quality, and all these doctors are practising\r\n\r\nin  an institutional set-up.  They are closely supervised\r\n\r\nand  monitored,  and  they add value  to  our  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.  So, it is not just a matter of cost and lowering\r\n\r\ncost.   I  know Dr Lily Neo says we must preserve quality\r\n\r\nat  all  costs.  But I am sure the next time I come  here\r\n\r\nand  ask  for a fee increase, she would be the  first  to\r\n\r\njump up and argue against a fee increase.  So, we have to\r\n\r\nbe  quite  clear.   It is not just a matter  of  lowering\r\n\r\ncost;  it  is  complementing the range of  expertise  and\r\n\r\nexperience that we have in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CME, I take both Dr Lily Neo and Dr Tan Cheng\r\n\r\nBock's  comments.   We  have tried this  on  a  voluntary\r\n\r\nbasis.  Other countries and jurisdictions have gone on to\r\n\r\nmake it compulsory.  I think we should follow suit.   Our\r\n\r\nrequirements are not that stringent.  50 points over  two\r\n\r\nyears  is  not an overly difficult hurdle  to  cross.   I\r\n\r\nrecognise   that   those  working  in  the   restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  or  institutions will find it easier,  whereas\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  operating  solo  practices  out  in  the\r\n\r\nheartlands will find it more difficult.  And that is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why we have worked very closely with the  College\r\n\r\nof   Family   Physicians   and  the   Singapore   Medical\r\n\r\nAssociation to work out mechanisms, whether it is  online\r\n\r\nor  self-directed, to make sure that the  private  sector\r\n\r\ngeneral practitioner can have access to CME.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the clusters have extended schemes to the\r\n\r\nprivate sector general practitioner under the partnership\r\n\r\nscheme,  where  GPs actually work with  the  clusters  as\r\n\r\npartners,  referring to the specialist clinics  and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.   Therefore, this link-up will allow the  private-sector GPs to attend the CME classes run by the clusters.\r\n\r\nBut I must say that in the end the private-sector GP must\r\n\r\nmake  an effort.  We do run these classes in the evenings\r\n\r\nand  on weekends, but they must make the effort.  My view\r\n\r\nis  that 50 CME points over two years is not that big  an\r\n\r\neffort  to make.  But I take the comments of Dr Lily  Neo\r\n\r\nand  Dr Tan Cheng Bock that we should make sure that this\r\n\r\nis  flexible, realistic and achievable, and that we  will\r\n\r\nwork together with the various professional organisations\r\n\r\nto make sure that this is so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the professional organisations must run\r\n\r\nCME  on  their  own budget.  The Ministry of  Health  has\r\n\r\ngiven  them  a  transitional budget to help  set  up  the\r\n\r\nonline processes, working out the curriculum.  But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  our intention that this fiscal support should be  in\r\n\r\nthe  long  term.  So, beyond the transitional grant  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health has given them, our intention  is\r\n\r\nthat the medical profession must stand on its own feet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made on the Interim Orders Committee,\r\n\r\nas  I  explained  in my speech, we know this  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndelicate balance.  We need to protect public safety.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we need to recognise the rights  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctors.   Therefore,  if  we ever  have  this  order  to\r\n\r\nsuspend a doctor's practice, I can assure the House  that\r\n\r\nthis would be done very, very selectively and, when there\r\n\r\nare compelling reasons in order to protect public safety.\r\n\r\nWe have modelled this after the UK.  Let us try this out.\r\n\r\nWe have put in all the safeguards that we have researched\r\n\r\non.   But I think we need to strike a balance.  We cannot\r\n\r\njust  give  the doctors a blank cheque to say  they  must\r\n\r\npractise, whatever the circumstances.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthere are issues of public safety involved, especially if\r\n\r\nthe  doctor  is  a very severe alcoholic or  has  a  drug\r\n\r\naddiction  problem  or  a  very  severe  mental   illness\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I assure the House we will do this very\r\n\r\nselectively, and only when there are compelling reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the registration of housemen, today graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  our local universities go for housemanship and,  at\r\n\r\nthe   end   of   housemanship,  they   are   given   full\r\n\r\nregistration.  But in one, two or three cases every year,\r\n\r\nthe  panel  of  assessors and the Dean  would  have  been\r\n\r\nhappier  if  the  doctor underwent  a  longer  period  of\r\n\r\nsupervision.   The  system here  is  that  we  allow  the\r\n\r\ndoctor,  after  the  one-year  housemanship,  to  go  and\r\n\r\npractise solo.  This is a very high burden.  If I may use\r\n\r\nthe  analogy of a private pilot's licence.  You may  know\r\n\r\nthe theory of how to fly a plane.  You may be able to fly\r\n\r\na  plane with the instructor next to you, to land and  to\r\n\r\ntake  off.  But to fly solo, you need a certain  exposure\r\n\r\nto  the different circumstances that may arise.  You need\r\n\r\nexperience  and judgement.  In a few of these cases,  the\r\n\r\npanel  of  assessors and the Dean would rather  that  the\r\n\r\ndoctors not go solo in the HDB heartlands, but that  they\r\n\r\nspend  another three months, six months or  another  year\r\n\r\nunder  supervision.   Then, I  think,  we  will  be  more\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the  doctor can  fly  solo  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartland clinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is to allow the panel of assessors\r\n\r\nand  the  Dean  to  have  this  flexibility  of  awarding\r\n\r\nconditional  registration,  so  that  the  doctor   still\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  practise, but practise under  supervision.\r\n\r\nThen,  after  a  period  of review,  when  the  panel  is\r\n\r\nconfident,  then  the doctor is given full  registration.\r\n\r\nAgain,  I  will assure the House that when  we  implement\r\n\r\nthis, there will be proper checks and balances, as we  do\r\n\r\nwhenever we assess the capabilities of the doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the representation of the SMC, the Act allows for\r\n\r\nthe   SMC  to  be  constituted,  some  appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, for which we have certain criteria to make sure\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  cross-section from the  private  and  public\r\n\r\nsectors, people from different specialties.  But the bulk\r\n\r\nis  elected  by  the  doctors themselves.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nessence of self-regulation by the SMC.  Here, I think, we\r\n\r\nwould expect the doctors to exercise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  judgement in electing a professional body  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their professional interests and who  will  be  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  regulating them.  So far it has worked  well.\r\n\r\nWe  will continue to monitor the SMC.  Over the years, it\r\n\r\nhas built up a strong reputation.  It has the support  of\r\n\r\nall the doctors and I am confident it will continue to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek\r\n\r\na point of clarification.  The Minister did not answer my\r\n\r\npoints  on whether there is a provision for doctors  who,\r\n\r\ndue   to  unforeseen  circumstances,  cannot  fulfil  the\r\n\r\nrequired CME points within the prescribed time.  Will  he\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  the circumstances allowed in  such  cases?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any recourse for a houseman to take?   The\r\n\r\nMinister said earlier that the non-traditional sources of\r\n\r\ndoctors  are of high quality.  Is he implying that  there\r\n\r\nis no need to recruit doctors from reputable universities\r\n\r\nnow,  and that there is no necessity to send our  doctors\r\n\r\nto  the  reputable universities and the best  centres  to\r\n\r\ntrain?  Where is our medical health heading then?  Is  he\r\n\r\nnot   risking  throwing  away  the  prestige  of  medical\r\n\r\nexcellence  that  we have painfully  built  up  over  the\r\n\r\nyears?   What kind of confidence can we get from our  own\r\n\r\nSingaporean  patients  and foreign  patients,  especially\r\n\r\nfrom the region?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now, 50 points over two years should not be such  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  hurdle  to cross.  Many of  these  points  are\r\n\r\naccumulated  just  by self-reading, answering  questions.\r\n\r\nWe  are talking about 50 CME points over two years.  I do\r\n\r\nnot see that being difficult to achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> No, should the doctor be hospitalised,\r\n\r\nfor example, due to unforeseen circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the doctor is immobilised for\r\n\r\ntwo  years, then I am sure the SMC would take  that  into\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On recourse by junior doctors for the housemanship,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the usual process: we have interviews with  the\r\n\r\nhousemen, they go through three supervisors and are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupervised by the Dean.  So, there are a lot of  feedback\r\n\r\nchannels  for the housemen, if they think that they  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  properly  assessed.  The Director  of  Medical\r\n\r\nServices  takes  a  very personal  interest  in  all  the\r\n\r\nhousemen.  This year, for example, one houseman  came  to\r\n\r\nmy office and asked to see me, and I saw her.  We keep  a\r\n\r\nfairly open-office policy in the Ministry of Health.  So,\r\n\r\nI  think  there is enough recourse.  Of course,  if  they\r\n\r\nfind  all these unsatisfactory, they will make a  beeline\r\n\r\nto see her!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quality of doctors, I think we are still\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the very high quality of our  doctors.   The\r\n\r\nmain  strategy is really our Health Manpower  Development\r\n\r\nProgramme (HMDP).  This has been on for many years.   Our\r\n\r\ndoctors go to the best and most reputable centres  around\r\n\r\nthe world, funded by the Government.  This is how we keep\r\n\r\nup  with  the latest.  The HMDP programme is our  key  in\r\n\r\nkeeping this quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we do face a shortage of doctors.\r\n\r\nWith  the expansion of the schedule, we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecruit both Singaporean as well as foreign doctors  from\r\n\r\nthe  foreign universities.  After 1993, when the list was\r\n\r\nrestricted  to  28  and  then, now  24,  our  avenues  of\r\n\r\nrecruitment were limited.  So, with the expansion of  the\r\n\r\nschedule,  obviously we have more choices.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nnot  rule out completely and insist that our clusters are\r\n\r\nnot allowed to recruit from universities not on the list.\r\n\r\nWhy  do we want to constrain them?  As long as they  make\r\n\r\nthe  assessment  that  these  doctors  meet  the  quality\r\n\r\nstandards   and  these  doctors  practise   under   close\r\n\r\nsupervision,  they add to our capability.   And  many  of\r\n\r\nthese doctors may later on continue to take up specialist\r\n\r\ncourses  and join our system.  Why do we want to restrict\r\n\r\nourselves  and  restrict recruitment from some  of  these\r\n\r\ngood universities, even though they may not appear on the\r\n\r\nschedule?   They  come, work for us  for  two  years,  we\r\n\r\nassess  them and, if they are good, we encourage them  to\r\n\r\ngo for specialist training.  They add to our talent pool.\r\n\r\nI do not see why we should cut them off.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Now that the Minister condones such a\r\n\r\npractice,  I  am sure our public community hospitals  and\r\n\r\neven the private hospitals will take in more doctors from\r\n\r\nthe  cheaper non-traditional sources for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nsaving  costs, but not necessarily to the benefit of  the\r\n\r\npatients and the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to register one more\r\n\r\npoint  to  my disappointment over this response from  the\r\n\r\nMinister, because I feel that this is definitely  a  soft\r\n\r\noption   and  not  preserving  the  prestige  of  medical\r\n\r\nexcellence in Singapore, and changing the position of our\r\n\r\nhealthcare service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I just seek\r\n\r\na point of clarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter concerning CME and registration.\r\n\r\nMust a person be a practising doctor before he can do his\r\n\r\nCME?

They  also\r\n\r\nneed  registration  but they are non-practising  doctors.\r\n\r\nCan  they  get  registration also, without having  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough,  say,  the  CME,  because  they  are   in   this\r\n\r\nparticular  position, and let them take  the  CME  later,\r\n\r\nsay,  when they have finished their political career  and\r\n\r\nthey want to go ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have made your point, Dr Tan.
