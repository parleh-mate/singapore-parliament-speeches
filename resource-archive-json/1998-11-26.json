Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\nSir, the Bill seeks to amend the Supreme Court of Judicature Act\r\n\r\n(Cap. 322) (SCJA) for two purposes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, to raise the claim threshold under which leave to\r\n\r\nappeal is required:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the case of appeals from a decision of a District Court\r\n\r\nor  Magistrate's Court in civil matters to the High Court,  from\r\n\r\n$5,000 to $50,000; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in the case of appeals from a decision of the High Court in\r\n\r\ncivil matters to the Court of Appeal, from $30,000 to $250,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, to deem any question of law referred to the Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal  by  the Public Prosecutor arising from any  criminal\r\n\r\nmatter  determined by the High Court to be a question of  public\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the first purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reasons for raising limits for Civil Appeals to High Court and Court of Appeal</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 1st August 1997, the District Courts' jurisdiction in\r\n\r\ncivil matters was raised from $100,000 to $250,000.  As a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresult, more than 1,500 (The exact figure, updated\r\n\r\nto 19th November 1998, is 1,544 cases.) claims exceeding\r\n\r\n$100,000 have been filed in the District Courts since August\r\n\r\n1997.  This has helped to reduce the number of claims filed in\r\n\r\nthe High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under section 34(2)(a) of the SCJA, appeals to the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal  from decisions of the  High  Court  in  civil\r\n\r\nmatters  can  still  be made as a matter of right,  ie,  without\r\n\r\nfirst  obtaining leave of the Court, if the value of the subject\r\n\r\nmatter exceeds $30,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the enhanced District Courts' jurisdiction to\r\n\r\n$250,000  in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed  that\r\n\r\nthe  existing  $30,000 limit in section 34(2)(a)  be  raised  to\r\n\r\n$250,000.   In  other words, bring its limit in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nenhancement.   If the limit is not raised to $250,000,  District\r\n\r\nCourt cases of less than $250,000 can first go on appeal to  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  and  then Court of Appeal.  This would  strain  the\r\n\r\nlimited resources of the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the Chief Justice also proposed that the limit of\r\n\r\n$5,000 under section 21(1) of the SCJA, which covers appeals  to\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court from decisions of the District and Magistrates'\r\n\r\nCourts in civil matters, be increased to $50,000.  The effect is\r\n\r\nthat  any  appeal  relating to a claim less than  $50,000  would\r\n\r\nrequire the leave of the Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendment is that in view of the\r\n\r\nincreased  jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to discourage non-serious appeals to the High Court.  This\r\n\r\nis  best  done  by raising the threshold limit  from  $5,000  to\r\n\r\n$50,000.   Litigants who feel that their appeals have merit  may\r\n\r\nstill  apply  for leave to appeal.   For flexibility,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nalso  provides that the President will be empowered to vary  the\r\n\r\nnew  limits  after consulting the Chief Justice.  If  necessary,\r\n\r\nthese  new  limits can be increased or decreased after assessing\r\n\r\nhow they work out in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the new limits will not have the\r\n\r\neffect of preventing meritorious appeals from being heard,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven if they concern claims below the new limits.\r\n\r\nThe requirement for leave is essentially a screening mechanism\r\n\r\nto sieve out non-serious and unmeritorious appeals.  Appeals can\r\n\r\nstill be brought with the leave of court in cases falling below\r\n\r\nthe new limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reasons for deeming a question of law referred by Public Prosecutor to Court of Appeal arising from criminal appeal determined by High Court to be a question of public interest.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the second amendment which is to amend\r\n\r\nsection 60 to deem any question of law referred by the Attorney-General  to  the Court of Appeal (CA) arising from any  criminal\r\n\r\nmatter  determined by the High Court to be a question of  public\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, under section 60, when an appeal from a decision\r\n\r\nof  a Subordinate Court in a criminal matter has been determined\r\n\r\nby  the  High  Court, the Judge may, on the application  of  any\r\n\r\nparty  and  shall, on the application of the Public  Prosecutor,\r\n\r\nreserve for the question of the Court of Appeal any question  of\r\n\r\nlaw  of  public interest which has arisen in the course  of  the\r\n\r\nappeal.   However,  the existing provision in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutor is unsatisfactory because the issue of whether\r\n\r\na  question  of  law  is  one of public interest  is  determined\r\n\r\nexclusively by the High Court.  The result therefore is that the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor  may be prevented from seeking  a  conclusive\r\n\r\nruling  from the Court of Appeal on questions which  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor considers to be of public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members of the House are aware, under the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the  Attorney-General, who  is  also  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor,  is charged with the responsibility for the  conduct\r\n\r\nof  all criminal prosecutions and for advising the Government on\r\n\r\nlegal   matters.    In   order   to   properly   discharge   his\r\n\r\nconstitutional  duties,  the  Attorney-General  feels,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agrees with him, that he should be given the  freedom\r\n\r\nto  pose  questions which he considers to be of public  interest\r\n\r\nfor a conclusive ruling by the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 60 seeks to\r\n\r\naddress this issue by providing that any question of law\r\n\r\nreferred by the Public Prosecutor to the Court of Appeal should\r\n\r\nbe deemed to be a question of public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in our\r\n\r\nlegal  system, there are two ways in which laws are  made.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  through Parliament and the other through  judges  who\r\n\r\ndecide  on  individual cases.  Uncertainty in the law may  arise\r\n\r\nwhen   there   are  gaps  or  when  laws  are  given   differing\r\n\r\ninterpretations  by judges, or when, in the case  of  judge-made\r\n\r\nlaw, judges disagree with each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In criminal law and procedure, it is important that there be\r\n\r\navenues  to correct any such uncertainties quickly.  The  proper\r\n\r\nadministration   of  justice  requires  laws  to   be   certain,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  criminal  laws are concerned.   Amendments  to\r\n\r\nstatutes can only be done by Parliament, but judge-made  law  is\r\n\r\nalways  subject to a determination by the highest court  of  the\r\n\r\nland, namely, the Court of Appeal.  Who can appeal, and on  what\r\n\r\ngrounds,  all  provided for in the various statutes  and  codes.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  are  considering  a particularly  important  aspect,\r\n\r\nmainly  the  role  of  the  Attorney-General  in  the  appellate\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current practice, as the Minister has indicated, under\r\n\r\nsection  60, is that both party and Attorney-General can  appeal\r\n\r\nfrom  a High Court decision to the Court of Appeal.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  an application by the AG, the judge is under a duty for  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Court of Appeal, any question of law of  public\r\n\r\ninterest that has surfaced during the High Court hearing.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  present section 64, the Court of Appeal is under a duty  to\r\n\r\nreserve, hear and determine the question reserved.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndeeming  provision  that where there is a conflict  of  judicial\r\n\r\nauthority  on a point of law, the question shall be regarded  as\r\n\r\none of public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the proposed amendment different from the\r\n\r\ncurrent one?  The key difference relates to the deeming\r\n\r\nprovision, ie, whenever the Attorney-General makes an\r\n\r\napplication under this section, the question of law is deemed to\r\n\r\nbe one of public interest.  That is in the proposed section 65.\r\n\r\nThat this amendment accords more with reality, there is no\r\n\r\ndoubt.  It must be a rarity that when the AG raises the question\r\n\r\nof law, it is not in the public interest.  This conceivably can\r\n\r\nonly happen when the AG is personally involved in the case.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a difference between a question of law\r\n\r\nraised by the Attorney-General and a question of law raised by\r\n\r\nthe accused in a case. The Attorney-General, the member of the\r\n\r\nExecutive, is charged, as the Minister has pointed out, with\r\n\r\nconstitutional duties relating to the legal affairs of the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the conduct of prosecutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Attorney-General Chambers also have a\r\n\r\nlegislative  division that in fact drafts all  legislation  laid\r\n\r\nbefore Parliament.  It is therefore important to recognise  this\r\n\r\nfact  that  accounts  for the difference between  the  Attorney-General  raising a question of law and the accused in  the  case\r\n\r\nraising a similar question.  It would, of course, be tidier,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General's ability to raise a question of  law  for\r\n\r\ndetermination  by  the  Court of Appeal  is  separate  from  the\r\n\r\nconfines  of  any case.  This is the situation, for example,  in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom where in the Criminal Justice Act of 1972,  a\r\n\r\nprocedure known as the Attorney-General's reference was created.\r\n\r\nThis  makes  it  very clear that the public interest  is  served\r\n\r\nevery   time   the  Attorney-General  makes  a   reference   for\r\n\r\ndetermination  by  the  Court.   Such  references  are  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of determining the law in future and this clearly  may\r\n\r\nbe beneficial to both accused and prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that it is not the case that when an\r\n\r\naccused  raises  a question of law, it is never  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.   But equally clearly, it cannot be deemed to  be  so.\r\n\r\nThe  accused is personally interested in the outcome of the case\r\n\r\nand is not usually concerned with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe application of the law to others.  As I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, it could have been better to separate the\r\n\r\naccused's right of appeal from the Attorney-General's right to\r\n\r\nask for determination of questions of law by the Court of\r\n\r\nAppeal.  Perhaps, this matter can be looked at again in due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another merit, of course, of the reference approach is that the\r\n\r\ndefendant's  name  is normally kept out of the  appeal,  so  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal can fully consider the case as  one  involving\r\n\r\nprospective  cases.   At the same time, it reinforces  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  the Attorney-General cannot, in such a case, ask the Court\r\n\r\nto  set  aside  an acquittal of the accused whose  case  is  the\r\n\r\nsubject of a reference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments can be supported in that the end result on\r\n\r\neither  approach is to produce clearer rulings from the  highest\r\n\r\ncourt  of the land to govern criminal cases.  No one, I believe,\r\n\r\nwill dispute the need or desirability to have such a procedure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there may be a case for considering, in future, a\r\n\r\nprocedure  whereby the Attorney-General can refer questions,  de\r\n\r\nnovo   to   the  Court  of  Appeal  in  anticipation  of   legal\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  problems  without  direct  reference   to   a\r\n\r\nparticular case.  If such a procedure exists, it may help in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of law without the need to involve Parliament unduly\r\n\r\nin matters concerning the administration of criminal justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of criminal evidence and procedure, there is\r\n\r\nalways  the  argument  made that the  judiciary  and  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  should be allowed to regulate such rules, especially\r\n\r\nas  they are the ones practising in this area, and where a quick\r\n\r\ndecision  may  be required.  It may take too long to  take  such\r\n\r\namendments   to   Parliament,   too   cumbersome   and   perhaps\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  The power of the Attorney-General to refer to  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal questions of law therefore remains a most useful\r\n\r\nand necessary power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wonder if Prof Chin would clarify his second\r\n\r\npoint when he says, \"In future, the Attorney-General should have\r\n\r\nthe  power to raise questions.\"  Is he advocating this, both for\r\n\r\ncriminal and civil cases, or only criminal cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the answer is that I would\r\n\r\nexpect it to be restricted to criminal cases, simply because the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, as the Minister mentioned just now, is charged\r\n\r\nwith the duty of all criminal prosecutions in the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill\r\n\r\nincreases the lower limits for appeal without leave, ie,  appeal\r\n\r\nas of right.  The limits are changed under the Bill as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For appeals from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court,\r\n\r\nthe  subject matter must now exceed $50,000 (which increases  it\r\n\r\nfrom $5,000 to $50,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, the\r\n\r\nsubject  matter must now exceed $250,000.  (This is an  increase\r\n\r\nfrom $30,000 to $250,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effect of the present limits is that cases within the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the Magistrate's  Court are appealable  as  of\r\n\r\nright to the High Court, but are not appealable  as of right  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal.  This is a two-tier system.  This position\r\n\r\nis  satisfactory,  as there is no real need for  a  three  tier-system for Magistrate Court suits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cases within the jurisdiction of the District Courts are\r\n\r\nappealable as of right to the High Court and are also appealable\r\n\r\nas   of  right  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.   This  position  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory as there is a  three-tier system and  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething   that  is  really  needed.   Indeed,   the   proposed\r\n\r\namendments may have been intended to do away with this anomaly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable\r\n\r\nas  of right to the Court of Appeal.  Here again, there is a two\r\n\r\ntier  system.  This position is satisfactory and was consciously\r\n\r\nadopted with the cessation of appeals to the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effect of the proposed amendments would be that cases\r\n\r\nwithin  the  jurisdiction  of  the Magistrate's  Court  are  not\r\n\r\nappealable  as  of right to the High Court.   There  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsingle tier system. This is unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to elaborate later, Sir. Cases within the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the District Courts are not appealable  as  of\r\n\r\nright,  if  the subject matter is between $30,000  and  $50,000.\r\n\r\nCases  with  subject  matter between $50,000  and  $250,000  are\r\n\r\nappealable  as of right to the High Court.  The removal  of  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  right  of  appeal for cases below  $50,000  is  again\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  Again, appeals to the Court of Appeal are  also\r\n\r\nno longer as a matter of right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable\r\n\r\nas of right only if the claim could not have been brought in the\r\n\r\nDistrict Court.  While the right of appeal is curtailed somehow,\r\n\r\nthe position under the proposed amendment is still satisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main concern under the Bill is that there is only a\r\n\r\nsingle tier for cases with subject matter below $50,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the cardinal principles for appeal is outlined by a\r\n\r\nfamous  Judge,  as he then was - Megarry Judge in  the  Erinford\r\n\r\nProperties v Chesire CC.  Sir, judges must decide cases even  if\r\n\r\nthey are hesitant in their conclusions.  At the other extreme, a\r\n\r\njudge may be very clear  in his conclusion and yet on appeal  be\r\n\r\nheld  to  be wrong.  No human being is infallible, and for  none\r\n\r\nare  there more public and authoritative explanations  of  their\r\n\r\nerrors than for judges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting of limits to automatic rights of appeal would\r\n\r\nstreamline the administration of justice in that the  number  of\r\n\r\ncases  heard  in the High Court would be reduced, in  particular\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Minister referred to as the non-serious  cases.   The\r\n\r\ntime  taken  for the final disposition of a case would  also  be\r\n\r\nreduced if there is a single tier.  However, it should be  noted\r\n\r\nthat  there  are already deterrents in the present  system,  and\r\n\r\nthese are the disincentives:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The appellant has to pay security for cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) He has to pay the cost of his own solicitors or\r\n\r\nlawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) He has also got to pay the cost of the winning party if\r\n\r\nhe  loses  his  appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there are inherent  cost  deterrents which are already in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments would run against the grain\r\n\r\nfor the following considerations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current limit of $5,000 is a relatively small figure\r\n\r\nfor  most  Singaporeans.   Cases with subject  matter  of,  say,\r\n\r\n$20,000  to  $50,000 are not small to many litigants and  indeed\r\n\r\nthe  outcome may be a matter of serious economic consequence for\r\n\r\na  fair number. Sir, from the labour statistics available as  at\r\n\r\nend of 1997, more than 770,000 Singaporeans still earn less than\r\n\r\n$1,500  per  month.   The number increases to 1,288,000  earning\r\n\r\nless  than  $2,500  per  month.  Sir,  for  a  large  number  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the $50,000 cut-off amount is too large an amount.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  amount could be increased to $10,000  or  $15,000.\r\n\r\nWhen  this  amendment came in 1994, even if  one  looks  at  the\r\n\r\ninflation figure, I think it does not justify such a large  jump\r\n\r\nin  the  cut-off  amount.   Sir, we must  avoid  confirming  the\r\n\r\nfeeling of the people that justice is only for the rich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single tier cases, in addition, would be matters\r\n\r\nhandled by a Magistrate or District Judge.  They are all members\r\n\r\nof  the  Subordinate  Judiciary.   The  Subordinate  Courts  are\r\n\r\nsubject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court, which\r\n\r\nis  the repository of judicial authority in the Constitution and\r\n\r\nsafeguarded with security of tenure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on experience and wisdom, a Magistrate or younger\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge is less likely to be infallible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, appeal and the right of appeal is intrinsic in the\r\n\r\njudicial process and ensures that justice is seen to be done.  A\r\n\r\nlitigant's  right  to  have another higher tribunal  review  his\r\n\r\ncause  should not be curtailed.  If the problem is the increased\r\n\r\nworkload for the High Court judges, let us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen appoint more High Court judges or Judicial Commissioners to\r\n\r\nhandle the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of fair adjudication to which all have\r\n\r\naccess  is  the sine qua non in the administration  of  justice.\r\n\r\nThe  raising  of  the limit for appeals to the High  Court  from\r\n\r\n$5,000  to $50,000 is a ten-fold increase and will result  in  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  individual or small business litigants  being\r\n\r\nsubject to a single tier of dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saving grace of applying for leave to appeal may be\r\n\r\nillusory and create problems of its own.  Application for  leave\r\n\r\nwould require examination of the merits.  Affidavits would  have\r\n\r\nto  be filed. The grounds of appeal would have to be identified.\r\n\r\nIf leave is given, the appeal itself will again be determined on\r\n\r\nmerits.   So  what happens here is that there is  an  additional\r\n\r\nstep  being created with the consequential increase in cost  and\r\n\r\nusage of court time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notice of Appeal also cannot be filed unless leave\r\n\r\nitself  is obtained.  Hence the grounds of decision will not  be\r\n\r\navailable for the purposes of the leave application.  This would\r\n\r\nmean  again  that  the judge hearing the application  for  leave\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  second  guess the  trial  judge.   Counsel,  in\r\n\r\nadvising  the  litigant wishing to appeal, would  also  have  to\r\n\r\nsecond  guess  the  trial  judge, in  formulating  the  intended\r\n\r\ngrounds of appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two possible ways to address the above\r\n\r\nissues.    The  limit can be increased from $5,000  but  not  to\r\n\r\n$50,000.   It can perhaps be increased to $15,000.   This  would\r\n\r\nreduce the number of appeals but would allow litigants to whom a\r\n\r\nfive figure claim is significant  to enjoy an automatic right of\r\n\r\nappeal and access to the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed limits can be retained, but the system\r\n\r\ncan  be  modified.  There should be an automatic right  to  file\r\n\r\nNotice  of Appeal on current limits or on an increased limit  to\r\n\r\nabout $15,000.  Leave is required to file the Petition of Appeal\r\n\r\nif the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubject  matter  is below the proposed limit which,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsuggested, is perhaps below $15,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another amendment that I would like to highlight is\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  to  clause 21(3).  This clause  allows  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident  to increase the cut-off amount, after consulting  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice,  and by publishing the same  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nGazette.   Sir, justice is a matter of grave importance  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  I disagree that a matter that determines the access  to\r\n\r\na right of appeal should be decided by the Chief Justice and the\r\n\r\nPresident  alone.   I  think such an important  matter  must  be\r\n\r\ndebated and decided by this House.  It is important that in  the\r\n\r\nname   of   administration  of  justice,  we  do  not  introduce\r\n\r\ndeficiency in justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I would like to support the proposed\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, two intended\r\n\r\namendments in the Bill are of concern to me.  One is, I believe,\r\n\r\nsomething you can question in principle; and the second  may  in\r\n\r\nfact raise a constitutional question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to the access to the courts. I wish to\r\n\r\nassociate  my  arguments to that of the speaker  before  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran.  I share many of the concerns he has expressed  about\r\n\r\nthe  intended limits of access to appeal.  If the amendments are\r\n\r\npassed,  some cases would have no right of appeal.  There  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  single tier only and this is something we should question\r\n\r\nin  principle.   The  right to appeal to the  Supreme  Court  is\r\n\r\nimportant.   With  respect, as compared to judges  of  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt,  many  judges  in the Subordinate Courts  are  relatively\r\n\r\ninexperienced  and  they  do  not  have  security   of   tenure.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the nature of the Subordinate Courts is that  written\r\n\r\njudgements  are  not  normally  issued  with  full  grounds   of\r\n\r\ndecision, unless an appeal is pending.  Therefore, if  we  limit\r\n\r\nthe   right   to   appeal,   we  limit  the   transparency   and\r\n\r\naccountability  of these courts, and the use of their  decisions\r\n\r\nas precedents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus on the quantum in each case is of concern. The\r\n\r\nnew  sums  to be set are high, Sir.  I believe that  justice  is\r\n\r\nabout questions of principle, not quantum.  Just because a  case\r\n\r\nis  worth  less  does not automatically mean  that  it  is  less\r\n\r\nimportant  to  those  involved.  One  example  illustrates  this\r\n\r\nstarkly.   In the Small Claims Tribunals Act, the sums  involved\r\n\r\nare  well  below  $50,000.  Yet section 35 of the  Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals Act (Chapter 308) states that any party may appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe   High   Court  on  any  point  of  law  or  questions   for\r\n\r\njurisdiction.   This  is  of right.  To  limit  access  now,  as\r\n\r\nproposed, would seem inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment might be justified perhaps if there\r\n\r\nwere  a  backlog  of cases caused by a flood of appeals.   This,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is not the case at present, as I understand  it.   Our\r\n\r\ncourts have shown world class efficiency.  This, we can be proud\r\n\r\nof.   We  should  value  the efficiency in the  dispensation  of\r\n\r\njustice.   But  we  should pause and question before  efficiency\r\n\r\ngives way to haste or expediency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point refers to amendments to section 21(b) and\r\n\r\nsection  34(b).  These intend to allow the amounts to be  varied\r\n\r\nby  the President after consulting the Chief Justice.  I wish to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister to clarify if the Cabinet or the Minister-in-charge,  Minister for Law, is to first advise the  President  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter, or it would be left to the President to  act  after\r\n\r\nconsulting  the Chief Justice.  This is not clear  to  me.   The\r\n\r\nplain  wording  of the amendment suggests the  latter,  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  left  to  the  President after consulting  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice.  Article 21(5) of the Constitution of Singapore  allows\r\n\r\nfor legislation such as this to require the President to consult\r\n\r\nwith  any  person, other than the Cabinet or Minister.  However,\r\n\r\nArticle  21(1)  of the Constitution says that generally,  unless\r\n\r\notherwise  provided,  the President acts on ministerial  advice.\r\n\r\nMy  concern  is that if the President acts in consultation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Justice  only and without ministerial  advice,  this\r\n\r\nraises  a  constitutional question.  Will  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nclarify if the Cabinet or Minister will advise the President  of\r\n\r\nany  change, and by \"advise\" I mean in the constitutional  sense\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nputting the question outside the discretion of the President.  I\r\n\r\nassume  the  Minister  will clarify  at  the  end  and  I  shall\r\n\r\ntherefore   proceed  with  the  question  that  arises   if   no\r\n\r\nministerial  advice is required and the concerns that  therefore\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no ministerial advice is required, this raises the\r\n\r\nconcern  that it might be against constitutional principle.   In\r\n\r\nraising  this concern, allow me to make it plain that I  do  not\r\n\r\nquestion  the  august  judgment of the  Chief  Justice  and  the\r\n\r\nPresident.    Rather,  it  is  question  of  the  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements  of  power.  The Constitution  gives  separate  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  powers  to  the Executive, the  legislature  and  the\r\n\r\njudiciary.   One  institution should not  intrude  on  another's\r\n\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the judicial power in Article 93 is to interpret law\r\n\r\nas  applied in individual cases.  The Chief Justice also has the\r\n\r\npower  to  supervise  administration  of  the  courts  that  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  provides  or this House  creates  by  legislation.\r\n\r\nThis   House  cannot  make  laws  that  are  designed  to  apply\r\n\r\nspecifically and specially to decide any singular or  particular\r\n\r\ncase.  This would intrude on the judicial power as shown in  the\r\n\r\nPrivy Council case of Liyange.   Judicial power, however, is set\r\n\r\nwithin  its own limits.  Judicial power is not a power  to  make\r\n\r\nlaw or to decide general rules on what kind of cases to hear  by\r\n\r\nquantum  or  other  general characteristics  as  these  intended\r\n\r\namendments  provide.  This is the power of the  legislation  and\r\n\r\nthat   power  belongs  rightly  to  the  legislature  and   this\r\n\r\nParliament.  The power to make laws such as the SCJA belongs  to\r\n\r\nthis  House.  So does the power to vary it.  It does not  belong\r\n\r\nto either the Chief Justice or the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to make law can be, of course, delegated for\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  legislation.   The power can  be  delegated  to  the\r\n\r\nExecutive,  Ministers.   Parliament  then  plays  its  role   by\r\n\r\nretaining the power to question Ministers over their use of  the\r\n\r\ndelegated power to hold them accountable to the House.  This  is\r\n\r\npossible  because our Ministers are also Members of  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe  constitutional  principle  is  that  delegated  legislation\r\n\r\nshould be in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of the Executives who are accountable to Parliament.\r\n\r\nIf  we  put  the  power in the hands of the President  or  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice,  I  wish to point out that the House cannot  hold  them\r\n\r\naccountable in the same way as Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem can, of course, be circumvented. The\r\n\r\namendment  can  provide for the Minister for Law to  act,  after\r\n\r\nconsulting   the   Chief   Justice.   This   will   accord   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  principles  and accountability  of  this  House,\r\n\r\nwhile  achieving  the  wish  to  take  into  account  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice's  views  and to amend as necessary.  This  is  a  small\r\n\r\nchange,  but it is one that may be necessary to clearly  observe\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution.  I would urge the Minister to  clarify  these\r\n\r\nconcerns before passing the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nobliged  to  you  for  giving  me this  opportunity.   Sir,  two\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers, Mr Ravindran and Mr Simon Tay, have  touched\r\n\r\non  the  question of section 34, ie, the power of the President.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with them, and may I add my own view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the matter now stands, it is this Parliament that\r\n\r\ndecides  the  question of jurisdiction.  And I see no  need  for\r\n\r\nthis  power to be given either to the President or to the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice.   This  is  a  very  important  constitutional   issue.\r\n\r\nQuestion  of  jurisdiction should be within the  hands  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament  and  this Parliament alone.  And I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to reconsider the position.  As Mr Simon Tay has  said,\r\n\r\neven  if  the  Minister advises, I still think that  this  House\r\n\r\nshould be the final body to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. However, I\r\n\r\nmust  say that I have reservation that the quantum that is being\r\n\r\nasked  in  this Bill is indeed very high.  As the matter  stands\r\n\r\nnow, anything below $5,000, you require leave.  Now we are being\r\n\r\nasked to raise this limit to $50,000, which is 10 times.   I  am\r\n\r\naware that leave will be granted if there is merit.  But then it\r\n\r\nwould lead to legal expenses and involve time.  The Minister has\r\n\r\nnot given this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHouse  any  figure to indicate that because of  this  provision,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a backlog in the High Court and the Court of  Appeal.\r\n\r\nJustice must be seen to be done and I think justice will be done\r\n\r\nif  there is less restraint on the part of the litigant to  seek\r\n\r\njustice.   And  I would like to assure this House,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  members of the legal profession, who would  normally\r\n\r\nadvise  on  question of appeal, are very cautious.   They  would\r\n\r\nconsider  the merit of the case because time and legal  expenses\r\n\r\nare  involved and only when they think there is some merit, then\r\n\r\nonly  they  will  go to court.  So I am asking the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nincrease  it by all means, but not 10 times, perhaps $20,000  (4\r\n\r\ntimes)  and  come back to this House sometime in the future,  if\r\n\r\nneed be, as the previous speaker, Mr Simon Tay, has spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practising member of the Bar, Sir, I am proud of the\r\n\r\njudicial  system.   In  the  last  seven  years,  despite   some\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from some quarters outside, I can say in this  House\r\n\r\nthat  we  have the most independent and capable judicial  system\r\n\r\nanywhere in the world, and world bodies have reckoned this.  But\r\n\r\nin the name of efficiency, we should not undermine the system to\r\n\r\nsuch an extent that the right to appeal is questioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also a related question which, of course, is\r\n\r\nnot  part  of  this  debate, but I will  pursue  it,  with  your\r\n\r\npermission.  The Court of Appeal is presently made  up  of  only\r\n\r\nthree permanent Judges.  May I urge the Minister to consider  in\r\n\r\nfuture  to increase this to five permanent Judges.  I  know  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice  from time to time appoints  one  of  the  senior\r\n\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court, but I think this arrangement is not\r\n\r\npractical.   Even Hong Kong, Sir, I am told, has got more  Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal Judges.  With more Appellate Judges, there  would  be\r\n\r\nmore views and our judicial system will benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to another issue which I think deserves\r\n\r\nmention  -  the  right of appeal.  The Attorney-General  is  the\r\n\r\nhighest  officer  of  the land and I am glad  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nbrought  this  amendment.  He should have  the  discretion.   He\r\n\r\nshould have the right to appeal in the public interest.   And  I\r\n\r\nshare Prof. Chin's concern\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  even  on  hypothetical questions, he is the  man  who  can\r\n\r\nforesee  what are the problems that are going to face  him.   He\r\n\r\ncould  pose even hypothetical questions, so that the  public  at\r\n\r\nlarge will know what is the legal position.  I think it will  be\r\n\r\na  wise  thing for us to do this now than to wait for things  to\r\n\r\nhappen and then introduce legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a practising member of the Bar, I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister - I am supportive of the amendment - to please go slow.\r\n\r\nThe perception and the signal we must send to the public is that\r\n\r\nwe  are  interested in justice and we are not, in  the  name  of\r\n\r\nefficiency,  going to change the system to the  disadvantage  of\r\n\r\nthe litigant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to raise my concern on one of the two proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Bill, that is, the monetary  limit  for  an\r\n\r\nappeal to the higher Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main rules of natural justice is the quick\r\n\r\nresolution  of disputes.  The fat of the proposed  Bill  may  be\r\n\r\njust  that.  But many cases may not be referred for appeal to  a\r\n\r\nhigher Court and therefore it removes potentially the backlog of\r\n\r\nappeal cases.  But equally important is the accessibility  to  a\r\n\r\nright  of appeal.  The Bill, by increasing the limit from $5,000\r\n\r\nto  $50,000  for an appeal to the High Court from a District  or\r\n\r\nMagistrate Court, and $30,000 to $250,000 for an appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of Appeal, is, in my view, excessive.  The public,  whose\r\n\r\ndisputes and claims may be small in quantum, may feel that  they\r\n\r\nhave  no  access to appeal to a higher Court simply because  the\r\n\r\nclaim involved is small.  In fact, it may appear that commercial\r\n\r\ncases  are  more  likely to qualify for appeal  because  of  the\r\n\r\nhigher  limit  as  quite naturally, cases  involving  commercial\r\n\r\ndisputes involve large sums of money.  But the right of  appeal,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  for everyone, not just corporations.  For an  ordinary\r\n\r\nman, it is not just the quantum, it is the principle and the law\r\n\r\nthat  is involved that is equally important to him.  For parties\r\n\r\nthat go to Court, especially when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  have  used up all the avenues of mediation, his  case  and\r\n\r\ndispute  could be the most important thing to him,  whether  the\r\n\r\namount is big or small.  A more accessible right to appeal  also\r\n\r\nmeans the opportunity for any person seeking justice to have his\r\n\r\ncase heard before a more experienced Judge, especially when many\r\n\r\nof  our Judges in the District and Magistrate Courts are younger\r\n\r\nand less experienced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, money cannot be the main determinant whether a case is\r\n\r\nheard  by a more experienced Judge.  There could be cases  where\r\n\r\nthe  amount  involved is small but may have very  important  and\r\n\r\nwide  implications to society.  Are we discounting the fact that\r\n\r\nmistake  in judgement and decision could be one of the  possible\r\n\r\noutcomes  and consequence of decision at the lower  Court?   Why\r\n\r\nmake  it difficult for parties to appeal?  If any, we must  make\r\n\r\nthe  appeal  process accessible, convenient and  affordable.   I\r\n\r\nurge   the   Minister  to  review  and  clarify  these  matters,\r\n\r\nespecially  on  the  limits of appeal, so  as  not  to  make  it\r\n\r\nexcessive.  Based on this qualification, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  may I say from the outset that I am most unhappy with  the\r\n\r\namendments  proposed in this Bill.  I do not support  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nand may I say that my Party does not support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have to say in this House that\r\n\r\njustice  lies at the heart of every human being.  And  he  wants\r\n\r\njustice in his conduct of his daily life and in any action taken\r\n\r\nagainst him by the Government or the public prosecutor who is  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Executive.  So, he must be given access  to  the\r\n\r\nCourts and to the highest Court, if necessary, if he feels  that\r\n\r\nit is important enough to him.  So he must have ready access.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on which I have expressed my dissatisfaction and the\r\n\r\nParty's  dissatisfaction, although it does not come  within  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  this Bill, is the increasing cost of justice  to  the\r\n\r\nordinary man.  We have had cost increases several times and many\r\n\r\na man feels now it is too expensive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto go to the Courts.  This is a very unfortunate and regrettable\r\n\r\nfeeling if it is shared by a great majority of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said here, Mr Speaker, Sir, the right of an appeal\r\n\r\nto  test  the  decision of a single Judge has been with  us  for\r\n\r\nmany, many years.  It is an inherent part of the judicial system\r\n\r\nof  many countries, almost every country I should have said, and\r\n\r\nnot  only  do  they provide a one tier appeal,  they  go  on  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  further  appeal, a two tier appeal.   We  have  seen\r\n\r\nrecently  with Malaysia setting up the Supreme Court of Malaysia\r\n\r\nto  hear  appeals  from the Court of Appeal.   And  I  shall  be\r\n\r\ntalking about this later.  Instead of moving towards a two  tier\r\n\r\nappeal system, we seem to be heading towards cutting out appeals\r\n\r\naltogether.   Is that what we want in this country?   There  are\r\n\r\nother  ways  than  bringing  legislation  before  Parliament  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage appeals, and which are also to be regretted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, the Chief Justice, who hears Magistrates'\r\n\r\nappeals,  said quite publicly at a hearing that he was going  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage frivolous appeals by convicted persons who  may  have\r\n\r\nhad  long sentences of imprisonment or heavy fines, and he would\r\n\r\ndiscourage  that, cut down the number of appeals  by  increasing\r\n\r\nthe  sentences.   May  I say that is a most unfortunate  remark.\r\n\r\nAnd  now  what does the Government propose to do?  As  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid by the speakers before me, it proposes to provide from now,\r\n\r\nwith the passing of this Bill, and there is no question that  it\r\n\r\nwill  become  law, that a single magistrate be  left  to  decide\r\n\r\nclaims  below  $30,000.  To the litigant, a  claim  of  $15,000,\r\n\r\n$20,000  or  $25,000  may mean a great  lot  to  him.   In  that\r\n\r\nrespect,  this Bill is discriminatory.  Mr Ravindran,  I  think,\r\n\r\nmentioned  that, but I will go further and say this  is  totally\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory, and questions may be asked whether  it  does  or\r\n\r\ndoes  not  violate the equality requirement in our Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhy  should  you deny a litigant who has a claim  of  less  than\r\n\r\n$50,000 any right of appeal from the decision of a single  judge\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmagistrate?  Why is it that only persons who have claims of more\r\n\r\nthan $50,000 and $250,000 should have this right and not persons\r\n\r\nwho  have  claims  below the sum of $50,000?  Of  course,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  little restraint in the number of appeals  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed and the present limits are good enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, as has been pointed out, there are other restraints by\r\n\r\nway  of requiring appellants to provide security for costs.   If\r\n\r\nthe  appeal is thought to be frivolous, the answer is to ask for\r\n\r\nfurther  security and the opposing litigants can do  just  that.\r\n\r\nIf  they  thought an appeal was frivolous, they  could  make  an\r\n\r\napplication  to  the  High Court for security  for  cost  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased,  particularly  if there is  some  evidence  that  the\r\n\r\nperson appealing will not have the means to pay the costs at the\r\n\r\nend.   So we have the mechanism to prevent frivolous and useless\r\n\r\nappeals going up to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister was very brief in his introduction of this Bill and\r\n\r\nhe  says the Chief Justice had requested the amendments.  May we\r\n\r\nknow  from the Minister whether it is because there are too many\r\n\r\nappeals  and, if so, what is the present number of appeals  that\r\n\r\njudges find difficult to cope with?  As has been said before me,\r\n\r\njustice demands that even if it takes a little longer, that  the\r\n\r\nperson seeking justice should be accorded justice and be able to\r\n\r\nleave  the  court or tribunal with the feeling that justice  has\r\n\r\nbeen done to him even though he may not agree with the decision.\r\n\r\nSo  what  is  the need?  Is it because there are  far  too  many\r\n\r\nappeals  and we have not got enough judges, or we have  not  got\r\n\r\nenough court rooms and appeals are going to be lengthened out to\r\n\r\ntwo or three years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, I am unhappy at the haste with which cases are\r\n\r\nprocessed  through the courts.  So I am, and my Party  is,  very\r\n\r\nunhappy with the proposal that we now increase the threshold for\r\n\r\nappeal  from the Subordinate Courts to $50,000.  It is not  good\r\n\r\nenough  to say they can still appeal because they can  seek  the\r\n\r\nleave  of the magistrate.   Magistrates are human and, like  any\r\n\r\nother human being.  More so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  they are judicial officers and they have to  decide  on\r\n\r\nthe merits they must feel that they are right in their decision.\r\n\r\nThey  would  be  reluctant to grant any further  appeal  saying,\r\n\r\n\"This question is very clear to me.  I cannot see that an appeal\r\n\r\nis  going  to  help.\"  So the decision is left entirely  to  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate this by what the Privy Council said, and I am\r\n\r\nsure  the Minister is aware of this, in relation to applications\r\n\r\nthat  were  made  under  section 60  of  the  Supreme  Court  of\r\n\r\nJudicature  Act.  There were two applications made  under  that,\r\n\r\none  to  the Chief Justice and one to another judge of the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.  They were criminal cases because section 60 applies only\r\n\r\nto  criminal cases.  And in both instances, the applications  to\r\n\r\nrefer  questions  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  were  turned  down\r\n\r\nsummarily.  The Privy Council which, as I have said before,  was\r\n\r\nthen the highest court in the land, pronounced their unhappiness\r\n\r\nover  the decisions of the two judges not to refer the questions\r\n\r\nto  the Court of Appeal.  The Privy Council was in no doubt that\r\n\r\nthe  questions  sought to be referred were questions  of  public\r\n\r\ninterest and they said they should have been referred.  So there\r\n\r\nis  the Privy Council commenting, not on magistrates' decisions,\r\n\r\nbut on the decision of the Chief Justice and a judge of the High\r\n\r\nCourt.   So  if  they can make mistakes, what about magistrates?\r\n\r\nAre they not liable to fall into the same error?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear from the Minister the compelling reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  this amendment is necessary at this stage.  If it is speedy\r\n\r\njustice  that  we want, cases heard and disposed of immediately,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  should  try and take a leaf  from  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  Pakistan is proposing to do.  He is  proposing  to\r\n\r\nhave  cases  heard  immediately,  appeal  heard  the  next  day,\r\n\r\nexecution carried out within seven days.  Is that what  we  want\r\n\r\nin Singapore - is that the whole aim and object of justice, that\r\n\r\nit should be speedily carried out and determined?  Or is our aim\r\n\r\nto  try  and do justice between subject and subject and  between\r\n\r\nthe  subject  and  the  Government?  These  are  very  important\r\n\r\nquestions of principle and cannot be shrugged off or shelved  by\r\n\r\nconsiderations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   time   or  convenience.   Many  a  judge  has   said   that\r\n\r\nadministrative  convenience  has  no  place  in  the  system  of\r\n\r\njustice.   However inconvenient it may be, it must be  the  sole\r\n\r\naim  and object of justice to do justice even though it  may  be\r\n\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on to the proposed repeal and re-enactment of section\r\n\r\n60.  This is again most unsatisfactory.  I have raised this, not\r\n\r\nonce, but two or three times in this House, after I returned  to\r\n\r\nthis  House.   The  law  as  it  now  stands  gives  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  the sole right without any hindrance to  take  up  a\r\n\r\nquestion  to the Court of Appeal.  But the accused has to  apply\r\n\r\nfor leave and, as I have indicated, whether it reaches the Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal or not was left to the judge who heard the appeal and\r\n\r\nwho  quite  clearly  felt  convinced of  the  rightness  of  his\r\n\r\ndecisions.  That itself was wrong in principle.  Why should  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor be allowed to ride - I suppose I  should  not\r\n\r\nsay his coach and six horses - his car through the courts?  This\r\n\r\nBill  seeks to give him greater rights.  I am sure the  Minister\r\n\r\nis  aware, and this comes from the pronouncements of the highest\r\n\r\ncourts which have dealt with the question of Crown privilege.  I\r\n\r\nam sure he is aware that the courts have decided again and again\r\n\r\nin  England and Scotland that the question of public interest is\r\n\r\nnot a matter for the Attorney-General or anyone else, but it  is\r\n\r\nfor the courts to determine after hearing both sides what is the\r\n\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is wrong about that? The courts are the persons who\r\n\r\nshould  decide   what  is  in  the  public  interest,  not   the\r\n\r\nExecutive.   This amendment seeks to remove that  question  from\r\n\r\nthe realm of the court to the Public Prosecutor, contrary to the\r\n\r\ndecisions from other jurisdictions.  We seem to be stepping  out\r\n\r\nof  line  with the jurisdictions in other countries.  I  suppose\r\n\r\nthen it can be said that we are unique, we are different, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  follow what other countries do.  Is that what we want?   Or\r\n\r\nare  we concerned with whether our present system serves justice\r\n\r\nor not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had proposed previously that under section 60 at least the\r\n\r\nright  to  take the matter up to the Court of Appeal  should  be\r\n\r\nleft to the Court of Appeal itself and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  litigants  or  the  Public  Prosecutor  should  make   the\r\n\r\napplication  to  the Court of Appeal and not to  the  judge  who\r\n\r\nheard it.  This was done by Malaysia many, many years ago.  They\r\n\r\nsubstituted the decision of the judge with the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal, requiring an application to be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal.  What is wrong with that, instead of giving the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor greater rights?  Reference was  made  to  the\r\n\r\nright  of the Public Prosecutor in the United Kingdom.   As  has\r\n\r\nbeen  pointed out, in the United Kingdom, the Public  Prosecutor\r\n\r\nhas  no  right  of appeal against the acquittal of  any  accused\r\n\r\nperson by a court.  But here in Singapore we do, and it is there\r\n\r\nthat  he takes up the questions to the Court of Appeal.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, it is purely a question of law which would  not\r\n\r\naffect  the decision in a particular case.  It is to govern  the\r\n\r\ncourts  in  any  future cases coming before them involving  that\r\n\r\npoint of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say a few words about the amendment proposed by\r\n\r\nclause  3  on  the amendment of section 34 to  add  a  new  sub-section.   This  is again, may I say, very unsatisfactory.   The\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal, as I have said, is an inherent  part  of  the\r\n\r\njudicial  system, and is a matter of great public interest.   It\r\n\r\nshould only be left to the legislature what limits should be put\r\n\r\nto  it  and  not  left  entirely to the  Chief  Justice  or  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  A very valuable point was taken by Mr Simon Tay that\r\n\r\nunder  the amendment if a decision to change the limit is  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  President or the Chief Justice, it cannot be questioned\r\n\r\nin  this House.  I would ask the Minister not to move the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  the  Bill  but  that it be  referred  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   At least then we will have the views of the  public\r\n\r\nas to what they feel about the rights of appeal being restricted\r\n\r\nso severely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a few words about the present system of appeals\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  At the moment, as I indicated, we only have a one\r\n\r\ntier  appeal except where in civil cases, decisions go  up  from\r\n\r\nthe District Court to the High Court. Then there is another tier\r\n\r\nof appeal to the Court of Appeal.  I think it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  time  we thought of introducing a further tier of appeal,  a\r\n\r\ntwo-tier  appeal, which as I said, is in place in  most  of  the\r\n\r\nother countries, certainly in the Commonwealth countries and the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom.  And in the United States, you will  find  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  more  than a two-tier system of appeal.   They  have\r\n\r\nthree  tiers  and there may, in some cases, be a  four-tier.   I\r\n\r\nknow  criticism has been made particularly about the  death  row\r\n\r\ninmates in the United States.  I agree that a person should  not\r\n\r\nbe  left 10 - 12 years waiting to know whether he is going to be\r\n\r\nexecuted or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate, if I have the time, Mr Speaker, Sir, why I\r\n\r\nthink  a two-tier appeal is necessary by referring to a case  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where I think a possible miscarriage of  justice  was\r\n\r\ndone  to  the litigants by the absence of a further appeal  from\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeal.  And this was the case of the three accused\r\n\r\npersons which I referred to in my motion on the appointment of a\r\n\r\ncommission  to  look into the investigation of  criminal  cases.\r\n\r\nThese  three men were charged with murder when they  should  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  charged.  They were not even at the  scene  and  the\r\n\r\nmurder  was  committed by someone else as was proved later,  and\r\n\r\nthat man was convicted after the three men were acquitted.   And\r\n\r\nthat  came about because the defence sought strenuously to bring\r\n\r\nthat other man to justice.  That is the criminal side of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the men took their action to the High Court for damages,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  had  spent  three years  in  jail,  the  Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner  dismissed the case without answering the  question\r\n\r\nwhich  was posed to him.  He was asked to answer how is it  that\r\n\r\nthree  innocent  men could confess to such a gruesome  crime  as\r\n\r\nmurder  when they knew, at the end of it, they would be  hanged.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer the question.  They took it up to the Court of\r\n\r\nAppeal  and the Court of Appeal was troubled with this question.\r\n\r\nThe  Court of Appeal felt that the presumption of innocence  was\r\n\r\nvery  strong.  The three men had been acquitted and someone else\r\n\r\nhad  been convicted. They felt there was this strong presumption\r\n\r\nof innocence in favour of the accused\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  were  claiming for damages for malicious prosecution.   But\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal said in its judgment, \"But we can  find  no\r\n\r\nevidence   that   they   gave  evidence  before   the   Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner  that  they were innocent and that  they  were  not\r\n\r\nthere  at the scene of the crime.\"  That was an error.  A  total\r\n\r\nerror.   They  had  adjourned  their  decision  and  gave  their\r\n\r\njudgment.   But they overlooked the evidence the men had  given.\r\n\r\nYet,  in  their own affidavit of evidence filed, in the  hearing\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Judicial  Commissioner, every  single  accused  had\r\n\r\nstarted his affidavit by saying, \"I am totally innocent of  this\r\n\r\ncrime.   I was never there.  I knew nothing about this.  I  deny\r\n\r\nthe charge right from the start.\"  So the evidence was there and\r\n\r\nyet the Court of Appeal missed that evidence.  If there had been\r\n\r\na  further  appeal available to the three men, they  could  have\r\n\r\ngone up to the appellate court.  But that was not possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your time is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam :</b> May I say those men have now been made\r\n\r\nbankrupt.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Members\r\n\r\nwho   have   spoken  and  several  comments,  observations   and\r\n\r\ncriticisms  have  been made.  I will try to categorise  them  in\r\n\r\nbroad categories and deal with the issues that they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, several Members have expressed the concern that this\r\n\r\nsomehow  will  affect  access  to  justice  and  there  will  be\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on justice.  Much has been said by  Members  about\r\n\r\nthe   inherent  right  for  litigants  to  appeal.   Some   have\r\n\r\nemphasised  the importance of automatic appeal.   Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\neven  thought that this amendment raises questions  of  equality\r\n\r\nunder  the Constitution.  Before we get carried away in thinking\r\n\r\nthat this amendment has come out of the blue, never done before,\r\n\r\nand that it violates some sacrosanct principles, I would like to\r\n\r\ninform Members of the background.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background is that all these years, the principle that leave\r\n\r\nto appeal is required, coupled with a monetary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthreshold, is not new.  It has always been there in our  statute\r\n\r\nbooks.  That is the first point I wish to make.  I think Members\r\n\r\nshould know that this system of leave to appeal, coupled with  a\r\n\r\nmonetary  limit,  has  been an essential feature  of  our  legal\r\n\r\nsystem.  It  has been in our laws since 1955.  In  fact,  before\r\n\r\nthat,  in  1936, there was no appeal when the amount  was  below\r\n\r\n$100.  At that time the jurisdiction of the Court was $500.  So,\r\n\r\nin  case Members did not realise it, the monetary limit is  part\r\n\r\nand parcel of this principle of leave to appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, periodic adjustments of the monetary limit is also not\r\n\r\nnew,  and it has never been argued before that having that limit\r\n\r\nand  persons who do not qualify under the limit having to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  leave  -  it  has never been argued that justice  has  been\r\n\r\ndenied  and access to justice restricted.  Because some  of  the\r\n\r\nspeakers  seem to be unaware of this background, let  me  remind\r\n\r\nthem of how this has evolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1986, the monetary limit was $500 in the Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts,  or with leave if the amount was less.  This element  of\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  apply for leave has always been there,  if  the\r\n\r\namount was not reached.  So the monetary limit was $500 and  the\r\n\r\njurisdictional  limit  of  the Subordinate  Courts  was  $10,000\r\n\r\nbefore   1986.   In  1986,  the  jurisdictional  limit  of   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts was raised to $50,000.  When that  was  done,\r\n\r\nthe  appeal threshold limit was then raised from $500 to $2,000,\r\n\r\na  four-fold  increase.  I was then in Parliament.   Of  course,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the Members who spoke were not there.  But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nrecall  any  Member  then arguing that this was  curtailment  of\r\n\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, seven years later, the jurisdictional limit of the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts was raised to $100,000.  The appeal threshold\r\n\r\nlimit  was  then  raised from $2,000 to $5,000,   2  1/2  times.\r\n\r\nAgain, I stress, the element of applying for leave to appeal was\r\n\r\nalways there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 1997, the jurisdictional limit for the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts was raised to $250,000.  But last  year  the\r\n\r\ncourts did not propose that the appeal be immediately\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanged.  It was kept at $5,000, and monitored for a year.  Now,\r\n\r\nwe  are  altering the appeal limit to $50,000.  The  element  of\r\n\r\nleave  being given is still being retained.  So the point to  be\r\n\r\nunderscored  is  that with the increase in jurisdiction  of  our\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts to $250,000, obviously more and  more  cases\r\n\r\nare going to be heard by the Subordinate Courts.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nthreshold  for  appeals has to be adjusted.  Then  the  question\r\n\r\narises:  what  is the figure?  $10,000, $15,000,  $20,000?   The\r\n\r\nChief Justice has proposed it be raised to $50,000.  I would, as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Law, accept the judgement of the Chief Justice\r\n\r\nwho  is in charge of administration of the courts and who has  a\r\n\r\ngood  overview of the management of cases.  That  is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint  I  would  make.  So let's be clear about the  background.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  something that has come out of the blue,  it  was\r\n\r\nnever   done   before.   These  are  periodic   adjustments   of\r\n\r\njurisdictional  limits and threshold limits  for  appeals.   All\r\n\r\nalong,  those who do not meet the threshold limits did not  have\r\n\r\nautomatic appeal. But it does not mean that the right of  appeal\r\n\r\nwas  curtailed  because they could have  applied  for  leave  to\r\n\r\nappeal.  If there were merits and they made a case, leave  would\r\n\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make to those who have suggested\r\n\r\nthat  it somehow conjures up curtailment of justice, some  grave\r\n\r\ninjustice  is being done, is to say that that is a  very  narrow\r\n\r\nway  of  approaching  the issue.  They  proceed  on  the  narrow\r\n\r\nassumption  that the more appeals you have, the  more  tiers  of\r\n\r\nappeals  you have, the more automatic appeals you have, that  is\r\n\r\njustice.  I do not think it follows.  That is a narrow  view  of\r\n\r\nlooking  at the whole system of justice because looking  at  the\r\n\r\nadministration of justice in totality, you have to view what the\r\n\r\ncourts  have  done  in the past many years.  A  whole  array  of\r\n\r\nreforms has been undertaken by the courts.  Rather than conclude\r\n\r\nthat  automatic  appeals,  greater number  of  appeals,  greater\r\n\r\nnumber  of  tiers  of  appeals equals better  administration  of\r\n\r\njustice, why not examine and inquire what the courts have  done,\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  a  pro-active case management approach to administration  of\r\n\r\njustice?   In  fact it saves time, cost and trauma and  emotions\r\n\r\nfor  potential  litigants, with lesser cases  having  to  go  to\r\n\r\ntrial,  and lesser cases going to appeal.  Does that necessarily\r\n\r\nmean it is bad for justice?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justice system in Singapore has undergone tremendous reforms\r\n\r\nand many initiatives have been taken by the courts.  The quality\r\n\r\nof  judgments, quality of judges improves and judges handle  the\r\n\r\ncases  and  deal  with them seriously and fewer appeals  go  up.\r\n\r\nDoes  this  necessarily mean bad?  I do not  think  it  follows.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would stress that we should look at the totality of\r\n\r\nour  justice system.  Look at the whole context of the proactive\r\n\r\napproach  taken by the courts because they have indeed  taken  a\r\n\r\nwide  variety  of  measures which have  in  fact  benefited  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notable example that comes to my mind is mediation of civil\r\n\r\ncases  since  1994.   The law did not require  it.   It  was  an\r\n\r\ninitiative,  an innovation of the courts, that all  civil  cases\r\n\r\nare mediated before trial, and the settlement rate is 92%.  From\r\n\r\n1995 to October 1998, only 1.6% of 125,000 civil cases proceeded\r\n\r\nto  trial.  If you proceed on the assumption that the more cases\r\n\r\nthe  better, obviously it is a bad system of justice!   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to put it to colleagues here that this system of mediation,\r\n\r\nwhere  so many cases have been settled, has in fact resulted  in\r\n\r\nsubstantial  savings  of  money, time, heartache,  emotion,  for\r\n\r\npotential litigants.  None of the MPs have touched on this.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  justice system as evolved by our  courts  under  the\r\n\r\nleadership of the Chief Justice has in fact led to two bites  at\r\n\r\nthe  cherry.  One bite is to have the case resolved by mediation\r\n\r\nfirst.  If that fails, then a second bite at the trial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the other proactive measures taken by the courts - mediation and counselling in matrimonial cases which can cause\r\n\r\ntremendous  emotional  trauma  for  the  husband  or  wife   and\r\n\r\nchildren.  The number of cases now going to trial is very small.\r\n\r\nThe  courts have reduced the time lag between setting  down  the\r\n\r\ncase and hearing in the High Court where they had a target of 18\r\n\r\nmonths, and I am told the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntarget has been reached.  Even the Subordinate Courts cases  are\r\n\r\nfixed  within three to four weeks from the time that the parties\r\n\r\nare  ready.  Pre-trial conferences, electronic filing of  cases,\r\n\r\nability  of people to pay fines through ATOMs without having  to\r\n\r\ngo  to the Subordinate Courts.  And the Subordinate Courts  have\r\n\r\nnow  also had a recent soft launching of its innovative  concept\r\n\r\nknown  as  \"Multi-door Hot House\", which is a  one-stop  service\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I mention all this? Because I am troubled by the\r\n\r\napproach  taken by some of my colleagues who seem to focus  just\r\n\r\non  this  right  of  appeal.  They have not been  aware  that  a\r\n\r\nperiodic  adjustment has been done from 1986,  and  before  that\r\n\r\ntoo.   We  have  to  do  this because  the  monetary  limit  was\r\n\r\nincreased in 1987 to $250,000.  Do not take a narrow view.   You\r\n\r\nhave to look at the whole system of justice and it is because of\r\n\r\nall  these  reforms taken that our judiciary has been given  top\r\n\r\nmarks,  not  by  me, speaking as the Minister for  Law,  but  by\r\n\r\nindependent international rating agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By the ICJ.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> ICJ is not an independent rating agency!\r\n\r\nIn  the  PERC  study, August 1998, on the ranking of Singapore's\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Judiciary  among certain countries,  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nrated  to have the best national institutions in Asia.   In  the\r\n\r\nranking of the judiciary and the police, Singapore topped  again\r\n\r\nwith a score of 2.87 whereas the rating of the United States and\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  was  3 and 3.11 respectively.  Since an  interesting\r\n\r\ndebate is going to come later on, PERC commented:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Surprisingly, for a country where the Government is often\r\n\r\naccused by foreign human rights activists (and if I may add,  by\r\n\r\nsomebody  else)  of  using the judiciary to pursue  politically-motivated  libel  suits,  our  American  respondents  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  even  rated  the island's judicial  system  as  being\r\n\r\nsuperior to that of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please bear in mind this total approach to the administration of\r\n\r\njustice, and I think colleagues should really join me in  giving\r\n\r\ntop   marks  to  our  judiciary,  ie,  the  Supreme  Court,  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts and our Chief Justice.  I  think  they  have\r\n\r\ndone\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  proud.  Far from curtailing access to  justice,  they\r\n\r\nhave  in fact gone out of their way to deliver justice in a more\r\n\r\nuser-friendly and more efficient way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the statistics are interesting. When the appeal limit\r\n\r\nwas  $5,000 in the Subordinate Courts, in 1996 the total  number\r\n\r\nof claims filed in the Subordinate Courts was 29,281.  Of these,\r\n\r\n425 went to trial.  Of these, only 83 went on appeal.  Of these,\r\n\r\nonly  15  appeals were allowed, less than 1%.  In  1997,  32,088\r\n\r\nclaims  were  filed in the Subordinate Courts.  Only  462  cases\r\n\r\nwent to trial.  Of these, 87 went up on appeal, of which 14 were\r\n\r\nallowed.   In 1998, up to October this year, 36,269 claims  were\r\n\r\nfiled in the Subordinate Courts.  469 went to trial, and 97 went\r\n\r\nup on appeal.  The point I am making is that the system has just\r\n\r\nevolved  shows  that  many cases have been mediated.   Only  the\r\n\r\ncases  that deserve to go on trial, or fail mediation,  went  to\r\n\r\ntrial.   Of  that, not many went on appeal.  So  the  system  of\r\n\r\njurisdiction limits and threshold limits for appeals works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the small number of cases that later went to\r\n\r\ntrial  shows  the high quality of the Subordinate Court  Judges.\r\n\r\nIt  shows that the regular adjustment of monetary limits ensures\r\n\r\nthat  only  serious appeals go up.  Otherwise, many other  cases\r\n\r\nwould have gone up and occupied precious High Court time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have said and the variation to the\r\n\r\nlimits proposed in the amendment, colleagues have noted that the\r\n\r\namendment provides for the President, in consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nChief Justice, to vary the amounts so the Courts can monitor the\r\n\r\nnumber of appeals and the number of applications filed for leave\r\n\r\nto  appeal.   If necessary, in the light of experience  of  what\r\n\r\nhappens,  the  amount  can be decreased  or  adjusted.   Several\r\n\r\nMembers  - Mr Simon Tay, Mr Ravindran, Mr Shriniwas Rai  and  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  -  took umbrage at this provision and said  this  is\r\n\r\nintrinsically wrong, it is Parliament which should  decide,  and\r\n\r\nParliament  should be the sole arbiter, whether  this  or  other\r\n\r\nlimit.   We can argue this and debate it.  But who is  the  best\r\n\r\njudge of what limit best works?  We in Parliament?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Of course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam says, of course. The\r\n\r\nadministration of the Courts is really under the  leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Justice.  He has brought the Courts and developed the\r\n\r\nCourts  to a situation which has today earned praise and  kudos.\r\n\r\nI  for one would have full confidence in the Chief Justice,  and\r\n\r\nin  the  light of experience, depending on the number of  cases,\r\n\r\nthis figure can be adjusted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay raised a question as to whether there are some\r\n\r\nconstitutional principles involved here.  But I must be  careful\r\n\r\nnot  to give any authoritative pronouncement or purport to  make\r\n\r\nany  authoritative pronouncement on constitutional issue.   With\r\n\r\nthat  caveat, let me say also that the Attorney-General is  very\r\n\r\ncareful  when  he  drafts Bills that he would  have  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount the constitutional aspect of the Bill.  But to answer Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay's  question, I would think that this  provision  does\r\n\r\nfall  within  Article 21(5) of the Constitution  which  provides\r\n\r\nthat, \"The Legislature may by law make provision to require  the\r\n\r\nPresident   to   act  after  consultation  with,   or   on   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of, any person or body of persons other than  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  in the exercise of his functions other than . [the  two\r\n\r\nprovisos are not applicable here.]\"  But let me say to Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay  that, in practice, the Chief Justice, on such matters,  has\r\n\r\nclose  consultations with the Attorney-General who in turn  also\r\n\r\nconsults me for my views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested raising the figure to $10,000 or\r\n\r\n$15,000.   This is a matter for judgement really at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe day.  If you say the figure has to be raised, and has to  be\r\n\r\nraised because of the upping of the limit last year to $250,000,\r\n\r\nthen  it is a relative matter, whether it is $10,000 or $15,000.\r\n\r\nI  think  $10,000 or $15,000, in fact, comes very close  to  the\r\n\r\ncases  which  the Small Claims Tribunal hears, ie, cases  up  to\r\n\r\n$10,000,  and with the consent of both parties, up  to  $20,000.\r\n\r\nSo  to raise it to $10,000 or $15,000, which will come so close,\r\n\r\nand overlap with the Small Claims Tribunal, may be unrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument was made by more than one speaker who\r\n\r\nsuggested   that  this  amendment  gives  the  impression   that\r\n\r\nlitigants  who have larger claims have better access to  justice\r\n\r\nand  better rights, and that this amendment may favour the rich.\r\n\r\nBut  they  fail  to  look at it from the other  point  of  view.\r\n\r\nBecause   you  can  have  a  \"rich\"  plaintiff,  big   corporate\r\n\r\nplaintiff,  suing  a  small-timer, small businessman.

So the Members who made\r\n\r\nthat point have failed to look at it from the other side of  the\r\n\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I touch on the amendments to section 60? First, Prof.\r\n\r\nChin Tet Yung has made some interesting observations.  He agrees\r\n\r\nwith  the  premise that there should be a difference  between  a\r\n\r\nreference  or a question by the Attorney-General and application\r\n\r\nto  refer by the accused person.  I think he accepts there is  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  distinction.  But as I listened to  his  speech,  I\r\n\r\nthink he made two separate points.  First, he proposes that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  reference ought  to  be  distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nreference  by the accused convicted person.  And he  would  want\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General to have the right to refer any question  of\r\n\r\nlaw  unconnected  with  the accused  person.   I  think  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider  that.   Of  course,  he  would  have  noted  that  the\r\n\r\namendment  does  make  a distinction in a  sense  that  for  the\r\n\r\naccused  person, the Court has a discretion whether  to  reserve\r\n\r\nthe  question for decision by the Court of Appeal.  In the  case\r\n\r\nof  an  application  by  the Attorney-General,  the  Judge  must\r\n\r\nreserve  the question, provided the other ingredients  are  met.\r\n\r\nHe has referred to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom's position.  Of course, in the  United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nthe  conviction and acquittal is not disturbed by the  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal's  decision.   Our  existing  provision,  including   the\r\n\r\namendment that we propose to make, is different because in cases\r\n\r\nof  acquittal, the Court of Appeal's practice is not to  disturb\r\n\r\nthe  acquittal  even  if they agree with the  arguments  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  prosecutor.  But the Court of Appeal can set  aside  the\r\n\r\nconviction  if  the point of law is decided against  the  public\r\n\r\nprosecutor's arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he made a second and even broader proposal, which is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Attorney-General should have the power to  refer  any\r\n\r\nquestion  de  novo without direct reference to any  case,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it.  And he says it will help in the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  law, and I believe he was supported by Mr Shriniwas Rai who\r\n\r\nhas  gone  further  and said even hypothetical  cases  could  be\r\n\r\nraised.   The significance of this proposal is that it would  be\r\n\r\ndelinking from the other elements which have to be satisfied  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing provision, ie, that it must arise in a  particular\r\n\r\ncriminal matter and the determination of that question must have\r\n\r\naffected  the  case.   But he has clarified  that  he  is  still\r\n\r\ntalking  about criminal cases.  I am prepared to look into  this\r\n\r\nand  discuss  it with the Attorney-General, and if  we  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  merit  in this, we may well  have  to  come  to\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam, as he himself admits, has raised much of\r\n\r\nwhat  he has said before.  The first point he makes is that  the\r\n\r\npublic   prosecutor  ought  not  to  have  this  special   right\r\n\r\ndistinguished from the application by the accused -  application\r\n\r\nby the accused is discretionary; the Court can turn it down, but\r\n\r\nthe  application  by the Attorney-General has  to  be  approved,\r\n\r\nprovided it meets these other elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Instead of giving a lengthy reply, since\r\n\r\nhe  raised it on 30th July 1997, my colleague, Minister of State\r\n\r\nHo Peng Kee, gave an excellent reply which was as follows, and I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the Public Prosecutor prosecutes cases, he prosecutes\r\n\r\nin  the public interest.  If there is a point of public interest\r\n\r\nthat needs the clarification of a full\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal, then as Public Prosecutor he should have  the\r\n\r\nleeway so that the point of law can be conclusively decided.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut,  then,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  says  on  the  question  of  public\r\n\r\ninterest,  we  are  out  of line with other  jurisdictions,  and\r\n\r\npublic  interest  must  be determined by  the  Court.   He  even\r\n\r\nreferred  to  Malaysia.   He should  double  check  the  law  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia because in the case of Public Prosecutor v Lim Joo Soon\r\n\r\n[1981]  1  Malayan  Law Journal, page 107,  this  was  what  the\r\n\r\nFederal Court had to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". The Public Prosecutor's application coming as it is as\r\n\r\nfrom  such  an  august  officer of  the  law  removes  from  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of  the  court the right to decide  on  whether  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  of  public interest.  When the  Public  Prosecutor\r\n\r\napplies  for  a reference . it must be taken that  any  question\r\n\r\nposed  by him is of public interest, unless of course it can  be\r\n\r\nshown  that the question is indeed of his own personal  interest\r\n\r\nand of no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be useful for me to explain to this House why is it that\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General's conclusion that the question he is posing\r\n\r\nor  is  applying  to refer a matter of public interest  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  be a public interest.  And the best I can  do  is  to\r\n\r\nreproduce  part of the judgement of the Court of Appeal  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher case (1998).   In  that\r\n\r\ncase,  the argument was made by the Attorney-General.   But  the\r\n\r\ncourt found that his submissions were \"compelling\" but felt that\r\n\r\nthe  existing provision was not appropriately worded.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Attorney-General argued, and this is summarised by  the\r\n\r\nCourt  in  its judgement and I think it succinctly puts  forward\r\n\r\nthe rationale for this amendment to section 60. I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Public Prosecutor is responsible for and represents\r\n\r\nthe  State  in all criminal prosecutions.  He is also the  Chief\r\n\r\nLegal  Adviser to the Government on what the law is.  He  has  a\r\n\r\nduty  to  enforce what he believes to be the right law which  no\r\n\r\none  has.   Therefore  if  he does not agree  with  the  law  as\r\n\r\npronounced by the High Court, he should be entitled to go to the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal for a final ruling.  Accordingly,  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  submitted in the case that any  Public  Prosecutor's\r\n\r\nquestions which satisfy the three conditions would invariably be\r\n\r\none  of public interest based on the need to have a final ruling\r\n\r\nfor future cases.  He further submitted that a determination  by\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal advances the public interest in reinforcing\r\n\r\nthe  finality principle in the following ways:  (a)  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor  is  thereafter  able to decide  on  prosecutions  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the Court of Appeal's decision;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Public Prosecutor is able to advise the\r\n\r\nGovernment on whether or not it is desirable to change the  law;\r\n\r\nand   (c)   where  the  Court  of  Appeal  upholds  the   Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor's  case,  all convictions and acquittals  founded  on\r\n\r\nthat  principle  of  law are likely to end  at  the  Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Court of Appeal's judgement is that the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's submissions were compelling,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhas agreed to give effect to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise a number of\r\n\r\npoints with the Minister by way of clarification?  As I listened\r\n\r\nto  his  reply,  I noted that he was saying that the  number  of\r\n\r\ncases  had  decreased tremendously, not only by the transfer  of\r\n\r\nthe  cases  above  $50,000  to the  Subordinate  Courts  by  the\r\n\r\namendment  made  last  year, but as a result  of  the  mediation\r\n\r\nprocess  introduced in this country.  I am all for it.   But  to\r\n\r\nsay  that we have mediation and we do not need appeals seems  to\r\n\r\nme to miss the point altogether.

Are  our\r\n\r\njudges overworked with appeals at the moment?  May I ask all the\r\n\r\nquestions so that Prof. Jayakumar does not have to jump up every\r\n\r\nfew  minutes.   May I point out to him, by way of clarification,\r\n\r\nthat  I  was  not  relying  on  the  Malaysian  Court  for   the\r\n\r\nproposition that public interest is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmatter  for the courts.  I am sure he is aware of the  decisions\r\n\r\nin  the  House  of Lords, on appeals from Scotland and  England,\r\n\r\nthat  public interest is eminently a matter that should be  left\r\n\r\nto  the  courts, and he mentioned Christopher Bridges'  case.  I\r\n\r\nstand  corrected of course, but the Court of Appeal  there  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  question  of public interest was  a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\ncourts.   It did.  So there we have it, supporting what  I  said\r\n\r\nthat it should be a matter for the courts and not for the Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Minister whether it is the speedy\r\n\r\nadministration of justice that is important in society?   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant.   Or  is  it the perception in the public  mind  that\r\n\r\nevery  citizen will get the justice that is satisfactory and  of\r\n\r\nwhich  he  can  feel satisfied?  Which is more important  -  the\r\n\r\nperception  of  justice by the public at  large  or  the  speedy\r\n\r\nadministration of justice?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first point, I\r\n\r\ndid  not  say that, because there is mediation, there should  be\r\n\r\nlesser  appeals.  I raised the point on mediation  to  make  the\r\n\r\nbroader  point to urge colleagues to look at the total  approach\r\n\r\nto the administration of justice which our courts have taken and\r\n\r\nthat  is a considerable development for which the courts are  to\r\n\r\nbe congratulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also not justified this amendment on the ground that\r\n\r\nthere  is a tremendous overload or flood of cases.  The point  I\r\n\r\nmade here is that the main reason is because of the increase  of\r\n\r\nthe  jurisdictional limit to $250,000, there will be more cases.\r\n\r\nAnd  as we have done before, we will have to increase the appeal\r\n\r\nlimit so as to be in line with the jurisdictional limit.   As  I\r\n\r\nconceded, we can have a debate on whether it should be  $50,000,\r\n\r\n$40,000,  $30,000, and so on.  It is a relative  matter.   I  am\r\n\r\nmore  than  willing to defer to the wise judgement of the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice   in  this  regard  because  he  is  dealing  with   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the courts on a daily basis.  Who  are  we  to\r\n\r\nsecond  guess  and  say, \"Well, it should  be  $40,000  and  not\r\n\r\n$50,000.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Jeyaretnam extols what is going on in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom and what the courts have decided.  I should point out to\r\n\r\nhim  that  the provision in the United Kingdom which Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nTet Yung referred to, would enable the Attorney-General there to\r\n\r\nrefer a point to the court, if I am not mistaken, whether or not\r\n\r\nit  is of public interest.  So the United Kingdom's approach  in\r\n\r\nan  analogous provision delinks it from the public interest.  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam is shaking his head.  But he may do well to  look  up\r\n\r\nsection 36 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1972.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Christopher Bridges' case indeed. If he had listened\r\n\r\ncarefully  to what I have said, I said that the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nargued  and made a lengthy submission as to why there were  very\r\n\r\ngood  reasons for interpreting the provisions in such a way that\r\n\r\nwhen the Attorney-General makes an application for reference  of\r\n\r\na  question,  it should be considered to be of public  interest.\r\n\r\nThe  court  found that argument compelling but the  section,  as\r\n\r\nworded,  they  did  not feel it was appropriate  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  argument.  Therefore,  the  law  has  to  be\r\n\r\namended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question he asked is that he seems to imply that\r\n\r\nall  the measures which I have praised the court are really  for\r\n\r\nthe  speedy administration of justice, ie, speed at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  justice being done.  Actually, if you examine what  happens,\r\n\r\nthe  measures  taken  by the courts involve more  time,  effort,\r\n\r\nenergy  and  work  by the judges, the Registrars  and  everybody\r\n\r\ninvolved.  They need not have done it.  They can just say,  \"You\r\n\r\nhave come to sue?  A wants to sue B?  Fine, let's have a trial.\"\r\n\r\nThe  amount  of  work  it takes for counselling  in  family  and\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  affairs and the amount of work  it  takes  to  have\r\n\r\nmediation is tremendous.  So it is not speed in wanting  to  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  these cases.  It is in fact with the desire  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the parties are able to resolve the cases before they come\r\n\r\nto  trial  that  motivates them.  And I think  that  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  principle in the administration of justice  which  we\r\n\r\nshould not forget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have another question.

The  Tripartite   Committee   also\r\n\r\nrecommended the reduction in the employer's CPF contribution for\r\n\r\nworkers above the age of 60 and allowing employers to reduce the\r\n\r\nwage cost of older employees by up to 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of the retirement age is a strategic move\r\n\r\nto tackle the problem brought about by our ageing population and\r\n\r\ndeclining  birth  rates.  Currently, eight  economically  active\r\n\r\npersons  aged between 15 and 59 support one person aged  60  and\r\n\r\nabove.  This ratio will decline\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsharply  in future.  By the year 2010, there will only  be  four\r\n\r\neconomically active persons supporting one person  aged  60  and\r\n\r\nabove.   This ratio is expected to fall further to  2.5  in  the\r\n\r\nyear 2030.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this decline in economically active persons will\r\n\r\naffect  our economic vitality.  The working population  will  be\r\n\r\nfaced  with an increasingly heavy burden of having to support  a\r\n\r\ngrowing number of elderly persons who are not able to work.  The\r\n\r\ngrowing  number  of economically inactive senior  citizens  will\r\n\r\nalso  place  a heavy demand for a wide range of social  services\r\n\r\nincluding health care.  This will result in a heavier tax burden\r\n\r\non those who are still working.  Furthermore, a dwindling supply\r\n\r\nof  local workers will compel employers to turn to more  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  to  meet their manpower needs.  While  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nskilled  and  talented  foreign workers  will  be  an  asset  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  an  increase  in  the number  of  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers will create more social problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life expectancy at birth is 77 years. Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are healthy and vigorous well beyond  60  years  of\r\n\r\nage.   It is a waste of valuable human resources if workers  are\r\n\r\nrequired to retire at the age of 60 when they are still able  to\r\n\r\nadd  value to the economy.  Moreover, an early retirement  means\r\n\r\nthat  a  retired worker or retiree will have to start living  on\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  savings much earlier.  This will result  in  a  faster\r\n\r\ndepletion  of  their retirement savings. Hence, an extension  of\r\n\r\nthe retirement age will not only maximise the utilisation of our\r\n\r\nhuman  resources, it will also provide the opportunity for older\r\n\r\nworkers  to  continue earning a regular income and  accumulating\r\n\r\nmore savings for their eventual retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that most developed countries are\r\n\r\nalready  ahead of us in this area.  The retirement age  norm  in\r\n\r\ncountries  like  Germany, Switzerland, United  Kingdom,  Sweden,\r\n\r\nNetherlands  and  Italy is 65.  Some countries like  Norway  and\r\n\r\nDenmark  set a higher retirement age of 67 years.  We understand\r\n\r\nthat the United States has recently announced its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlong-term  plan to raise the retirement age to 70.  The  current\r\n\r\nretirement  age is 65 and is due to increase to  67  next  year.\r\n\r\nEven  in the Asian NIEs, workers are now working well beyond  60\r\n\r\nyears. For example, retirement age norm in Taiwan is now 65.  As\r\n\r\na  country  with  a  small population, we  should  maximize  our\r\n\r\nlimited   indigenous   human  resource,  including   the   older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have accumulated valuable skills  and  working\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no doubt that raising the retirement age\r\n\r\nwill  generate  long  term benefits for  our  economy,  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers and also for the workers themselves.  It is a  win-win\r\n\r\nstrategy.  Despite the current economic downturn and an increase\r\n\r\nin  unemployment rate, we should not ignore the long-term impact\r\n\r\nof  a  rapidly  aging workforce.  We need to take  a  pro-active\r\n\r\napproach  to  address the issue now before it  develops  into  a\r\n\r\nserious  problem in future.  The time to tackle  such  potential\r\n\r\nproblems  is  now,  not  when  our  competitiveness  is  already\r\n\r\nseriously  weakened by an aging workforce.  But in  raising  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age,  we must not ignore the reality  to  employers,\r\n\r\nwhich  is,  the cost of employing older workers is higher  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of our seniority-based wage scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current wage structure, the longer a worker has\r\n\r\nbeen  employed,  the higher is his pay.  In  other  words,  wage\r\n\r\nlevels  are  determined more by an employee's length of  service\r\n\r\nthan the value of his job or performance.  As a result, wages of\r\n\r\nolder  workers  are not closely linked to their productivity  or\r\n\r\nperformance.  Consequently, older workers are often  being  paid\r\n\r\nbeyond their job worth.  That is why employers are reluctant  to\r\n\r\nretain or to employ older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the problems of the seniority-based-wage system,\r\n\r\nthe  Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age had\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  employers should implement the  base-up  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   The adoption of the base-up wage system will  help  to\r\n\r\nnarrow   the  maximum-minimum  salary  ratio  and  enable   wage\r\n\r\nincreases  to  be  more  closely  linked  to  productivity   and\r\n\r\nperformance.  However, before the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbase-up wage system can be implemented, companies have to adjust\r\n\r\ntheir salary ratio to the optimal level of 1.5:1.  Since it will\r\n\r\ntake  some  time  to  achieve  the  optimal  salary  ratio,  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee  recommended  that  employers  should   be\r\n\r\nallowed to initiate a wage cut of up to 10% for employees  above\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 60.  This measure will make it more attractive  for\r\n\r\nemployers to retain their older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To supplement the 10% wage cut for older workers, the\r\n\r\nTripartite   Committee  also  proposed   that   employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for employees aged 60-65 years be reduced from\r\n\r\n7.5% to 4% and from 5% to 4% for employees aged above 65 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to introduce wage and CPF cuts came\r\n\r\nabout  after  extensive  discussions and  deliberations  by  the\r\n\r\nTripartite Committee.  The Committee took note of the fact  that\r\n\r\nsince  most  workers  are on the seniority wage  system,  it  is\r\n\r\ncurrently not uncommon for an employee to accept a wage  cut  of\r\n\r\n20%  to  25%  when  they are re-employed upon retirement  at  60\r\n\r\nyears.  The Tripartite Committee's proposal to cut wages  by  up\r\n\r\nto 10% in addition to the CPF cut is therefore a more favourable\r\n\r\narrangement for older workers.  This should encourage more older\r\n\r\nworkers  to work beyond 60 and continue to contribute  to  their\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the employers have given the full discretion to\r\n\r\ninitiate a wage cut, the Tripartite Committee also urged them to\r\n\r\nbe judicious in implementing this policy.  Employers should bear\r\n\r\nin  mind  that  the  wage  cut is introduced  with  the  aim  to\r\n\r\nrectifying  the problems arising out of the seniority-based-wage\r\n\r\nsystem  and  to bring wages of older workers in line with  their\r\n\r\nproductivity and performance.  They should therefore  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  their companies' maximum-minimum salary ratio, as  well\r\n\r\nas  their  job  worth  and performance of older  employees  when\r\n\r\ndeciding  on making the wage cut.  A wage cut is not  needed  if\r\n\r\nthe  older employees' salaries are already reflective  of  their\r\n\r\njob  worth or their productivity or where their productivity and\r\n\r\nperformance already justify their salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the Bill seeks to amend the Retirement Age Act\r\n\r\n(Cap  274A)  to  enable employers to reduce the wages  of  their\r\n\r\nemployees who attain the age of 60 years and above, on or  after\r\n\r\n1st  January  1999.  The higher retirement age  of  62  will  be\r\n\r\neffected separately through Regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill introduces a new section 4A to spell\r\n\r\nout  the  circumstances and conditions whereby an  employer  can\r\n\r\nreduce the wages of employees above the age of 60.  This section\r\n\r\nstipulates that an employer should give reasonable prior  notice\r\n\r\nin  writing to an older employee of the intention to reduce  his\r\n\r\nsalary.   The prior notice should furnish information,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  amount and the effective date of the reduction.  The extent\r\n\r\nof  the wage reduction is limited to 10% of the employee's  wage\r\n\r\nat the age of 60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers will be required to give the older employees a\r\n\r\nreasonable  opportunity to consider and respond to the  proposed\r\n\r\nwage  reduction.  In the event that no agreement can be reached,\r\n\r\nthe  older  employee  may choose to retire on  his  own  accord.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the employer may retire him from service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 4A(5)(a) lays down the grounds whereby\r\n\r\nemployers can initiate a wage cut.  It states that the reduction\r\n\r\nshall  be  based  on reasonable factors, such as the  employee's\r\n\r\nproductivity,  performance,  duties  and  responsibilities,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  he is on a seniority-based-wage system.  Employers  are\r\n\r\nprohibited from initiating a wage cut solely on the ground of an\r\n\r\nemployee's  age, unless age is a bona-fide requirement  for  the\r\n\r\nperformance of his job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide more flexibility, section 4A(5)(b) allows\r\n\r\nemployers to introduce the wage cut, either at the age of 60  or\r\n\r\nat  any  age  above  60.   Hence,  in  a  situation  whereby  an\r\n\r\nemployee's  salary is still reflective of the job worth  at  the\r\n\r\nage of 60 but not beyond, his employer can choose not to cut his\r\n\r\nwages  at the age of 60 but to initiate a cut later on, say,  at\r\n\r\nage  61.   At  the  same time, employers are allowed  to  either\r\n\r\nintroduce a one-off cut in the wages of their older employees by\r\n\r\nup to 10%, or to stagger the wage cut in such a manner\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the total extent of the reduction does not exceed  10%  of\r\n\r\nthe  employee's  wages  at age 60.  In  view  of  the  differing\r\n\r\nproductivity levels and performances among employees, the extent\r\n\r\nof the wage cut could vary from one employee to another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill hence enables employers to implement the wage\r\n\r\nreduction  in  a manner most suited to the company's  needs  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   However, employers should  follow  closely  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee's  recommendation  of  initiating  a  wage\r\n\r\nreduction  either  through  a  direct  wage  cut  or  through  a\r\n\r\ncombination  of  various wage cost items  which  include  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits, variable bonus, AWS and the basic wage.  In  the  case\r\n\r\nof unionized companies, the union concerned should be consulted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the key recommendations on raising the retirement\r\n\r\nage   and  reducing  wages  of  older  workers,  the  Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee  also proposed several other measures to  address  the\r\n\r\nproblems of an aging workforce.  These include :-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 25-year cap on the service period for the calculation of\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of a base-up-wage system in place of the seniority-based-wage system;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Alternative Medical Benefit Scheme in place of the\r\n\r\ncurrent medical benefit scheme; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outplacement programme to assist older workers who\r\n\r\ncannot  be re-deployed within the company, to secure a  suitable\r\n\r\njob in another company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are supplementary measures to address concerns of the\r\n\r\nhigh  costs of retaining older workers. These measures  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented through the tripartite guidelines.  We do  not  need\r\n\r\nlegislative  changes at this juncture for  the  measures  to  be\r\n\r\napplied.   In  fact,  some  employers and  unions  have  already\r\n\r\nstarted  to  implement  these  measures.   While  some  teething\r\n\r\nproblems  may crop up at the initial stage of implementation,  I\r\n\r\nam  confident with good tripartite co-operation, we will be able\r\n\r\nto make progress in these reforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the retirement age was raised from\r\n\r\n55  to 60 in 1993, it had provided employment opportunities  for\r\n\r\nsome  63,000  employees who are above the age of 55.   With  the\r\n\r\nraising  of  the  retirement age to 62,  it  is  estimated  that\r\n\r\nanother 7,000 employees who will turn 60 next year will benefit.\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year of the implementation, about 10,000\r\n\r\nworkers are expected to benefit each year.  The raising  of  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age  is clearly beneficial to older  workers  as  it\r\n\r\nallows  them  to remain gainfully employed for a longer  period.\r\n\r\nEmployers  will also stand to gain from the retention  of  these\r\n\r\nskilled and experienced workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to speak on this interesting Bill.  I fully  support\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the picture painted by the Minister is indeed a very\r\n\r\nchallenging  one for all of us in Singapore because  demographic\r\n\r\ntransition  will be very dramatic in the years  ahead.   By  the\r\n\r\nYear  2010,  as the Minister has stated, the population  of  the\r\n\r\naged  could  become quite dramatic and grave for us.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nissue well thought of, because we would have to think about  how\r\n\r\nwe  need to deal with this challenging issue of the future,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  greying  of Singapore.  The Bill will be relevant  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture,  but  it  will be redundant in the future  because  we\r\n\r\nwould not be able to talk about retirement in the years ahead as\r\n\r\nnobody   will  be  retiring  and  the  work  world  will  change\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   Nobody will be allowed to  retire.   Mind  you,\r\n\r\nsome  of you would not be allowed to get off!  You will be  kept\r\n\r\nas long as possible and there will be no retirement, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be the issue of information technology. With\r\n\r\nthe change of work itself, people will be retained as long as it\r\n\r\nis possible and it is not a picture that we can avoid.  It could\r\n\r\nbe a real picture in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to this Bill, it will enhance the employability\r\n\r\nof  the retirees and this is good.  It enables various companies\r\n\r\nto think about retaining older workers and this is indeed a very\r\n\r\npositive  move.   But there are a few areas of  concern  that  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to raise, because with this transition, there  will\r\n\r\nobviously be areas of disputes related to wages.  I want to find\r\n\r\nout  from the Minister who mediates in case there is dispute  on\r\n\r\nthe  wages. I can understand that for workers who are unionised,\r\n\r\nthe  unions would be able to represent them.  But there are lots\r\n\r\nof  workers who are not unionised and one needs to look  at  how\r\n\r\ntheir interest could be protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there would be a lot of employers who might take\r\n\r\nadvantage of this Bill and try and find a leverage to retire off\r\n\r\npeople  earlier  than they should.  So there  will  be  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  older workers who would be got rid off because they  are\r\n\r\neither  not  really productive or found not to be  suitable,  or\r\n\r\nsome  excuses could be given to terminate them from  their  work\r\n\r\nworld.  I want to find out what protection or recourse would  be\r\n\r\navailable   to   ensure  that  older  workers   would   not   be\r\n\r\nunjustifiably  retired  off earlier  than  they  should  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill as a whole, I agree with it because it\r\n\r\nis  going to help us meet the challenges of the aging population\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, to those who have reached the age of 60, \"1-1-99\" is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  number  to  remember because, with  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  1999,  the  Ministry of Manpower  will  raise  the  new\r\n\r\nretirement age from 60 to 62.  The new Act will allow  employers\r\n\r\nto  cut up to 10% of the wages of employees beyond the age of 60\r\n\r\nover a period of two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support this Bill. For employees who have reached\r\n\r\nthe  age of 60, the employers' CPF contribution has already been\r\n\r\nreduced  from 20% to 4%.  With the recently announced employers'\r\n\r\ncost-cutting measures, this will again be cut by 2%.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, the employers'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution will be reduced from 20% to  2%,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nreduction of 18%.  This will reduce the income of the employees.\r\n\r\nDuring  their  years  of employment, these employees  have  made\r\n\r\ncontributions to the company.  They worked hard for the company.\r\n\r\nI  hope that when employers are deciding on the wage-cut of  the\r\n\r\nemployees,  they will consider all these factors.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they must also value and treasure the experience acquired\r\n\r\nby the older employees.  I feel that the wage-cuts should not be\r\n\r\nexercised too frequently, otherwise the employers will  be  busy\r\n\r\ncalculating  the  amounts  to be cut  all  the  time  while  the\r\n\r\nemployees will be bogged down with worries and anxiety and  lose\r\n\r\nheart   to  work.   Efficiency  will  be  affected.    So   will\r\n\r\nproductivity.   So  I  would suggest that wage  cuts  should  be\r\n\r\nlimited to not more than once a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private companies and the civil service should adopt the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  annual increments to evaluate the performance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  employees  before the employers decide  whether  the  pay\r\n\r\nshould  be  cut  or  not.   An annual  appraisal  will  be  more\r\n\r\nrational.  Secondly, under the Bill, the employers who intend to\r\n\r\ncut the pay of employees must give reasonable advance notice  in\r\n\r\nwriting  to  the employees so as to give the employees  time  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  matter. As such, I would propose  that  the  Bill\r\n\r\nshould  specify that the employees must be given  at  least  one\r\n\r\nmonth's  notice  and  should  be  required  to  reply  to  their\r\n\r\nemployers within one month whether they accept the terms.   With\r\n\r\nthe  stipulation of one month, it is good for both sides.  There\r\n\r\nwill be no unnecessary controversies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the civil servants who are under the pension\r\n\r\nscheme  will  be seriously affected by this new Bill  when  they\r\n\r\nreach  the  retirement  age at 60.  I  would  propose  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider allowing civil servants  to  collect  their\r\n\r\nlump sum pension when they reach the age of 60 and then continue\r\n\r\nto work in keeping with the spirit of the new Bill.  These civil\r\n\r\nservants have worked their whole adult working lives in  various\r\n\r\nMinistries   and   Government   departments   and   have    made\r\n\r\ncontributions to the development of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.

As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  these  increments, older workers  generally  receive\r\n\r\nhigher  wages compared to younger workers who are still  at  the\r\n\r\nlower  end  of their salary scales even for doing the same  job.\r\n\r\nThis may create a situation eventually where it becomes less and\r\n\r\nless  viable for companies to retain the services of their older\r\n\r\nworkers compared to the younger ones.  Employers may also resist\r\n\r\nattempts  to  raise  the  retirement  age  as  it  will   become\r\n\r\nprogressively more expensive to retain an aging workforce.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  for  older  workers is especially  precarious  during\r\n\r\nperiods   of  economic  downturn,  as  companies  retrench   and\r\n\r\nrestructure their operations in order to remain competitive  and\r\n\r\nto  survive the recession.  Higher-paid workers are more  likely\r\n\r\nto  be  axed  if their jobs can be taken over by less  expensive\r\n\r\nyounger  workers.  Our older workers will find it more difficult\r\n\r\nto hold on to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njobs  in companies that are facing difficult times, as the  cost\r\n\r\ndifferential of keeping them on the payroll compared to  younger\r\n\r\nworkers becomes too wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from several Members in the last few days,\r\n\r\nincluding  NTUC Secretary-General, that older workers  generally\r\n\r\nexperience more difficulty obtaining and fitting into new  jobs,\r\n\r\nrequiring new skills and offering lower salaries, when they  are\r\n\r\nretrenched  compared  to  younger  workers.   It  is   therefore\r\n\r\nimperative  that  measures be taken to  ensure  that  our  older\r\n\r\nworkers stand an equal chance of remaining employed and  not  be\r\n\r\nplaced  in  a  more disadvantaged position compared  to  younger\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of such measures becomes more critical in\r\n\r\nthese economically difficult times, as companies look at ways to\r\n\r\ntrim   costs.    Reduction  in  the  rate  of   employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  for older workers had previously helped  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  cost  differential of retaining older workers  compared  to\r\n\r\nhiring  younger  ones  manageable.  The employers'  contribution\r\n\r\nrate  for  younger  workers until recently stood  at  20%  while\r\n\r\nemployers  pay only 7.5% or less for workers over  55  years  of\r\n\r\nage.   However,  with the impending reduction in employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate by 10% for younger workers, but only  by  3.5%\r\n\r\nor  less  for  older  workers,  the comparative  cost  advantage\r\n\r\nafforded  by lower CPF contributions for older workers  will  be\r\n\r\neroded.   Adjustments will have to be made in order  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  viability  for employers to retain or employ older  workers\r\n\r\nwhile  ensuring that workers, regardless of their age,  continue\r\n\r\nto  receive  a  fair  wage  for  their  experience,  skills  and\r\n\r\nperformance,  and  not  to be discriminated  against  purely  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of their age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment for the reasons\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  stated.  However, I would  like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider safeguards that would  ensure  our  older\r\n\r\nworkers, whose salaries are at or below the market rate for  the\r\n\r\njob,  would  not  be adversely affected by this amendment  where\r\n\r\ntheir salaries can be further reduced by 10% when they attain 60\r\n\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A(3) of the amendment Bill stipulates that the\r\n\r\nemployer  has  to  give reasonable prior notice  to  the  worker\r\n\r\nbefore reducing his salary, and that the worker must be given  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  opportunity of being heard.   After  the  worker  is\r\n\r\nheard,  new section 4A(3) implies that he is then left with  two\r\n\r\nchoices,  if  he is not happy with the reduction in his  salary.\r\n\r\nHe  can either retire or be retired by his employer.  In effect,\r\n\r\nit  is  really no choice, and the worker has to retire.  Whether\r\n\r\nit is voluntarily or involuntarily, it is really quite academic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to have seen a provision in the Bill that\r\n\r\nwould  provide the worker an exemption of the 10%  reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe  salary after he attains 60 years of age if he or his  union\r\n\r\nis  able  to establish that his cost to his employer is no  more\r\n\r\nthan that of younger workers with equivalent job performance  in\r\n\r\nsimilar jobs in his company, or that his wage is at or below the\r\n\r\nmarket rate for this job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Minister to prohibit\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are  not  affected by the  seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem  from  invoking the provisions in this Bill in  order  to\r\n\r\nreduce the salaries of their older workers.  For example, if  an\r\n\r\nemployer  pays  his  workers a fixed hourly rate  for  the  job,\r\n\r\nregardless  of the seniority of the worker, should the  employer\r\n\r\nstill  be permitted to reduce the salary of his employee by  10%\r\n\r\nonce he attains the age of 60 years?  To permit employers to  do\r\n\r\nso   without   other   valid   grounds   would   tantamount   to\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against the worker purely by virtue of his age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A(5) permits an employer to reduce the wages\r\n\r\nof  the  older  employees differently for various reasons  other\r\n\r\nthan age.  However, this section may not have gone far enough to\r\n\r\nprohibit  employers  not  affected by the  seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem  from using provisions in this amendment Bill  to  reduce\r\n\r\nwages  of their workers purely by them attaining the age  of  60\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on balance, I support the amendment Bill\r\n\r\nas it will remove one more obstacle and one more excuse given by\r\n\r\nsome employers for not wanting to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemploy older workers, and it will also enhance the prospects  of\r\n\r\nfurther  extensions of the retirement age for  workers  who  may\r\n\r\nwant  to work beyond the current retirement age without imposing\r\n\r\ntoo onerous a burden on employers, especially in these difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   However,  I  would  like to  request  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider further refinements to the provisions of the Retirement\r\n\r\nAge Act in subsequent amendments after more companies modify  or\r\n\r\ndiscard the seniority-based wage system for alternative systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today,\r\n\r\nwe  face economic difficulties.  The number of retrenchments has\r\n\r\nrisen  beyond 20,000, more than double the figure for the  whole\r\n\r\nof  last  year.  The unemployment rate has shot up  to  4.5%  in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  more than double what it was in July.  So  when  the\r\n\r\nnumber of jobless rises, we can expect some people to call for a\r\n\r\nlowering  of the retirement age.  Yet, we are today  meeting  to\r\n\r\nraise  our retirement age from 60 to 62, from 1st January  1999,\r\n\r\nas scheduled.  Why are we doing this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has cited some statistics to show the very\r\n\r\nrapid  rate which our population and workforce are ageing. Faced\r\n\r\nwith  this trend, I share the Minister's view that there  is  an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to  raise the retirement age.   With  rising  life\r\n\r\nexpectancy,  we should allow our older workers to remain  longer\r\n\r\nin  the  workforce.   This  would enable  them  to  continue  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the economy and remain financially independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has provided convincing arguments on the need\r\n\r\nto  cut the wages of older workers by up to 10%.  This issue has\r\n\r\nbeen thoroughly discussed and agreed at the Tripartite Committee\r\n\r\non  the  Extension of the Retirement Age.  Unions and  employees\r\n\r\nare  aware  of  the rationale behind the cut and  agreed  it  is\r\n\r\njustifiable  under the seniority-based wage  system.   But  from\r\n\r\nwhat  I know, most older employees are prepared to accept a wage\r\n\r\ncut in return for the opportunity to continue working beyond the\r\n\r\nage  of 60.  They find this a reasonable trade-off in return for\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to earn a steady\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  for another two years.  In any case, most of them  would\r\n\r\nhave  discharged the bulk of their financial obligations.   They\r\n\r\ncan also tap on their CPF savings to meet their expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, nevertheless, there is concern among some employees\r\n\r\nthat  employers might abuse the right to initiate  a  wage  cut.\r\n\r\nThey fear that employers might insist on introducing a wage  cut\r\n\r\neven  where  the older workers' job worth and performance  could\r\n\r\njustify  their  salary.  It is reassuring earlier  on  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has   in  his  speech  highlighted   the   Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee's  call for employers to be judicious in  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  wage  cut.  I certainly hope that employers could heed  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee's  call  and  carefully  consider  various\r\n\r\nfactors  such  as the companies' minimum-maximum ratio  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees'  skills,  experience and job responsibilities  before\r\n\r\ndeciding on wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also heartening to note that the proposed Bill\r\n\r\nrequires  that  the  older employees be given  reasonable  prior\r\n\r\nnotice  on  the  intended wage cut, and also the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  respond to the proposed cut.  I would  urge  both\r\n\r\nemployers  and employees to be open-minded and accommodating  in\r\n\r\ntheir  discussion of the wage cut and be prepared to  listen  to\r\n\r\neach  other's views.  If there is any disagreement on  the  wage\r\n\r\ncut, both parties should adopt a flexible attitude and strive to\r\n\r\ncome to a compromise.  I hope that the proposed section 4A(4) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill would only be used as a last resort and employers would\r\n\r\nas  far  as possible avoid exercising the right to retire  their\r\n\r\nemployees under this section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the issue of training. With\r\n\r\nthe  extension of the retirement age, older workers are expected\r\n\r\nto  remain  longer in the workforce.  It is therefore  important\r\n\r\nthat they should continue to be given the necessary training  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to remain relevant on the job.  Training  would  be\r\n\r\nespecially  essential in situations where the older workers  are\r\n\r\ndeployed to other jobs.  From\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat I gather, some employers are reluctant to train their older\r\n\r\nworkers because they perceive that these workers are either  too\r\n\r\nold  to  learn or not cost-effective to be trained because  they\r\n\r\nare   due  for  retirement  soon.   This  perception  is  wrong.\r\n\r\nSpeaking from my experience, older workers are every bit as keen\r\n\r\nto  learn  as  their younger counterparts.  They take  pride  in\r\n\r\ntheir work and are prepared to upgrade their skills so that they\r\n\r\ncan continue to remain an asset not only to the company but also\r\n\r\ncontribute to its growth.  Older workers are also less likely to\r\n\r\njob-hop so it does make economic sense for employers to continue\r\n\r\nto provide them with the necessary training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am glad that the Government has taken a\r\n\r\nlong-term perspective on the issue of raising the retirement age\r\n\r\nand  has  proceeded  to  raise the retirement  age  despite  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.  I am positive that we  have  moved  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction  and  this policy will  benefit  not  only  our\r\n\r\nworkers, but also our employers and the economy in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have moved in the right\r\n\r\ndirection by raising retirement age, even though in Germany, the\r\n\r\nnew  government is considering reducing it from 65 to 60.   What\r\n\r\nwould  be the effect if we lower our retirement age?  If  we  do\r\n\r\nso,  we  will merely be shifting employment from the old to  the\r\n\r\nyoung.   There is no additional employment created.  What  would\r\n\r\nthe  `young retirees' do?  How would they live?  In the case  of\r\n\r\nGermany, the unions expect the state to pay pensions.   If  not,\r\n\r\nthe `young retirees' would have to fend for themselves.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthis is not the way we should go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People need money to live on. Extending retirement age has\r\n\r\nhelped  the more senior amongst us to be independent.  The  crux\r\n\r\nof  the  problem  is  to  create  employment,  and  keep  people\r\n\r\nemployable.   So  I  support the Bill on the  extension  of  the\r\n\r\nretirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, with the rapid ageing of our population, the mapping out of\r\n\r\nan employment policy must be one of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  most  urgent tasks, arguably more urgent, than  any  single\r\n\r\nemployment policy.  The Bill to reduce wages of employees  above\r\n\r\n60  years  old must be supported as part of the steps to  expand\r\n\r\nthe  employment potential of older workers.  We should also give\r\n\r\npriority  to  efforts to encourage and facilitate  employers  to\r\n\r\nretain workers as long as they possibly can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but the greying of Singapore requires effort that goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  legislation.  Far from being a relatively young country,\r\n\r\nSingapore will enter the 21st century with the fastest  rate  of\r\n\r\nageing  ever  experienced on earth.  In the nine  years  between\r\n\r\n2012 and 2021, the proportion of our population above the age of\r\n\r\n60  will  rise from 10% to 15%.  The same process took Japan  15\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest obstacles we face today is the inherent\r\n\r\nprejudice  and  wrong perceptions that people have  about  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   We have read recently how difficult it is for  a  45-year  old  young  man to look for a job.  Quite  frequently  and\r\n\r\nwrongly,  he  is  seen  as being in poor  health,  difficult  to\r\n\r\nmanage,  not strong, does not present an image of dynamism,  not\r\n\r\nadaptable  and would stifle the promotion prospects  of  younger\r\n\r\ncolleagues.   Evidence from advertised job vacancies  shows  the\r\n\r\nincidence of age qualified vacancies is fairly widespread.  They\r\n\r\nfail to realise that older workers cannot be neatly grouped into\r\n\r\nskill,   ability  and  physical  strength.   Although   physical\r\n\r\nstrength does decline with age, chronological age is by no means\r\n\r\nan  accurate indicator of one's ability to perform a task.   Age\r\n\r\ndoes not necessarily affect productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we must ensure that older workers are not exploited or\r\n\r\ndiscriminated.   In  1978, the US introduced  a  legislation  to\r\n\r\noutlaw discrimination on grounds of age among workers up to  the\r\n\r\nage  of  70.   Perhaps, it is timely that we should  incorporate\r\n\r\nsuch  legislation  here.   Many of the  older  workers  want  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work, especially if they can find less  stressful,\r\n\r\nless  physically demanding work.  They want to live  independent\r\n\r\nlives.   Many prefer not to depend on their children as a source\r\n\r\nof income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMany simply cannot afford to remain unemployed without suffering\r\n\r\na substantial loss of income and fall in living standards.  Even\r\n\r\nfor the increasingly affluent group, work will provide more than\r\n\r\njust  income.   But status, interest and companionship  and  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  these does not necessarily become less  important  on\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose four specific suggestions for the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prepare workers for retirement. Many are ill-prepared to\r\n\r\ncope  what  maybe  one  third of their lives.   We  should  have\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  will prepare them and enlighten  them  of  the\r\n\r\nchoices  that they can make.  For example, volunteer,  part-time\r\n\r\nwork,  or  even  a change that will lead to a life  of  leisure,\r\n\r\nespecially at a time when we are calling for more active  people\r\n\r\nsector.   We  can also establish more adult education programmes\r\n\r\nin the existing tertiary institutions to cater to this need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should encourage and prepare workers for second careers.\r\n\r\nWe  must fully utilise aged workers.  Their capacities and  long\r\n\r\njob  experience  are human resources in which tremendous  public\r\n\r\nand  private  investments have been made.   These  are  reliable\r\n\r\nresources  that  have to be effectively utilised  not  only  for\r\n\r\ntheir sake but for the community and the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We must reserve some jobs which are most suited for the\r\n\r\nelderly.  Grandparents today are the most ideal choice of  care-givers  for our children.  Yet, how often do we see grandparents\r\n\r\nin  kindergartens,  in  childcare  centres  where  they  can  be\r\n\r\neffective  not  only as tutors, but in passing  down  the  right\r\n\r\nvalues  and  attitudes  to the younger  generation.   This  also\r\n\r\napplies  to  many of the jobs in service counters in  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries and statutory boards.  They are especially suited  to\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations,  for  example,  the  CDCs,  the   town\r\n\r\ncouncils,  which  require a high level  of  human  relationship,\r\n\r\nskills  and patience.  The elderly make good counsellors because\r\n\r\nage   may  bring  maturity  of  judgement  and  the  weight   of\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We must expand the Skills Development Fund. It should be\r\n\r\nenlarged  to allow for the training of older workers  for  their\r\n\r\nsecond careers.  The fact is that blue collar workers will  have\r\n\r\nfewer  opportunities compared to white collar workers in finding\r\n\r\njobs where their skills and experience can be fully utilised  in\r\n\r\nlater years.  Therefore, programmes to train workers should also\r\n\r\nbe  extended  to  older  or  retiring  workers.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\ntechnological  innovation  may also induce  obsolescence  in  an\r\n\r\nageing workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, the current economic crisis will pose a great\r\n\r\nchallenge  because  of falling demand for labour.   Despite  the\r\n\r\nwage  cuts  and  reduced CPF contribution, employers  may  still\r\n\r\nprefer  to  employ younger workers.  We must do more  to  change\r\n\r\nthis.   In  Singapore, today, sadly, becoming 60s is a watershed\r\n\r\nbecause to many, it is an end of employment and the beginning of\r\n\r\na loss of income, status and sometimes independence.  Retirement\r\n\r\nmay  not  necessarily mean an end to this.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do more to change the attitude  people  have  of\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, think about this. Few would attribute the same\r\n\r\ncharacteristics to a 30-year old as they would  a  60-year  old.\r\n\r\nWhy  then  should  the 60s and 90s be classed  together  as  one\r\n\r\ngroup?  It is very easy to assume that all the elderly want this\r\n\r\nor  feel  that.   It  might be more realistic to  generalise  if\r\n\r\npeople  are  divided according to how they appear in  behaviour,\r\n\r\nattitudes  and thoughts.  \"As old as you feel\" is one  approach.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  to act old is to be sad in one way, to lack flexibility\r\n\r\nof thought and to generally look old fashioned, then, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare many people in the 20s and 30s who will qualify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the average\r\n\r\nlifespan  of Singaporeans today is 76 and the current retirement\r\n\r\nage  is  60.   What this means is that, on average, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould  spend about 70% of their adult life working  and  30%  in\r\n\r\nretirement.  With the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nraising of the retirement age to 62, this will increase from 70%\r\n\r\nto  about 75% and eventually, if we do raise the retirement  age\r\n\r\nto  67, it will go up to 85%.  I therefore support the extension\r\n\r\nof  the  retirement  age  because I  believe  this  will  enable\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to live a more fulfilling life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in supporting this extension of retirement age, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  raise  three  points  for  the  consideration  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Firstly, the purpose of extending retirement  age  is\r\n\r\nto  secure  the  right  for  Singaporeans  to  work  beyond  60.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  should  continue to leave  it  to  the  individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to decide whether they want to exercise  the  right\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  age of 60.  So from that angle, in determining  the\r\n\r\npension  arrangement for civil servants, I hope  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  not  penalise  civil servants who are on  the  pensionable\r\n\r\nservice and who decide to work beyond 60 under this extension of\r\n\r\nretirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we extend the retirement age, we are endorsing pay\r\n\r\ncut of up to 10%.  As the Minister mentioned, this is because of\r\n\r\nthe  seniority-based wage system in Singapore.  From the union's\r\n\r\nperspective,  we hope that this is only a temporary  arrangement\r\n\r\nbecause  the  long-term  solution  is  to  move  away  from  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based wage system towards a base-up wage system.  Sir,\r\n\r\nin this regard, we hope that the civil service can take the lead\r\n\r\nto  move  into the base-up wage system because today, the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  likewise depends very much on the seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   We hope the civil service can respond.  As  we  extend\r\n\r\nthe retirement age, why not take the lead to move into the base-up  wage  system  in a big way, in a concerted  way,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nencourage the private sector to follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that with the extension of retirement age,\r\n\r\neven though it will give Singapore workers the right to work, it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  guarantee that Singaporeans will be able to  exercise\r\n\r\nthe  right.   For  example,  in  this  particular  crisis,  many\r\n\r\ncompanies are now talking about renewing their workforce  so  as\r\n\r\nto gear up for a knowledge-based economy of the future.  Some of\r\n\r\nthem are talking about retrenching the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nolder workers and re-hiring the younger workers. So their way of\r\n\r\nrenewing workforce is by retrenching the older workers.  If this\r\n\r\nwere to continue in a big way, then obviously, many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  not going to be able to exercise their right to work beyond\r\n\r\n60 years old under the extension of retirement age.  We hope the\r\n\r\ntripartite   partners,  namely,  the  unions,   Government   and\r\n\r\nemployers,  can  work together to arrest this particular  trend.\r\n\r\nWe need to encourage as many companies and employers as possible\r\n\r\nto  work  together  to  help our Singapore workforce  to  remain\r\n\r\nhealthy, employable and productive, so that as many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nas  possible can really exercise their right to work  beyond  60\r\n\r\nunder  the extension of retirement age.  On that, I support  the\r\n\r\namendment Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  for  today  be exempted at this day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RETIREMENT AGE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me assure you that I\r\n\r\nam  going  to be very brief.  I just have one question  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Isn't this talk about raising the retirement age  for\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the  private  sector  academic  so  long  as  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act allows an employer to terminate the services  of\r\n\r\nany  employee by just giving him one month's notice?  I can  see\r\n\r\nthat this makes a profound change perhaps for the civil servants\r\n\r\nwho have security of tenure under the Constitution.  But for the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, is this not purely academic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken out in support of this amendment Bill to raise  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age  from  60 to 62.  They have  raised  many  valid\r\n\r\npoints  for  consideration and I will try  to  address  all  the\r\n\r\nconcerns that they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr Vasoo, in supporting the amendment, raised the\r\n\r\nconcern  of  potential  areas of dispute between  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees when they come to the age of 60 and they have to  give\r\n\r\nreasonable  notice on reducing the wage of older  workers.   And\r\n\r\nhis  question is:  if there is a dispute, who will mediate,  who\r\n\r\nwill help the employee to listen to his appeal, to listen to his\r\n\r\nown concern?  I would like to assure the Member that my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  since 1994, when we first enacted the Retirement  Age  Act,\r\n\r\nestablished a unit in the Labour Relations Department  which  is\r\n\r\ngeared towards looking after the needs of older workers who have\r\n\r\nany  dispute with their employers on account of age.  So, if  an\r\n\r\nolder  worker  feels that his employer is making an unreasonable\r\n\r\noffer or that he is being retired prematurely, or his service is\r\n\r\nterminated on account of age, he can always come to my  Ministry\r\n\r\nto  seek  conciliation  or to seek support  in  resolving  those\r\n\r\nproblems  with  their  employers.  I am  pleased  to  say  that,\r\n\r\nalthough I do not have the exact numbers with me, since 1994, we\r\n\r\nhave been able to resolve the cases we handled expeditiously and\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily for both parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Dr Vasoo also raised this possibility of\r\n\r\nemployers  taking advantage of the wage reduction to  force  out\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  The recourse here is of course  for  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers to appeal to my Ministry to investigate their complaints\r\n\r\nagainst their employers for taking such unfair action.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure  Members  once  again that any such  complaints  will  be\r\n\r\ncarefully investigated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng also supported the Bill and he asked that\r\n\r\nemployers  should consider the contribution of  older  employees\r\n\r\nwhen they adjust the wages of such employees.  I agree with him.\r\n\r\nI  think  I  said  so  in  my main speech  that  the  Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee  in  fact made specific recommendation that  employers\r\n\r\nshould always consider the contribution, the wage level and  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the older employees before they proceed  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustment to the wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also suggested that the wage reduction should not be\r\n\r\ndone  haphazardly on a month-to-month basis or as and  when  the\r\n\r\nemployers  feel like doing so.  We have a certain  understanding\r\n\r\nbetween the tripartite partners that such wage reduction  should\r\n\r\nin  fact be done for a reasonable period, either a year  or  two\r\n\r\nyears.   The  extension of the retirement age is for two  years.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it should be for the full period of two years.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  good management practice to go and change the wages of  the\r\n\r\nemployee  on  a haphazard basis.  So I agree with him  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer should in fact give the employees reasonable notice and\r\n\r\nalso make such wage adjustment over a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nHe,  in fact, also said that there is this provision in the Bill\r\n\r\nfor   employees  to  give  reasonable  notice  to  their   older\r\n\r\nemployees.  It is not specified what is a reasonable  period  of\r\n\r\nnotice  and  the question is:  should it be seven  days  or  two\r\n\r\nmonths?   Let  me assure the Member that through the  tripartite\r\n\r\npractice,  and  through our practice of managing  the  employer-employee relationship, there have evolved certain norms on  what\r\n\r\nis a reasonable notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age has\r\n\r\nin  fact  discussed this particular issue quite extensively  and\r\n\r\nboth  employer  and  employee  representatives  agreed  that  in\r\n\r\namending  the  law,  we should not try to fix  a  rigid  period,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  should be two weeks or a month.   This  is  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  many situations in actual human resource  management\r\n\r\npractice  where you have to give allowance for the size  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany,  the  set-up within the company and the  company's  own\r\n\r\nmanagement practices.  They have recommended that we take a more\r\n\r\nflexible  approach  instead  of  specifying  the  exact  period.\r\n\r\nReasonable notices to us, would mean, say, at least a  month  or\r\n\r\nsomething  like that.  If, in fact, an employee feels  aggrieved\r\n\r\nthat  the  period of notice has been too short,  he  can  always\r\n\r\nappeal  to  my  Ministry  and  we  will  try  to  resolve  these\r\n\r\ndifferences.  As long as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is  in  tune with what is current practice in Singapore,  it\r\n\r\nwould be considered reasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang and Mr Lim Swee Say brought up this point that with\r\n\r\nthe  raising of the retirement age, pensionable employees in the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  should  not  be disadvantaged.   Although  civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  exempted from the coverage of  the  extension  of\r\n\r\nretirement  age, when we moved from age 55 to 60, we  gave  this\r\n\r\nexemption to the civil service.  I understand that the PSD  will\r\n\r\nin  fact  apply the new retirement age.  In other  words,  civil\r\n\r\nservants  will  be  able  to work up to  the  age  of  62.   For\r\n\r\npensionable  civil  servants, if they  want  to  withdraw  their\r\n\r\npension  at  age 60, they would have to retire from the  service\r\n\r\nbecause  they cannot withdraw the pension and carry  on  working\r\n\r\ncontinuously.  But if they want to carry on working, then  their\r\n\r\npension  right will be preserved up to the age of 62.   And  any\r\n\r\ntime  between 60 and 62, if they choose to retire, they will  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to their pension.  I think this is reasonable  because\r\n\r\nif  you  are already working and drawing a salary, albeit  about\r\n\r\n10%  less, there is really no need for you to have your  pension\r\n\r\nupfront.   So,  you carry on working, you have a regular  income\r\n\r\nand  you  do not need the pension.  The pension will be released\r\n\r\nwhen you retire.  But it will be frozen at the age of 60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong made several comments in supporting the\r\n\r\namendment.   I agree with him that older workers right  now  may\r\n\r\nhave  more difficulties fitting into new jobs that are available\r\n\r\nand I think Mr Lim Swee Say also made a point on the possibility\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment for older workers.  Our approach is to  try  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  older  workers who are retrenched  or  who  are  more\r\n\r\nvulnerable to retrenchment to uplift their skills, so that  they\r\n\r\nwould  be able to continue to serve or contribute to the company\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are currently working, or if offered an alternative\r\n\r\njob   in   another  company  where  they  can  make  a  valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main thrust of the Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\nand I reported to this House yesterday that, in fact, the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  progressing  very  smoothly and the  take-up  rate  is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.   As  of  now, we already  have  more  than  10,000\r\n\r\nworkers,  mostly  older  workers, who have  signed  up  for  the\r\n\r\nprogramme for retraining.  This is the way that we can  help  to\r\n\r\nlook after the older workers who are in need of skills upgrading\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they remain employable.  I have to say that this\r\n\r\nis  in fact the only way that we can help these older workers to\r\n\r\nequip  them  with the means to hold on to a job.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nother  way  that we can ensure that they remain employable.   We\r\n\r\ncannot legislate or force the employers, on their own, to retain\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers, because there are economic  considerations.\r\n\r\nWe  must make sure that older workers are equipped with all  the\r\n\r\nskills  that  are necessary for them to make a  value  added  to\r\n\r\ntheir employer and that is the only way to remain employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong mentioned that the cut in CPF arising from the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of the Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness\r\n\r\ncould  erode  the  differential between the  younger  and  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  I want to correct an impression.  The reduction in the\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF  contribution for older workers  is  a  separate\r\n\r\nmatter.  So, we are going to proceed with that.  We will, on 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 1999, reduce the CPF contribution rate for older workers\r\n\r\nfrom  7.5% to 4% for those aged 60 to 65, and for those aged  65\r\n\r\nand above, from 5% to 4%.  This is a separate matter.  The CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation,  which has been accepted by the  Government,  to\r\n\r\nreduce  employer's contribution by 10% point will also kick  in.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  for  older  workers,  from  1st  January  1999,  the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution rate will come down to 2%,  not  4%.\r\n\r\nSo the differential would still be maintained.  In fact, it will\r\n\r\nactually be improved, because in the past, we used to have 12.5%\r\n\r\ndifferential between the two groups.  Now, we have narrowed  the\r\n\r\ndifferential some more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong and Dr Vasoo also requested that safeguards should be\r\n\r\nput  in  place  to ensure that older workers who  are  currently\r\n\r\ndrawing  salaries which are at or in fact below the market  rate\r\n\r\nshould  not  be affected by the 10% wage cut.  If they  were  to\r\n\r\nlook at the Bill, they will see that in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfact these safeguards are already provided under the new section\r\n\r\n4A(5) which stipulates that the wage reduction shall be based on\r\n\r\nfactors such as employee's productivity, performance, duties and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and the wage system that a company practises or\r\n\r\nexercises.  This provision means that while employers are  given\r\n\r\nthe flexibility to reduce the wages of older employees by up  to\r\n\r\n10%,  such  cuts  cannot  be introduced  indiscriminately.   For\r\n\r\nemployees  who are not on the seniority-based wage system,  such\r\n\r\nas  those  who are paid by hourly rate or fixed rate, regardless\r\n\r\nof  their age - in other words, they are being paid according to\r\n\r\ntheir  job  worth - then the employers would have to  take  this\r\n\r\ninto  consideration in deciding on whether to make a  wage  cut.\r\n\r\nIf  in  fact  they proceed to make a wage cut and the  employees\r\n\r\nfeel  unhappy, they can always appeal to my Ministry.   We  will\r\n\r\ninvestigate their complaints and help them to reach  a  solution\r\n\r\nwith the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also suggested that we should prohibit companies\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not affected by the seniority-based wage  system  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  wage  cut  for  the  older  employees.   While   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  his  concern  that he  wants  to  provide  for  this\r\n\r\nexplicit  protection for older workers, we are of the view  that\r\n\r\nthe companies in fact should be given some flexibility to adjust\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  retaining their older workers.   Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based wage system, companies may need  to  adjust  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  older workers based on other considerations  which\r\n\r\nare already spelt out in the section provided earlier on.  These\r\n\r\nother factors are productivity, performance and contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  company.  So we should allow companies to do so  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinued  cost competitiveness despite the fact that there  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be more and more older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I also would like to point out that it would be\r\n\r\nunwise  for  an employer to indiscriminately cut  the  wages  of\r\n\r\ntheir productive older employees as this will certainly cause  a\r\n\r\nserious  effect on the morale of such employees.  In  any  case,\r\n\r\nemployers who intend to introduce a wage cut are required, under\r\n\r\nthe proposed Bill, to give notice to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployees  and  come to an agreement between  the  employer  and\r\n\r\nemployee.    In  fact,  in  companies  where  the  workers   are\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  unions,  the  unions  also  would  want  to  be\r\n\r\nconsulted on the degree of reduction that the employers want  to\r\n\r\ncarry out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to Mr Cyrille Tan. I thank him also for the\r\n\r\nsupport.  He has reinforced my argument on why we should move at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture,  despite  the economic downturn,  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nretirement age.  The fact that most older employees are prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept the wage cut of 10%, according to Mr Cyrille Tan,  is\r\n\r\nan  indication  that our process of tripartite discussion  of  a\r\n\r\nsensitive  issue is working well.  It is through this Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee on Extension of Retirement Age that we have arrived at\r\n\r\nthis consensus that would take into consideration the employers'\r\n\r\nand  also the employees' concern. We have arrived at this  level\r\n\r\nof  wage  adjustment  which  I think,  as  Mr  Cyrille  Tan  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  is  acceptable to the workers.  That would  help  to\r\n\r\nencourage more older Singaporeans to carry on working.   If  you\r\n\r\nmake too big a cut, then you will demotivate them and they might\r\n\r\njust  decide  not to carry on, in which case our Retirement  Age\r\n\r\nAct would not have achieved its objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan also mentioned the need for training of\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  I touched on it earlier on.  I agree  with  him\r\n\r\nthat we should continue to provide training to older workers, in\r\n\r\nparticular, to help them to adjust to the changed labour  market\r\n\r\nwhere newer jobs are being created, but requiring higher skills.\r\n\r\nI  think  it is of interest for Members to know that  the  shift\r\n\r\ntowards  higher skilled jobs is taking place quite rapidly.   In\r\n\r\nthe  early 90s, EDB promoted investments and created  a  lot  of\r\n\r\njobs.    Out  of  the  jobs  that  were  created  through  EDB's\r\n\r\ninvestment  promotion effort, about one-third of  them  required\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.  But today the investments brought in  by  EDB\r\n\r\nand  the  jobs  that they create require two-thirds  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.  So we have doubled the requirement for skilled workers\r\n\r\nover a short\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperiod  of less than a decade.  So older workers, in particular,\r\n\r\ntherefore need to make a special effort.  Let me assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  Government will provide all the opportunities and fundings\r\n\r\nthat  are necessary to ensure that older workers who are in need\r\n\r\nof skills upgrading will receive this training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Zulkifli Baharudin. He raised several\r\n\r\nvalid  points  and  concerns which I will try  to  address.   He\r\n\r\nmentioned  the possibility of introducing legislation like  that\r\n\r\nin  the US to outlaw discrimination of workers up to the age  of\r\n\r\n70.   In  fact,  the  Retirement Age Act is such  a  legislation\r\n\r\nbecause  under  the  Retirement Age Act the  employers  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to retire workers on account of age until they reach  a\r\n\r\nminimum  statutory retirement age.  So, in effect,  it  provides\r\n\r\nthe  same degree of non-discrimination for older workers.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthe  provision now is to raise to only 62, but we  have  already\r\n\r\nserved  notice that we intend to raise it to 67.  But we  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  this  in a rush.  We cannot hurry the process.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  time  to ensure that the employment market can  adjust  to\r\n\r\nthis  change.   In due course, when we move it to 67,  we  would\r\n\r\nalready be very much closer to the target in the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also suggested that we should prepare workers\r\n\r\nfor  retirement.  I also agree with him on that score that  even\r\n\r\nas  we  talk  about  extending the retirement  age  and  working\r\n\r\nlonger,  we do need to make preparation for eventual retirement,\r\n\r\nand  to  make  both financial planning and also in terms  of  an\r\n\r\nalternative or even a second career after retirement.   Even  at\r\n\r\nage  62  or,  in the future, 65, there will be many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  still  very  physically and mentally  very  alert  and\r\n\r\nactive.  They can do a lot of other kinds of work as a form of a\r\n\r\nsecond  career.   It  is  part of our continuing  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  programme that we are  in the process of  establishing\r\n\r\nunder  the  new  charter of the Ministry of Manpower,  ie,  this\r\n\r\nconcept of a lifelong learning. We will incorporate these  ideas\r\n\r\nto  train  young  and old workers so that they  can  continually\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills and capabilities and they can continue  to\r\n\r\nserve their employers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  in other areas such as social organisations, as mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe Nominated Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point that he raised that I cannot quite\r\n\r\nagree  with him, and that is, the point about trying to  reserve\r\n\r\ncertain jobs for older workers.  For instance, he mentioned jobs\r\n\r\nin  kindergartens and childcare services.   While I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim   that  grandparents  are  great  for  looking  after  young\r\n\r\nchildren,  we should not be interfering with the job  market  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  that  certain jobs such as those in  the  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres be reserved for older people.  That would not help us in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that they will introduce rigidities and  distortions\r\n\r\ninto our labour market.  It may cause unhappiness and resentment\r\n\r\namong the younger workers who also may want to do such jobs.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  generalise to say that younger workers  cannot  do  such\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, it is not advisable for us to move towards\r\n\r\ntrying  to  take a protectionist approach and say  that  certain\r\n\r\njobs must be reserved for older workers or to interfere with our\r\n\r\nfree   labour   market  practice.   Instead  of  adopting   this\r\n\r\nprotectionistic  approach,  trying to  reserve  jobs  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers,  which is really not efficient, economically  speaking,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  more  viable for us to continue to  encourage  and\r\n\r\npromote  the employment of older Singaporeans for a wide variety\r\n\r\nof  jobs.   I  am  sure Members are aware of how companies  like\r\n\r\nMcDonalds, for instance, have branched out  in their search  for\r\n\r\nmanpower  to  the  older Singaporeans and they  have  been  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  that.   They  can  meet  most  of  their  labour\r\n\r\nrequirements   by   employing  older   Singaporeans,   including\r\n\r\nretirees.   More and more companies should adopt  this  approach\r\n\r\nand  change  their  mindset to try to create  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nolder Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also suggests extending the Skills Development\r\n\r\nFund  or  setting up a special fund to look after  the  training\r\n\r\nneeds  of  older people.  I have already mentioned that  in  our\r\n\r\nconcept of developing a lifelong learning system, we will  reach\r\n\r\nout to both young and old workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, I do not think there is a need to specifically\r\n\r\nidentify  a  fund for older workers.  In fact, the SRP,  if  you\r\n\r\nwant  to look at it, indirectly benefits older workers more than\r\n\r\nyounger workers because the SRP is targeted at the lower skilled\r\n\r\nand  less  educated  workers who, by virtue of  the  definition,\r\n\r\nbecome  the  older  workers.  They are  the  ones  who  are  now\r\n\r\nbenefiting  most  from  the SRP.  All  Skills  Development  Fund\r\n\r\ntraining  subsidies are eligible for young and old workers.   We\r\n\r\nmake no distinction on age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed Mr Lim Swee Say's point about\r\n\r\npensionable  civil servants.  Their pensions will be  protected.\r\n\r\nThey  can  carry  on to work beyond 60 to 62.  Of  course,  they\r\n\r\nwould  also have to come to an agreement on the amount  of  wage\r\n\r\nreduction, just like employees in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would pass on his suggestion that the civil service takes\r\n\r\nthe  lead in implementing the base-up wage system.  I think this\r\n\r\nwill  be considered by the PSD.  I agree with Mr Lim that  while\r\n\r\nwe  can amend the law, there is still no guarantee of employment\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is  very much dependent on the job  opportunities\r\n\r\navailable.  In a situation where there is an overall decline  in\r\n\r\nemployment, as we have experienced in the last two quarters as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the economic downturn, there is of course a  greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty  to ensure that older Singaporeans stay in  the  job.\r\n\r\nBut I would urge all employers, even when they have to downsize,\r\n\r\nnot  to inflict a penalty on the older workers.  I think Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nhas  adequately pointed out that older workers,  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nseveral other Members have mentioned this, can continue to  make\r\n\r\na valuable contribution to the company's operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to Mr Jeyaretnam. He says that the talk of\r\n\r\nraising the retirement age is academic as long as employers  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  terminate the employee's service with  one  month's\r\n\r\nnotice.  This is not a new thing.  This right to give notice  to\r\n\r\nterminate  an  employment contract is already in our  Employment\r\n\r\nAct.  We have to look at it in totality.  While the employer can\r\n\r\ngive termination notice, there must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  sufficient  reason  for  such termination.   If  in  fact  an\r\n\r\nemployee whose service has been terminated but he feels that  it\r\n\r\nis actually a dismissal in the guise of contractual termination,\r\n\r\nhe  can  always appeal to my Ministry.  Each year we  do  get  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number of such appeals and we have always been able  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the differences between the employer and employee.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  not a completely one-sided situation where the  employer\r\n\r\nhas absolute right and to exercise it indiscriminately.  We have\r\n\r\na  mechanism within the Ministry in implementing the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct  to  ensure that employees' interests are also looked after.\r\n\r\nI  am pleased to inform Members that in terms of conciliation of\r\n\r\nresolving  such  difficulties, the Ministry's  Labour  Relations\r\n\r\nDepartment has been very effective and efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member also has to look from the point of view\r\n\r\nof  the employer.  After all, employees also can leave a job  by\r\n\r\ngiving  a  certain period of notice.  So it cuts both ways.   An\r\n\r\nemployer  has  invested money in training an  employee  and  the\r\n\r\nemployee can turn around and say, \"Look, I want to quit.  I give\r\n\r\nyou  a month's notice.\"  So I think in a free labour market,  we\r\n\r\nshould   allow  this  flexibility,  instead  of  creating   more\r\n\r\nrigidities, as he seems to be suggesting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just ask the Minister one more\r\n\r\nquestion?  Does he not agree that there is no provision  in  the\r\n\r\nAct  for  an  employee  whose services are terminated  with  the\r\n\r\nrequisite notice of one month to appeal to the Ministry?  He  is\r\n\r\nnot aware of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just said that\r\n\r\nif  any  employee  feels that his services  have  been  unfairly\r\n\r\nterminated, he can appeal to my Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL LAW (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.18 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill makes technical amendments to the Civil Law Act\r\n\r\nfor  purposes  of clarification and law reform.  The  provisions\r\n\r\nhave  the  support  of  relevant bodies  such  as  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore and the Singapore Academy of Law,  where\r\n\r\nthe  Law  Society  of Singapore is represented.   The  financial\r\n\r\nservices  industry  and NUS law lecturers were  also  consulted.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  will improve our commercial and civil  law  and  will\r\n\r\nprovide   a   more  predictable  legal  environment,   something\r\n\r\nimportant to businesses and financial institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Updating the law on contribution</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first set of amendments makes new provisions for\r\n\r\ncontribution  between persons who are jointly or  severally,  or\r\n\r\nboth  jointly and severally, liable for the same damage  and  in\r\n\r\ncertain other similar cases where two or more persons have  paid\r\n\r\nor  may be required to pay compensation for the same damage.  It\r\n\r\nalso  amends  the  law relating to proceedings  against  persons\r\n\r\njointly  liable  for the same debt or jointly or  severally,  or\r\n\r\nboth jointly and severally, liable for the same damage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are of a law reform nature. They were proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Academy of Law's Law Reform Committee and supported  by\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General (AG).  The changes will bring our  law  on\r\n\r\ncontribution  in line with the UK Civil Liability (Contribution)\r\n\r\nAct  1978 and address anomalies in litigation practice.  The law\r\n\r\non contribution is a technical area which deals with the payment\r\n\r\nof  a proportionate share of a liability which has been borne by\r\n\r\none or some only of a number of persons who are jointly liable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Civil Law Act will be amended to extend the\r\n\r\napplicability  of  the  provisions on  contribution  to  damages\r\n\r\narising from legal grounds other than tort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The rule in Bain v Fothergill</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment of a law reform nature is to abolish the\r\n\r\nrule  of  law  known  as the rule in Bain  v  Fothergill.   This\r\n\r\nfollows   changes  made  in  the  UK  by  the  Law  of  Property\r\n\r\n(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule of law is that \"if, a person enters into a\r\n\r\ncontract  for  the sale of real estate knowing that  he  has  no\r\n\r\ntitle to it, nor any means of acquiring it, the purchaser cannot\r\n\r\nrecover damages beyond the expenses he has incurred by an action\r\n\r\nfor breach of the contract; he can only obtain other damages  by\r\n\r\nan  action  for  deceit\".  This rule is an anachronism  and  was\r\n\r\nabolished  in  the  UK in 1989.  It was established  before  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of a comprehensive land registration  system,  when\r\n\r\nparties  could  not be absolutely certain about their  title  to\r\n\r\nland  and when there was a requirement to trace a good  root  of\r\n\r\ntitle  back  for  60 years.  The rule is no longer  relevant  in\r\n\r\npresent  day  Singapore.  Most of our land  are  now  registered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Land  Titles Act or the Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act.\r\n\r\nFurther,  all dealings in unregistered land are required  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered under the Registration of Deeds Act where the duty to\r\n\r\nshow good root of title goes back only 15 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Creating predictability for financial services law against gaming</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next set of amendments is for purposes of\r\n\r\nclarification.   They  are supported by MAS  and  the  financial\r\n\r\nservices   industry.   These  amendments  do  not   affect   the\r\n\r\nregulation of financial and investment activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment relates to section 6(1) of the Civil\r\n\r\nLaw  Act,  which renders all contracts or agreements by  way  of\r\n\r\ngaming  or wagering null and void.  This amendment arose out  of\r\n\r\nconcerns  expressed  by  a  private  sector  Corporate   Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee  (CFC),  chaired by Mr Lim Yong  Wah,  that  there  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  uncertainty over whether the  trading  of  \"Over  the\r\n\r\nCounter\"   (OTC)  derivatives  in  Singapore  is   illegal   and\r\n\r\nunenforceable because of the law against gaming.  The  CFC  felt\r\n\r\nthat  this uncertainty has impeded the growth of a thriving  OTC\r\n\r\nderivatives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket in Singapore.  As a large number of derivatives contracts\r\n\r\nare  settled  by  price differences based  on  future  uncertain\r\n\r\nevents,  and  do  not  depend  on any  actual  delivery  of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  property,  they could technically  fall  within  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  gaming.   The CFC's  report,  published  on  9th\r\n\r\nNovember  1998, recommended that the law should be clarified  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the growth of the derivative business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the law against gaming should not apply to any\r\n\r\nlegitimate or hedging investment activity.  It should not hinder\r\n\r\nthe  dynamic  development of innovative  financial  products  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The Bill therefore amends section 6 to  make  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  law  against gaming does not affect the  validity  or\r\n\r\nenforceability of contracts entered into by way of business  and\r\n\r\nthe making or performance of which constitutes an investment  or\r\n\r\nhedging activity.  A list of these activities, drafted in  close\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  MAS  and representatives  of  the  financial\r\n\r\nservices industry, is set out in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>EMU and the Euro</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another amendment makes clear that the European\r\n\r\nEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU) will not affect the continuity\r\n\r\nof  contracts denominated in currencies that will be affected by\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of  the euros.  The premise  underlying  this\r\n\r\namendment  is  that,  as  far as possible,  we  should  maintain\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness as an  international  business  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre by providing predictability and  certainty  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses when the euro is introduced on 1st January 1999,  the\r\n\r\nstart  of  the  transitional stage.  It is  modelled  after  the\r\n\r\nequivalent New York law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, a declaratory provision will be\r\n\r\nenacted that the continuity of contracts will not be affected by\r\n\r\nthe  substitution  or  replacement of  currencies  by  the  euro\r\n\r\narising from the European Economic and Monetary Union.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential and related amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill makes consequential amendments to\r\n\r\nsection 6(1) of the Carriage by Air Act (Cap. 32A) and section 3\r\n\r\nof the Contributory Negligence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Personal  Injuries Act (Cap. 54).  The Bill  also  makes  a\r\n\r\nrelated  amendment to the Limitation Act (Cap. 163) by inserting\r\n\r\na  new  section 6A to provide for a special time  limit  of  two\r\n\r\nyears  for  claiming contribution.  This will clarify a  current\r\n\r\nuncertainty in litigation practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  giving me this opportunity.

I will  be\r\n\r\nvery short.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Civil Law Act is one of the cornerstones of our\r\n\r\nlegal system and the number of amendments that has been proposed\r\n\r\nwill  help us in the administration of justice.  In our  system,\r\n\r\nwe  practise  the  rule  of law and the separation  of  power  - Judiciary,  Executive  and Legislature.   The  function  of  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary  is to interpret the law while it is the  function  of\r\n\r\nParliament  to  enact  laws.  I congratulate  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nintroducing  this  Bill.  It is timely.  I am  especially  happy\r\n\r\nthat  the  rule in Bain's case is being laid to  rest.   It  has\r\n\r\noutlived  its  usefulness.  It just goes to show  that  the  law\r\n\r\ncannot  be static.  It is a living institution.  It must undergo\r\n\r\nchange  from time to time.  And in this regard, I am asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether,  besides  the Law  Reform  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy  of  Law, the Ministry  has  any  unit  which\r\n\r\nmonitors changes of law that are required in our system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to administer outmoded law would do grave injustice to\r\n\r\nthe  parties.   The  Minister has been very,  very  thorough  in\r\n\r\nshowing  us  the  various amendments he is going  to  introduce,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  going to help us, and I hope other Ministries  would\r\n\r\nalso do likewise.

The Committee's work has resulted in amendments to  the\r\n\r\nCopyright Act and Patents Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is another product of the Committee's review. It\r\n\r\nwill replace the existing Trade Marks Act.  Besides amending the\r\n\r\nlaw to comply with the TRIPS Agreement, the Bill also modernises\r\n\r\nand  simplifies  our trade marks law in line with  international\r\n\r\ntrends.   Our  trade  marks legislation is  some  50  years  old\r\n\r\n(1938).   Some  of its provisions on the registration  of  trade\r\n\r\nmarks  are unnecessarily complicated and onerous, thus  impeding\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency  of the Registry of Trade Marks.   A  number  of\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  also  outdated and do not  conform  to  current\r\n\r\ninternational  trends.  This Bill addresses these  shortcomings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the Bill will enable Singapore to  accede  to  the\r\n\r\nProtocol Relating to the International Registration of Marks  or\r\n\r\nthe  Madrid Protocol.  In the process of drafting the  Bill,  we\r\n\r\nhave  taken into account the views of academics from the Faculty\r\n\r\nof  Law, National University of Singapore, and consultants  from\r\n\r\nWorld  Intellectual Property Organisation or WIPO,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nviews of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>TRIPS related provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn first to the provisions inserted to comply\r\n\r\nwith the TRIPS Agreement.  These relate to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) definition of trade mark;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) well-known trade marks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) collective marks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) civil measures;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) border enforcement; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) geographical indications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, a trade mark is defined along the lines of the\r\n\r\nTRIPS  Agreement.   Basically, a trade  mark  must  be  visually\r\n\r\nperceptible and capable of distinguishing the goods or  services\r\n\r\nof the proprietor.  Three-dimensional marks are now registrable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards well-known trade marks, the Bill allows the\r\n\r\nproprietor  of  an  earlier  trade mark  which  is  entitled  to\r\n\r\nprotection under the Paris Convention or the TRIPS Agreement  as\r\n\r\na  well-known  trade  mark  to oppose  the  registration  of  an\r\n\r\nidentical or similar trade mark.  Further, the proprietor  of  a\r\n\r\nwell-known trade mark is entitled to restrain by injunction  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  an  identical  or  similar  trademark  in  relation  to\r\n\r\nidentical  or similar goods or services where the use is  likely\r\n\r\nto cause confusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, well-known trade marks are protected under the\r\n\r\ncommon  law tort of passing off.  If they consist of an invented\r\n\r\nword or words, they can also be registered as defensive marks in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  goods  under  the  existing  Trade  Marks  Act.   A\r\n\r\ndefensive  mark is essentially a well-known trade mark  that  is\r\n\r\nregistered  for  goods other than those in which the  proprietor\r\n\r\ntrades, where a connection in the course of trade between  those\r\n\r\ngoods and the proprietor is likely to be inferred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new feature of the Bill is the registration of collective\r\n\r\nmarks.   This is required by the TRIPS Agreement.  A  collective\r\n\r\nmark is held by an association and used by its members.  It is a\r\n\r\nmark distinguishing the goods or services of members of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassociation from those dealt with or provided by persons who are\r\n\r\nnot members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no registration of collective marks in\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Trade Marks Act.  Instead, an  association  which\r\n\r\ndoes  not use its logo as a trade mark registers it as  a  trade\r\n\r\nmark  and then registers its members as permitted users  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade mark. The registration of collective marks by associations\r\n\r\nunder  the  Bill  will enable their members  to  use  the  marks\r\n\r\nwithout   having  to  go  through  the  process  of  registering\r\n\r\nthemselves as permitted users with the Registry of Trade Marks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also expressly sets out the civil and\r\n\r\nadministrative   remedies  available  to  a  proprietor   of   a\r\n\r\nregistered  trade  mark.   These include  injunctions,  damages,\r\n\r\naccount  of  profits,  removal of the  offending  sign  and  the\r\n\r\ndelivery  up and forfeiture or destruction of infringing  goods,\r\n\r\nmaterial or articles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of the Bill pertains to border\r\n\r\nenforcement measures to prevent infringing intellectual property\r\n\r\nmaterials  from  entering Singapore.  The Bill's  provisions  on\r\n\r\nthese  measures are similar to those in the copyright area  with\r\n\r\nadaptation  to  suit  the  trade  mark  field.   In  line   with\r\n\r\ninternational trends, the Bill designates the Customs and Excise\r\n\r\nDepartment to handle border enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Modernisation and Simplification in accordance with International Trends</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the provisions which seek to modernise\r\n\r\nand   simplify   our   trade  marks  law  in   accordance   with\r\n\r\ninternational trends.  Some of the more important changes are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, abolishing the distinction between Parts A and B of\r\n\r\nthe   Register  of  Trade  Marks.   Trade  Marks  are  presently\r\n\r\nregistered  in  Part  A or Part B of the register.   Almost  all\r\n\r\napplications  filed  with the Registry of Trade  Marks  are  for\r\n\r\nregistration  in  Part A.   If the Registrar  decides  that  the\r\n\r\ntrade  marks  do  not  qualify for Part A registration,  he  may\r\n\r\npropose to register them in Part B.  A trade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmark  registered  in  Part  A must satisfy  a  higher  level  of\r\n\r\ndistinctiveness  than a Part B trade mark and thus  has  greater\r\n\r\nprotection.   For  example, the validity  of  a  trade  mark  is\r\n\r\npresumed  to  be conclusive after 7 years under the Trade  Marks\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the differences for the proprietor between\r\n\r\nregistration in Part A or Part B do not justify the considerable\r\n\r\namount  of time spent by examiners and applicants in determining\r\n\r\nwhich  Part  a  trade  mark  is  registrable  under.   The  Bill\r\n\r\naccordingly  provides for a unified register.   This  will  thus\r\n\r\nsimplify  examination,  resulting in savings  in  administration\r\n\r\ncosts and also costs to applicants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, providing for less stringent criteria for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  trade marks.  This will  make  it  easier  for\r\n\r\nproprietors to obtain registration.  The test for registrability\r\n\r\nwill  generally  be  similar to that for a Part  B  registration\r\n\r\nunder  the  present Trade Marks Act, that is,  a  mark  must  be\r\n\r\ncapable  of  distinguishing  the  goods  or  services   of   its\r\n\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, simplifying and expediting the examination process\r\n\r\nby  removing the Registrar's power to impose disclaimers.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  present Trade Marks Act, the Registrar may, as a  condition\r\n\r\nof registration, require the applicant to disclaim rights to non-distinctive  features  of  a  trade  mark.   The  effect  of   a\r\n\r\ndisclaimer  is that the proprietor of the registered trade  mark\r\n\r\ncannot claim any rights under the Act in respect of the parts of\r\n\r\nthe  mark to which the disclaimer relates.  Therefore, no action\r\n\r\nfor infringement shall lie in respect of the use or imitation of\r\n\r\nthe disclaimed elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, the Registrar will have no power to impose\r\n\r\ndisclaimers.   But  there is a provision for disclaimers  to  be\r\n\r\nentered  in  the  register by the applicants  voluntarily.   The\r\n\r\napplicants  may  wish  to do this at the  application  stage  to\r\n\r\nforestall possible opposition to the registration of their trade\r\n\r\nmarks.  Disclaimers may also be entered by the applicants  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of opposition proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, abolishing Association of Trade Marks. The Bill\r\n\r\nabolishes the practice of associating identical or similar trade\r\n\r\nmarks  in  respect  of  the same or similar  goods  or  services\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the  same proprietor.  Under the  existing  Trade\r\n\r\nMarks Act, associated trade marks must be assigned together,  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  public from being misled as to the source  of  the\r\n\r\ngoods  or  services.  The abolition of the association of  trade\r\n\r\nmarks  in  the  Bill  is premised on the fact  that  trade  mark\r\n\r\nproprietors  are most attuned to market conditions and  are  the\r\n\r\nbest  persons to ensure that an assignment of their trade  marks\r\n\r\ndoes  not  lead  to confusion or deception on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, registering marks relating to Ancillary Services.\r\n\r\nAt  the  second  reading of the Trade Marks Bill  in  1991,  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Law  informed  the  House  that  the  issue   of\r\n\r\nregistration of retail service marks would be reviewed.  We have\r\n\r\nstudied   the   international  trend  which  acknowledges   that\r\n\r\nancillary services such as retail services have attributes which\r\n\r\ndeserve  recognition.  The Bill accordingly makes provision  for\r\n\r\nthe  registration  of  marks in relation to  ancillary  services\r\n\r\nperformed  for  the  benefit  of someone  else  other  than  the\r\n\r\nproprietor.   Therefore, marks such as SOGO and  METRO  are  now\r\n\r\nregistrable in respect of retail services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Madrid Protocol</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill will enable Singapore to accede to\r\n\r\nthe  Madrid  Protocol.   The  Madrid Protocol  which  came  into\r\n\r\noperation  on  1st  April  1996 is  administered  by  the  World\r\n\r\nIntellectual   Property  Organisation  or  WIPO.    Essentially,\r\n\r\naccession to the Protocol would enable trade marks registered in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be protected internationally.  As at  1st  October\r\n\r\n1998,   35  countries  including  the  United  Kingdom,  France,\r\n\r\nGermany, Switzerland and China were parties to the Protocol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill will be an important addition to\r\n\r\nour  legislation on intellectual property rights which have seen\r\n\r\nsignificant advancements in recent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nyour indulgence.  I support the Bill and I just want to raise  a\r\n\r\nsmall point for the Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as it stands right now, does not deal with e-mail\r\n\r\naddresses  and  domain names.  I believe with  Singapore's  move\r\n\r\ninto  e-commerce and greater use of the Internet for competitive\r\n\r\npurposes,  there will be an opportunity given to scoundrels  and\r\n\r\ncrooks  who  would register things as they have  done  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries like ronald@Mcdonald.com.sg and these are things which\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  well-known trade marks or even  registered  trade\r\n\r\nmarks  for purposes which include blackmailing the actual  trade\r\n\r\nmark  owner to pay off this particular person.  So I would  just\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister to consider adding this perhaps to the future\r\n\r\namendment to the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I thank the Member for his\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  We can certainly consider it as we see how the  law\r\n\r\nworks out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, as in the case of the Trade Marks Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich has just been read and put through the House, is a product\r\n\r\nof  the  inter-ministry Committee reviewing our  legislation  on\r\n\r\nintellectual protection rights.  A similar consultative approach\r\n\r\nwas taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim of this Bill is two-fold. Firstly, it seeks to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  level of protection for geographical  indications.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it  seeks  to enable Singapore  to  comply  with  our\r\n\r\nobligations  under  Articles 22 to 24 of the  WTO  Agreement  on\r\n\r\nTrade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,  or  the\r\n\r\nTRIPS Agreement, in short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Geographical Indications</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, geographical indications are names or signs used in\r\n\r\ntrade to identify a good or product as originating from a place,\r\n\r\nwhere  a  given  quality, reputation or other characteristic  of\r\n\r\nthat good or product is largely attributable to its geographical\r\n\r\norigin.  Some  well-known  examples of geographical  indications\r\n\r\ninclude  \"CHAMPAGNE\", \"SCOTCH WHISKY\", \"CHEDDAR CHEESE\",  \"PARMA\r\n\r\nHAM\",  \"BORDEAUX\", \"PORT\" and \"SHERRY\", names which Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould likely have come across in any supermarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Compliance of the Existing Law with the TRIPS Agreement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore presently does not have specific legislation\r\n\r\ngoverning the use of geographical indications.  It is,  however,\r\n\r\npossible to register them as certification trade marks, if  they\r\n\r\nfulfil   the   requirements   under   the   Trade   Marks   Act.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  owners  of  geographical  indications  or  those\r\n\r\nauthorised by them to use the geographical indication,  may  sue\r\n\r\nfor  passing off, if the geographical indication fails to fulfil\r\n\r\nthe  registrability  requirements under  the  Trade  Marks  Act.\r\n\r\nAlso,  under the Consumer Protection Act, the use or application\r\n\r\nof  a  false trade description on goods, including their origin,\r\n\r\nis prohibited and constitutes an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, these laws do not meet the standard of\r\n\r\nprotection  required  for geographical  indications  in  general\r\n\r\nunder  the  TRIPS Agreement.  Also, international  trend  is  to\r\n\r\nenact  specific legislation to protect geographical indications,\r\n\r\ndistinct   from  those  relating  to  trade  marks   or   unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition. Hence, we have decided to enact a separate Bill  to\r\n\r\ncover this specific area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Aim of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, Sir, the Bill, in compliance with the TRIPS\r\n\r\nAgreement, prohibits the following acts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) use of misleading geographical indications;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registration of misleading geographical indications as\r\n\r\ntrade marks; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) use of geographical indications which would constitute an\r\n\r\nact  of  unfair  competition within the  meaning  of  the  Paris\r\n\r\nConvention for the Protection of Industrial Property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, further, the Bill provides additional protection for\r\n\r\ngeographical  indications  relating  to  wines  and  spirits  by\r\n\r\nprohibiting the non-misleading use of a geographical  indication\r\n\r\nin  relation to wines and spirits, that is to say, the use of  a\r\n\r\ngeographical  indication for wines and spirits  not  originating\r\n\r\nfrom the place indicated by the geographical indication, even if\r\n\r\nthe  true  origin of the goods is indicated, or the geographical\r\n\r\nindication  is used in translation or accompanied by expressions\r\n\r\nsuch as \"kind\", \"type\", \"style\", \"imitation\" or the like.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, protection under the Bill is limited to geographical\r\n\r\nindications of a country or territory which is a member  of  the\r\n\r\nWTO,  or  a party to the Paris Convention for the Protection  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial Property, or a country designated by the Minister  as\r\n\r\na qualifying country. The last category is to give us the option\r\n\r\nof  entering  into  a bilateral or multilateral  agreement  with\r\n\r\ncountries that are neither members of the WTO, nor party to  the\r\n\r\nParis Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no requirement for registration of a geographical\r\n\r\nindication  as  the  TRIPS Agreement does  not  make  protection\r\n\r\ncontingent  upon  registration.   Instead,  the  Bill  allows  a\r\n\r\nproducer   or   trader  of  goods  identified  by   geographical\r\n\r\nindications  or  an association of these persons,  to  institute\r\n\r\nproceedings  against a person for committing an  act  prohibited\r\n\r\nunder the Bill. In line with the TRIPS Agreement,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsumers  may  not pursue this avenue. Consumers may,  however,\r\n\r\npursue  existing remedies under the Consumer Protection  Act  or\r\n\r\nthe Trade Marks Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exceptions to Protection of Geographical Indications</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, protection under the Bill is subject to some\r\n\r\nexceptions, including:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, no relief may be claimed under the Bill in relation\r\n\r\nto  a  geographical indication which is contrary to public order\r\n\r\nor morality, or which has fallen into disuse or has ceased to be\r\n\r\nprotected in its country of origin;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a person may use a geographical indication in relation\r\n\r\nto  goods  or services which has become a common name  of  those\r\n\r\ngoods or services in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, businesses which produce or trade in products which\r\n\r\nrely  on  geographical origin to indicate their quality and  for\r\n\r\ntheir reputation will benefit from this Bill.  It will also have\r\n\r\nthe general effect of facilitating trade and the flow of quality\r\n\r\ngoods,  and  allow consumers to rely confidently on geographical\r\n\r\nindications as an indication of the quality commonly  associated\r\n\r\nwith the various geographical regions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

The rate is 6% if estate duty\r\n\r\nis unpaid 6 to 18 months from the date of death, and there is no\r\n\r\nprovision  to reduce the rate if reasonable cause for the  delay\r\n\r\ncan be shown.  For the period beyond 18 months, the 12% interest\r\n\r\nrate  can  be  reduced to 6% provided reasonable cause  for  the\r\n\r\ndelay can be shown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the administrator or executor of an estate to\r\n\r\nfile in a complete affidavit early, the rate for the first six\r\n\r\nmonths after death will be reduced to 0% if a complete affidavit\r\n\r\nis received.  The rate on unpaid estate duty 6 to 18 months\r\n\r\nafter death will also be reduced from 6% to 3% if reasonable\r\n\r\ncause for the delay can be shown.

However, under the Income Tax\r\n\r\nAct, tax deductions are allowed for donations made to\r\n\r\nInstitutions of a Public Character (IPCs) or the Government at\r\n\r\nany point of time.  For consistency with the Income Tax Act,\r\n\r\ndonations, gifts and bequests to IPCs or the Government will be\r\n\r\nexempt from estate duty regardless of the point of time they are\r\n\r\nmade to these institutions.  Clauses 3 and 4 amend the Act to\r\n\r\nprovide for the estate duty exemption on donations/gifts and\r\n\r\nbequests made to these institutions while clause 13 repeals the\r\n\r\nNinth Schedule which is no longer required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate administration of estate duty, clauses 2, 5,\r\n\r\n6 ,7 and 8 amend the Act to provide for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To empower the Commissioner of Estate Duty, instead of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, to determine the forms for notice  of\r\n\r\nassessment,  estate duty affidavit and the estate duty  form  of\r\n\r\naccount;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To remove the requirement for the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nEstate  Duty to certify the payment of estate duty on the estate\r\n\r\nduty  affidavit  or  the  form of account  for  internal  record\r\n\r\npurposes; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To allow the shares of a deceased person in\r\n\r\nthe  CDP  account  or CPF investment account to  be  transferred\r\n\r\nwithout estate duty clearance if the market value of such shares\r\n\r\nin  either account at the time of death does not exceed $50,000.\r\n\r\nStatistics  show  that such cases are generally  not  liable  to\r\n\r\nestate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I rise to support the Bill. The new\r\n\r\namendment   would  allow  the  Commissioner   of   Estate   Duty\r\n\r\nflexibility in issuing notices of assessments in such form as he\r\n\r\nmay  determine.  Similarly, the Estate Duty affidavit which  has\r\n\r\nbeen in circulation for a long time would also be updated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the exemption of gifts and donations to be made\r\n\r\nto  Institutions of a Public Character (IPC) as well as  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and I hope that the media will give enough  publicity\r\n\r\nso that more donations could be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find clause 8 which amends section 44 of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  very progressive.  However, my complaint  is  why  the\r\n\r\nMinister chose only a figure of $50,000 instead of $100,000.   I\r\n\r\nthink  another  method  could have  been  adopted.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nsetting  the  limit  at  $50,000, we could  have  empowered  the\r\n\r\nMinister to vary the figure.  As it now stands, he has  to  come\r\n\r\nback to this House whenever he has to make any amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore must be Asia's largest shareholding country\r\n\r\nand this is why I am appealing to the Minister to reconsider the\r\n\r\nposition.   I  also hope the Minister would consider introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation where small estates below $100,000 need  not  go  to\r\n\r\ncourt.  It could be administered either by the Public Trustee or\r\n\r\neven institutions like banks and solicitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Sixth Schedule is to be welcomed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  have  one plea for the Minister, and  that  is,  he\r\n\r\nshould  give outright exemption for interest for the  first  six\r\n\r\nmonths and thereafter the interest should be added in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  current prime rate.  I am aware of the fact that  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner is quite generous in exempting interest  but  I  am\r\n\r\npuzzled that the upper limit of 12% is indeed high.  May I  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to reconsider the position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got another request. I know I am not going to be happy\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of the day but I am still asking the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  abolishing  estate duty itself gradually.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nasking  him to do it now but eventually I hope he would consider\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Mr  Rai for his comments.  I consider the figure  $50,000\r\n\r\nadequate  for  the time being although the suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister should be allowed to vary it is reasonable which may be\r\n\r\nincorporated in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the introduction of legislation to exempt small estates,\r\n\r\nI will consider the suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On interest rates, if an affidavit is filed within six\r\n\r\nmonths,  the  interest  rate should be  zero.   Thereafter,  the\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  are applied to induce estates to  submit  their\r\n\r\naffidavits  in  a timely manner so as to expedite  the  process.\r\n\r\nBut we will always review this from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on his suggestion to abolish estate duty\r\n\r\naltogether, I would like to assure him that the issue of  estate\r\n\r\nduty  revision is reviewed annually, and I will take his request\r\n\r\ninto consideration in the next Budget, although I cannot promise\r\n\r\nanything now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ACCOUNTANTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House mainly seeks to improve the\r\n\r\nstandard  of the professional accounting practice in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  to streamline disciplinary proceedings for  better\r\n\r\nregulation of the profession.  With the worldwide trend  towards\r\n\r\ngreater transparency and disclosure in corporate regimes,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  to  ensure that our public accountants  continually\r\n\r\nimprove  their high standards to ensure the continued  integrity\r\n\r\nof our financial system.  I believe that the proposed amendments\r\n\r\ntake us a step further in that direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in the Bill arose mainly out of\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the Accountants Act Amendments Committee\r\n\r\nand  the  Public  Accountants Board (PAB) Working  Committee  to\r\n\r\nReview Accounting and Auditing Standards in Singapore.  The  two\r\n\r\nCommittees included academics and practitioners from the Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University, the Stock Exchange of Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General's Office, the Attorney-General's  Chambers,  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore  (ICPAS),\r\n\r\nand the Registry of Companies and Businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly explain the key provisions of the Bill,\r\n\r\nstarting with those which strengthen the regulatory framework of\r\n\r\npublic  accountants, contained in the following clauses  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 6: Validity Period of Licence and Prescribed Requirements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 repeals and re-enacts section 15, which governs\r\n\r\nthe  certificate  of registration of a public  accountant.   The\r\n\r\nduration  of the registration of a public accountant is  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom three years at present to one year.  The Public Accountants\r\n\r\nBoard  will  then be able to gain more timely information  about\r\n\r\napplicants,  and more effectively regulate errant practitioners.\r\n\r\nRather than an automatic renewal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the licence once every three years, it is now provided  that\r\n\r\nthe Board will renew the certificate of registration of a public\r\n\r\naccountant   only  if  he  has  complied  with  the   prescribed\r\n\r\nrequirements  relating  to  continuing  professional   education\r\n\r\n(CPE),  and  meets what is expected in his professional  conduct\r\n\r\nand practice.  This re-emphasises the importance of training and\r\n\r\npractice review to maintain the high standards of accounting and\r\n\r\nauditing  practices in Singapore.  It will give legal effect  to\r\n\r\nstandards already required of public accountants by ICPAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 8:  Preliminary Information/Need for Deposit</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 20, which governs procedures on\r\n\r\ncomplaints.   The Board, in the event of a complaint  against  a\r\n\r\npublic accountant, can now require the accountant to respond  to\r\n\r\nits  preliminary inquiries, before the complaint is referred  to\r\n\r\nan  Inquiry Committee.  A maximum fine of $2,000 may be  imposed\r\n\r\nif  the  accountant concerned refuses, without good  reason,  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the  preliminary inquiry.  To  weed  out  frivolous\r\n\r\ncomplaints and abuse of the disciplinary process, the  amendment\r\n\r\nwill  also  allow the Board to require a refundable deposit  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $1,000 to be placed with the Board.  This amount  may\r\n\r\nbe  forfeited in full or partially if the complaint is found  to\r\n\r\nbe  frivolous or vexatious, or dismissed because the complainant\r\n\r\nrefuses to co-operate with the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clauses 6 & 9: Suspension and De-Registration</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends section 21 to add to the grounds on which the\r\n\r\nBoard  may  suspend  or de-register a public accountant.   Every\r\n\r\npublic  accountant  who  is registered with  the  Board  has  to\r\n\r\nobserve the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, set out  in\r\n\r\nthe  Third  Schedule  of the Board Rules.   He  has  to  conduct\r\n\r\nhimself in a manner consistent with the good reputation  of  the\r\n\r\naccountancy   profession,  which  demands  high   standards   of\r\n\r\nintegrity,  objectivity, independence and moral character.   The\r\n\r\namendment  gives  legal effect for failure  to  conduct  oneself\r\n\r\nproperly.  Consequential amendment is made via clause 6\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  section  19 to allow an Inquiry Committee to be set  up  for\r\n\r\npurpose  of  ascertaining whether an infringement or failure  to\r\n\r\nobserve the Code has been committed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public accountants will also benefit from this amendment, which\r\n\r\nprovides  that any suspension, de-registration or imposition  of\r\n\r\npenalty  on a public accountant may take effect only  after  the\r\n\r\nexpiration  of  one  month from the date  on  which  the  appeal\r\n\r\nagainst  the decision made to the High Court has been determined\r\n\r\nor  withdrawn.   This  new provision seeks  to  minimize  losses\r\n\r\nsuffered   by  the  public  accountant  as  a  result   of   the\r\n\r\ncancellation or suspension of his licence.  The High  Court  may\r\n\r\nalso assess any cost charged against a public accountant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 11: Voluntary De-Registration Upon Complaint/Summary De-Registration</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 amends section 23 to add to the grounds on which a\r\n\r\npublic accountant may be summarily removed from the Register  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Accountants.  A new provision is inserted to  prevent  a\r\n\r\npublic  accountant from applying to be removed from the Register\r\n\r\nof  Public Accountants if disciplinary action is pending against\r\n\r\nhim  or  if  he  is being investigated by an Inquiry  Committee.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  loophole  that should be  plugged  and  is  a  fair\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill, we have however received\r\n\r\nfeedback from various sources that the other intended provisions\r\n\r\nmay  be  too  harsh.   In  particular, in the  current  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment, business revenues may be severely affected, leading\r\n\r\nto  unavoidable  credit problems.  As such, I  have  decided  to\r\n\r\nremove   \"insolvency\"  and  \"entering  into   composition   with\r\n\r\ncreditors\"  as  grounds for summary removal.  Instead,  in  such\r\n\r\ncases, we will rely on existing provisions under section  21  of\r\n\r\nthe Act, which requires an Inquiry Committee to be first set up,\r\n\r\nwith its appropriate appeal channels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in cases where the public accountant has already been\r\n\r\nadjudged a bankrupt through the usual processes, there is really\r\n\r\nno need for the PAB to go through a further Inquiry Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHence, there are grounds for summary removal in the case where a\r\n\r\npublic  accountant is an adjudged bankrupt.  I propose  to  move\r\n\r\namendments  to clarify these points.  With the consent  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I will therefore be proposing these changes to the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhen we are in Committee stage later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 13: Imposition of Composition Fines</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 inserts a new section 56A. This enables the Board to\r\n\r\nimpose deterrent fines on minor offences without having to bring\r\n\r\noffenders   to  court.  However,  offences  involving   personal\r\n\r\nmisconduct,   which  will  be  dealt  with  under  the   Board's\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  proceedings and subject to due process,  shall  be\r\n\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to other amendments which will improve the operations\r\n\r\nand efficiency  of the Public Accountants Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 3: Adoption of Accounting Standards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, PAB rules already require a public accountant to\r\n\r\ncarry out his professional work in accordance with technical and\r\n\r\nprofessional  standards expected of him as a public  accountant.\r\n\r\nWhile  the practice of the Public Accountants Board is to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe standards issued by ICPAS, its power to do so is implied  by\r\n\r\nsection 5(d) as one of the Board's functions is to \"control  and\r\n\r\nregulate the practice of the profession of accountancy by public\r\n\r\naccountants\".   In comparison, in the United States  and  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  the  regulatory bodies for the accountancy  profession\r\n\r\nhave the legislative power to prescribe such standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence an amendment is required to amend section 5 of the\r\n\r\nAccountants Act to expressly empower the Board to prescribe  the\r\n\r\nstandards,  methods and procedures that public accountants  have\r\n\r\nto follow in the course of their professional work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 12: De-Regulation of Tax Consultants</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 amends section 48 to enable persons not registered as\r\n\r\npublic   accountants  to  practise  as  tax  consultants.    Tax\r\n\r\nconsultancy   should  not  be  the  sole  preserve   of   public\r\n\r\naccountants  and  solicitors, as currently  provided  under  the\r\n\r\nAccountants   Act.   Indeed  market  forces   will   drive   tax\r\n\r\nconsultants  who  do  not deliver good quality  service  out  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  In addition, unlike public accountants whose work has\r\n\r\na great impact on the public, the argument for the protection of\r\n\r\ngeneral  public interest holds less weight in the  case  of  tax\r\n\r\nconsultancy  as  it  is  a  service offered  exclusively  to  an\r\n\r\nindividual paying customer.  There is thus no specific need  for\r\n\r\nthe  Board  to  regulate tax agents.  Nevertheless,  the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will be examining ways  of\r\n\r\nensuring the continued high professional standard of tax agents,\r\n\r\nand this will be announced when ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 4: Change to Self-Funding Status of PAB</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 4 amends section 7 to enable the Board to meet\r\n\r\nits expenses through Government funding. Presently, the Board is\r\n\r\nfunded  solely  by  fees  collected from  the  registration  and\r\n\r\nrenewal  of public accountants' licences. This is not sufficient\r\n\r\nto  cover  the  Board's operating expenditure,  especially  when\r\n\r\nlegal  and  inquiry  costs need to be incurred.   The  grant  is\r\n\r\nnecessary as the Board's expenditure will continue to be  pushed\r\n\r\nup  by  rising administrative expenses as well as investigation,\r\n\r\nprosecution and legal assessment costs for increasingly  complex\r\n\r\ncomplaint  cases.   These  costs  are  essential  to  ensure   a\r\n\r\nthorough, fair and effective complaints inquiry process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are to clarify interpretations and relate\r\n\r\nto consequential amendments to the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Accountants  (Amendment) Bill.  I would like,  however,  to\r\n\r\nexpress  some concerns over some of the proposed amendments  and\r\n\r\nalso to seek clarification on some others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 21(1)(a)(viii) appears to be very stringent such\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  accountants are  not  able  to  pursue  other\r\n\r\nbusiness   interests.    This   does   not   provide   for   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  spirit,  which  our  country   is   encouraging\r\n\r\ncurrently.  Moreover, this will pose hardship to many  part-time\r\n\r\nand  small  time public accountants who form quite a substantial\r\n\r\nportion of the accountant community.  They will feel the adverse\r\n\r\neffects  of  this  amendment as in  most cases they  do  provide\r\n\r\nother non-accountancy-related services as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 23(g) should stop at the word \"bankrupt\". This\r\n\r\nis   because,  with  the  current  economic  crisis,  a   public\r\n\r\naccountant  may need to enter into a composition with  creditors\r\n\r\nand should he be successful, there is no reason why he should be\r\n\r\nremoved from the register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 56(A), there is no consistency in this provision\r\n\r\nwhereby  any offences under this Act or any rule made thereunder\r\n\r\nwhich  is  prescribed as compoundable offences may be compounded\r\n\r\nfor  a  sum  of  money not exceeding $1,000.   This  is  because\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions  call for a fine not  exceeding  $2,000,  an\r\n\r\nexample  which may be found in section 20(3E).  Therefore,  this\r\n\r\nprovision  may have been better to be in line with  the  others,\r\n\r\nie, a fine not exceeding $2,000 as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 19 provides a much wider scope for\r\n\r\nmisconduct  for  public accountants, unlike the  old  Act  which\r\n\r\nrestricts complaints to professional misconduct only.  There  is\r\n\r\nambiguity  in  the  \"improper  act  or  conduct\"  which   brings\r\n\r\ndisrepute  to  the accountants' profession or which  makes  them\r\n\r\nunfit  for practice.  There is a need for clarification here  in\r\n\r\nthe  nature  and  extent  in the meaning  of  \"improper  act  or\r\n\r\nconduct\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards section 15, firstly, subsection 5(b) on \"appraisal of\r\n\r\nthe public accountant's professional conduct and practice\" calls\r\n\r\nfor  further clarification on the operational methods to  ensure\r\n\r\neffective and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncredible  judgement and, secondly, in subsection  5(c)  on  \"any\r\n\r\nother  matter  which the Board considers relevant\" embodies  too\r\n\r\nmuch  and  the  nature of these matters should be specified  and\r\n\r\nshould be confined to technical, professional or moral issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in section 5 appear to prepare the way for the\r\n\r\nPublic  Accountants Board to prescribe the accounting standards,\r\n\r\nmethods and procedures to be followed by public accountants when\r\n\r\ndoing any work in the course of their profession.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  seek  clarification on the kind of resources which  will  be\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  this  function in order to  benefit  the  general\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.  I would like to declare my interest  as  a\r\n\r\npractising  public  accountant,  as  a  Council  member  of  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore,  and  as\r\n\r\nsomeone  who has participated in some of the discussions earlier\r\n\r\non over some of these amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to state that I am expressing a personal\r\n\r\nview.   When  I  first read the Bill for the first  time  as  an\r\n\r\nindividual, as anyone else would have been looking at  the  text\r\n\r\nof  the Bill, I had this feeling that the amendments were rather\r\n\r\ndraconian.   Then I read it a second and third  time,  but  this\r\n\r\ntime  as  a practitioner, as a public accountant, and I  realise\r\n\r\nthat the amendments really were to bring the Accountants Act  in\r\n\r\nline  with  other  Acts regulating the other professionals.   In\r\n\r\nsome respect, because it is a more recent amendment than the Act\r\n\r\nregulating,  say, the solicitors, we have actually  improved  on\r\n\r\nit.   We  have  included composition for very minor offences  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite convinced that the amendments have been made not to\r\n\r\nmake  life  more difficult for public accountants, but  to  help\r\n\r\npublic  accountants maintain their stature.  I am in support  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill but there are some areas of concern that I feel need to\r\n\r\nbe addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15(5)(a) on continuing professional education and\r\n\r\nsection  15(5)(b)   on the appraisal of the public  accountant's\r\n\r\nprofessional  conduct  and practice are two  of  the  areas  for\r\n\r\ncompliance  that will be considered by the Board for the  annual\r\n\r\nrenewal  of  their  certificate.  I think  there  will  be  some\r\n\r\nproblems here because Continuing Professional Education (CPE) is\r\n\r\nbeing  monitored  for  compliance over  a  3-year  period.   The\r\n\r\npractice review to appraise the public accountant's professional\r\n\r\nconduct and practice is also done in cycles.  Perhaps there is a\r\n\r\nneed to add that compliance in these two areas is assumed unless\r\n\r\nthere is evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there is going to be an amendment to the\r\n\r\namendment  because I was quite concerned over the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nthe  condition  of  insolvency and of  a  composition  with  any\r\n\r\ncreditor  for a public accountant to be struck off.   Especially\r\n\r\nin  current times, a public accountant having bought a home with\r\n\r\na  bank overdraft, and with the fall in the property market, may\r\n\r\nwell  find himself to be technically insolvent.  But I think  it\r\n\r\nis  now  water  under  the bridge as there  is  now  a  proposed\r\n\r\namendment.  So overall, yes, I find it is more stringent on  the\r\n\r\npublic  accountants  but  it  is a profession,  the  stature  is\r\n\r\nrespected and should be maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly glad with the amendment in section 48 which\r\n\r\nnow  allows non-accountants to practise as tax consultants.  For\r\n\r\nsome time now, I feel that it does not make sense that a person,\r\n\r\nwho has passed all the vigorous examinations of the Institute of\r\n\r\nTaxation,  and perhaps even with experience practising taxation,\r\n\r\nor  perhaps  has  been  in  employment  of  the  Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nAuthority, cannot come out and practise as a tax consultant.   I\r\n\r\nthink now this addresses that issue.  However, having opened  it\r\n\r\nup,  there  is  a  need perhaps for regulation  to  control  and\r\n\r\nmaintain the standards of tax consultants in the interest of the\r\n\r\npublic.   It would be a sad day if the public is represented  by\r\n\r\nsomeone holding himself up to be a tax consultant and who is not\r\n\r\ncompetent, and therefore results in huge losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendments to the Accountants Act, the public\r\n\r\naccountant is well regulated, and I am sure some will feel  that\r\n\r\nwe  are being over-regulated.  I am very sure over the next  few\r\n\r\nmonths,  some  public accountants will be arguing  and  debating\r\n\r\nover  the  amendments.  The question that remains is:  who  then\r\n\r\nregulates  the accountants in commerce?  After all,  they  cause\r\n\r\nfinancial statements to be prepared and often are the  ones  who\r\n\r\nprepare the financial statements themselves.  I think there is a\r\n\r\nneed also to control the conduct and the standard of accountants\r\n\r\nin  commercial practice.  If the work of both the commercial and\r\n\r\npublic   accountants  is  of  a  high  standard,   they   become\r\n\r\ncomplementary.  But, as it stands now, in some cases  where  the\r\n\r\nstandards  do differ, the respective positions of the commercial\r\n\r\naccountants  and the public accountants can then be  adversarial\r\n\r\nto the detriment of all parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank Dr Neo and Mr Ee for their comments and points raised  and\r\n\r\nI will try to address their concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, disciplinary proceedings. Dr Lily Neo has commented\r\n\r\nthat  section  21(1)(a)(viii) is too  stringent  and  may  deter\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   She also feels that it will  pose  hardship,\r\n\r\nespecially  on small time accountants, since in most cases  they\r\n\r\ndo provide other non-accountancy related services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also concerned that section 19(1) may be too wide as the\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  an  Inquiry Committee to be set up  have  expanded\r\n\r\nbeyond professional misconduct, and now include an \"improper act\r\n\r\nor  conduct\" which brings disrepute to the profession  or  makes\r\n\r\nthem  unfit  for  practice.  I will address these  two  concerns\r\n\r\ntogether, as they are related.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in moving the amendment, I had earlier informed the\r\n\r\nHouse  that every public accountant has to observe the  Code  of\r\n\r\nProfessional  Conduct and Ethics and has to conduct  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself in a manner consistent with the good reputation  of  the\r\n\r\naccountancy   profession.    The  Code   already   imposes   the\r\n\r\nrequirement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  public accountants should not be substantially engaged  in\r\n\r\nany  other  business,  other than that of a  public  accountant.\r\n\r\nThis is to pre-empt situations where public accountants are  put\r\n\r\nin a position where their independence is compromised, and there\r\n\r\nis   a   conflict   of   interest   between   his   professional\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and the pursuit of wider business interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 21 merely picks up on these\r\n\r\nprofessional  obligations which are,  in  fact,  being  observed\r\n\r\nalready.  Section 21 sets out the grounds for the PAB to suspend\r\n\r\nor    cancel    a   public   accountant's   licence,   following\r\n\r\ninvestigations by an Inquiry Committee.  It thus establishes the\r\n\r\nlegal recourse (of suspension or deregistration) for failure  to\r\n\r\nact professionally and independently, resulting from a range  of\r\n\r\ncauses, including that of engaging in business at odds with  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of the profession.  I am therefore confident  that  the\r\n\r\namendment  should  not  in any way hinder  entrepreneurship,  as\r\n\r\npublic  accountants would remain quite free  to  carry  on  non-accountancy-related services, as long as there is no conflict of\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to section 19 are really\r\n\r\nconsequential to the broadening of the causes for deregistration\r\n\r\nin section 21.  The amendment will allow an Inquiry Committee to\r\n\r\nbe  set  up  when  a public accountant brings disrepute  to  his\r\n\r\nprofession,  by  behaviour  in  areas  beyond  his  professional\r\n\r\ncapacity.  Some may say that this appears draconian, but let  me\r\n\r\nassure Members that the provisions will not be triggered when  a\r\n\r\npublic  accountant has committed an improper  act  per  se.   An\r\n\r\ninquiry can only proceed if the act has an adverse impact on the\r\n\r\ngeneral  standing of the profession, or shows  that  the  public\r\n\r\naccountant  is  unfit  for  his  profession.   This  is  a  fair\r\n\r\napplication  of  the law, in order to safeguard and  uphold  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the accounting profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers are crafted broadly in the statute in order to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  PAB has a wide enough remit  to  achieve  its\r\n\r\nobjective.   But  I  expect the PAB to  be  circumspect  in  its\r\n\r\nadministration.  Members may also be interested to know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  largely  similar provisions exist in the Legal  Profession\r\n\r\nAct,  where  \"misconduct unbefitting . an advocate or solicitor\"\r\n\r\nis also grounds for discipline by the Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of renewal of certificate of registration,\r\n\r\nboth Dr Neo and Mr Gerard Ee have asked for clarification on how\r\n\r\nthe  new provisions in section 15 on the renewal of certificates\r\n\r\nof registration will work in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, renewal of certificates will no longer be\r\n\r\nautomatic,    but   conditional   on   satisfying    \"continuing\r\n\r\nprofessional  education\"  (CPE) and  \"appraisal  of  the  public\r\n\r\naccountant's professional conduct and practice\".  In response to\r\n\r\nMr  Ee's  question, the annual CPE records of public accountants\r\n\r\nwill  be  considered by the Public Accountants  Board  when  the\r\n\r\nrenewal of public accountants becomes due.  But given the three-year compliance rule, consideration will be given to whether  or\r\n\r\nnot the public accountant has fulfilled the requirements for the\r\n\r\npreceding three-year period on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For practice reviews, the Board shall consider only the reports\r\n\r\nof  accounting firms for which the review has been completed  in\r\n\r\nthat  year.   Only  the public accountants of  these  particular\r\n\r\nfirms will have the renewals of their licences to be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe practice review reports being satisfactory.  However, over a\r\n\r\nthree-year cycle, all public accountants will be covered  as  it\r\n\r\nis intended for all public accounting firms to be reviewed.  The\r\n\r\npractice review of accounting firms with public listed companies\r\n\r\nas clients will be more regular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both CPE and practice review requirements, if a public\r\n\r\naccountant  does not satisfy either requirement  for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime,  he  will  be issued with a warning letter.   Only  if  he\r\n\r\npersists in failing to meet the requirement will the licence not\r\n\r\nbe renewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAB's Rules will be suitably amended to incorporate the new\r\n\r\nprovisions in due course.  As for Dr Neo's concern that  section\r\n\r\n15(5)(c)  is  overly wide, I would like to assure her  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard will continue to confine itself only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  technical and professional issues.  There is no intention to\r\n\r\ndeliberately  make it more difficult for public  accountants  to\r\n\r\nrenew their licences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of composition fines, Dr Neo has commented\r\n\r\nthat  the new section 56A, which allows PAB to compound offences\r\n\r\nof  up  to  $1,000,  is  inconsistent  with  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nAccountants Act on other offences, some of which can  result  in\r\n\r\nfines of up to $2,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a clear distinction between a\r\n\r\ncompoundment of an offence and a statutory fine.  A  composition\r\n\r\nsum  is that which the authority administering an Act allows  an\r\n\r\noffender to pay, in lieu of prosecuting him in the court for the\r\n\r\noffence,  whereas a statutory fine results from a conviction  in\r\n\r\ncourt, and covers more serious offences.  Thus, the penalty  for\r\n\r\ncompounded offence should necessarily be lower than  that  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  fine, as the two are not equivalent.  Compounding  is\r\n\r\nreally  for  more  minor offences or offences  where  there  are\r\n\r\nmitigating factors, such that a prosecution is not warranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an option to compound fines for minor offences at a\r\n\r\nlower  amount,  the High Court may be clogged up with  even  the\r\n\r\nmost  minor  offences.   If  the  composition  fine  is  raised,\r\n\r\noffenders may find it more attractive to fight it out  in  court\r\n\r\nin the hope of getting undeserved acquittals.  This would defeat\r\n\r\nthe whole purpose of the compoundment provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulation of tax consultants, Mr Gerard Ee has asked\r\n\r\nwho will regulate the tax professionals.  As I have mentioned in\r\n\r\nmy  Second  Reading  speech,  the Inland  Revenue  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore would be examining ways of ensuring the continued high\r\n\r\nprofessional standard of tax agents, and this will be  announced\r\n\r\nwhen  ready.   Under the Tax Acts, where there are  errors  (and\r\n\r\nomissions)  in tax returns, IRAS can prosecute those  who  flout\r\n\r\nthe law.  If the error is due to negligence of the tax agent, he\r\n\r\nwould be required to pay penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulation over non-practising accountants, Mr Gerard Ee\r\n\r\nalso  feels that there should be greater regulation and  control\r\n\r\nover  non-practising  accountants who are the  frontline  people\r\n\r\npreparing   or   influencing   the  preparation   of   financial\r\n\r\nstatements.   I  think  this is a fair statement.   But  control\r\n\r\nalready  exists in the Institute of Certified Public Accountants\r\n\r\nof  Singapore (ICPAS) as it regulates non-practising accountants\r\n\r\nwho   are  its  members.   For  example,  ICPAS  has  also  made\r\n\r\ncontinuing professional education (CPE) hours mandatory for such\r\n\r\nmembers,  who  can also be deregistered from ICPAS  for  various\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICPAS, however, has no hold over non-practising accountants who\r\n\r\nare  not  its  members, and it is unclear that  such  regulation\r\n\r\nshould  be  mandated.  This was debated at  length  by  the  PAB\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee to Review Accounting and Auditing  Standards,\r\n\r\nwhose  rationale was as follows.  As non-practising  accountants\r\n\r\ngenerally work for companies, it is more of an employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship.   And  since it is the responsibility  of  company\r\n\r\ndirectors  to ensure that the proper records are kept  and  that\r\n\r\naccounts are properly drawn up, it is less imperative that  such\r\n\r\naccounts preparers be directly regulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On PAB resources, Dr Neo has commented on the amendment to\r\n\r\nsection  5,  which provides for PAB to prescribe the  accounting\r\n\r\nstandards  and procedures to be followed by public  accountants.\r\n\r\nShe  would like to know what kind of resources will be committed\r\n\r\nto this function.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of\r\n\r\nSingapore prescribes auditing and accounting standards,  and  as\r\n\r\nearlier explained, the amendment will expressly empower the  PAB\r\n\r\nto  adopt  such standards.  Therefore, I do not expect  this  to\r\n\r\nresult  in a significant increase in resources required for  the\r\n\r\nPAB.   Nonetheless,  I  wish to point out that  I  have  already\r\n\r\nintroduced,  by  way of clause 4, a change to  the  self-funding\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the  PAB.   The Government  is  prepared  to  extend\r\n\r\noperating grants to PAB, and this co-sharing of regulatory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncosts    signifies    the   Government's   commitment    towards\r\n\r\nstrengthening the integrity of the financial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this, and other proposed changes, will all\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  a major enhancement of the regulatory  framework\r\n\r\nfor  the accounting profession, and deserve the support of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of summary removal due to composition\r\n\r\narrangement with creditors, I have already addressed this in  my\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  speech, and I believe that Dr  Neo  and  Mr  Ee\r\n\r\nshould be pleased with the outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As the notice of amendment is out of time, I\r\n\r\ngive my consent to the Minister to move the amendment.

Apart from this major amendment, opportunity  is\r\n\r\nalso  taken  to incorporate 16 other amendments to  improve  and\r\n\r\nupdate practices and procedures of the Board of Commissioners of\r\n\r\nCurrency of Singapore (BCCS).\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 13: Lifting of Controls over Colour Copiers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill seeks to repeal the existing\r\n\r\nprovision on the controls of colour copiers governed by  section\r\n\r\n20A of the Currency Act and the Currency (Full Copying Machines)\r\n\r\nRegulations  of 1996.  These statutes require a permit  for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  colour  copiers,  as well as a  counterfeit  prevention\r\n\r\nsystem (CPS) to be fitted in every such machine licensed for use\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Controls on colour copiers had been put in place\r\n\r\nsince  1979 to combat counterfeit activity.  They were  enhanced\r\n\r\nin  1995 when currency counterfeits made by even low-end  colour\r\n\r\ncopiers  were found to be good enough to be passed off  as  real\r\n\r\ncurrency.  However, with rapid advances in technology, a drastic\r\n\r\nreduction in the cost of producing colour copiers, and therefore\r\n\r\nthe  widespread availability of these colour copiers  worldwide,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  acknowledged that our controls  on  colour\r\n\r\ncopiers  are becoming increasingly onerous and impractical,  and\r\n\r\ncannot be expected to be water-tight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of seeking to continue strong and direct\r\n\r\ncontrols  which  disadvantage Singaporeans and inhibit  industry\r\n\r\nplayers,  especially those based in Singapore,  we  have  chosen\r\n\r\ninstead to speed up the development of a new Portrait series  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   currency   notes  that   are   more   resistant   to\r\n\r\ncounterfeiting via colour copiers.  BCCS will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissuing  the new Portrait Series incorporating the latest  anti-colour copier and anti-scanner security features, including  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Mark  System  (CMS) in 1999.  The  CMS  is  designed  to\r\n\r\ndistort  the image of any attempted colour photocopies of  these\r\n\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for the existing controls of colour copiers to be\r\n\r\nlifted.  The main beneficiaries would be Singaporeans, who  will\r\n\r\nnow  have  wider access to full colour copiers, and the business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  not  only  users but also  manufacturers  trying  to\r\n\r\ncreate a mass market for low-cost colour copiers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments to the Currency Act are to improve\r\n\r\nthe  practices and procedures of the BCCS.  I will now bring the\r\n\r\nHouse through the main amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clauses 4 and 5: Board Appointment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to amend section 6 of the Act to clarify\r\n\r\nthat all members of the Board, including the Chairman and Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman, shall be appointed for a specific period not exceeding\r\n\r\nthree  years  and  shall  be eligible  for  re-appointment.  The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment is made in view of the provision since  1991\r\n\r\nthat the post of Chairman, BCCS, is no longer held automatically\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  for Finance, hence the need  to  specify  the\r\n\r\nduration  of  the Chairman's appointment.  Clause 5 extends  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  disqualification  provision  in  section  8(1)  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Act to apply to all members of the Board, including the\r\n\r\nChairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 12: Provision on Currency Reproduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 seeks to amend section 20(1) and (2) to clarify\r\n\r\nand  extend the restriction on the use of photographs,  drawings\r\n\r\nor  designs  of Singapore currency notes and coins.  The  clause\r\n\r\nalso  seeks  to  enable  BCCS to impose conditions  in  granting\r\n\r\npermission on the use of these photographs, drawings  or  design\r\n\r\nof  currency notes and coins. The effect would be that  selected\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and others who have been licensed to use Singapore\r\n\r\ncurrency  note  or coin design for souvenirs, merchandise,  etc,\r\n\r\ncould have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir licences rescinded by BCCS should they fail to comply with\r\n\r\nthe conditions specified in the licences.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clauses 14 and 18: Currency Fund and Liquidity Requirements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 21(5) to remove the percentage of\r\n\r\n30%  of  the Currency Fund which must be held in liquid portion.\r\n\r\nThis  specification is considered unnecessary as currently,  the\r\n\r\nliquid portion can be varied with the unanimous approval of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 also seeks to delete section 21(6) which defines\r\n\r\nthe list of assets previously deemed to be liquid, such as gold,\r\n\r\nsilver,  foreign  exchange and Government guaranteed  securities\r\n\r\nmaturing in less than two years.  The amendment brings  the  Act\r\n\r\nup to date with current developments in the financial landscape,\r\n\r\nin  which liquidity is no longer static or quantifiable concept,\r\n\r\ngiven  that the ease with which investments are liquidated would\r\n\r\ndiffer under varying circumstances.  The proposed amendment will\r\n\r\naccord  the  Board  greater flexibility in maintaining  adequate\r\n\r\nliquidity in the Currency Fund to meet demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 15: External Assets</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 seeks to amend section 22 to specify three other\r\n\r\ntypes of external assets in the Currency Fund, namely, equities,\r\n\r\ncorporate  bonds,  and  currency  and  financial  futures.  This\r\n\r\namendment makes it clear in the legislation the inclusion of the\r\n\r\nthree  additional  external  assets  which  have  already   been\r\n\r\napproved by the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are of a drafting nature to rectify\r\n\r\ninconsistencies, and clarify provisions where  there  have  been\r\n\r\ndifficulties in interpretation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMISSION TO EXAMINE DEFAMATION LAW</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.43 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The motion is subject to signification\r\n\r\nof  support by at least one Member.

And I dare say that Members, feeling perhaps\r\n\r\nexhausted  after a long day and not only just the long  day  but\r\n\r\nthe  week, will say to themselves, \"Are we going to have another\r\n\r\ntedious  hour  from  Mr Jeyaretnam?\"  It is  probably  for  that\r\n\r\nreason that our faithful Singapore press did not report anything\r\n\r\nof what I said at the last motion.  They find it tedious to bore\r\n\r\ntheir  readers and that is probably why nothing was  said  about\r\n\r\nwhat  I said in Parliament two days ago.  But I am not going  to\r\n\r\nbother about what the Singapore press has to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, moves the focus to this House.\r\n\r\nMay  I  make that clear.  The previous motion was examining  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the people in our society, particularly their role  in\r\n\r\nthe  participation  in decision-making.   But  this  motion  now\r\n\r\nproposes to examine the role of Parliament in such a society.  I\r\n\r\nwill explain what I mean as I go on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said once before, in 1947, when we, as a people, were\r\n\r\ndeciding  what  sort  of a government we  desired,  because  the\r\n\r\nBritish  had  offered some self-autonomy, we sent  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommission  to  London  to say that we  wanted  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  based  on  the Westminster  model.   And  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that we should have  chosen\r\n\r\nthat,  that  is, that we wanted a parliamentary democracy  where\r\n\r\nthe  Government will be subject to Parliament, representing  the\r\n\r\nwill  of  the people.  I said it is not surprising because  that\r\n\r\nsystem  of  government was accepted by the people of the  United\r\n\r\nStates  when they decided to break away from the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand become a nation by themselves, only that they carried it  to\r\n\r\nmore  rigid  divisions  of power and it  was  also  accepted  by\r\n\r\ncountries which were once under British rule and then broke away\r\n\r\nfrom  British  rule.   And Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru,  the  first\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of  India,  and who  was  a  great,  passionate\r\n\r\nbeliever in parliamentary democracy, chose that as the model for\r\n\r\nIndia.   May I say, it was not just Jawaharlal Nehru,  even  our\r\n\r\npresent  Senior  Minister  who was a  member  of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommission  to  London,  chose for  Singapore,  along  with  the\r\n\r\nothers,  this parliamentary system of government.   It  was  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  he  should  choose  that,  having  come   from\r\n\r\nCambridge and studied DICEY and the rule of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this system of government, it is Parliament that, as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the people, should have  control  over  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It  should  act not only  as  offering  advice  on\r\n\r\nlegislation, law and other matters, but first and foremost, as a\r\n\r\ncheck  on  executive power.  That was the foremost intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  people who evolved Parliament into what it is today in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom and other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I am posing today, and which I would ask the\r\n\r\nMembers to answer honestly, is: is this Parliament, now 50 years\r\n\r\ndown  the  road, after we accepted the parliamentary  system  of\r\n\r\ngovernment,  performing such a role, and if  not,  why  not?   I\r\n\r\npropose in the course\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  my  speech to give the answers as to why this House  is  not\r\n\r\nperforming  the  role  that  it  should  be  performing   in   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democratic  form of government  and  suggest  the\r\n\r\nremedy for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was envisaged by those who were setting out on the nationhood\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore that Parliament should, as I said, be the supreme\r\n\r\nbody  and  that the Government be subject to it.  Of  course,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  acknowledge that in the years before  1959,  when  the\r\n\r\npresent  Senior Minister was in the opposition, the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,  even though it had limited powers, was trying  to  do\r\n\r\njust  that,  to  act as a check on the Government  then.   Those\r\n\r\nMembers  who have read the debates would have seen that  Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nwasted  no time, although again his Opposition Members were  not\r\n\r\nvery  large, in trying to bring the Government to check, probing\r\n\r\nand  seeking answers to questions.  He then showed himself as  a\r\n\r\nfirm  believer  in parliamentary democracy.  But for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthis fervour somewhat began to cool off after the PAP took power\r\n\r\nin  1959, though from the years 1963 to 1965, when we were  part\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  and Mr Lee was attending the Malaysian Parliament,\r\n\r\nthere  he  again found his fervour and spoke at length, whenever\r\n\r\nit was possible, on the need for parliamentary democracy and the\r\n\r\ngovernment being subject to parliamentary control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after we came out of Malaysia and perhaps before that,\r\n\r\nParliament  began on the road of not being able to exercise  its\r\n\r\nrole  which  was intended for it.  This became very marked  when\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis who were still in the Assembly after  they\r\n\r\nhad  broken away from the People's Action Party and were sitting\r\n\r\nin  the  opposition benches, decided, for some reason or  other,\r\n\r\nthat  they would take their battle to the streets, and would  no\r\n\r\nlonger  attend the sittings of the Assembly.  That, may  I  say,\r\n\r\nand I have said it, was a wrong move and it was a disservice  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore when they left the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when we came out of Malaysia, we found ourselves with a\r\n\r\nParliament  totally  composed of One-Party Members,  the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty Members, and that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinued  until  1981  when there was  one  other  Member  from\r\n\r\nanother party in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, 50 years down the road, we still have not reached\r\n\r\nanywhere  near the stage of performing the role that  Parliament\r\n\r\nwas intended.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

But the\r\n\r\npoint  is that by a systematic and deliberate move, which  I  am\r\n\r\ngoing to spell out, the libel suits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be one of these measures.  That is why I am going to  ask\r\n\r\nfor an amendment to the defamation laws.  But I am saying, by  a\r\n\r\nsystematic  and  deliberate  move, the  Government  has  so  far\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in  preventing  the  election  into  Parliament   of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  and that is what I am  talking  about  this\r\n\r\nevening,  and  that is why I am asking for an amendment  to  the\r\n\r\ndefamation  laws in accordance with the spirit and  Articles  of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.  Do I make myself clear, Mr Deputy Speaker?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Come to the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, thank you. As I said, by a deliberate\r\n\r\nand  systematic  course of action, they kept Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nout.   At  first,  it  was  the use  of  ISA,  and  making  life\r\n\r\ninconvenient  for  those who aspired to enter  Parliament.   But\r\n\r\nnow, over the last few years, we see an increasing trend to keep\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members out by the use of the libel  law  and  which\r\n\r\ndeters very effectively, may I say, persons who aspire to  enter\r\n\r\nParliament  to serve their country, but think that  their  place\r\n\r\nshould  really  be in the Opposition, and not in the  Government\r\n\r\nparty.  But they are deterred by the defamation actions.   I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  ask whether these defamation actions accord with  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of the Articles in the Constitution and with the law  as\r\n\r\nit is being developed in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want me to move on, I will. But the quintessence of a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy,  may  I  say,  is  the   presence   in\r\n\r\nParliament  of  a  sufficient body of  members  to  perform  the\r\n\r\nprimary role of Parliament as a check on the Executive.  So  the\r\n\r\npoint  I  am  making is that if you really believe  in  a  truly\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society,  then you should  put  no  impediments,  no\r\n\r\nblocks,  on Parliament playing the role that it was intended  to\r\n\r\nplay.  It can only play that role if you have a sufficient  body\r\n\r\nof  Opposition Members.  They can only enter Parliament  through\r\n\r\nelections and there is no substitute for allowing the electorate\r\n\r\nto  elect the Opposition Members into Parliament.  With  respect\r\n\r\nto  the  Nominated Members, they are no substitute.   Parliament\r\n\r\nshould have the Opposition Members in Parliament elected by  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  For this, there is a basic right\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the  part of voters to receive information on issues in  the\r\n\r\nelections  and  corresponding  right  on  candidates  to  impart\r\n\r\ninformation.  Therefore, free speech becomes the life  blood  in\r\n\r\nelections for voters to make their choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 14, Part IV\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution, enshrines what are the  essentials  of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society  and which Singapore should  have.   Article\r\n\r\n14(1)  of the Constitution  grants every citizen the freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression and assembly.    Article 14(2)(a), however, seeks  to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  restriction  on this right  where  it  is  considered\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It  says,  \"Parliament may by  law  impose  .  such\r\n\r\nrestrictions  as it considers necessary.\"  Article  162  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution expressly mandates the courts, Parliament  and  all\r\n\r\nother  law-making  bodies  to construe  any  existing  law  with\r\n\r\nmodifications,  adaptations, qualifications  and  exceptions  to\r\n\r\nbring  them into conformity with the Constitution.  So there  is\r\n\r\nclear  mandate in the Constitution that there should be  no  law\r\n\r\nwhich  unnecessarily, and that is important, puts an  impediment\r\n\r\non the development of a truly democratic society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate how the defamation laws have been applied by\r\n\r\nthe  courts, and I am not here to criticise the decisions of the\r\n\r\ncourts,  but  I  am here to ask whether we should  now  make  an\r\n\r\namendment to the defamation law to bring it into accord with the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   I will illustrate this by three cases  of  libel\r\n\r\nsuits that were brought, and they are of very recent origins, so\r\n\r\nI expect Members must be more than aware of these suits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was a suit brought in 1989 and it arose over\r\n\r\nquestions asked about the death of a Minister.  Members will, of\r\n\r\ncourse, recall that the former Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nof whom Mr Lee, when I was in this House, declared, \"Where can I\r\n\r\nfind  another Mr Teh Cheang Wan.\"  He was found dead in bed  one\r\n\r\nmorning  and  the  cause  of death was  an  overdose  of  amytal\r\n\r\ntablets.   It  was then revealed that he was under investigation\r\n\r\nfor corruption.  So that was immediately a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmatter  of great public interest.  There is no question that  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  matter  of  great  public  interest.   Our  party  asked\r\n\r\nquestions saying there should be a full investigation into  this\r\n\r\ndeath  and  how  he came by his death.  We asked  two  questions\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was revealed that he had written to the then  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the present Senior Minister, a letter the day  before\r\n\r\nhe  died.   It was not revealed whether there was any  reply  to\r\n\r\nthat  letter.  So we asked whether there was any reply given  to\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was: how did he get these amytal tablets?\r\n\r\nBecause   amytal tablets, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are probably\r\n\r\naware,  are  on the Poisons List.  Their stocks and distribution\r\n\r\nare  controlled,  and should be controlled very  strictly,  with\r\n\r\nproper  records kept.  When we asked for questions  through  the\r\n\r\nparty, there was no answer.  But when I asked the same questions\r\n\r\nin  an  election in 1988, I was served with a writ.  I  do  want\r\n\r\nMembers  to  understand this clearly that this  arose  over  two\r\n\r\nquestions  asked, questions which were of great public interest.\r\n\r\nIn  any other country, the press and public would be in full cry\r\n\r\nwanting  to know the answers to several questions.   But  I  was\r\n\r\ntaken to court as having libelled the then Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in court, we got an answer from him that he did\r\n\r\nnot reply to that letter.  As someone observed to me, \"Well, you\r\n\r\nhad to pay $260,000 for an answer to a question. Was that not  a\r\n\r\nbit expensive?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we should ask is: should we permit actions\r\n\r\nlike this, or should we not amend the law to prevent actions  of\r\n\r\nthis nature where the action arises over legitimate questions of\r\n\r\npublic interest asked of Ministers and public officials?  It  is\r\n\r\nvery important that we grasp this because if Ministers are going\r\n\r\nto  serve  a  writ  on any member of the public  or  any  member\r\n\r\naspiring  to  come into Parliament because he asks questions  of\r\n\r\npublic  interest and then scare him into coming into Parliament,\r\n\r\nwe are never going to get a Parliament to play its role.  We are\r\n\r\nnot  going to get the Opposition Members coming into Parliament.\r\n\r\nSo that was one case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the more recent cases brought after the last\r\n\r\nelections or just towards the tail end of the elections.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot have to repeat or give a lot of information to Members about\r\n\r\nhow  these libel suits came about.  But, of course, Members will\r\n\r\nrecall that it was revealed publicly that a Cabinet decision had\r\n\r\nbeen  taken to keep Mr Tang Liang Hong out of Parliament.   That\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet  had  decided that he should not  be  allowed  into\r\n\r\nParliament.  Of course, that meant that the whole team could not\r\n\r\ncome in.  I could not come in either because he was part of  the\r\n\r\nteam.   In  pursuance of that, they decided,  and  this  is  all\r\n\r\npublic,  that they would expose him as a Chinese chauvinist  and\r\n\r\nan  anti-Christian.  He had not said anything but  they  decided\r\n\r\nthat  they would expose him as a Chinese chauvinist and an anti-Christian so that he would not enter into Parliament, and  along\r\n\r\nwith   him,  me  and  the  others  who  were  standing  in  this\r\n\r\nconstituency.  And Mr Tang said he was not a Chinese chauvinist,\r\n\r\nhe was not anti-Christian, because he could not keep silent when\r\n\r\nhe  was  accused of these things, and so he spoke to the  press,\r\n\r\nand he said, \"I am not.\"  He said, \"They are telling lies.\"  But\r\n\r\nhe could have said they were not telling the truth.  There is no\r\n\r\ntruth in what they say.  And for that, it was decided that libel\r\n\r\nsuits should be issued against him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members can see how oppressively libel suits are\r\n\r\nbeing  used in Singapore.  Here is a man who is accused of being\r\n\r\na  Chinese  chauvinist,  being  anti-Christian,  because  it  is\r\n\r\nthought  that he should not be in this House.  And  libel  suits\r\n\r\nare issued against him when he denies it, says that they are not\r\n\r\ntelling  the  truth  when they accuse him  of  being  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nchauvinist and anti-Christian.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were other suits against him. One was that\r\n\r\nbecause  he said in Kuala Lumpur when he was informed  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had said that he would not be arrested under  the\r\n\r\nISA,  \"Should I trust him?\" or something.  He was again  slapped\r\n\r\nwith a libel suit.  Again, the question that Members should  ask\r\n\r\nis:  was  a libel suit necessary in these circumstances?   There\r\n\r\nwas  no  statement,  I repeat, made either by  me  in  the  1988\r\n\r\nstatement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  elections  or Mr Tang Liang Hong accusing  anyone,  any\r\n\r\nMinister,  of corruption or of committing criminal offences.   I\r\n\r\nwas  asking questions of public interest and Mr Tang Liang  Hong\r\n\r\nwas  seeking  to  deny  allegations made  against  him.   Is  it\r\n\r\njustifiable  that he should then be the subject, as  I  was  the\r\n\r\nsubject,  of  libel suits, simply to frighten - I am  saying  in\r\n\r\nthis House - others who may aspire to come into Parliament?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then following that was the Prime Minister's suit against\r\n\r\nme.  And, again, I do not have to remind Members - I am sure  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  fresh in their memories - that the words over which  I\r\n\r\nwas sued for libel were to give a statement of fact that Mr Tang\r\n\r\nLiang  Hong  had made reports to the Police, as he had  said  he\r\n\r\nwould.  And his report to the Police, if you care to look it up,\r\n\r\nwas  simply  denying  the allegations, and  to  ask  for  Police\r\n\r\nprotection.   And I was slapped with suits.  Just as  he,  there\r\n\r\nwere  about  eight  or nine suits against him  (I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nprobably more), but I had eight suits against me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this how we are going to keep Opposition Members out of\r\n\r\nParliament?   The question we have to ask, and I keep  repeating\r\n\r\nthis:  should  we allow in this country these libel  actions  to\r\n\r\ncontinue?   Or  should we say enough is enough now,  we  want  a\r\n\r\nsociety  that is progressive, and we can only become progressive\r\n\r\nif  Parliament  is allowed to play its role as a  check  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   And if that will not be possible,  we  will  never\r\n\r\nbecome  a  progressive  society, we will never  become  an  open\r\n\r\nsociety,  so long as these impediments are in place,  preventing\r\n\r\ncandidates  from speaking their mind openly and  freely  at  the\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating - let me make it very clear - a licence for\r\n\r\ncandidates  to  defame Ministers or others in  public  life,  to\r\n\r\naccuse them falsely of anything.  But as I have tried to show in\r\n\r\nthese  three actions, there was nothing of that sort.   And  yet\r\n\r\nthe  actions  were  brought.   The Courts  have  held  that  the\r\n\r\nmeanings were that we were defaming them.  But, as I said, I  am\r\n\r\nnot  here to criticise the decision of the Courts.  But if  that\r\n\r\nis  how it is going to be interpreted, then it is time we looked\r\n\r\nat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  law of defamation to see whether actions like these  should\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to be brought in the Courts in Singapore,  but  that\r\n\r\ncandidates  should have, as was intended by the framers  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, the uninhibited basic right to give information to\r\n\r\nthe voters and to ask questions that are necessary and that will\r\n\r\nhelp  to guide the voters in the choice of who they should  send\r\n\r\ninto Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps I will deal at length with the\r\n\r\nlaws  in the other countries in my reply, but I wish to say this\r\n\r\nnow,  so  that  whoever is replying can consider this.   Article\r\n\r\n14(2)(a)  allows  Parliament to make  such  laws  as  Parliament\r\n\r\nconsiders  it necessary to impose restrictions on the  right  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  granted  under Article 14(1).  The question  is,  would\r\n\r\nthese laws be necessary?  There is also the question of which is\r\n\r\nthe  greater  public  interest - the asking  of  questions,  the\r\n\r\nattempt  to  deny  allegations made against you  or  is  it  the\r\n\r\nsupposed  protection  of  the reputation  of  public  officials?\r\n\r\nWhich is of greater public interest?  And I am sure, if you  ask\r\n\r\nany Parliamentarian, he would say the greater public interest is\r\n\r\nthat questions should be asked and information given honestly to\r\n\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first decision which made an inroad to cut on this attempt\r\n\r\nto  shut  members of the public from questioning or  criticising\r\n\r\nthe  conduct of public officials was way back in the 1940s  when\r\n\r\nthe US Supreme Court decided in the case of Sullivan and the New\r\n\r\nYork  Times  that  public officials cannot  maintain  an  action\r\n\r\nagainst  any  criticism of them even if the facts  were  wrongly\r\n\r\nstated,  unless  the public officials were  able  to  show  that\r\n\r\nwhoever made that criticism had actual knowledge that the  facts\r\n\r\nwere false and so were acting maliciously.  Knowing something to\r\n\r\nbe false and stating it.  That was a revolutionary change in the\r\n\r\nlaw.   It stopped public officials from bringing actions because\r\n\r\nof criticism of the officials concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even at the beginning of this century, a minority view in a\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court (I think it goes back to 1908), it  was  a  State\r\n\r\nSupreme Court, held that the greater right was the right to  ask\r\n\r\nquestions and that libel actions should not be entertained where\r\n\r\na  citizen seeks to criticise, even wrongly on wrong facts,  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  public officials.  Sullivan's case was followed  by\r\n\r\nthe  European Court of Human Rights in the case of a  journalist\r\n\r\nwho  wrote  an  article  criticising  the  Austrian  Chancellor,\r\n\r\naccusing   him  of  very  grave  offences,  of  harbouring   and\r\n\r\nprotecting  Nazis during the Nazi regime.  And he was  convicted\r\n\r\nin  an  action brought for criminal defamation.  He took up  his\r\n\r\ncase  to the European Court of Human Rights. Fortunately, Europe\r\n\r\nhas  thought  fit  to have a court of human rights  which  would\r\n\r\nentertain  petitions of this nature.  I shall read the provision\r\n\r\nin   the  European  Charter,  which  I  say  corresponds  almost\r\n\r\nidentically  with  our  Article 14.  The  Court  held  that  the\r\n\r\nconviction  was an unnecessary interference with the liberty  of\r\n\r\nthis journalist to write on a matter of public interest and they\r\n\r\nset aside the conviction and ordered compensation to be paid  to\r\n\r\nthe  journalist for all the suffering he had suffered.  They had\r\n\r\nno  doubt  of  what was the greater right in a truly  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a case in England brought by a County Council\r\n\r\nagainst  a newspaper which had criticised, not public officials,\r\n\r\nI  must point out the difference, but the Council itself, and  I\r\n\r\nshall read some of the passages in the judgement in my reply but\r\n\r\ntime does not permit me to read them now.  It was held that in a\r\n\r\ntruly democratic society, this freedom is important, the freedom\r\n\r\nto  criticise and comment on public officials, and the action by\r\n\r\nthe  County Council was thrown out.  It went up to the House  of\r\n\r\nLords.  The County Council took it up to the House of Lords  who\r\n\r\ndismissed  the  appeal, again, declaring what had  already  been\r\n\r\nsaid  about  the vital importance and role in a truly democratic\r\n\r\nsociety for citizens to comment on and criticise the conduct  of\r\n\r\npublic officials and to ask questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have these developments in the law in other countries.\r\n\r\nThis  development of the law is also taking place  in  Australia\r\n\r\nwhere  the High Court of Australia has ruled that it is  of  the\r\n\r\nutmost  importance that the right of citizens to  criticise  and\r\n\r\ncomment on the conduct of public officials should not be  curbed\r\n\r\nin any way unless it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three cases that I have illustrated, I hope, will\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that  the actions were totally unnecessary  because\r\n\r\nthere  was no question of the Ministers being accused of  crimes\r\n\r\nor  misconduct  in their lives.  These actions  arose  over  the\r\n\r\nexercise of our rights as citizens to ask questions and, in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Mr Tang Liang Hong, to deny accusations which were made\r\n\r\nagainst  him.   Here  is  a  man who was  seeking  elections  to\r\n\r\nParliament along with me.  If he did not deny it, and if he  did\r\n\r\nnot  say  it  was not the truth, what would the electorate  say?\r\n\r\nThose  who  had to make up their minds would say,  \"I  see.   He\r\n\r\nadmits that he is a Chinese chauvinist.  He admits he is an anti-Christian.  So we better not vote him in.\"  So does he not  have\r\n\r\na  right  to deny that he is a Chinese chauvinist and  an  anti-Christian?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that he is a Chinese chauvinist, and I said\r\n\r\nthat  several times during the elections, neither is he an anti-Christian.  His daughter is a Christian.  And as we said, it  is\r\n\r\nquite  inexplicable that if he is an anti-Christian,  he  should\r\n\r\ndecide to team up with me who is a Christian, and he knew  that.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only him who suffered, it was his wife of whom  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  some  publicity the week before.  Her  passport  was\r\n\r\nimpounded illegally.  She was prevented from leaving Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on but probably I am nearing the time I am allowed to\r\n\r\nspeak.  But what we have to ask is, as Mr Lee was asking when he\r\n\r\nwas  in the Opposition, do we believe in democracy or do we not?\r\n\r\nHe  was asking that question.  He said that it was simple.  \"You\r\n\r\nanswer that\", he said.  Do we believe in democracy or do we not?\r\n\r\nIf we do believe in democracy, then there is no answer except to\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  should allow the practice of  democracy  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  which means the right in every citizen to ask honestly,\r\n\r\nwithout any malice,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany questions of public officials in their conduct and discharge\r\n\r\nof  public  functions.   If,  however,  we  do  not  believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and we do not want a democratic society in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not want a Parliamentary system of government which  can\r\n\r\nonly  function with an adequate number of Opposition Members  in\r\n\r\nParliament,  not  Nominated Members, but Opposition  Members  in\r\n\r\nParliament, then let us tell the world we do not want  democracy\r\n\r\nin  this  country.  We do not want Parliamentary democracy.   We\r\n\r\nare  quite  happy with our own autocracy.  So then  we  will  be\r\n\r\nhonest with ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the contrary, we hear protestations from Ministers that\r\n\r\nwe  are a democratic country, that we are an open society.   The\r\n\r\nquestions I asked in 1988, may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in\r\n\r\nreply  to  Mr Lee's statement then that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nwas  an open Government accountable to the people.  And I  posed\r\n\r\nseveral   questions  and  these  questions  were   among   those\r\n\r\nquestions:  were you open and accountable to the people in those\r\n\r\nsituations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for us who have the mandate under the Constitution to see\r\n\r\nthat  the  spirit of the Constitution is preserved and enforced.\r\n\r\nWe  take  the  oath when we come into this House  that  we  will\r\n\r\ndefend, preserve and protect the Constitution.  If we are to  be\r\n\r\ntrue  to  that oath, then we have got to take steps to see  that\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution is not in any way hindered or impeded by  laws\r\n\r\nor  administrative  action, but that  the  full  spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution be given effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting what amendments\r\n\r\nshould  be  made.   A Nominated Member queried  why  we  need  a\r\n\r\nCommission.  I thought it would be obvious.  I am not suggesting\r\n\r\nwhat amendments should be made.  I am suggesting that we appoint\r\n\r\na Commission now to inquire into whether it is time for us, as a\r\n\r\nsociety,  to  look at the way the defamation law is applied  and\r\n\r\nwhether  it should be continued to be applied as it  is  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of the utmost importance, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that we\r\n\r\nshould take steps now.  We were debating the whole of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  week  on  competitiveness and about going  into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  If we are to go into the 21st century, we have got  to\r\n\r\ngo in as a progressive society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Your time is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in the earlier motion\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Jeyaretnam referred to, I was concerned about the rules\r\n\r\nof  preventive  detention.  But I did not  support  that  motion\r\n\r\nbecause I felt that there were smaller concerns that might limit\r\n\r\nfree speech in our society.  I turn then to this motion to think\r\n\r\nwhether our defamation laws are one of those concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking today, I must say that while some sectors of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  sympathy  for Mr  J.B.  Jeyaretnam  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious suits that he has fought and lost, I would wish to  make\r\n\r\nmy  remarks less personal and avoid the cases he has referred to\r\n\r\nwhich  have  already been decided by the courts and which  stand\r\n\r\ntoday as the law in Singapore as decided by our highest courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to four questions. The first is the\r\n\r\nimportance of free speech.  The second is whether this important\r\n\r\nfree speech needs to be balanced in some way.  The third is what\r\n\r\nis  that right balance.  And the fourth is how do we change  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   Is a Commission, as proposed by the motion, the best  way\r\n\r\nto go about it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, the importance of free speech. I have\r\n\r\nserved  this  year, and I am still serving, as a member  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Committee.  In this context, I co-chair a committee\r\n\r\nconcerning the search for consensus and consultation on one hand\r\n\r\nagainst  decisiveness and quick action on  the  other.   In  our\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  many  people,  we  have  emphasised  that,   for\r\n\r\nconsultation to happen in Singapore, there must be free  speech,\r\n\r\nthere must also be a sense of participation and there must be  a\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  our  national interests and  the  harmony  that\r\n\r\nunderpins our society.  Only when we accept on one hand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  speak  and,  on the  other,  recognise  the  due\r\n\r\nlimitations  to  those who speak.  This helps make  consultation\r\n\r\nwork, and Singapore is a better place rather than a more fragile\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the law of defamation concerns me because it is\r\n\r\nnot  about all forms of speech.  Defamation, as any law  student\r\n\r\nwill tell you, is about false statements.  If you are saying the\r\n\r\ntruth, you cannot be found guilty of defamation.  You must first\r\n\r\nbe  saying  something that is false.  There are  other  elements\r\n\r\nsuch  as,  secondly,  that  false  statement  then  injures  the\r\n\r\nreputation  of  the  person you refer to.   That  is  the  first\r\n\r\ndistinction  I want to make about the broader question  of  free\r\n\r\nspeech and the narrower question on defamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we value free speech, should we value it so much that\r\n\r\nwe  want to protect false statements that harm reputation?  This\r\n\r\nquestion  is an important one because it leads me to my  second,\r\n\r\nthe  question  of balance.  Having said that free speech  has  a\r\n\r\nvalue and is recognised in the Constitution under Article 14, we\r\n\r\nhave  to recognise that there are concerns that the politicians,\r\n\r\nor  those who would be politicians, would have their reputations\r\n\r\ninjured falsely, or ordinary citizens would.  This might lead to\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  good  people to volunteer themselves  for  public\r\n\r\noffice  and  to have their reputation scrutinised  and  publicly\r\n\r\ncriticised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exception of question of defamation is also in the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  So, if on one hand, the freedom of speech  is  in\r\n\r\nthe Constitution, so is the exception of defamation, and we have\r\n\r\nto recognise that that is the substance of our Constitution.  We\r\n\r\ncannot on one hand inflate the value of free speech, and pretend\r\n\r\nthe  exception does not exist in our Constitution.  But I  still\r\n\r\nthink  that  there  is  room  to  recognise  that  the  law   of\r\n\r\ndefamation, as it exists today, can have unintended consequences\r\n\r\nthat  it  can chill free speech.  It can prevent some  good  and\r\n\r\nhonest citizens from speaking up in case they make a false slip.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  want  to  emphasise \"in case\" because we recognise  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  as a generic quality, are somewhat  \"kiasu\",  too\r\n\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also have to think about the law of defamation\r\n\r\nthat  exists  and  the unintended consequences  because  of  two\r\n\r\nthings.  The first is the privilege that all of us in this House\r\n\r\nenjoy  as Members.  In this House, we are free from civil suits,\r\n\r\nincluding  suits for defamation.  Why do we enjoy this  freedom?\r\n\r\nIt is because this House should have the freest debate possible.\r\n\r\nWe  may  be brought up for parliamentary processes, but  we  are\r\n\r\nfree from civil action while we speak in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason I can think of to re-look at defamation\r\n\r\nlaw  at  this point in time is the example set by our own  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr Goh Chok Tong.  In the recent suit with the  NCMP,\r\n\r\nMr Jeyaretnam, I, and I think, many Singaporeans, were heartened\r\n\r\nby  PM  Goh's offer to forgo a certain amount of damages  if  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam was to publicly accept the judgment of the  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal  and  to  apologise in certain terms  set  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  lawyers.  This offer did not come to  pass  but  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's  offer  itself  makes  it  clear  that  he  is\r\n\r\ncognizant of an unintended consequence that might otherwise have\r\n\r\ncome  to  pass.  That, in the legitimate interest of  protecting\r\n\r\nhis  reputation, he might unintentionally knock out a Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament, an NCMP, which he said was not his intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then to the next question. Having said that\r\n\r\nthere is a reason for balance, what is the right balance?  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to guess what Mr Jeyaretnam will bring up as examples.\r\n\r\nLet me just quickly sketch two extreme positions and some places\r\n\r\nin  between.  The two extreme positions, as I see them, is first\r\n\r\nthe  USA,  and second, ours.  I mean there are positions  beyond\r\n\r\nours,  but for the spectrum I wish to sketch, I will take  these\r\n\r\ntwo ends.  In America, as regards politicians, you cannot defame\r\n\r\nthem,  even  if  you  are completely and utterly  false  without\r\n\r\nbasis,  only if you can prove actual malice, that is, out  of  a\r\n\r\nvendetta, a hate, a personal vindictiveness, you have said  what\r\n\r\nyou know to be false, and obviously, this is very hard to prove.\r\n\r\nSo, the American political figures live with all sorts of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nslander.  In Singapore, at this end of the spectrum, there is no\r\n\r\ndifference between politicians and private individuals.  Whether\r\n\r\nyou  are  running  for office or whether you choose  to  lead  a\r\n\r\nquiet, private life, the rule is the same for you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to see therefore when we think about law reform,\r\n\r\nthat  there  can be places in between these two positions.   But\r\n\r\neven  if we choose to reform, we need not open up the box to  be\r\n\r\nexactly like America.  That may be fine for Americans but it may\r\n\r\nnot suit our temper and tenor of our society.  This position  in\r\n\r\nbetween can try to make a distinction where a false statement is\r\n\r\nmade recklessly, or a false statement is made negligently, or  a\r\n\r\nfalse  statement  is made out of some sincere belief  or  honest\r\n\r\nmistake.   Let  me quickly sketch the differences between  these\r\n\r\nthree intermediate positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Recklessly\" might mean I heard some rumour about Mr X and I\r\n\r\njust  simply blurt it out publicly.  I make no attempt  to  find\r\n\r\nout  whether it is true.  Second, negligently, I heard the  same\r\n\r\nrumour.   Perhaps  I  am  a more careful  man,  I  call  up  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  or somebody who is supposed to be the authority,  his\r\n\r\nboss,  his  subordinate, and I check.  But  somehow,  that  same\r\n\r\nmistake  is  duplicated.  It is not cured.  I make my  statement\r\n\r\nand  fail  to check properly; I make some checks, but I  do  not\r\n\r\ncheck  properly, and I am negligent.  The third: sincere  belief\r\n\r\nor honest mistake is when I have been thorough in my checking, I\r\n\r\nhave  already tried exhaustively to check out whether what I  am\r\n\r\nsaying is true or not true, and yet it is still possible to make\r\n\r\na mistake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we are talking here about false statements in\r\n\r\ndefamation that lower someone's reputation in the public eye.  I\r\n\r\nmyself will stand for the idea that if there is malice, or if it\r\n\r\nis  reckless or negligent, the value of free speech  should  not\r\n\r\ncover such sins.  We should not excuse such forms of defamation.\r\n\r\nThat  leaves me only with the concern about honest mistakes  and\r\n\r\nsincerely held beliefs.  The law of defamation, as it stands  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  recognises various defences, one  of  which  is  the\r\n\r\ndefence of fair comment.  This has to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  a question of opinion, of course, rather than a statement of\r\n\r\nfact.   It is of course possible to add other defences, such  as\r\n\r\nhonest  mistake  and  it is possible to  twin  this  with  other\r\n\r\nquestions  and limits, such as to limit this extent  of  greater\r\n\r\nfreedom  to times of political competition in elections,  or  to\r\n\r\nlimit  to politicians or those who run for public office because\r\n\r\nthey  put themselves up for public choice and the public  should\r\n\r\nhave  a  right to know.  We could also cap damages to a sizeable\r\n\r\namount,  an  amount  that  has  bite,  but  one  that  will  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  ruin  a  person for a  single  mistake.   We  could\r\n\r\ninstitute a formal role to the question of apology.  Many of you\r\n\r\nknow  that  when an apology is given honestly and sincerely  and\r\n\r\naccepted, this defamatory mistake can be forgiven.  However,  as\r\n\r\nit  stands, this is a matter of negotiation between the  wronged\r\n\r\nparty  and  the person who has wronged them.  It is possible  to\r\n\r\nmake this matter of public process in the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many possibilities of which I have quickly\r\n\r\nsketched my own inclinations.  But the motion today is not about\r\n\r\nany  particular  choice  and I do not want  to  over-argue  this\r\n\r\npoint.   I  just  want to demonstrate that if  a  Commission  is\r\n\r\ncalled for, there is room to work on the law, to refine the law,\r\n\r\nfinding a new balance without abandoning certain cornerstones of\r\n\r\nour  belief, such as democracy, and on the other hand, the  need\r\n\r\nto defend reputations which are falsely accused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point then is the question of institutions.\r\n\r\nCourts  themselves  have  regulated  defamation.   There  is   a\r\n\r\nDefamation  Act  of  course passed by  this  Parliament  or  its\r\n\r\npredecessors, but that Act does not really provide the  body  of\r\n\r\ndefamation  law.  It provides rather some narrow  exceptions  to\r\n\r\nit.   The  body  of defamation law is carried over by  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom   other  precedents  in  England  particularly,  and   more\r\n\r\nrecently, our own precedent, as one case builds on another.  The\r\n\r\ncourts  themselves, I believe, are always the  first  person  to\r\n\r\nturn to, to change their own mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, I have previously spoken and cautioned against\r\n\r\nover-anxiety of legislation to cure one or two judgments, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  shifted my position.  That is still my view that  the\r\n\r\ncourts  themselves  should be the primary focus  when  we  think\r\n\r\nabout  an evolutionary change in law.  How else can the  law  be\r\n\r\nchanged?   Normally,  when  there is  a  call  for  reform,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will take it up and the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\nwill  do  the work, call in together the various ministries  and\r\n\r\nother agencies that are concerned or involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion standing in the NCMP's name is different from\r\n\r\nthis.  It calls for a Commission of Inquiry.  I am not sure this\r\n\r\nis  at all the right institution. It is certainly different from\r\n\r\nwhat has been done before and I think it is quite different from\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  most Commissions of Inquiry  to  investigate  a\r\n\r\ncertain,  fixed  and quite narrow question.  But  when  I  think\r\n\r\nthrough  the  motion  and  whether I should  support  it,  I  am\r\n\r\nreminded  that  in  one of the sittings in  this  House  that  I\r\n\r\nattended, the NCMP said in a rather sarcastic tone that  he  was\r\n\r\nnot  at  all  surprised  that  one of  the  NMPs  supported  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I then shared my view of the function of NMPs  with\r\n\r\nhim  and  the  House.   NMPs, to my mind, are  neither  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment nor against it, neither are we for the opposition nor\r\n\r\nagainst them.  I try to look at the law and policies in  a  non-partisan  light to give what inputs we can, and I have tried  to\r\n\r\ndo this today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Mr Jeyaretnam's personal remarks and the cases that he\r\n\r\nhas  brought  up  concerning himself or  his  fellow  opposition\r\n\r\ncandidates, I do believe, for the reasons I have given, the  law\r\n\r\ncould  stand  the  question of reform.  When  we  look  at  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of reform, we may not in the end decide we do  need  a\r\n\r\nreform.   If we do decide on a reform, we do not need to  decide\r\n\r\nthat it is American or some other western form.  We can find our\r\n\r\nown way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hope and with this reservation also about the\r\n\r\ninstitution, about some of the arguments that the NCMP has  made\r\n\r\nfor  the  law and for the value of freedom of speech, I  support\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>7.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\npersonally agree with the call to review the Defamation Act  but\r\n\r\ncertainly not the formation of a commission.  I do not  wish  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the  personal experiences of Mr  J.  B.  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nexcept  to say that the law must apply if defamation is  proven.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is another completely different matter and outside  the\r\n\r\npresent  law  if the Prime Minister offers him avenues  to  help\r\n\r\nlessen the burden and consequences brought about by the decision\r\n\r\nof  the  court.  Personally, I am encouraged by PM's gesture  of\r\n\r\ntolerance and forgiveness.  But I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  the  wider  implication  of  the  Defamation  Act.\r\n\r\nArticle  14 of the Constitution clearly guarantees every citizen\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  freedom  of  speech and  expression.   But  this\r\n\r\ncertainly  does  not  mean the right to defame.   We  can  speak\r\n\r\nfreely, but certainly no one can defame freely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I would like to highlight is that the\r\n\r\nDefamation  Act  is  not  necessarily for  politicians  only  or\r\n\r\npolitical parties.  It is available for any citizen, corporation\r\n\r\nor  organisation.  The law of defamation essentially attempts to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance between the public's freedom of speech and  the\r\n\r\nindividual's right to the protection of his good name, and  that\r\n\r\ncertainly  must  be  a  very sensitive and important  matter  of\r\n\r\nsomebody  who  holds  a  high public  position  like  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Unfortunately, in Singapore, people tend to associate\r\n\r\ndefamation laws with political figures and politics, because  of\r\n\r\nthe  series  of legal suits involving politicians and  the  high\r\n\r\nprofile  publicity given to such suits.  My concern is  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  brought  about, like what my colleague, Mr  Simon  Tay  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,   the  unintended  consequences  and  some   negative\r\n\r\nimplications on civil society.  Because of that, some people are\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  speak  up  and comment  on  controversial  public\r\n\r\npolicies  or on public office holders because of the  fear  that\r\n\r\nthey may be subjected to legal suits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, most people have no problem giving their views to\r\n\r\nlocal newspapers because they feel that the local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npress  will  exercise  care and caution  not  to  defame  public\r\n\r\nofficials.   But this is not in the case of foreign publications\r\n\r\nor  journalists  because  of  their  past  experience  of  being\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  defamation  suits themselves.   Quite  frequently,\r\n\r\nforeign  journalists  have  problems getting  enough  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  willing  to express their views.    \"No  comment\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Don't  quote  me\"  are  common  responses.   As  such,  we  may\r\n\r\nunnecessarily be sending a wrong signal to Singaporeans who  are\r\n\r\nafraid to speak up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be fair, Sir, a lot depends on the person himself to\r\n\r\nexercise  caution  when commenting on personalities  and  public\r\n\r\npolicies.  While it is quite easy to determine whether a  person\r\n\r\nmaking  defamatory statements has been malicious or reckless  by\r\n\r\nexposing the person to hatred, contempt or ridicule which, in my\r\n\r\nview, is what the Act is intended for, it is quite difficult  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  intent  and impact of other less damaging  statements\r\n\r\nwhich may arise out of mistakes or negligence or, at the spur of\r\n\r\nthe  moment, reliance on wrong source of information.  I do  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily condone this.  But perhaps in view of that,  it  may\r\n\r\nbe  useful to consider amending the present legislation to  give\r\n\r\nmore  weightage to apology in mitigation factors or in assessing\r\n\r\ndamages.   Perhaps  one  suggestion is to consider  limiting  or\r\n\r\nspecifying the quantum awarded in a different type of defamation\r\n\r\ncases,  especially  parties who have relied on  the  process  of\r\n\r\nmediation   or  in  settlement  are  prepared  to  make   public\r\n\r\napologies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, political leaders who have been defamed,\r\n\r\nquite  rightly  have  taken  strong  actions  to  protect  their\r\n\r\nreputation.  Although monetary compensations were given,  as  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases  quite  large sums, these do  not  seem  to  be  the\r\n\r\nobjective of those seeking remedies, as charities have been  the\r\n\r\nmain   beneficiaries  of  such  monetary  awards.   Again,   the\r\n\r\nintention  here is not to bankrupt anybody but to  redeem  one's\r\n\r\nreputation.   However, the consequence is  that,  as  it  stands\r\n\r\ntoday,  because of the monetary compensation given, some  people\r\n\r\nstay away from political controversies of criticising on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  policies or politicians because of the fear that it  may\r\n\r\nlead  to financial ruin.  What in fact happens is those who have\r\n\r\nbeen found guility, and I said guilty, are certainly liable  for\r\n\r\ndefamation.   In  this case, they may find themselves  paying  a\r\n\r\nheavy price or penalty for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to elections where some of these issues have\r\n\r\ncropped  up, especially during elections, and it can be expected\r\n\r\nthat  during the heat of elections, statements that can be  made\r\n\r\nmay  be  construed as defamatory, not in its intent, but in  its\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  the situation that is found.   Based  on  past\r\n\r\ncases,  one has to be extremely careful and one should in making\r\n\r\nspeeches  during election rallies.  While care  must  always  be\r\n\r\nexercised,  the  law should not cause unnecessary  restrictions,\r\n\r\nespecially  during  elections.  One  suggestion  is  perhaps  to\r\n\r\nexercise  more  tolerance before resorting to legal  suits.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  works both ways for all parties  taking  part  in\r\n\r\nelection rallies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, Sir, is to provide for limited privileges during\r\n\r\nelections,   especially   to  cover   cases   of   unintentional\r\n\r\ndefamation.   Of course, one can argue that this suggestion  may\r\n\r\nmean  giving  political  parties  or  individuals  a  leeway  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  and  defame  others and  later  get  away  by  merely\r\n\r\napologising.   But  I would say today, Sir,  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nfoolish for any politician seeking office to think that  he  can\r\n\r\nget  elected  if  he  has  the habit  of  frequently  having  to\r\n\r\napologise  to his political opponents.  At the end of  the  day,\r\n\r\nSir, defamation, especially the one Mr Jeyaretnam mentioned,  is\r\n\r\na  very  personal  matter.   I  think  the  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  that  avenues have been made available,  which  is\r\n\r\nrelevant  to this case.  At the end of the day, the two  parties\r\n\r\nmust explore those personal avenues available to settle what  is\r\n\r\nessentially  a  personal matter.  But I hope the Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider  the suggestions that I have referred to in  the  wider\r\n\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's motion to call on the Government to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappoint  a  commission  to examine and  recommend  what  changes\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  to the law of defamation is  misconceived  and\r\n\r\nshould not be supported by this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the benefit of Members of this House who may not\r\n\r\nbe  familiar with the subject, the general starting point  of  a\r\n\r\ndefamation  law  begins  with a published  defamatory  statement\r\n\r\nwhich  refers  to the person concerned.  I underline  the  words\r\n\r\n\"persons  concerned\" because this will be relevant  subsequently\r\n\r\nwhen  I respond to Mr Simon Tay's point.  A defamatory statement\r\n\r\nis  one which is calculated to injure a person's reputation  and\r\n\r\nto diminish the willingness of the others to associate with him.\r\n\r\nWhere  it  is  alleged that a defamatory remark  has  been  made\r\n\r\nagainst  a  person, the person who is alleged to have  made  the\r\n\r\ndefamatory  remarks  would not be liable  for  those  defamatory\r\n\r\nremarks  if  he  is able to establish certain defences  such  as\r\n\r\njustification, absolute privilege, qualified privilege  or  fair\r\n\r\ncomment.  For instance, if I called somebody a cheat and a liar,\r\n\r\nI would, on the face of the statement, be liable for defamation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  I  am able to, among other things, show  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  whom  I had called such was indeed a cheat and  a  liar,\r\n\r\nthen  I  would  not  be  liable  as  I  had  spoken  the  truth.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  if  it  was found as a fact  that  a  particular\r\n\r\nperson indeed told a lie, it would not be defamatory for one  to\r\n\r\npass an opinion that it was wrong to lie, since this comment was\r\n\r\nbased on a proven fact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had broadly stated the underlying principles of\r\n\r\ndefamation  only  to  show that contrary to what  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nseems to suggest, there is generally a right to proffer what  is\r\n\r\non  the  surface, defamatory comments on the conduct  of  public\r\n\r\nofficials or anybody whatsoever, provided that the author of the\r\n\r\nstatements  is  able  to raise the defences  which  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.   If  I  may add, defamatory statements  are  not  just\r\n\r\nstatements  alone  but  also include innuendoes  or  suggestions\r\n\r\nindicating the conduct or otherwise of the person concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam had numerous encounters with defamation laws.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all of his encounters have met with successes\r\n\r\nin  his  favour.  Perhaps that is the reason, and we have  heard\r\n\r\nthis  to  be  so,  why  he is asking this  House  to  appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommission to reform the laws of defamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that in every democratic society, there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  constitutional right of free  speech.   We  are  no\r\n\r\nexception.   Our  Constitution provides the assurance  that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have that right.  However, we must also  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  there  is equally the right of individuals to protect  his\r\n\r\nhonour,  reputation and dignity.  The right of free speech  must\r\n\r\nbe subject to some form of legal control.  An English jurist put\r\n\r\nit well when he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Firstly, any person is entitled prima facie to his good\r\n\r\nname,  and  imputations are not to be made without justification\r\n\r\nwhich  are detrimental to his reputation.  Secondly, any  person\r\n\r\nshould  be  entitled in a free democratic community  to  publish\r\n\r\nfearlessly  statements  of  fact  and  expressions  of  opinions\r\n\r\nhowever forthright or unpopular and even though they may reflect\r\n\r\non or displease particular individuals or groups.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the freedom of expression without fear or favour\r\n\r\nserves  as an important underpinning in our democracy.   Without\r\n\r\nthe freedom to speak up, our people will not have the ability to\r\n\r\ndetermine  their  own future in this country.   To  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  and  comment is the spur by which our  Government  is\r\n\r\nkept  perpetually on its toes.  In any democracy, if the  people\r\n\r\ndo not have the right to speak nor the courage to get themselves\r\n\r\ninvolved  or  heard,  there  will  not  be  any  check  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In the end, they only have themselves to  blame  if\r\n\r\nthe Government abuses its powers at the expense of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we recognise the constitutional right of\r\n\r\nfree  speech, it is another thing altogether to give people  the\r\n\r\ncarte  blanche  licence  to go into scurrilous  attacks  on  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  and reputation of any individual member  of  society.\r\n\r\nThe  cases which Mr Jeyaretnam referred to in his earlier speech\r\n\r\ndid  not provide the complete picture because while he tried  to\r\n\r\npaint the picture that he merely made those remarks innocently,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  a  lawyer, he should know that taken in toto, those  remarks\r\n\r\nrepresent certain innuendoes which, if not pursued in a court of\r\n\r\nlaw,  will  result  in the undermining of the character  of  the\r\n\r\nperson  concerned.   Certainly,  an  innocent  remark  which  he\r\n\r\npresented  earlier, as asking questions about the conduct  of  a\r\n\r\nparticular Minister, can be seen as disparaging the good name of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, as it was indeed so, as found by the  court\r\n\r\nin the decision which he referred to; and that is the Teh Cheang\r\n\r\nWan's case.  What Mr Jeyaretnam is asking for is not freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech.    That   is  an  inalienable  constitution   right   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  What Mr Jeyaretnam wants, although  he  has  said\r\n\r\nthat this is not the case that he wanted, is a licence to defame\r\n\r\npeople  without  being called to account for the  basis  of  his\r\n\r\nallegations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam knows that it is no defamation for anyone to\r\n\r\ncomment  and  even to criticise stridently, any  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Outside this House, people are free  to  criticise\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies and Acts.  At the last  general  elections,\r\n\r\nmany of the Opposition Members had been volubly vocal about many\r\n\r\nof  our  Government policies.  Are these criticisms made out  of\r\n\r\nfear?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we must realise is that at the end of the day a\r\n\r\ndistinction  must be made between the criticism of a  particular\r\n\r\npolicy for which the fight for the vote of the people must stand\r\n\r\non as opposed to an attack on the integrity and the good name of\r\n\r\nthe person concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we must realise is that in a country as important\r\n\r\nas  ours,  human  resource is our only asset.   Making  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  public officials to sue in defamation  may  well\r\n\r\ndiscourage  many from joining the public sector.  The Government\r\n\r\nwould  end  up being poorer for it. It may not be the  case  for\r\n\r\nsome,  but  for  many,  honour,  reputation  and  integrity  are\r\n\r\nqualities that many work hard at building and preserving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case which Mr Jeyaretnam cited, and that is the New York\r\n\r\nTimes'  case, has been considered in a Canadian court, Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal which decided not to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nendorse it.  In Derickson v Tomat [1992] 88 DLR 401, the British\r\n\r\nColumbian  Court of Appeal in that case took the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether or not the New York Times' case  ought  to  be\r\n\r\nadopted in Canada.  The judge said that this particular decision\r\n\r\nhas no application in Canada, and I will read the dicta from the\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The rule that the New York Times case leaves vulnerable the\r\n\r\nreputation  of  all  who are, or would be,  in  public  life  by\r\n\r\ndepriving  such  people  of any legal recourse  from  defamatory\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  directed against them, except in  those  rare  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  actual  malice can be established.   Such  a  rule  would\r\n\r\nlikely  discourage  honest and decent people from  standing  for\r\n\r\npublic office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the rule destroys rather than preserves the delicate\r\n\r\nbalance   between  freedom  of  expression  and  protection   of\r\n\r\nreputation  which, as I already noted, is vital to the  survival\r\n\r\nof a democratic process of government.  For that reason, I would\r\n\r\noppose  introducing such a rule in this country.  So  there  you\r\n\r\nare, Mr Jeyaretnam, it is not by uniform consensus that the rule\r\n\r\nin  the  New York Times case is universally applicable  even  by\r\n\r\nwestern standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of our public servants, they are not likely to\r\n\r\nallow  anyone  to fritter away their good name through  spurious\r\n\r\nallegations  which cannot be substantiated.  If we  allow  that,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  many, I am sure, who will have second  thoughts\r\n\r\nabout  being  a part of the public service.  And I am  sure  you\r\n\r\nagree that this is not in our interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if the pubic servant concerned was engaged in some\r\n\r\nillegal or improper acts, Mr Jeyaretnam is at liberty to  report\r\n\r\nthe  matter to the proper authorities.  Let them deal  with  it.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  it if were true, there is nothing to stop Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nfrom  stating  the  substance of his concern  publicly.   If  an\r\n\r\nofficer,  for  example, were engaged in an act of corruption  by\r\n\r\naccepting some form of gratification, it would be a defence to a\r\n\r\nclaim in defamation if one can justify the statement.  What  the\r\n\r\nlaw  cannot accept, however, is the allegation of improper  acts\r\n\r\nthrough indefensible statements or innuendoes which diminish the\r\n\r\nstanding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  person  in  the eyes of his peers.  This  is  the  real\r\n\r\nintention  of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's  call  for  the  reformation  of\r\n\r\ndefamation laws in this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is aware that our laws apply equally to all. If I\r\n\r\nchoose  to defame Mr Jeyaretnam publicly outside this House,  he\r\n\r\ncan  sue me in a court of law.  Whether or not he chooses to sue\r\n\r\nme  is a separate matter.  That is the essence of our democracy.\r\n\r\nThe  rule  of  law  applies to all.  It does not  matter  if  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam was making the defamatory remarks against me, or if I\r\n\r\nwas  making  a  defamatory  remark  against  him.   The  law  is\r\n\r\nrespecter of no class or rank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that with widespread literacy and universal\r\n\r\nsuffrage,  Singaporeans have the opportunity to  participate  in\r\n\r\nthe political and community affairs of our country.  With better\r\n\r\neducation,  Singaporeans  are better able  to  articulate  their\r\n\r\nviews  more  effectively.  We have seen  that  over  the  years,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  more  actively  involved  in  the   political\r\n\r\nprocesses than before.  They would want more information  rather\r\n\r\nthan less of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise this and we encourage the flow of free and frank\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  This is necessary for the maintenance of democracy\r\n\r\nin  this  country.  However, and I say it again, it  is  another\r\n\r\nthing altogether to say that that right extends to defaming  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of another fellow human being and to destroy  his  or\r\n\r\nher reputation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's motion in part relates to some recent matters\r\n\r\nwhich  involved several international NGOs.  I am  referring  in\r\n\r\nparticular  to  defamation  suits against  Mr  Jeyaretnam  which\r\n\r\nattracted much media and international attention.  Sir, at  this\r\n\r\nmoment, I would like to touch on the comments of several parties\r\n\r\nwho have spoken publicly on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the issue of reformation of defamation laws is the\r\n\r\nquestion,  as  alleged  by  some  critics,  of  whether  we  use\r\n\r\ndefamation  laws  here to stifle and oppress opposition  voices.\r\n\r\nBoth  the  ICJ  and  the  Amnesty  International  observed   the\r\n\r\ndefamation trials involving Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnesty International in their report expressed the concern that\r\n\r\nthe   decision   to   launch  defamation  was  unnecessary   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable.   They  feel  that  the  combined  action  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership and the decision of the court placed restrictions  on\r\n\r\nfreedom  of expression that cannot be justified by international\r\n\r\nstandards.   Amnesty International went on to  pontificate  that\r\n\r\ncivil defamation has been misused by the Executive to intimidate\r\n\r\nand  deter  those  with  dissenting views.   The  suits  have  a\r\n\r\nchilling effect on the political life and place unreasonable and\r\n\r\nunacceptable restrictions on the right of Singaporeans to freely\r\n\r\nhold and express their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Commission of Jurists, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthrough  their self righteous representative Stuart  Littlemore,\r\n\r\nblatantly stated that the courts have assisted the plaintiffs in\r\n\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two comments to make on these. First, we must\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  as a matter of first principle,  every  country\r\n\r\nwith  its  duly  elected government has the sovereign  right  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  its own destiny.  I have stated, at the  onset,  that\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of expression and speech must be balanced in  every\r\n\r\ndemocracy  against the right of any individual  to  protect  his\r\n\r\nreputation  and  standing in the eyes of the  community.   Where\r\n\r\nthat  balance lies is to be decided by the people of the country\r\n\r\nconcerned.   It is not for any one, Stuart Littlemore  included,\r\n\r\nwho has no stake in his country, and who had himself sued others\r\n\r\nfor  defamation, to pass judgment and to say where that  balance\r\n\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, we have leaders who have worked hard at\r\n\r\ntransforming this country into an economic miracle.  The success\r\n\r\nof  this country rides not only on the back of the labour of our\r\n\r\npeople  but is also founded on the integrity and honesty of  the\r\n\r\nleadership.   Their integrity has helped to build up  the  trust\r\n\r\nthat  the people have in the leadership of this country.  It  is\r\n\r\nthis  inherent trust that our people have in our Government that\r\n\r\nhas  led to the quiet confidence that this Government will  lead\r\n\r\nthe country through its present difficult time.  The leaders did\r\n\r\nnot forge this trust overnight or through subterfuge.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  years of hard work, and the success of our  leaders  at\r\n\r\nevery general election is an affirmation of that trust.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to allow anyone to fritter away the trust  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  have  in  the  leadership by  allowing  anyone  to  cast\r\n\r\naspersions on the character of our leaders which is indefensible\r\n\r\nin law; and certainly not allow anyone who, after they have lost\r\n\r\ntheir  case in a court of law, should now come to this House  to\r\n\r\nask  for  the rules to be changed so that he has the licence  to\r\n\r\ndefame others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of defamation may be similar in most common law\r\n\r\ncountries,  but the standards of defamation are  and  should  be\r\n\r\ndifferent.   The  Guardian,  in its editorial,  has  called  our\r\n\r\nleaders thin-skinned.  If that is the allegation, so be it.   We\r\n\r\nhave seen the buffoonery of the English press in the handling of\r\n\r\ntheir own leaders under the guise of freedom of expression.   If\r\n\r\nthat is the standard they want us to go down to, Sir, we are not\r\n\r\ninterested.  Let us decide what those standards are and  let  us\r\n\r\nbe our own judge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the reports that have emerged suggest that we have no\r\n\r\navenue for constructive criticism at all.  Is this true?  Are we\r\n\r\ndeterred  as a people from speaking up publicly?  Mr  Simon  Tay\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier,  people are discouraged from speaking  simply  in\r\n\r\ncase there is a chance that they may be sued for defamation.   I\r\n\r\ndid  say  earlier  that  a  distinction  must  be  made  between\r\n\r\ndefamation which goes towards the integrity and the good name of\r\n\r\na  person  as  opposed to a fair criticism and  comment  of  the\r\n\r\npolicies of a country.  I think, in any election, there must  be\r\n\r\na  contest  of ideas.  In the last elections, we have seen  that\r\n\r\nthe people have had no restraint in publicly criticising, rather\r\n\r\nstridently at times, some of our Government policies.   But  let\r\n\r\nthere be no mistake about it, that here it is the good name  and\r\n\r\nthe  reputation of the people concerned that we  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nprotect.  And it is a matter of policy, we have decided,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast  I feel we have decided, that if we allow people to launch\r\n\r\ninto  scurrilous  attacks against the good name  of  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned,   then   the   people  may  feel   discouraged   from\r\n\r\nparticipating in the political process.  But then, of course,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Zulikifli  has  also said that people who  are  involved  in\r\n\r\nelections should be prepared to have their feet muddied  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.   But then I ask Mr Zulkifli, the hon. NMP, why  should\r\n\r\npoliticians be any different?  Are they not human?  Are they not\r\n\r\nentitled to have the right to defend their good name in a  court\r\n\r\nof law?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, let us ask ourselves: Is there a forum\r\n\r\nfor  our people to express deep unhappiness over policies?   Are\r\n\r\nthere  people in prison today because they spoke out their minds\r\n\r\nand  spoke from conscience?  No.  The answer is a resounding no.\r\n\r\nSir,  over  the  years, we have put in place  institutions  that\r\n\r\nencourage  people  to  participate  in  policy  formulation  and\r\n\r\nimplementation.   Mr Simon Tay, for example, is  involved  in  a\r\n\r\nforum  that looks at deciding policies that will carry Singapore\r\n\r\nto  the  next  millennium.   If it  was  our  intention  to  gag\r\n\r\nopposing, or even remotely, dissenting voices, he would have  no\r\n\r\nplace  in  this Committee today.  And that is why  we  have  the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit,  the  Forum  page  of  the  Straits  Times,  the\r\n\r\nInternet, and, as I said earlier, more recently the Singapore 21\r\n\r\nCommittee  where the people involved have actually gone  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir   way  to  solicit  views  as  to  the  kind  of   society\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  want  in  the  next  millennium.   In  all   these\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  one would say that there were no attempts  to  put\r\n\r\nany  unreasonable restrictions other than those which go  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  bounds  of human decency, in matters which they  have  been\r\n\r\nallowed  to raise.  Did we go after them because of such adverse\r\n\r\nremarks?   Was there ever any indication of oppression  or  fear\r\n\r\nwhich  prevented them from speaking out?  No.  If there was  any\r\n\r\neffort on the Government's part to gag these voices or to instil\r\n\r\nin  them  a fear to speak out against what is perceived  as  bad\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies, we would not have seen  or  heard  any  of\r\n\r\nthese strident criticisms that we see or hear of these days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should realise that nowhere in the world would you find a\r\n\r\nGovernment  that has taken the trouble of constitutional  reform\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that there is adequate representation in  Parliament\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nminority  voices.  It is for this reason that we  have  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  today  Nominated MPs and the NCMP.  These representatives\r\n\r\nhave no obligation to anyone and are encouraged to speak without\r\n\r\nfear or favour.  Mr Jeyaretnam, a loser in the last election, is\r\n\r\nhere today by the grace of the same Government he now claims  is\r\n\r\nsuppressing  this  right  of free  and  fair  speech.   Has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  tried to stop him from speaking in Parliament?   No.\r\n\r\nOn  the contrary, we have been patiently listening to him  going\r\n\r\non  and  on  in this House almost ad nauseam on the same  themes\r\n\r\nlike  an  old record.  If we had a strict democracy,  where  the\r\n\r\nright of admission into this august House is through the vote of\r\n\r\nthe  people, then these people, like Mr Jeyaretnam, will not  be\r\n\r\nhere  today, and we all agree that Singapore will be poorer  for\r\n\r\nit.  So, Mr Jeyaretnam, how are we, with all that we have sought\r\n\r\nto  do in these past years, any less democratic?  How can we  be\r\n\r\nsaid  to  be  oppressive  and  stifling  free  expressions   and\r\n\r\ndiscussions?   Mr Jeyaretnam, unfortunately, has his  pet  peeve\r\n\r\nand  would waste no time in bringing it into this House  without\r\n\r\nconsidering whether it stands to reason.  Today's motion is  yet\r\n\r\nagain another example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I do not support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me say, before going\r\n\r\ninto  the  motion proper, but I would not take  as  long  as  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam did, when he introduced this motion with a  20-minute\r\n\r\nspeech which sounded like a history lecture, that this House  is\r\n\r\ndoing   well.   Mr  Jeyaretnam  asked  whether  this  House   is\r\n\r\neffective.  He has criticised this House as not doing its job of\r\n\r\nchecking the Executive.  But, of course, from his standpoint, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam would like a gridlock, as happened in some countries,\r\n\r\nwhere  the Legislative arm and the Executive arm cannot see  eye\r\n\r\nto eye, and government cannot function.  But, Sir, in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  do  things  differently.  Yes, Parliament has  a  role,  and\r\n\r\nParliament  plays its role effectively.  This, in  fact,  was  a\r\n\r\nsubject matter of a motion which Mr Jeyaretnam himself had moved\r\n\r\nin this House six months ago.  So we have already dealt\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith that effectively.  It is not only me who says this, because\r\n\r\nhere  again  if you look at independent polls, I  think  it  was\r\n\r\n1996,  the PERC polls talked about the state of the legislatures\r\n\r\nin  the  Asian region.  The PERC polls put Singapore at  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh   placing,  saying  that  despite  the  absence  of  strong\r\n\r\nOpposition in the House, there was rigorous and vigorous debate.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about Mr Jeyaretnam is that he keeps returning\r\n\r\nto  old  themes.   He  laments why there are so  few  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers in Parliament.  He has given other reasons in the  past.\r\n\r\nHe has a new one this time.  He says that Opposition politicians\r\n\r\nare defeated in the polls because of the law of defamation.   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam, what else will you come out with next?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first say that the motion is misconceived. It must\r\n\r\nbe  rejected because its basic premises are false and untenable.\r\n\r\nThese  are,  firstly,  that the law of defamation  denies  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  the  right to comment on and criticise the  conduct  of\r\n\r\npublic  officials  and  the discharge of  public  functions  and\r\n\r\nduties.  And secondly, without changes to the law of defamation,\r\n\r\ncitizens cannot exercise their right without fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin has just said that this is far from the truth.\r\n\r\nBecause,  as  Mr  Sin has said, and indeed  this  is  the  case,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are not afraid to criticise Government policies  or\r\n\r\nindeed  officials, if justified.  I think in the last debate  in\r\n\r\nthis House, again on Mr Jeyaretnam's motion, Mr Zulkifli and  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay had alluded to this, that as a civil society, we  are\r\n\r\nopening  up and more people are speaking up.  And for those  who\r\n\r\nare not speaking up, it is not so much for fear of being put  in\r\n\r\nprison or Government reprisal, but I think Mr Zulkifli also said\r\n\r\nit  is  partly due to a cultural basis.  People may not want  to\r\n\r\nspeak up in public to avoid the embarrassment of being put  down\r\n\r\nor having to rebut and to debate publicly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly, it is not the fear of defamation that puts\r\n\r\npeople  off  from speaking up.  In any case, even if  there  are\r\n\r\nsome, like Mr Zulkifli has mentioned, who may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  this fear, I hope that, after today's debate, knowing what\r\n\r\nthe ambit of the law of defamation is and how Government leaders\r\n\r\nhave in the past used it, the few instances when PAP leaders had\r\n\r\nused  defamation  in what context and what  were  the  words  in\r\n\r\nquestion, I think such fears can be put to rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Mr Jeyaretnam's motivation for moving this debate?\r\n\r\nI think he shows it quite clearly.  He has talked about cases he\r\n\r\nhad  been involved in, two of which he was involved in, and  the\r\n\r\nother one involving Mr Tang Liang Hong, a Party member.  Like Mr\r\n\r\nSin  has  mentioned, and the other two Nominated MPs  have  also\r\n\r\nsaid,  these are cases which have been dealt with fully  by  the\r\n\r\ncourts,  up to the Court of Appeal, which have examined them  in\r\n\r\nthe context of the law and in the context of accepted standards,\r\n\r\ntests  and  principles,  whether  the  words  in  question  were\r\n\r\ndefamatory  or  not.  Of course, Mr Jeyaretnam, in  this  House,\r\n\r\ntries  to  tell us that they were all innocent statements,  they\r\n\r\nwere  innocent denials.  Again, without going into the  details,\r\n\r\nsurely the courts examined these words very carefully, not  only\r\n\r\nin the context of what was the natural and ordinary meaning, but\r\n\r\nalso  what was the innuendo meaning in the context in which  the\r\n\r\nwords  were uttered, and after a full consideration in the cases\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Jeyaretnam  had mentioned, the courts  had  held  that\r\n\r\nindeed defamation was made out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about democratic society and freedom of\r\n\r\nspeech.   He makes a big pitch about it.  Let me first say  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  democratic society in the world, let  alone  true\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  words in the motion, whatever true democracy  means,\r\n\r\nwhere  the right to exercise free speech includes the  right  to\r\n\r\ndefame individuals, including public officials, not here, not in\r\n\r\nthe  US, not anywhere.  As Mr Tay has pointed out, every society\r\n\r\nhas  to  strike  a  balance.  What is this balance  between  the\r\n\r\nindividual's right of free speech and the interest  of  society?\r\n\r\nOur defamation laws are well established.  They have worked well\r\n\r\nand  I  would  say  that there is no need for  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry to look into changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about democratic freedom. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnot  a  democratic freedom to defame and attack another person's\r\n\r\nreputation  with  falsehoods  to impugn  his  integrity  without\r\n\r\nbasis.    Our   defamation   laws   give   everyone,   including\r\n\r\npoliticians, and that is what it should be, the right to protect\r\n\r\none's  reputation  and honour.  It is one  thing  to  engage  in\r\n\r\nrobust  political debate and criticise the Government as leaders\r\n\r\nor  policies  in  the  process.  In  fact,  Opposition  leaders,\r\n\r\nMembers  like Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Chiam See Tong and  others,\r\n\r\nhave  done  for many years.  They have not been sued  for  these\r\n\r\ncriticisms.   But  it is another thing to defame.   And  indeed,\r\n\r\neveryone,   including   politicians,   must   take   the   legal\r\n\r\nconsequences of their words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only Government leaders who sue in defamation. I\r\n\r\nam  sure Mr Chiam knows this very well.  He has also invoked the\r\n\r\nlaw  of  defamation.  When justified, he has sued.  He  has  won\r\n\r\ncases,  not just against other Opposition politicians  but  also\r\n\r\nagainst  PAP leaders.  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam himself has invoked\r\n\r\nthe  law  of defamation when he sued the Prime Minister who  was\r\n\r\nthen  DPM  in 1989.  That case went up to the Privy Council  and\r\n\r\nwas dismissed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Whatever it is, the highest\r\n\r\ncourt at that time dismissed Mr Jeyaretnam's case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also talks about our Constitution. In\r\n\r\nSingapore, yes, there is freedom of speech in Article 14 of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Yet, at the same time, and Mr Tay has alluded  to\r\n\r\nthat, it must be balanced because the word \"defamation\" is  also\r\n\r\nmentioned   expressly  in  our  Constitution.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  balance is in fact expressly  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Tay supports Mr Jeyaretnam's call for a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry.   A  Commission of Inquiry is normally  set  up  to\r\n\r\ninquire into alleged wrongdoing.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  the proper forum for the examination of an area of the law.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  with Mr Jeyaretnam back in the House, I  think  one\r\n\r\nother  theme that is recurrent has been his constant  calls  for\r\n\r\nthe   formation  of  Commissions  of  Inquiry,  committees   and\r\n\r\nwhatnots.   Perhaps he sees himself playing a starring  role  in\r\n\r\nthese  committees.   He wants a higher profile  for  himself  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I have said just now, the law is working well. Indeed, the\r\n\r\nlaw  is  evolving because our courts are still  looking  at  how\r\n\r\ndefamation laws can be applied in various contexts.   So I would\r\n\r\nsay, let the courts do the job.  I think this is an approach  Mr\r\n\r\nTay  himself has previously argued for.  So our position is that\r\n\r\nunless  there  is  a  need for Parliamentary  intervention,  the\r\n\r\ncourts should do their job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should take this opportunity to explain why PAP leaders sue\r\n\r\nfor  defamation.  We have explained this many times before, both\r\n\r\nhere  and  outside.   Defamation  is  taken  very  seriously  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not  just  by  the Government,  but  indeed  by  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  more  so  when  the integrity  of  its  political\r\n\r\nleaders  and  key institutions is questioned.   In  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nlacking  in  natural resources where the cutting edge  that  has\r\n\r\nmade a difference is human resource, it is critical that at  the\r\n\r\napex   where   the   national  political  leadership   and   key\r\n\r\ninstitutions  sit,  there is no doubt  that  there  is  absolute\r\n\r\nhonesty  and  integrity.  Wild allegations must be deterred  and\r\n\r\ndebunked  in  accordance  with the  law.   Why?   Otherwise  the\r\n\r\nability  to  govern  will  be  undermined.   This  indeed  is  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  and  conclusive  way to  settle  disputes  and  thus\r\n\r\nmaintain high standards of truth in politics.  The other way, as\r\n\r\nis  the  case  in some countries, is to exchange defamation  for\r\n\r\ndefamation  in the media with the public never the wiser  as  to\r\n\r\nwho is lying.  Singapore leaders therefore sue in defamation  to\r\n\r\nclear their names and protect these key institutions through due\r\n\r\nprocess  of  the  law,  not  to stifle,  intimidate,  harass  or\r\n\r\nbankrupt  the  Opposition.  Therefore,  these  actions  are  not\r\n\r\npolitically motivated.  Ultimately, Singapore will benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of course is that politicians who do not\r\n\r\nclear  their name in court, when defamed, will lose the  respect\r\n\r\nof the electorate.  They will ask what is he fearful about.  Why\r\n\r\nis  he  not suing?  A key ingredient of good Government is  that\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders have the trust and respect of the electorate.\r\n\r\nPAP  leaders  working with important institutions, such  as  the\r\n\r\ncivil service, have through many years of hard, honest work  won\r\n\r\nthis  trust and respect.  Public interest demands that such good\r\n\r\nrepute  be accorded the protection that it deserves, because  we\r\n\r\ncannot   risk   what  has  happened  in  some  countries   where\r\n\r\npoliticians are regarded very lowly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not forget that when anyone, more so a national leader,\r\n\r\nsues  in  defamation, he is putting his own  reputation  on  the\r\n\r\nline.   As such, PAP leaders sue in their personal capacity.   I\r\n\r\nthink  all  of us know a key defence to a defamation  action  is\r\n\r\njustification.  In other words, it is open to the  defendant  to\r\n\r\nprove  that  what he says is true.  A politician who  sues  thus\r\n\r\nopens  himself and his actions to public scrutiny  and  rigorous\r\n\r\ncross-examination in court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, with all these constraints, why then do politicians sue?\r\n\r\nThe  main  point is to establish the truth.  A politician  knows\r\n\r\nthat  scurrilous accusations left unchallenged would poison  the\r\n\r\npublic's  mind.   For  example,  past  allegations  against  PAP\r\n\r\nleaders  which have prompted them to sue for defamation  include\r\n\r\nimputations  or  implications  of nepotism,  corruption,  lying,\r\n\r\nabuse  of power, all of which are very serious allegations,  and\r\n\r\nof  course implication in the death of a Minister and other such\r\n\r\nimplications.  In a Singapore founded on good honest Government,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  allow  such  poison to fester and  go  unchallenged.\r\n\r\nBesides  risking exposure, if the allegations are proven  to  be\r\n\r\ntrue, a losing plaintiff has also to pay costs.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\npoint  is no PAP leader will sue for defamation unadvisedly  and\r\n\r\nwithout just cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a higher threshold when remarks are uttered in\r\n\r\nthe heat of the hustings?  This is Mr Zulkifli's point.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nthis is the situation on which the three cases are founded.  But\r\n\r\nthe question\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreally  is:  why  should it be so?  Elections and electioneering\r\n\r\nshould  never  be  justification for defaming and  maligning  an\r\n\r\nopposing  candidate  whether with  words  which  are  plain  and\r\n\r\nordinary  in  the  meaning or, more often than not,  words  with\r\n\r\ninnuendo   meaning.   Why  should  the  law  give   licence   to\r\n\r\npoliticians,   whether  Opposition  or   Government,   to   make\r\n\r\ndefamatory statements?  If any politician thinks it  is  in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest to expose any character flaw or wrongdoing of an\r\n\r\nopposing candidate, he can and indeed should do so.  But, at the\r\n\r\nsame time, he must be prepared to justify these allegations, and\r\n\r\nthat is the way it should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rules of conduct in election campaigning. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nwe can imagine that the noble task of choosing political leaders\r\n\r\nwho  form the Government to lead the country will become an open\r\n\r\nseason  for mud-slinging and character assassination, an outcome\r\n\r\nwe must avoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, another important point is that the defamation\r\n\r\naction  is  not  a  blunt  instrument.   And  I  am  sure   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  I think not many, who fear defamation  action  if\r\n\r\nthey  criticise the Government or public officials, if they know\r\n\r\nthis,  they  will be assured.  Because, besides the  defence  of\r\n\r\njustification,  there  are also other  defences,  such  as  fair\r\n\r\ncomment and qualified privilege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a person who innocently defames another may make\r\n\r\namends in accordance with section 7 of the Defamation Act.  Even\r\n\r\nif  not  made innocently, he can mitigate damages by  making  an\r\n\r\nunreserved  apology.  And indeed an early, sincere,  unqualified\r\n\r\napology may in fact avert a defamation suit.  In many cases, the\r\n\r\npublication  of  an unqualified apology in the  newspapers  will\r\n\r\nresult in a full settlement of any potential action for damages.\r\n\r\nSome may argue that freedom of speech should include freedom  to\r\n\r\nerr in speech.  Our defamation laws allow for freedom to err  in\r\n\r\nspeech  but  not freedom to perpetuate defamatory statements  to\r\n\r\nthe detriment of the person defamed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made these points to show that the law of defamation\r\n\r\nis not a sledgehammer.  Quite the contrary, the law is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsensitive and nuanced enough to differentiate fair criticisms on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, innocent, unintended or careless remarks  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, and malicious falsehoods in the third category.  The\r\n\r\nlaw  also  ensures  that fair and justified  comments,  even  if\r\n\r\ndefamatory, will not necessarily get its maker into trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that Mr Jeyaretnam cites support from\r\n\r\ndevelopments   in  overseas  jurisdictions.   He   talks   about\r\n\r\nDerbyshire.  He talks about New York Times.  He talks about  the\r\n\r\nTheophanous  and  Stephen's cases in the Australian  High  Court\r\n\r\nwhich incidentally were only 4-3 majority decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lingers in the European Court of Human Rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The Austrian case, I know. My\r\n\r\nresponse  is  that  as Singapore matures as a society,  we  must\r\n\r\nbuild up our own legal jurisprudence.  This must be so.  This is\r\n\r\nan  inexorable process, applicable not only in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of defamation, where there are well over 100 local reported\r\n\r\nand  unreported  cases,  including several  important  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal decisions, but in many areas of the law, such as criminal\r\n\r\nlaw,  family law, as well.  But I would say that more so in  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of  defamation,  we cannot follow developments  in  Western\r\n\r\ndemocracies such as UK, US or Australia blindly.  Why?   Because\r\n\r\ndefamation  laws are society-oriented.  The test  of  defamation\r\n\r\ninvolves  how  ordinary members of that society would  view  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff  in  the  light  of  the alleged  defamatory  remarks.\r\n\r\nHence, every society must, in the final analysis, evolve its own\r\n\r\nbenchmark  and  yardstick.  What amounts to  defamation  in  one\r\n\r\nsociety may not be so in another, and this is shown very clearly\r\n\r\nin the US, for example, as Mr Tay has alluded.  And indeed, even\r\n\r\namong the countries that Mr Jeyaretnam cites, whether it is  US,\r\n\r\nUK, Australia, their laws of defamation also differ which proves\r\n\r\nmy point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no one right approach. Neither is there an\r\n\r\ninternational approach.  Ridiculing and sullying the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreputation of national political leaders may be acceptable, say,\r\n\r\nin  the  US.   But why should it be so in Singapore,  where  the\r\n\r\nstanding of politicians and the process are different?  Hence in\r\n\r\nthe  US, because of this requirement for express malice, it  has\r\n\r\nbecome  well-nigh  impossible  to  sue  in  defamation  when   a\r\n\r\npolitician  is defamed.  Hence, we have the media  coverage  and\r\n\r\nstories  being  exchanged, defamation for  defamation.   Is  the\r\n\r\ncountry better off for it?  Surely not.  So that cannot  be  the\r\n\r\nbetter approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, maybe not as dramatic, but different\r\n\r\nnonetheless, we are also evolving differently as a society  from\r\n\r\nthe British society, the Australian society.  Or as Mr Simon Tay\r\n\r\nsays, \"Why not the middle ground?  US in one spectrum, or at one\r\n\r\nend,  and  Singapore at the other end, but there  may  be  other\r\n\r\nmodels  in  between.\"  We have to find our own model, especially\r\n\r\nwhen we talk about political leaders having to protect their own\r\n\r\nreputation because the way political leaders are elected  differ\r\n\r\nfrom  country to country.  The compact between the  elected  and\r\n\r\nthe  electorate differs from country to country.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust evolve our own way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: should there therefore be a\r\n\r\ndifferent yardstick for political and public figures?  I  think,\r\n\r\nMr  Zulkifli,  and if I am not wrong, Mr Tay, also  asked  this.\r\n\r\nShould politicians be treated differently?  Should they be  more\r\n\r\nthick-skinned?   Sir, the law of defamation  protects  everyone,\r\n\r\nboth  public officials and private citizens alike.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nso.   There is equality before the law.  In fact, this point was\r\n\r\nbrought up in one of the cases where section 12 was cited.   Why\r\n\r\nshould  the reputation of public officials matter less?  Indeed,\r\n\r\nit  is already hard enough attracting able Singaporeans to  give\r\n\r\nup  the  privacy  of their lives to heed the higher  calling  of\r\n\r\npolitics.   A  higher  requirement of suing  and  succeeding  in\r\n\r\ndefamation, to clear one's reputation, when smeared, would be an\r\n\r\nunnecessary   additional  barrier.   Hence,   Singaporeans   can\r\n\r\ncriticise  Government's  policies, implementation  of  policies,\r\n\r\nconduct  of  public officials, but I would say,  no  defamation,\r\n\r\nplease.  These will be met with rebuttals,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexplanations and consultation, if need be.  But, let us not open\r\n\r\nPandora's box because when the horse bolts, we may not know  how\r\n\r\nto  rein it in.  We have kept it in this manner which has worked\r\n\r\nall  these  years.  Singapore has done well.  It  is  the  right\r\n\r\napproach.  Let us keep to it.  Otherwise, there will be a lot of\r\n\r\nenergy  spent by Government leaders, not governing but  handling\r\n\r\nthe media, countering these defamations in the media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point which I have made is the occasions when\r\n\r\nPAP leaders have sued.  I have made this point already.  That is\r\n\r\na  point  worth repeating.  It is not because of criticisms  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of grave and serious allegations, personal ones,  going\r\n\r\nto  the heart of good governance. Therefore, the falsehood  must\r\n\r\nbe   shown  up  and  the  best  way  to  do  it  is  decisively,\r\n\r\nindependently,   objectively,  according   to   principles   and\r\n\r\nstandards which are all laid out in the case laws in our courts.\r\n\r\nThis  afternoon, the Minister for Law has, in a very  convincing\r\n\r\nspeech,  highlighted the reputation of our Courts, not  just  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  worldwide.  It is not just said by  us,  but  by\r\n\r\nindependent polls.  So let the Courts do their job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a cap on the quantum of damages? Again, I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that there is no need to do this because  the  cases\r\n\r\ndiffer  on  the facts.  Unlike the UK where the jury decides  on\r\n\r\nthe damages and it has been said the damages can be inordinately\r\n\r\nlarge  and  somewhat  inconsistent, in Singapore,  where  judges\r\n\r\ndecide  on the damages, they look at the framework of cases  and\r\n\r\nthey decide based on precedents.  They would say, \"In this case,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  these facts, so much will be given.\"   I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould not have a cap and limit the quantum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude. It is obvious that this motion\r\n\r\ncannot  stand.  Ever since Mr Jeyaretnam returned to this House,\r\n\r\nhe  has sought at every turn for a higher profile for himself in\r\n\r\nParliament.  I think this time round, as in other times, we must\r\n\r\ndeny  him  that.  Our approach has worked well.  It has resulted\r\n\r\nin  good  government  where honest and able  men  and  women  of\r\n\r\nintegrity are prepared to step forward, sometimes as a sacrifice\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthemselves, to assume public office.  What is happening  in  the\r\n\r\nregion in the last 2-3 years where Singapore is standing up very\r\n\r\nwell,  shows  that this approach is the way to go.   Politicians\r\n\r\nwho   are  subject  to  scurrilous  attacks  on  their  personal\r\n\r\nintegrity  and character must continue to receive the protection\r\n\r\nof  the  law.   In  this, they should not  be  singled  out  and\r\n\r\nadditional fetters should not be placed in their path when  they\r\n\r\nsue for defamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I say that,\r\n\r\napart  from the two Nominated MPs, what we have heard  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  benches,  Mr  Sng  in  particular,  and  the  junior\r\n\r\nMinister are all old hat.  They say I keep repeating but  theirs\r\n\r\nis old hat.  We have heard this over and over again, perhaps not\r\n\r\nfrom them but from Ministers.  Mr  Goh Chok Tong, even from  the\r\n\r\nwitness stand, was saying what Mr Sng was repeating here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the record,\r\n\r\nit is Mr Sin, and not Mr Sng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Sin. Forgive me. It is nothing new to\r\n\r\nme.   But,  as I have said before, there is a total  failure  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  grips with the question raised by this motion.   There\r\n\r\nare  even  misconceptions completely of the terms of the  motion\r\n\r\nand  its  purpose.  Instead of that, both Mr Sin and the  junior\r\n\r\nMinister questioned my motivation.  It is not surprising  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  question  that  motivation.   But  that   is\r\n\r\nsomething I am used to.  We have heard this from Ministers  over\r\n\r\nand  over  again but when we question their motives for bringing\r\n\r\nthe  action they take umbrage.  As I said, it does not worry  me\r\n\r\nif  they  should  accuse  me of motivation.   But  whatever  the\r\n\r\nmotivation,  the  question  is,  and  which  must  be   answered\r\n\r\nhonestly,  is:   should  we  allow  in  Singapore  actions   for\r\n\r\ndefamation  on  the facts that I have outlined  in  these  three\r\n\r\ncases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think both Members, particularly the Minister of State,\r\n\r\nsuggest that I am perhaps seeking a high profile in this  House.\r\n\r\nBut again, it attacks my personal motive.  May I ask is that the\r\n\r\nreason,  because  they  think I am  trying  to  achieve  a  high\r\n\r\nprofile.  Is that the reason why the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedia  have  been  told to shut me out completely  so  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  may  not know anything about what I say in  this  House,\r\n\r\neven  questions that I ask?  Nothing is shown on TV or mentioned\r\n\r\nover the radio.  The press, particularly the English press, have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  say.   Is  that the reason, may  I  ask,  for  this\r\n\r\nblocking  out  of  whatever I say in this  House  because  I  am\r\n\r\nseeking  a  high  profile and that should not be  allowed?   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:   what do the public want to hear?   What  do  the\r\n\r\npublic  feel  about the role of opposition in  Parliament?   Not\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Opposition Members are seeking a high  profile  or\r\n\r\nnot.   If they are talking nonsense, let it be reported so  that\r\n\r\nthe public can see it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the misconceptions, both Members, I think perhaps even one of\r\n\r\nthe  NMPs,  questioned whether a Commission was the  right  way.\r\n\r\nBut  if you read my motion, I am not asking for a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  A Commission of Inquiry is set up to inquire into some\r\n\r\nwrongdoing or some accident to find out the facts.  But that  is\r\n\r\nnot  what  the motion is seeking to bring about.  The motion  is\r\n\r\nasking  for a Commission.  Have the Government Backbenchers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State  not heard of  law  reform  commissions\r\n\r\nappointed  to look into the law and to suggest ways of  bringing\r\n\r\nthe  law up-to-date, if it were necessary?  That is the sort  of\r\n\r\nCommission I am asking, not for a Commission of Inquiry into why\r\n\r\nthey brought these actions.  But a Commission on whether the law\r\n\r\nof defamation in Singapore intrudes unnecessarily, may I repeat,\r\n\r\nintrudes   unnecessarily,  into  the   freedom   of   expression\r\n\r\nguaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.  That is all.  And\r\n\r\nno one is suggesting that we bring in carte blanche the American\r\n\r\nmodel  or  any  other model.  All that I am asking  is  that  we\r\n\r\nshould seriously examine this question.  Are the defamation laws\r\n\r\ncurtailing  in  any way this basic right of the individual?   So\r\n\r\nthat is the first misconception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second misconception is that, somehow or other, I am\r\n\r\nasking that the law of defamation be amended to give\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersons  the  licence to defame everybody, including politicians\r\n\r\r\nin  high  places.  I do not know whether it is because they  did\r\n\r\nnot  hear  me, or whether they thought they should  just  ignore\r\n\r\nwhat  I said and continue to make the same allegation that I  am\r\n\r\nasking for a licence.  I made it clear that I was not seeking  a\r\n\r\nlicence  for  defamation, for the right to  defame,  whether  at\r\n\r\nelections  or at any other time.  The US law does not  give  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  the  right to defame.  It only protects the  right  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  question and participate in  the  affairs  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  And it protects them if there are errors of which they\r\n\r\nwere  not  aware at the time they made the statement.   What  is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  that?   The US decision in the New York  Times  and\r\n\r\nSullivan does not say that you can defame the President, you can\r\n\r\ndefame all the other public officials, you can go ahead, and the\r\n\r\nConstitution  gives you the licence.  It does not say  that  and\r\n\r\nneither  do the laws in other countries.  So, do not be  carried\r\n\r\naway by the idea that I am proposing for Singapore a licence  to\r\n\r\ndefame.  All I am concerned is that we should move from the kind\r\n\r\nof society we are in now into a freer society, with the right of\r\n\r\nevery citizen, in elections or out of elections, to question the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  to have answers given to those  questions,  and\r\n\r\nwithout being shut up by the threat of defamation actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a big misconception by Mr Sin and the Minister of\r\n\r\nState,  and perhaps also the point taken by one of the NMPs,  Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli,  is  that, in Singapore, people have the  channels  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  and  they do it fearlessly.  I do not know  how  this\r\n\r\nperception  was arrived at.  I would commend to the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  and to the Government that perhaps they should appoint  a\r\n\r\nfact-finding  body,  not the Government,  to  inquire  from  the\r\n\r\ncitizens whether they feel they have a right to speak up  freely\r\n\r\nand  criticise the Government and its officials in the discharge\r\n\r\nof  its  public duties.  May I say from what I know, if  such  a\r\n\r\nbody  is appointed and the citizens are told, \"You need have  no\r\n\r\nfear.   You  can give the answers truly.\", it will surprise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Not a day passes without me encountering people who\r\n\r\ntell me,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"In Singapore, we cannot breathe.  In Singapore, we cannot speak\r\n\r\nup.\"   It  does not only come from taxi drivers.  It comes  from\r\n\r\npeople way down.  So, I fail to understand this statement  that,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, no one need be afraid, whether of defamation laws\r\n\r\nor the ISA or any other administrative action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fora are there in Singapore for expression of public\r\n\r\nopinion?  It is no good pointing to feedback systems set  up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   I  have mentioned before  that  it  has  been\r\n\r\nreported  to me that even at these feedback sessions,  questions\r\n\r\nhave first to be given and they have to be approved.  But what I\r\n\r\nam  suggesting  is  that  if  you are  really  sincere  in  your\r\n\r\nstatement  that  there are enough avenues,  or  you  would  want\r\n\r\navenues,  then open up, and allow public discussion.  Take  away\r\n\r\nthe  permit requirements for public meetings.  Allow persons  to\r\n\r\ncongregate  and  discuss openly.  Then you  can  say,  \"Yes,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we have all the avenues necessary.\"  But  that  does\r\n\r\nnot  obtain in Singapore.  There is no freedom of expression  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chilling effect of the defamation actions on the freedom of\r\n\r\nexpression  is not something that just the Amnesty, the  ICJ  or\r\n\r\nother   NGOs   have  brought  up.   This  chilling   effect   of\r\n\r\nrestricting, by defamation laws, public participation was  noted\r\n\r\nby the House of Lords in the Derbyshire County Council case.  It\r\n\r\nis  probably  from there that people have begun using  the  term\r\n\r\n\"the  chilling effect\". It is not just the ICJ or Amnesty  which\r\n\r\ntalks  about the chilling effect.  The courts in other countries\r\n\r\nhave  recognised that and they recognise the importance of  free\r\n\r\nspeech for a truly democratic society which rates the freedom of\r\n\r\nthe  citizens to participate in public affairs higher  than  the\r\n\r\nright to protect personal reputation.   But, of course, they are\r\n\r\nnot suggesting that we go overboard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big misconception is to totally ignore the three\r\n\r\ncases  on  which  I  have relied and to talk generally  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot   allow  our  citizens,  even  if  they  are   Opposition\r\n\r\npoliticians,  to run down political leaders.  Do I  need  to  go\r\n\r\nover again the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfacts  upon  which the actions were brought in the three  cases?\r\n\r\nThere was no smearing of the plaintiffs in these actions.  In Mr\r\n\r\nTang  Liang  Hong's case, it was a denial of defamation  against\r\n\r\nhim, that he was a Chinese chauvinist and anti-Christian. So are\r\n\r\nwe  saying  that  in Singapore, if a Minister  decides  to  call\r\n\r\nsomeone a liar, he should just shut up and not say, \"I am afraid\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is not speaking the truth\"?  Because the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill then say, \"Oh, you are accusing me of lying.  I am going to\r\n\r\nsue  you in the courts.\"  Is that not the situation in the  case\r\n\r\nof  Tang  Liang  Hong?  Reference is made to the  perception  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that in our society politicians should  immediately\r\n\r\ntake  action  to protect themselves if there is anything  unkind\r\n\r\nsaid about them, even if it is defamatory, and especially it  is\r\n\r\nslightly defamatory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I ask: where do you get that perception from? Has\r\n\r\nany  poll  been  conducted, as it would have been  conducted  in\r\n\r\nother  countries,  as  to  what  Singaporeans  thought  of   the\r\n\r\ndefamation  actions in the circumstances over  which  they  were\r\n\r\nbrought?  I would urge the Government to carry out that  survey.\r\n\r\nYou  can dismiss what I say as just my own perception or because\r\n\r\na  few  have  told me.  My friends have told me and, of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  would  say  that.   But my own  perception  is  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   were  very  disappointed  and  upset   over   the\r\n\r\ndefamation  actions.  I think I had said in the previous  motion\r\n\r\nabout  the  letters that I had received after the last elections\r\n\r\nwhere  Singaporeans said they were sickened to the pit of  their\r\n\r\nstomachs  by what had happened during the elections.  They  said\r\n\r\nthey were ashamed that this should be allowed in Singapore.  So,\r\n\r\nplease  carry out a survey.  I would be very glad if  you  would\r\n\r\ncarry  out  a  survey among Singaporeans as to what  they  think\r\n\r\nabout the defamation actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not disputing that we should make laws that we think are\r\n\r\nnecessary for our society.  And this would be the purpose of the\r\n\r\nCommission.  The Commission would examine the present defamation\r\n\r\nlaws and see how they have been applied in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCourts.   The Commission would go into the facts and  then  come\r\n\r\nout  with  their  recommendation whether they think  any  change\r\n\r\nshould  be  made.  That is all.  What is so difficult about  it?\r\n\r\nWe  should  all  accept that with open arms if, as  I  said,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  in democracy.  So we come back again and again to  this\r\n\r\nquestion: what kind of society do we want in Singapore?   Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  an open democratic society?  Or do we want a society where\r\n\r\nthe  people's mouths are shut and they are not able to speak  up\r\n\r\nand make their contributions to the society?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, in the speeches of the NMPs, the need to protect\r\n\r\npoliticians from false charges or reckless charges.   My  answer\r\n\r\nto  that  is,  of  course, I can see the need  to  protect  them\r\n\r\nagainst  scurrilous false charges, but we would have to  examine\r\n\r\nand  answer  the question whether, in these three  cases,  there\r\n\r\nwere false scurrilous charges. In my own particular case, it was\r\n\r\na  statement of truth, that he had placed in front of me reports\r\n\r\nwhich  he  had  made to the Police.  On that  it  could  not  be\r\n\r\ndenied, it was nothing but the absolute truth.  There is nothing\r\n\r\nfalse about it.  And, indeed, as Members must know, the next day\r\n\r\nthe  press  carried Mr Tang Liang Hong's reports to the  Police,\r\n\r\nreleased  by  no  less than the Senior Minister, in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith the Prime Minister.  So they were informing the public  and\r\n\r\nyet  I was sued because I had told the public that he had lodged\r\n\r\nthe reports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this situation that one should examine and answer the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  we  should  allow  libel  actions  in   these\r\n\r\nsituations.   Of  course,  there is  the  law,  the  defence  of\r\n\r\njustification,  the  defence of fair  comment,  the  defence  of\r\n\r\nqualified privilege.  But, as has been observed in the decisions\r\n\r\nin the other countries, it is almost impossible for a person who\r\n\r\nmakes  a comment to prove something which lies peculiarly within\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge of the other party.  So it is for the other party\r\n\r\nto  bring all the facts and to show that the statement was false\r\n\r\nand  that the person knew the falsity of the statement  when  he\r\n\r\nmade it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Sin and the Minister of State talk about the sovereign\r\n\r\nright in Singapore to make its own laws.  Where does this motion\r\n\r\ndeny  that sovereign right?  So what is the purpose in repeating\r\n\r\nthat?  We are asking independent people to advise the Government\r\n\r\non  the law of defamation.  We are not asking them to import any\r\n\r\nother laws.  We would be asking them to appoint a Commission  to\r\n\r\nmake recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to read, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and I could read,\r\n\r\nstatements  in all the cases decided outside Singapore  to  show\r\n\r\nwhat importance they attach to the rights of the citizens.
