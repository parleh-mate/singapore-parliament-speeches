The Head of the Dewan Bahasa\r\n\r\ndan  Kebudayaan Kebangsaan is working on a  scheme\r\n\r\nto make people more conscious of the need to learn\r\n\r\nthe National Language.

However,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nindicate at the moment what form the Language Week\r\n\r\nwill take, because we must take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe special conditions in Singapore. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nlargely  a non-Malay speaking territory and  so  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  of  this  kind,  while  stimulating  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  use the national language, should  not\r\n\r\ncause  undue  inconvenience to administration  and\r\n\r\nbusiness.

As from that date, under\r\n\r\nsection 8 of the Ordinance, all land alienated  by\r\n\r\nthe Crown will be brought under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance and certificates of title  will  be\r\n\r\nissued  in  lieu  of  Crown instruments.  However,\r\n\r\nsince 1956, there have been a number of surrenders\r\n\r\nby  land developers under section 11 of the  Crown\r\n\r\nLands  Ordinance  for the purpose of  sub-dividing\r\n\r\ntheir   land   into  smaller  lots  for   building\r\n\r\npurposes.  Some  1,200 lots in  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nSembawang Hill Estate and another 1,000  odd  lots\r\n\r\nin  the  case of the Serangoon Garden Estate  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  sub-divided. In both  these  cases,\r\n\r\nCrown  grants  have not yet been issued  for  each\r\n\r\nsubdivided lot as time is taken for the survey  of\r\n\r\nthe   land  to  be  completed.  However,  in   the\r\n\r\nmeantime, buildings which have been erected on the\r\n\r\nlots  have  been sold and most of these properties\r\n\r\nare  under mortgage. Under section 8 of  the  Land\r\n\r\nTitles  Ordinance, there is no provision  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  mortgages or other  encumbrances\r\n\r\ncreated before the issue of the Crown grants.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  present Bill is to  provide  the\r\n\r\nmachinery   whereby  these  mortgages   or   other\r\n\r\nencumbrances  can be protected by notification  on\r\n\r\nthe   land  register  kept  in  the  Land   Titles\r\n\r\nRegistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 8A. (b) [clause 2] of the Bill\r\n\r\nputs the responsibility of informing the Registrar\r\n\r\nof   the  existence  of  any  mortgage  or   other\r\n\r\nencumbrance   on   the  person   interested,   and\r\n\r\nparagraph  (c)  enables  the  purchaser   of   the\r\n\r\nmortgaged  property to be registered as proprietor\r\n\r\nwithout  an order of the Court.

The Registrar shall thereupon  bring  the\r\n\r\nland  under  the  provisions of the  Ordinance  as\r\n\r\ntherein directed, and shall deliver the triplicate\r\n\r\ncertificate  of  title  to  the  person   entitled\r\n\r\nthereto.  This complicated provision really  means\r\n\r\nthat the Collector of Land Revenue is under a duty\r\n\r\nto  give  a certificate to the Registrar  of  Land\r\n\r\nTitles who then registers it. But in the case of a\r\n\r\nstatutory land grant issued under section 4 (1) of\r\n\r\nthe  Crown Lands Ordinance, the Collector of  Land\r\n\r\nRevenue will be faced with this difficulty.  Under\r\n\r\nsection 2 of the Ordinance, a statutory land grant\r\n\r\nis  defined  as  a  grant in  perpetuity,  but  in\r\n\r\nSchedule A, the Form provides for an estate in fee\r\n\r\nsimple by virtue of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords of limitation on \"his heirs and assigns  for\r\n\r\never\".  This  means, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nCollector will either have to follow the words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Form,  in which case it will be  contrary  to\r\n\r\nsection  2; or if he goes according to section  2,\r\n\r\nhe  will not be going in accordance with the  Form\r\n\r\nand Schedule A.

Both  the\r\n\r\noccurence   of   the  disease   and   deaths   are\r\n\r\npreventable by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmunisation, and this Bill is designed to improve\r\n\r\npreventive   measures   by   making   immunisation\r\n\r\ncompulsory for infants and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1938 in the City area and after the Second\r\n\r\nWorld  War  in  the rural area, it  has  been  the\r\n\r\npolicy  to encourage parents to accept inoculation\r\n\r\nagainst   diphtheria   on   a   voluntary   basis.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the  response  has  not  been   as\r\n\r\nencouraging as expected. Only approximately 50 per\r\n\r\ncent   of   the   new-born  every  year   obtained\r\n\r\nimmunisation  by  the voluntary  method.  For  the\r\n\r\neffective  eradication or reduction of diphtheria,\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary that 90 per cent of the children\r\n\r\nshould be immunised. Thus, it is considered to  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  at  his  stage to require  compulsory\r\n\r\nimmunisation  of  all  infants  and  children   by\r\n\r\nprimary  and  booster  diphtheria  inoculation  as\r\n\r\ndefined in clause 2 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory immunisation by legislation is neither\r\n\r\nnew  nor unorthodox. Children are required  to  be\r\n\r\nimmunised against diphtheria in such countries  as\r\n\r\nJapan,  Canada, Germany, France, the U.S.S.R. and\r\n\r\nYugoslavia,  and  it has been  the  experience  of\r\n\r\nthese  countries that such compulsory immunisation\r\n\r\nsharply decreases the incidence of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main immunisation will be effected by\r\n\r\nrequiring  every  child to  be  administered  with\r\n\r\nprimary diphtheria inoculation within 12 months of\r\n\r\nbirth.  Alternatively,  every  child  resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, who is under the age of seven years and\r\n\r\nwho  has  not  been immunised against  diphtheria,\r\n\r\nwill  be required to do so under clause 5  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Booster diphtheria inoculation, which means\r\n\r\na  further  inoculation against diphtheria  for  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  has received a previous  inoculation,\r\n\r\nwill  be  made compulsory for every child residing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore on attaining the age of four  years.\r\n\r\nProvision  is also made for a child  to  obtain  a\r\n\r\nsecond  booster inoculation upon entry to  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool. Clause 6 refers to booster inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill are to ensure that\r\n\r\ninoculation  and intra-dermal test  (to  test  the\r\n\r\nsusceptibility  of  a  person against  diphtheria)\r\n\r\nshall  be  carried out by qualified persons.

Hence, clause\r\n\r\n11  provides  that  the Registrar  of  Births  and\r\n\r\nDeaths  shall issue, after registering a birth,  a\r\n\r\nnotice to the guardian directing his attention  to\r\n\r\nhis responsibilities. I may say that the Registrar\r\n\r\ngoes  through  the same procedure  in  respect  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory small-pox vaccination under section  48\r\n\r\nof   the  Quarantine  and  Prevention  of  Disease\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for penalties for persons who\r\n\r\nrefuse or fail without reasonable excuse to submit\r\n\r\nto  the  provisions of the Bill.  There  are  also\r\n\r\npenalties  for  obtaining false certificates.  You\r\n\r\nwill  note,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that no prosecution\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  any offence shall  be  instituted\r\n\r\nwithout  the  written sanction of the Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to modern medical practice, it is\r\n\r\ndesirable to cease inoculation in the event of  an\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  other  infectious  disease  such  as\r\n\r\npoliomyelitis. That is why clause 13 provides  for\r\n\r\nthe suspension of any or all the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill as a public health measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise clause 14 provides the Minister with\r\n\r\npower  to  declare any area as an area of outbreak\r\n\r\nof diphtheria, and thereupon to require compulsory\r\n\r\ninoculation of all children under 12 years of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage   residing  therein.  In  such  an  emergency,\r\n\r\nimmunisation shall be free of charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for the making of regulations\r\n\r\ngenerally for carrying out the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, and includes any fees or charges that it may\r\n\r\nbe  necessary to levy for the purpose of  carrying\r\n\r\nout  the  provisions  of  the  Bill.  Among  other\r\n\r\nthings, the Minister is also enabled, under clause\r\n\r\n15, to regulate the preparation or preparations to\r\n\r\nbe  used, the number of occasions they are  to  be\r\n\r\nadministered,  the mode of administration  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the Minister to prescribe a\r\n\r\nmaximum  fee  to  be charged by practitioners  who\r\n\r\nadminister  any intra-dermal test or  inoculation.\r\n\r\nThis   is  to  ensure  that  there  shall   be   a\r\n\r\nstandardisation of fee and that, in any emergency,\r\n\r\nno  variation of fees shall be allowed. Of course,\r\n\r\nsuch prescription of fees would not be made unless\r\n\r\na situation to warrant it should arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that this Bill\r\n\r\nrepresents an important step in the fight  against\r\n\r\ndiphtheria, towards eradication of this disease in\r\n\r\nSingapore   by  the  compulsory  immunisation   of\r\n\r\ninfants and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Sheng Nam Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WOMEN'S CHARTER BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

That Bill was referred to a Select  Com\r\n\r\nmittee,  but  before  the  Report  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee   could  be  adopted,  the   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  was  prorogued and the Bill,  therefore,\r\n\r\nlapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to reconsider the\r\n\r\ndetails   of   the   Bill   in   the   light    of\r\n\r\nrepresentations  made before the Select  Committee\r\n\r\non  the former Women's Charter Bill. The result is\r\n\r\nthat  a  number of detailed amendments  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  to  the Bill. As I propose to move that  the\r\n\r\nBill  be referred to a Select Committee, I do  not\r\n\r\nwant, at this stage, to do more than summarise the\r\n\r\nmain changes that have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to make provision for the\r\n\r\nappointment  of Assistant Registrars who  will  be\r\n\r\npublic officers and who will assist the Registrar,\r\n\r\nand who will be able to exercise all the powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar. The definition of \"Registrar\"  has\r\n\r\nbeen  amended to include Assistant Registrar,  and\r\n\r\nclause 25 of the Bill provides for the appointment\r\n\r\nof Assistant Registrars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of prohibited degrees of marriage is now\r\n\r\nset  out  in the First Schedule to the Bill.  This\r\n\r\nfollows  the provisions in the Federation's  Civil\r\n\r\nMarriage  Ordinance,  and  makes  it  clear  which\r\n\r\nparties are prohibited from marriage. In order  to\r\n\r\nenable  marriages  in extremis to  be  solemnized,\r\n\r\npower  is  given to the Minister to  delegate  the\r\n\r\npower  to  issue licences to marry. It is proposed\r\n\r\nthat  this  power  be delegated to  the  heads  of\r\n\r\nreligious  denominations to enable  them  to  give\r\n\r\npower to solemnize marriages in extremis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made for a religious ceremony\r\n\r\nto  be  performed in addition to a civil marriage.\r\n\r\nThe  provision to enable the Minister to  delegate\r\n\r\nthe power to issue licences is contained in clause\r\n\r\n20,  sub-clause (4), and provision  for  religious\r\n\r\nceremonies in marriage is made in clause 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision relating to the rights and duties\r\n\r\nof  husband and wife have been modified,  and  the\r\n\r\nreference to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequal  rights and the ownership and management  of\r\n\r\nthe family properties in clause 45 of the Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen  omitted, as it was suggested that this might\r\n\r\nbe  inconsistent with the provisions  relating  to\r\n\r\nthe property rights of married women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposal to register all marriages\r\n\r\nnot  previously registered has been abandoned.

Today, in this Assembly here, we  want  to\r\n\r\nexpress  the attitude of the Party towards  women,\r\n\r\nand also to express the views and the attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1959 general election, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  said women's problems are problems  to\r\n\r\nbe  resolved after the general election.  We  have\r\n\r\nclearly  expressed  out attitude  towards  women's\r\n\r\nproblems in our Party's Manual. We realise that we\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  until a true and just  society  is\r\n\r\nestablished   before   we  can   resolve   women's\r\n\r\nproblems.  In  a non-socialist government,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  find any equality. The difference between  men\r\n\r\nand  women  presents  a problem.  In  a  socialist\r\n\r\nsociety, women will not be exploited. This is  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  society  that  we  the  P.A.P. want  to\r\n\r\nestablish. In a just and equal society, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  determined to try its best to organise all the\r\n\r\npeople  to fight for a common aim. It is indeed  a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  and long-term task  to  establish\r\n\r\nthis   happy  society.  For  example,  at  present\r\n\r\nwomen's  problems are difficult to  solve  because\r\n\r\nwomen  have  been  oppressed  in  the  past.  Take\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  instance. At present  there  exist\r\n\r\nfeudalistic  ideas and systems. Many colonialistic\r\n\r\nideas still exist. Therefore, women's problems are\r\n\r\nstill  very difficult to solve because  women  are\r\n\r\nfaced   with   these  hardships.   Nowadays,   the\r\n\r\nopportunities for the education of women are  very\r\n\r\nrare  and greatly curtailed. This is because  many\r\n\r\npeople  still  regard women as only  suitable  for\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  home  and not outside  in  society.\r\n\r\nTherefore, women's opportunities to participate in\r\n\r\nsociety  are  very little. Their lot  in  life  is\r\n\r\nsimply  to work very hard in exchange for  a  bare\r\n\r\nmeal.  Under these circumstances, they  have  been\r\n\r\noppressed and exploited by the capitalists.  Women\r\n\r\nlive  in  ignorance,  and do  not  see  their  own\r\n\r\nfuture.   Many   women  waste   their   money   in\r\n\r\nsuperstitious  beliefs  and  gambling.  They   are\r\n\r\noppressed  without  realising  it.  In  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  women's  conditions are even  worse.  Many\r\n\r\nwomen   villagers   do   not   know   what   their\r\n\r\nrelationship with society is. After more than  one\r\n\r\nhundred years of colonialistic control, they still\r\n\r\ndo  not know their difficulties. Education to  the\r\n\r\nvillage  women  means nothing to them.  They  base\r\n\r\ntheir  hopes on gambling like chap-ji-ki and other\r\n\r\ngames and superstitious beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see the women in the city area. Except the\r\n\r\nlabourers,  women  in other walks  of  life  still\r\n\r\nsuffer  oppression.  Their opportunities  are  not\r\n\r\nequal.  For  example, career women are treated  as\r\n\r\nflowers  in a vase. They are not treated  equally.\r\n\r\nMany    employers   treat   women   as   beautiful\r\n\r\ndecorations.  Because  of society's  inequalities,\r\n\r\nwomen  regard themselves as decorations  and  only\r\n\r\nsuitable for work in the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many men marry more than one wife. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwomen do not enjoy full equality in the home. They\r\n\r\ndo  not  enjoy political equality. When  they  are\r\n\r\nhelpless, they are abandoned by their husbands and\r\n\r\ndeprived of their basic rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the above-mentioned facts, women's\r\n\r\nproblems  will  have to be solved. However,  there\r\n\r\nstill  exist  some  different  conditions  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  It is very important to solve all  these\r\n\r\nproblems. We have here many races- Chinese, Malay,\r\n\r\nIndian  and  so  on.  Since  every  race  has  its\r\n\r\npeculiarities, traditions and customs, there exist\r\n\r\ndifferent  forms  of women's problems.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nsolve all these problems with one method. We  have\r\n\r\nto  solve  them  with a common method.  Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  religious problems. We  should  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful   in   solving  them.   We,   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, fully respect the religions and rights\r\n\r\nto  all  races.  So we must be very careful,  when\r\n\r\ntrying  to solve the religious problems of  women,\r\n\r\nnot to go against their religious beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has re-introduced the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.  What  are its effects upon  the  women's\r\n\r\nmovement?   Firstly,  the  Women's  Charter   will\r\n\r\nprevent husbands from abandoning their wives.  The\r\n\r\nBill  will not allow a man to marry more than  one\r\n\r\nwife.  If a husband abandons his wife as he likes,\r\n\r\nthen  he  will  be punished, because abandoning  a\r\n\r\nwife  will  have adverse effects on the family  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  on  society as a whole. We must  make  a\r\n\r\nunited  effort to build a good family and  a  good\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will arouse the emotions of all the\r\n\r\nwomen in Singapore who are suffering and make them\r\n\r\nrealise the fact. We must fight for equality among\r\n\r\nmen and women. This Bill will also enhance women's\r\n\r\nposition  in  society. It will  give  the  women's\r\n\r\nmovement  a very flat and level road on  which  to\r\n\r\ntravel. It will strengthen the confidence of women\r\n\r\nin building a good society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also rectifies the many mistakes made\r\n\r\nin  the  past. Although this Bill will not provide\r\n\r\nfor  equal  pay  among  men and  women,  it  will,\r\n\r\nhowever, make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  fully  realise their political, educational,\r\n\r\ncultural,  and economic equality in society.  This\r\n\r\nmust  be made possible if a good society is to  be\r\n\r\nestablished. Until all this is realised, we cannot\r\n\r\nfind another society in which all these conditions\r\n\r\ncan  be  fulfilled. This Bill acts as a lighthouse\r\n\r\non  the  road to building a good society. It  will\r\n\r\nmake us work harder to attain a better society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must clearly point out here that when the Bill\r\n\r\nbecomes law, many of the women's problems will  be\r\n\r\nfinally  resolved.  This shows  that  the  women's\r\n\r\nmovement  has  a  very good beginning.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthousands   of  women  must,  under   these   good\r\n\r\nconditions, arouse other women, who are suffering,\r\n\r\nto work together and partake in the building of  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which will be for the welfare of all  the\r\n\r\npeople, and to unite with all the other people  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  happy Malaya, it is  only  with  this\r\n\r\nobject in view that we could build a good society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the P.A.P. have suffered hardship and have\r\n\r\ntried  our best to fulfil our Five-Year  Plan.  We\r\n\r\nintroduce this Bill in order to uphold the  rights\r\n\r\nof  women,  so  that all their  problems  will  be\r\n\r\neasily  resolved. At the same time, we have  tried\r\n\r\nour  best to discover the inequalities of men  and\r\n\r\nwomen in the civil service. We pay great attention\r\n\r\nto  women's  problems.  These  problems  were  not\r\n\r\nlooked after by the previous governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us, all the sisters in Singapore,\r\n\r\ntry  our  best and make use of our lives  to  work\r\n\r\nhard  for the emancipation of women so as to build\r\n\r\na just and equal socialistic society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am glad the Minister for Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\nseems to take an interest in the welfare of women.\r\n\r\nI  must congratulate him. What a really wise  step\r\n\r\nhe  has  taken,  by incorporating in  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter   the  advice  of  the  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition. You will remember, Sir, that when  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter came up for debate  in  the  last\r\n\r\nSession  here, the Minister called me names,  such\r\n\r\nas \"a chameleon\", when I pointed out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   inadvisability  of  having  the   compulsory\r\n\r\nregistration  clause.  I  was  ridiculed  when   I\r\n\r\npointed  out that this clause would cause hardship\r\n\r\nto  the  poor.  I  am, therefore, extremely  happy\r\n\r\ntoday, Sir, to see that the Minister now seems  to\r\n\r\nhave changed his views and has begun to see eye to\r\n\r\neye  with  the  Opposition. Instead of  compulsory\r\n\r\nregistration, we now see in the new  Charter,  for\r\n\r\nwant  of a better phrase, \"automatic registration\"\r\n\r\nfor  all marriages which took place before the 2nd\r\n\r\nof  March,  1961.  In view of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the past has been very much inclined\r\n\r\nto  adopt the attitude that Sir Ivor Jennings  and\r\n\r\nLord Hailsham have always warned us against, i.e.,\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  that the Opposition  can  never  be\r\n\r\nright  and  the Government can never be  wrong,  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the Minister for Labour and Law deserves\r\n\r\nspecial  commendation for having  the  courage  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  the advice of the Opposition  in  the\r\n\r\nWomen's   Charter,  when  he   thinks   that   the\r\n\r\nOpposition is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also happy, Sir, to note that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself has acted on the  suggestion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill  regarding  the  Congo\r\n\r\ndonation.  We hope, Sir, that this is a sign  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  at last beginning to  realise  the\r\n\r\nimportance of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would however, Sir, like to make a few\r\n\r\nobservations regarding the other sections  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter and to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law, who I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nis  genuinely interested in the welfare  of  women\r\n\r\nand  children,  that the mere  passing  of  a  law\r\n\r\nprotecting  the  rights of women  is  not  at  all\r\n\r\nsufficient. While it is true, Sir, that  statutory\r\n\r\nlaw  is essential, it is the implementation of the\r\n\r\nlaw  that matters. In this connection, Sir, I hope\r\n\r\nyou  will  permit me to quote Miss Dorothy  Moses,\r\n\r\nRegional  Social Services Officer  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Economic Commission for Asia and the  Far\r\n\r\nEast,  when  she  said  this  two  months  ago  in\r\n\r\nAustralia. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In many countries, such rights exist only on\r\n\r\npaper  and  remain  more  in  the  form  of   good\r\n\r\nintentions, since there is often a very large  gap\r\n\r\nbetween legal provisions for such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunities  and actual practice. In  actuality,\r\n\r\nwomen  in many countries, especially in the\r\n\r\nSouth-east  Asia region, are still ignorant and backward\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, remain deprived of  their  proper\r\n\r\nrights.   They   are  also   an   easy   prey   to\r\n\r\nexploitation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what exploitation she means, Sir;\r\n\r\nprobably-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Husband!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> -it even includes\r\n\r\npolitical exploitation-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To do the washing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> She went on to say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  this situation, if left unremedied, forms  a\r\n\r\nvicious  circle. [Laughter] I am sorry to  see  so\r\n\r\nmuch  fun made of this statement of an expert from\r\n\r\nthe United Nations, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`where the circumstances that force women to live\r\n\r\nunder   these  down-trodden  conditions   continue\r\n\r\nunchanged,  since women are unable to change  them\r\n\r\nunless they are helped to do so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  if  the Government of Singapore were requested\r\n\r\nto  produce a report or paper on the legal  status\r\n\r\nof   women,   political   franchise   for   women,\r\n\r\neligibility  of  women  for public  office,  their\r\n\r\naccess  into  administrative careers, their  civil\r\n\r\nliberties, their economic rights, their  right  to\r\n\r\nretain  their  nationality  after  marriage - I  can\r\n\r\nenvisage  the  glowing report that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment is able to produce. While statutory law\r\n\r\nin  Singapore - contrary to what the Lady Member  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government Bench has said - gives  women  their\r\n\r\nfull rights, there is not a single clause on paper\r\n\r\nthat  prevents women from exercising these rights;\r\n\r\nbut  (and  a very big but at that, Sir) are  these\r\n\r\nrights  being  exercised?  Are  women  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to exercise these rights? I  say  they\r\n\r\nare  not. Far from helping women to exercise these\r\n\r\nrights,  there is actually discrimination  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   against  women.  For  example,   Sir,\r\n\r\npolicewomen   who  have  served   faithfully   and\r\n\r\nefficiently  for  12 years are  still  serving  as\r\n\r\nInspectors  only  while their  men  contemporaries\r\n\r\nhave  reached at least the rank of A.S.P.  When  I\r\n\r\ndrew the attention of the Government at a previous\r\n\r\nsitting  to  women not getting equal treatment  in\r\n\r\nGovernment service, what was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  reply from the Minister for Finance? He  said\r\n\r\nhe believed that while all men are all equal, some\r\n\r\nmen  are  more equal than others. Sir, I ask  you,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the use of passing grand statutory  laws\r\n\r\nthat  give  women their rights when, in  practice,\r\n\r\nevery   effort  is  made  to  prevent  them   from\r\n\r\nexercising them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the hon. Lady on the Government Bench\r\n\r\ndid  agree  that  women can be  exploited  without\r\n\r\ntheir  realising it. I hope the Government is  not\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of this. May I again quote  Miss\r\n\r\nDorothy Moses? She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Women have a resignation to their lot and also\r\n\r\nfeelings  of dependency and insecurity which  they\r\n\r\nhave  developed  over a period of  suppression  of\r\n\r\ntheir true selves. It thus becomes evident that if\r\n\r\nchanges are considered desirable, women are to  be\r\n\r\nhelped to overcome their resistance to them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been universally accepted, Sir, that the\r\n\r\neconomic  independence of the woman of  today  has\r\n\r\nbeen to a very great extent responsible for giving\r\n\r\nher  a  self-sufficient sense of security to  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  shoulder her share of responsibility\r\n\r\nas  a  good citizen of the State. If this is true,\r\n\r\nSir,  then  the deprivation of equal  remuneration\r\n\r\nfor  equal work is certainly not only an  obstacle\r\n\r\nwhich prevents the woman from utilising the rights\r\n\r\ngranted  to her by the statutory law of the  State\r\n\r\nbut  also deprives her of the opportunity to  play\r\n\r\nher  true  role as an associate to her husband  in\r\n\r\nthe keeping of her home as required by the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter,  and  also in the building of  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nnation as promised in \"The Tasks Ahead\". One would\r\n\r\nexpect  to  find in a Women's Charter  machineries\r\n\r\nwhich  will help the woman to exercise her  rights\r\n\r\nfully  as  a  human  being and  to  give  her  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to play her true role as a good  wife,\r\n\r\na mother and a citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support wholeheartedly the idea of one\r\n\r\nman  one wife. But I am afraid, Sir, that I do not\r\n\r\nsee  how  this Charter gives political  rights  to\r\n\r\nwomen when they already exist, otherwise the  hon.\r\n\r\nLady  on the Government Bench and I would  not  be\r\n\r\nstanding  up here talking. She also says that  the\r\n\r\nCharter  educates women. I am afraid I cannot  see\r\n\r\nhow this Charter educates women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  she says the Charter makes women work harder.\r\n\r\nI thought this is not the reason why Government is\r\n\r\nputting  in  this Charter - only to make women  work\r\n\r\nharder - instead of giving them a rest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I must say this Charter falls\r\n\r\nvery short of what one might expect from a Women's\r\n\r\nCharter,  and I do hope the Select Committee  will\r\n\r\nsee its way to making it worthy of its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing\r\n\r\ntwo  charming  ladies  on opposite  sides  arguing\r\n\r\nagainst  each other, it is only a foolish man  who\r\n\r\ndares to step in between!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Charter meant for women, and it is\r\n\r\nsignificant  the Minister did not  say  much  when\r\n\r\nmoving the Second Reading of the Bill. It was left\r\n\r\nto  the Lady Member for Delta who stood up and her\r\n\r\nvery  first  words were, \"We thank the  Government\r\n\r\nfor  doing this.\" And she ended up by saying, \"We,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government, are doing this.\" Therefore,\r\n\r\nmay  I suggest that she need not thank herself for\r\n\r\nwhat  she thinks she is doing, because self-thanks\r\n\r\nare no thanks at all? Self-praise is no praise  at\r\n\r\nall.  I  felt  that I had to step in  because  she\r\n\r\nsaid, \"The previous Government did nothing for the\r\n\r\nwomen.\"  I  think it was because of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment that there are so many women sitting in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.  She  said  that  there  were   no\r\n\r\npolitical rights for women. Does she not know that\r\n\r\nthese  political rights have been given  to  women\r\n\r\neven  before the P.A.P. came into existence?  Even\r\n\r\nbefore the P.A.P. came into existence, there  were\r\n\r\nthese  rights going as far back as 1948  when  the\r\n\r\nfirst  elections  were held.  She  said  that  not\r\n\r\nenough education rights were given to women. May I\r\n\r\npoint  out that there are so many women, including\r\n\r\nthe  ladies  on the opposite side, who  have  been\r\n\r\neducated  under  administrations  that  were   not\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she was trying to point out that women have\r\n\r\nbeen  suffering  a  lot of things  under  previous\r\n\r\nadministrations, and that therefore it  is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government to do what it can to protect\r\n\r\nthe rights of women. We agreed last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear that it is right that one man should have one\r\n\r\nwife. That is all the Charter seeks to do - one  man\r\n\r\none  wife. The Charter goes further, no doubt.  It\r\n\r\nprotects the property rights of women. Other  than\r\n\r\nthat,  there  is  nothing  in  the  Charter   that\r\n\r\nreadjusts the inequalities and injustices that the\r\n\r\nLady Member for Delta would have us believe are in\r\n\r\nexistence.   Although  the  property  rights   are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be protected under this Charter,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not give full protection at all. Although  a\r\n\r\nwife under this Women's Charter can claim that she\r\n\r\nhas  a legal right to the property of her husband,\r\n\r\nyet  there  is nothing in this Charter to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  man  to will his property before he  dies  to\r\n\r\nanother  woman who is not his wife. Where then  is\r\n\r\nthe protection to the legal wife of the man? Where\r\n\r\nthen is this protection which the hon. Lady Member\r\n\r\nfor Delta says the P.A.P. is giving to the married\r\n\r\nwomen of Singapore? The Government says, \"One  man\r\n\r\nshould  have  one  wife.\" We know,  Sir,  in  this\r\n\r\npresent  world which man dares to have  more  than\r\n\r\none wife, but there is nothing in this Charter  to\r\n\r\nsay  that a man cannot have mistresses. The Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has pointed that out. What is there\r\n\r\nin  this  Charter to prevent a man from  having  a\r\n\r\nlegal   wife  and  having  three  charming  ladies\r\n\r\noutside   as   mistresses?  Where  then   is   the\r\n\r\nprotection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> When did I say that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister asks\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said it.

Now,   there  is  to  be   no   compulsory\r\n\r\nregistration. Under the new clause 166, it is only\r\n\r\nvalid  marriages  which  shall  be  deemed  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered  under  this law.  Where  then  is  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  clause  32?  It  makes   it   more\r\n\r\nconfusing.  It  says  that  although  you  may  be\r\n\r\nproperly married and properly registered, yet that\r\n\r\nregistration  can be valid. It had substance  last\r\n\r\nyear  when  there was the intention of  compulsory\r\n\r\nregistration.

But I want to stress the\r\n\r\npoint  that  I  must  take part  in  this  debate,\r\n\r\ninstead  of just listening to speeches, since  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Cairnhill  and  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  have said certain things with  regard\r\n\r\nto  the Women's Charter and they have caused  some\r\n\r\nlaughter.

I do not understand  why  they\r\n\r\nare averse to and so critical of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already stated that this Bill is\r\n\r\nre-introduced  to  suit  existing circumstances,  and\r\n\r\nthat it will have a great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  rights of women and  so  on.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in this debate, I have  a  certain\r\n\r\nfeeling  which  it is difficult to describe.  This\r\n\r\nCharter  has been under consideration for  a  very\r\n\r\nlong  time.  We have re-introduced it  and  it  is\r\n\r\nhaving its Second Reading today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Women's Charter because it is a\r\n\r\nvery healthy and progressive Bill. No matter how a\r\n\r\nperson  views  it,  he will see  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to the people of Singapore.  We  must\r\n\r\nrecognise this fact. Why is it a progressive Bill?\r\n\r\nIt  is  because it can remove all the maladies  in\r\n\r\nregard   to  women's  problems  under  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution and under the old administration. But\r\n\r\nnow  the  re-introduction of  this  Bill  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly is a fact that we cannot deny. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is a progressive Bill. Although we cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat  this Women's Charter has any concrete effect\r\n\r\non  our sisters, yet we understand clearly that we\r\n\r\nmust  support  this  Bill as long  as  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the people but is beneficial to the\r\n\r\npeople.   But  here  I  feel  that  I   have   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon.

I\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary to elucidate a few points in\r\n\r\nregard to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do some people think that the Women's Charter\r\n\r\ncannot  have  a very great effect on our  sisters?\r\n\r\nBecause under the present circumstances we  cannot\r\n\r\nachieve  very great results by this Bill,  because\r\n\r\nin  the  present political situation in Singapore,\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is  still affected by the colonialists,\r\n\r\nand  our aims and long-term policies have not been\r\n\r\nrealised.  Therefore,  how  could  we  deal   with\r\n\r\nwomen's   problems?  Because  all  these   women's\r\n\r\nproblems  are  related to our  circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  our present age, we therefore  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  very  great  assistance in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\ncarrying  into  effect  of this  Women's  Charter,\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   are  limited  by  our  constitution  and  our\r\n\r\nprevailing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all people could understand our viewpoint,\r\n\r\ni.e., they should not misunderstand our intentions\r\n\r\nregarding  the  re-introduction  of  this  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.  They  must not think that  we  have  not\r\n\r\ngiven  consideration  to it before  re-introducing\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I must second the decision of all our\r\n\r\nsisters   in   casting  away  doubts   and   other\r\n\r\nmisgivings  in relation to this Bill  and  women's\r\n\r\nrights.  I must also stress that we must not  have\r\n\r\nvery rosy dreams. We must not hope too much beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable  logic,  because  we  women  are  under\r\n\r\noppression by two sides. Therefore, we cannot  see\r\n\r\nan  immediate  practical improvement  by  the \r\n\r\nre-introduction of this Bill. Anyway, I can see  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  a progressive one and it will contribute\r\n\r\nto the welfare of our sisters so as to enable them\r\n\r\nto  carry  on their struggle. I fully support  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Delta  who  has  said  the\r\n\r\nre-introduction of this Bill will enable us to  carry\r\n\r\non  our duty in respect of women's contribution to\r\n\r\nsociety.  For  this reason, I feel  very  honoured\r\n\r\nthat  our P.A.P. Government has re-introduced this\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we are re-introducing this\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter.  We have been  attacked  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, but we the  P.A.P. base  our\r\n\r\nefforts  on  reality. Their unsatisfied criticisms\r\n\r\ndo  not merit our attention. The problems of women\r\n\r\nhave  been  neglected in the past.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nafter 140 years under colonial rule and under  the\r\n\r\nformer Lim Yew Hock Government, they had not  paid\r\n\r\nmuch  attention to the problems of women. Did they\r\n\r\nfeel  sorry  for  it, especially  our  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,   when  they  were   governing   this\r\n\r\ncountry?  Had  they done anything  beneficial  for\r\n\r\nwomen?  That is why today they are still  shouting\r\n\r\ncriticisms  at  us.  These  criticisms  will   not\r\n\r\ncontribute  anything constructive  to  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThey  had  let us down. They had disappointed  us.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  regard to the stand adopted by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  solve women's problems, we would like to carry\r\n\r\nout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  job in stages. Only we the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas  the  courage to attempt a solution. Is  there\r\n\r\nany  other  Party  which dares  to  take  up  this\r\n\r\nproblem?  We  are  proud of  our  stand.  We  have\r\n\r\nclearly written down and declared in our Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan what we will do for the welfare of women.  We\r\n\r\nwant true equality between men and women, just  as\r\n\r\nwhat  our  colleagues have said: that the solution\r\n\r\nto  the  problems of women will have to await  the\r\n\r\ncoming of a true socialist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain these points to the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers.  We  have said before that under  a  more\r\n\r\njust  society, there are no women's problems.  But\r\n\r\nwe  have not come to a socialist society. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have women's problems. If we  reach  that\r\n\r\nstage, then we believe we shall improve the lot of\r\n\r\nwomen.  According  to the principle  of  a  social\r\n\r\nevolution, people are equal, irrespective of their\r\n\r\nreligion,  creed  or sex. There will  not  be  any\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  man by man.  All  this  will  be\r\n\r\nabolished. This will be so only under a more  just\r\n\r\nsociety.  If  you want to raise the  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  standing of women, then we  have  to  work\r\n\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is a long-term one, and I will only\r\n\r\npoint  out  one thing. We do not say that  we  can\r\n\r\nsolve all the women's problems at this stage. What\r\n\r\nwe  say,  we  mean.  But  regarding  this  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter,  the  Opposition Members have  said  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot recognise that our intention is good.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the details of the Charter, we may\r\n\r\nhave  made some mistakes, but any good thing  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be considered so many times. As for  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms on clause 166, they cannot say that our\r\n\r\nintention is a bad one. One who has been liberated\r\n\r\nfrom   double  oppression  knows  full  well   the\r\n\r\nproblems of women. Therefore, we are proud that we\r\n\r\nare re-introducing this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I had not intended to  enter  into\r\n\r\nthis  controversy  and  pronounce  an  opinion  on\r\n\r\nmatters  on  which I am not fully an expert.  But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, since the Member for Mountbatten has\r\n\r\nquoted me somewhat erroneously, I am afraid I feel\r\n\r\nobliged to stand up and say a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not recollect quoting in this Assembly that\r\n\r\nfamous  passage  from  George  Orwell  about   the\r\n\r\nequality   of  men.  But  I  did  remember,   when\r\n\r\ndiscussing pay differentials between men and women\r\n\r\nteachers, that I did say that while we agree  that\r\n\r\nwomen   workers  are  equal  to  men,  there   are\r\n\r\noccupations when men are more equal. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten, in taking up the  example\r\n\r\nof  women Inspectors, merely brings out the  point\r\n\r\nwhich  I am trying to develop. She says that women\r\n\r\nInspectors  remain in the ranks for  12  years  or\r\n\r\nmore, while many men Inspectors have been promoted\r\n\r\nto  higher  grades. But surely that  is  just  the\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us suppose a Member of the Assembly is in a\r\n\r\ndifficult position. Let us say he is about  to  be\r\n\r\nassaulted by some tough gangsters. Would he prefer\r\n\r\nthen, in that situation, Mr Speaker, Sir, to have\r\n\r\nby  his side a very robust man police officer,  or\r\n\r\none  of the women Inspectors?

Therefore, in the conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice,  there  must  be regard  to  differential\r\n\r\nability, and, therefore, different terms  of  pay.\r\n\r\nBut what has always struck me as rather curious is\r\n\r\nthe  regulation  about retirement  which  requires\r\n\r\nwomen to retire at an earlier age than men. I  did\r\n\r\nraise  this  point once in this Assembly.  I  said\r\n\r\nthat  the vital statistics of all countries  prove\r\n\r\nbeyond all doubt that women live longer than  men,\r\n\r\nby  at  least  five or ten years; and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthey should retire five years later than men,  not\r\n\r\nearlier.  We would not want to have large  numbers\r\n\r\nof  our  population living on Government  pensions\r\n\r\nfor decades. So the Member for Mountbatten will be\r\n\r\ndelighted to know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I brought up this matter with my colleagues,\r\n\r\nand  although I could not gain my point that women\r\n\r\nshould  retire  at  a  later  age,  we  reached  a\r\n\r\ncompromise  and agreed that women and  men  should\r\n\r\nretire at the same age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to be more serious, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I\r\n\r\ncan  go  back  to the theme, and it is  a  serious\r\n\r\ntheme.  I  do not think Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwere  justified in making remarks about the  women\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government side so lightly, and  on\r\n\r\noccasions  so  derisively.  We  agree  that   this\r\n\r\nWomen's   Charter,  like  any   other   piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation, gives only the protective  framework.\r\n\r\nIn  itself,  it  cannot establish any  new  social\r\n\r\ncodes  of  behaviour. But the  difference  between\r\n\r\nwomen  Members on the Government side and  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition is that our  Members,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of their work and in the course  of  their\r\n\r\nlives,  have  come  across  so  many  examples  of\r\n\r\ninequality and oppression of women. These  phrases\r\n\r\nare not the catch phrases of politicians or people\r\n\r\nwho   go  abroad  to  attend  conferences  on  the\r\n\r\nequality of women. They see this as part of  their\r\n\r\ncommon experience, and, therefore, to them this is\r\n\r\na  real  problem, a genuine problem, and one  that\r\n\r\nrequires  immediate  and determined  action.  This\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation is only the beginning.  But\r\n\r\nthe  more  basic work - and this is the  point  that\r\n\r\nwomen  Members on the Government bench  have  been\r\n\r\nstressing - the  more urgent need is to  arouse  the\r\n\r\nconsciousness  of  women in our society,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  more  effectively stand  up  for  their\r\n\r\nrights,  and it is only the women who can  do  so.\r\n\r\nHowever  well disposed a man is, you can  be  sure\r\n\r\nthat there is in his unconscious mind some lurking\r\n\r\ndread whether or not the Government, with the best\r\n\r\nof intentions, might not have gone too far. But  I\r\n\r\nwould say that both the women Members and the  men\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government benches treat this as  a\r\n\r\nvery  real  and  genuine problem. When  they  talk\r\n\r\nabout  women, they do not think in terms of  women\r\n\r\nwho play mahjong, or who give charity balls or who\r\n\r\ndo  occasional  social work in  order  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir existence. We are thinking of women in  poor\r\n\r\nfamilies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the slums, in families where the sons are given\r\n\r\neducation  in preference to daughters,  where  the\r\n\r\nold force of the patriarchal family still remains,\r\n\r\nand  it is for this reason that the P.A.P.,  as  a\r\n\r\npolitical Party, has developed a conscious  policy\r\n\r\nin  regard to women. It is not, as I have said, an\r\n\r\nacademic  problem,  but it  is  a  real  one,  and\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Government Front Bench  are  fully\r\n\r\naware  of  it  and treat it as a real and  genuine\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister please wait for\r\n\r\none  second?

On that occasion, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, she said in this Assembly that  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter Bill was a fraud on the women  of\r\n\r\nSingapore; that, in fact, there was nothing new in\r\n\r\nthe  proposal that there should be monogamy in our\r\n\r\ncommunity; that it was a shame for the Charter  to\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  in this form, in  the  sense  that\r\n\r\nprovisions  for the suppression of  brothels  were\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  Bill which purported  to  be  a\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, as I\r\n\r\nhave   pointed  out  before,  is  worthy  of   the\r\n\r\ndescription  of being a Women's Charter.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time, if it is approved by this Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly, there will be monogamy in our community.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  the practice of a man being  restricted\r\n\r\nto  one wife has been restricted only to those who\r\n\r\nare Christians. The greater bulk of our population\r\n\r\nare  not Christians. If this Bill becomes law, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it  will,  for  the  first   time,\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  new principle in  our  community.\r\n\r\nThere  is no point in our talking about the rights\r\n\r\nof  women  and  so on unless the  woman  is  first\r\n\r\nregarded as the mistress in her own home.  If  she\r\n\r\nhas  to  share  her home with somebody  else,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  say that that is an ideal community,  that\r\n\r\nthat  is a community where the interests of  women\r\n\r\nare well served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, right through this law, if it\r\n\r\nis  looked  into carefully, I have  no  doubt  all\r\n\r\nthese  points could not have escaped the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Farrer Park. He has been  very\r\n\r\nsilent  this  afternoon.  He  knows  this  Charter\r\n\r\nbetter  than  any other Member of the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nbecause he spent quite long hours with us  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee proceedings which  went  to  250\r\n\r\npages.  He  will realise, and I have no  doubt  he\r\n\r\ndoes  realise,  that this Bill is  worthy  of  the\r\n\r\ndescription  which  we, as  the  Government,  have\r\n\r\napplied to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition have now said\r\n\r\nthat  they are glad to know that we have  profited\r\n\r\nby  the advice they have given us. They have  said\r\n\r\nit  is  a  good  thing  we have  now  dropped  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  with regard to the re-registration  of\r\n\r\nformer  marriages. Mr Speaker, Sir, we had  every\r\n\r\nintention of referring the former Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee from the very beginning, and we  did  do\r\n\r\nso.  We  wanted to invite comments not  only  from\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition on the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill,   but  also  comments  from  all  interested\r\n\r\nparties.   We  did  receive  quite  a  number   of\r\n\r\nrepresentations from members of the general public\r\n\r\nand,   as   a  result  of  those  representations,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided to  drop  the  provisions\r\n\r\nregarding re-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nsaid  just now that this is not the document  that\r\n\r\nit claims to be, in the sense that whether we have\r\n\r\nthis  Charter or not, a man is always free to will\r\n\r\nhis  property to any person he wants. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for the first time, a similar right is given\r\n\r\nto  a  married woman under the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  I  would refer the Member for Cairnhill  to\r\n\r\nclause  47 (1) of the Bill in which it is provided\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A married woman shall, in accordance with this\r\n\r\nPart  of  this Ordinance, be capable of acquiring,\r\n\r\nholding and disposing by will or otherwise of  any\r\n\r\nmovable  or  immovable property  as  her  separate\r\n\r\nproperty, in the same manner as if she were a feme\r\n\r\nsole, without the intervention of any trustee.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The position of a married woman then is equated in\r\n\r\nall  respects with that of her husband  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this law. Mr Speaker, there  are  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions in this law which protect the interests\r\n\r\nof  women and children. I need only refer to  Part\r\n\r\nVII  of the Bill which deals with the question  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance of wife and children; Part VIII  which\r\n\r\ndeals  with the enforcement of maintenance orders;\r\n\r\nPart  IX  which deals with divorce; and  the  last\r\n\r\nsections   of  the  Bill  which  deal   with   the\r\n\r\nprotection of women and girls generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer again to what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill said just now. He thought\r\n\r\nthat clause 32 is unnecessary. I would submit, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with respect, that clause 32 is very\r\n\r\nnecessary, because although registration gives one\r\n\r\nthe  right to regard a marriage as being  a  valid\r\n\r\nmarriage, there might be circumstances which  have\r\n\r\noccured  which,  if  proved,  would  be  able   to\r\n\r\nestablish that though registered, the marriage  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  valid  marriage  and  that  provision  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary in a Bill of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I call the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse  to the fact that the operative date of  the\r\n\r\nBill  has been put forward to the 2nd March, 1961,\r\n\r\nand   that  has  been  done  to  regularise  those\r\n\r\nmarriages  which have taken place under  customary\r\n\r\nlaw  between 2nd March, 1960, (when this Bill  was\r\n\r\nfirst introduced) and the time when this Bill will\r\n\r\nbe passed into law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to inform the\r\n\r\nHouse that since the original Bill was introduced,\r\n\r\nthere  have been more marriages solemnized in  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Marriages than there have been in  the\r\n\r\nlast  six  years.  So from that  alone,  it  would\r\n\r\nindicate  that  this Bill is, by and  large,  well\r\n\r\nsupported by the whole of our community, and  that\r\n\r\nthey  have now accepted the position that monogamy\r\n\r\nis to be their rightful lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker as Chairman and seven other Members to  be\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the  Committee of  Selection  -[Mr\r\n\r\nByrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN'S CHARTER BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

They  have   therefore\r\n\r\nagreed    to   present   this   report   of    the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  received  and  the   Minutes   of\r\n\r\nEvidence  taken before them and to recommend  that\r\n\r\nshould  a  similar Bill be introduced in the  next\r\n\r\nSession  and  should the Bill be  committed  to  a\r\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, this report be referred to  that\r\n\r\nSelect Committee for consideration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter Bill has been redrafted in\r\n\r\nthe  light of the representations made, and it has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced in this Session.

You  will be glad to know  that  under\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance, three loans totalling $70 million\r\n\r\nwere successfully floated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our development planning, loan capital is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  a major source  of  finance.  As\r\n\r\nMembers  would  have noted from  the  Government's\r\n\r\nfinancial talks with the United Kingdom Government\r\n\r\nin 1960, it is the intention to raise loan capital\r\n\r\nboth  locally  as  well as from external  sources.\r\n\r\nMembers  would  know, that in  this  context,  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom Government agreed to provide to the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government Exchequer loans of up  to  \ufffd5\r\n\r\nmillion  or  $42.5  million to meet  part  of  our\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure under the Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Plan itself was prepared last\r\n\r\nyear  and completed before my departure in  August\r\n\r\nto  the  United Kingdom for financial  talks.  The\r\n\r\noriginal   Plan   covered  a   five-year   period,\r\n\r\n1959/1964. As a result of further discussions with\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank Mission who visited Singapore last\r\n\r\nSeptember, and taking into account the  result  of\r\n\r\nour    financial   discussions   with   the   U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment, it was necessary to revise  in  detail\r\n\r\nsome  aspects  of  the Plan. I  referred  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter  in  my  last Budget Speech.  The  work  of\r\n\r\nrevision was an intricate operation. However,  the\r\n\r\nexercise  was completed by the end of  January  of\r\n\r\nthis  year and the Plan is now with the Government\r\n\r\nPrinters. I intend to present the Development Plan\r\n\r\nat  the  next  sitting  of the  Assembly  for  its\r\n\r\napproval  on  the 12th of April.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nlapse   of  time  since  the  original  Plan   was\r\n\r\nprepared,  it  is necessary to restrict  the  Plan\r\n\r\nperiod  to  four years, i.e., 1960/64. To  finance\r\n\r\nthe  Plan  expenditure, loans will be raised  both\r\n\r\nlocally  and  overseas. The  original  Development\r\n\r\nLoan (Local) Ordinance, 1959, does not provide for\r\n\r\nloans  raised externally. The Bill now before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  provides, in section 3, for the raising  of\r\n\r\nloans in the London money market and for Exchequer\r\n\r\nloans negotiated with the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have occasion to raise loans from other\r\n\r\nexternal  sources, such as the World Bank  or  the\r\n\r\nImport and Export Bank, it may be necessary either\r\n\r\nto  pass amending legislation or to introduce  new\r\n\r\nlegislation. These matters are being  examined  in\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry. But it is best to leave  that  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate exercise and deal with it as and when the\r\n\r\noccasion arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us, in addition to providing for\r\n\r\nloans  raised in the United Kingdom,  also  raises\r\n\r\nthe ceiling from $100 million to $400 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a substantial sum. But the amount is well\r\n\r\nwithin  the  borrowing capacity of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  provided the yield from  our  revenues\r\n\r\ncontinues  to expand, as it had done  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears,  and  provided also that strict control  is\r\n\r\nmaintained over annually recurrent expenditure  to\r\n\r\navoid waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Plan provides for a total\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $871 million in the years  1960/64.\r\n\r\nI  do  not wish to enter into a discourse  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan as this is properly a subject for\r\n\r\nthe  next  sitting  of  the Assembly.  But  I  may\r\n\r\nperhaps  be  permitted to say a few words  on  the\r\n\r\nurgency  of  the  problem.  The  main  outline  is\r\n\r\nfamiliar  enough  to all thinking  persons.  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking  about the outline of the problem and  not\r\n\r\nthe  outline of the plan. Here we are in the small\r\n\r\nisland  State  with  no  natural  resources.   Our\r\n\r\npopulation  is  expanding at  a  prodigious  rate.\r\n\r\nUnless  something is done immediately,  and  on  a\r\n\r\nscale  unprecedented in our history, a decline  in\r\n\r\nstandards of living in Singapore is inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No country in the world owes Singapore a\r\n\r\nlivelihood. They have even less responsibility  to\r\n\r\nassure our prosperity. Our standard of living, one\r\n\r\nof the highest in Asia, is due to the exertions of\r\n\r\nour   own  people,  their  thrift,  industry   and\r\n\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today Singapore faces a problem that she has\r\n\r\nnever had to face before. In the past, when things\r\n\r\nwere  really bad, large numbers of the  population\r\n\r\nreturned to their homeland, for the great majority\r\n\r\nof  the population in pre-war years, for instance,\r\n\r\nwas  of  immigrant origin. So we saw in the  great\r\n\r\ndepression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the  1930's  the  spectacle  of  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands of people returning to China and  India.\r\n\r\nBut  today our population is a settled one.  There\r\n\r\nis  no place for us to escape to, should things go\r\n\r\nbad.  Hence  it  is  the  responsibility  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that everything will be  done\r\n\r\nwithin  the limits of its capability to build  for\r\n\r\nthe   future.  The  Bill  before  us  enables  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to build up the sinews of the  economic\r\n\r\nstrength of the State. The effort that has  to  be\r\n\r\nmounted is an immense one for there is no easy way\r\n\r\nout, faced as we are in a very tight situation  in\r\n\r\nwhich   the   population   is   outstripping   our\r\n\r\nresources. I shall deal with this theme in greater\r\n\r\nlength at the next sitting of the Assembly when  I\r\n\r\npresent the Development Plan. In the meantime, all\r\n\r\nI  need say is that this Bill is intended to  make\r\n\r\npossible   the   mobilisation  of  our   financial\r\n\r\nresources to make this Development Plan effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Finance Minister,  in  moving  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of the Bill, informed  the  House\r\n\r\nthat  the  intention of this Bill was to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling  which had been set for the  previous\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Loan  (Local) Ordinance,  No.  50  of\r\n\r\n1959,  from $100 million to $400 million. He  also\r\n\r\ninformed   the  House  that  under  the   previous\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  $70 million had already  been  raised,\r\n\r\nleaving  $30  million still to be raised.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the Finance Minister could inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse   whether  it  is  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  raise  $400  million  under   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and to raise another $30 million  under\r\n\r\nthe  previous Ordinance; or what the intention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  is.  Under  this  Bill,  although  the\r\n\r\nexplanatory  statement says that it  replaces  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Loan (Local) Ordinance, 1959, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  repeal  that Ordinance. Therefore,  it  could\r\n\r\nwell  be  that the Government, if it chose,  could\r\n\r\nraise  the  full $400 million under this Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  go  for the balance of the $30 million  under\r\n\r\nthe Development Loan (Local)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1959.  The Schedule is  not  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  any  repealing  section.  It  is  merely   a\r\n\r\nSchedule  concerned  with the  definition  of  the\r\n\r\nexpression \"local stock\". So that if this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  the Government will, in effect,  have  at\r\n\r\nits disposal two Ordinances under which they could\r\n\r\nraise  loans up to $430 million, if they  felt  so\r\n\r\ndisposed.  I  am not saying that they  should  not\r\n\r\nraise  that  loan  but, if the ceiling  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment propose for the development  loan  over\r\n\r\nthe  next  four  years is $400  million,  then  it\r\n\r\nappears  that  the  Government  could,  under  the\r\n\r\nstatutory provisions, if this Bill is passed, draw\r\n\r\non  another $30 million. That is the first  point,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a matter of detail on clauses\r\n\r\n3  and 4 which I will raise in Committee when  the\r\n\r\nBill is moved into Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to\r\n\r\nclarify the point raised by the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark.

Clause 6 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any, loan raised under paragraph (c) of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  of  section 3 of  this  Ordinance\r\n\r\nshall  be  on such terms as may be agreed  between\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and the Secretary of State and shall\r\n\r\nbe  repaid by equal annual instalments of  capital\r\n\r\nand  interest combined so that such loan shall  be\r\n\r\nrepaid  within the period for which the  same  was\r\n\r\ngranted.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  clause 4, as it now stands, does  not  state\r\n\r\nwhether  or not moneys raised under clause  3  (2)\r\n\r\n(c) become payable out of the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question I ask the Minister for Finance is\r\n\r\nthis. If it is not payable out of the Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund,  then  out of what fund would he propose  to\r\n\r\nrepay any loans incurred under clause 3 (2) (c)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not think I can accept\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation of the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nClause  4  will  not have any relevance  to  loans\r\n\r\nraised  under clause 3 (2) (c) - that is,  Exchequer\r\n\r\nloans.  I would have thought that Exchequer  loans\r\n\r\nwould  have  come within the definition  of  loans\r\n\r\nraised  in the United Kingdom under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Bill, and therefore would be chargeable to\r\n\r\nthe Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the interpretation of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance is correct, then that is so.

It appears  to  me\r\n\r\nthat that phrase could only refer to clause 3  (2)\r\n\r\n(b).
