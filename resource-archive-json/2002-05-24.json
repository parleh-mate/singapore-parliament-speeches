These\r\n\r\nobjectives  have  been  met.  This is  evident  in  the  many\r\n\r\nimprovements made by Town Councils to the common property and\r\n\r\nthe  transformation  of  HDB  housing  estates  into  vibrant\r\n\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial years, Town Councils focused on the\r\n\r\nhardware aspect of estate management.  Their role has evolved\r\n\r\nover   the   years  to  include  the  promotion   of   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  community  bonding  amongst   residents,\r\n\r\nthrough  close  collaboration with the Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  and  other  grassroots organisations.   The  Annual\r\n\r\nIsland-Wide Cleanest Estate Competition and Annual Town  Days\r\n\r\nare some examples of such collaborative efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of our surveys in the past has been on how\r\n\r\nsatisfied residents are with the maintenance of their estates\r\n\r\nand  the  quality  of  the  services  provided  by  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils.   These  results have been positive  so  far.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in a survey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconducted  in  2000, 96.2% of the respondents  gave  a  \"very\r\n\r\nclean  or clean\" rating to their towns, as compared  to  only\r\n\r\n67.1%  in  1996.  Secondly, as far as enforcement actions  by\r\n\r\nTown  Councils are concerned, 88% of the respondents  gave  a\r\n\r\n\"very  effective  or effective\" rating as  compared  to  only\r\n\r\n78.5% in the 1996 survey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be more meaningful for Town Councils to conduct\r\n\r\nspecific  surveys to assess their own efforts  at  the  local\r\n\r\nlevel in shaping social behaviour and attitude, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan   tailor  their  programmes  accordingly.   Several  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils, for example, Marine Parade, East Coast and  Bishan-Toa  Payoh,  have  in  fact taken the initiative  to  conduct\r\n\r\nsurveys on their own performance.  We would like to encourage\r\n\r\nother Town Councils to follow their lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE AND SHANGHAI</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Comparison as a vibrant city)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand Industry (a) how is Singapore compared with Shanghai as a\r\n\r\nvibrant city with a lot of \"buzz\" which is good for business,\r\n\r\nand  (b)  how  do  we create and maintain  such  vibrancy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I interpret Mrs Yu-Foo's question to\r\n\r\nbe about the competition between Singapore and Shanghai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China continues on its path of economic growth,\r\n\r\nShanghai  will be one of the world's greatest cities  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  decades.   In  many ways, it will  reclaim  its  pre-eminent position in Asia, which was its status in the 1930s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `buzz' in Shanghai is the result of the sheer\r\n\r\nconcentration  of  human  talent  there.   Even  before  Deng\r\n\r\nXiaoping's  reform  and opening up of  the  Chinese  economy,\r\n\r\nShanghai  contributed disproportionately to China's economic,\r\n\r\nscientific, political, intellectual and cultural life.   Once\r\n\r\nChina opened up, Shanghai's natural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvitality   expressed  itself,  helped  by  a  very  competent\r\n\r\nmunicipal leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mrs Yu-Foo worries whether Shanghai is a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  threat to Singapore.  Well, in some sectors,  we\r\n\r\ncompete  as  we  do  with other cities.   But,  overall,  no.\r\n\r\nShanghai's  growth  and prosperity will  help  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nentire region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, the people there worry a lot about\r\n\r\nShanghai  because the two cities are geographically not  very\r\n\r\nfar  apart.   And after 1997, there is a feeling  among  Hong\r\n\r\nKongers that Shanghai is the eldest son on whom Beijing  will\r\n\r\nshower the greatest favour.  For this reason, Chinese leaders\r\n\r\ntake  great pains to assure the people of Hong Kong that they\r\n\r\nwill be looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore, we are actually quite far away from\r\n\r\nShanghai.  It takes almost five hours to fly there  which  is\r\n\r\nabout  the same time it takes to fly from London to Jerusalem\r\n\r\nor  from  Washington  to  Los Angeles.   Although  China  and\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia compete for FDI, Singapore's relationship with\r\n\r\nShanghai is largely cooperative and complementary.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason, we have been building up our presence in Shanghai and\r\n\r\naround  Shanghai over the years.  One reason why  we  are  at\r\n\r\nSuzhou is because of its proximity to Shanghai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we increase the `buzz' in Singapore? That really\r\n\r\nis  the  objective of the ERC and our other efforts to remake\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The key is our economy.  To stay competitive,  we\r\n\r\nmust keep taxes low, improve our infrastructure, simplify our\r\n\r\nregulations, educate our people, train and retrain  ourselves\r\n\r\ncontinuously,   bring   in  international   talent,   protect\r\n\r\nproperty,   including  intellectual  property,  and   develop\r\n\r\nbroadband  economic  connectivity with  our  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nneighbours and with the US, Europe, Japan, China,  India  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.   And that is the reason why we are now  embarking\r\n\r\non  so  many FTAs.  Being an independent city-state, we  will\r\n\r\nalways  be  more  cosmopolitan and outward-looking  than  any\r\n\r\nother  city  in Asia, including Shanghai.  This  cosmopolitan\r\n\r\nspirit  must  also  be  expressed  in  our  intellectual  and\r\n\r\ncultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  a misconception that adults below the height  of  1.5\r\n\r\nmetres  must  use  a booster seat.  The correct  position  is\r\n\r\nthis.  Persons who are eight years or older but who are below\r\n\r\nthe  height of 1.5 metres are, in fact, exempted from  having\r\n\r\nto  belt up.  It is unsafe for any person below 1.5 metres in\r\n\r\nheight  to wear a body restraining seat belt in a vehicle  as\r\n\r\nthe  shoulder  part of the belt would be placed  against  the\r\n\r\nperson's  neck  instead of lying over the shoulder.   In  the\r\n\r\nevent of an accident, the seat belt may strangle him or  her.\r\n\r\nHowever, parents of children above eight years old and  young\r\n\r\nteenagers  who are below 1.5 metres in height, are encouraged\r\n\r\nto use booster seats to elevate the seating position of their\r\n\r\nchildren so that the seat belts may be strapped safely across\r\n\r\nthe shoulder.  For the same reason, adults below 1.5 metre in\r\n\r\nheight are also encouraged to use booster seats so that  they\r\n\r\nmay strap up safely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, children below the age of eight years must be\r\n\r\nproperly  secured by an approved child restraint.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  requirement  since 1993.

In May  this  year,  it  had\r\n\r\nadvised major retailers to keep sufficient stocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police is monitoring the stock levels at major\r\n\r\nretail  outlets.   Child restraints are  temporarily  out  of\r\n\r\nstock  while booster seats are still available in the market.\r\n\r\nNew supplies are expected in a week's time.  In the meantime,\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  will  continue to advise  motorists  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety measures required for young passengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nconfirm once again that for a child above eight years old, it\r\n\r\nis  not compulsory for the child to use a booster seat  or  a\r\n\r\ncar seat.

In accordance with the\r\n\r\nSGX  Rules,  the  SGX Settlement Committee decided  that  all\r\n\r\noutstanding market trades in Links shares done during 14-16th\r\n\r\nAugust 2000 be settled by way of cash instead of delivery, at\r\n\r\nthe fair settlement price of $1.21.  This ruling also applied\r\n\r\nto  sale transactions by contra traders who had bought  Links\r\n\r\nshares  before 14th August 2000 and sold those shares  during\r\n\r\n14-16th August 2000.  As a result, such contra traders had to\r\n\r\npick up and pay for the shares they bought because their sale\r\n\r\ntransactions, like all other market trades during the period,\r\n\r\nhad been settled in cash instead of by delivery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some brokers have indicated to SGX that they are\r\n\r\nprepared   to  extend  credit  to  help  ease  any   cashflow\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced by such investors.  Others  have  allowed\r\n\r\ntheir  clients  to  pay for the shares by  instalments.   MAS\r\n\r\nencourages  such flexibility on the part of the  brokers,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  they  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.   MAS\r\n\r\ncannot, however, require or compel all brokers to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposal was for SGX to use its fidelity fund to\r\n\r\nhelp the affected investors.  This is not legally possible as\r\n\r\nthe  Securities Industry Act stipulates that the fund may  be\r\n\r\nused only to compensate investors in the event of defalcation\r\n\r\nby a broker or to pay creditors when a broker winds up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX has informed the company that it is prepared to\r\n\r\nallow  Links  shares to resume trading provided  the  company\r\n\r\nputs  in  place safeguards to prevent the counter from  being\r\n\r\ncornered again.  One of the safeguards that the parties are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussing is for the company to restore its free float to an\r\n\r\nappropriate  level.  The company's free float had  fallen  to\r\n\r\nless than 8% (below the minimum 10% required by SGX Rules) at\r\n\r\nthe time of Links' trading suspension in August 2000.  If the\r\n\r\ncompany  can  meet  SGX's requirements and trading  in  Links\r\n\r\nshares  resumes, contra traders with Links shares  will  have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to sell their Links shares.  But there is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee  that they will be able to sell their Links  shares\r\n\r\nat the prices prevailing before the trading suspension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contra trader should always be prepared to fork out\r\n\r\nthe  full amount for his share purchases and not rely on  the\r\n\r\nproceeds from subsequent sale to pay for them.  Apart from  a\r\n\r\ncorner  situation  where  the  SGX  Rules  provide  for  cash\r\n\r\nsettlement  of  outstanding market trades at fair  settlement\r\n\r\nprice,  there  are  other risks that contra investors  should\r\n\r\ntake  into  account  before engaging in contra  transactions.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, if trading in the counter should be  suspended\r\n\r\nfor  a  few  days  (either by the listed company  or  SGX  as\r\n\r\nprovided for under the SGX Rules), before the investor  could\r\n\r\ncontra  his outstanding purchases, he would have to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthe shares in full.  Or if the share price fell sharply after\r\n\r\nthe investor had bought his shares, he would have to sell off\r\n\r\nthe  shares  at  a  loss  if  he  could  not  pay  for  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is not prudent for an investor to over-stretch\r\n\r\nhimself  by  relying on contra trades to pay  for  his  share\r\n\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, regarding contra trades,\r\n\r\nthe  trades were actually done within the three days and  the\r\n\r\nclient would have assumed that they had already been settled.\r\n\r\nBut  it  was suspended, and after one year the Stock Exchange\r\n\r\ncame  and said that the trades were actually nullified  under\r\n\r\nthe  settlement  process.   So it was  not  that  the  contra\r\n\r\ntraders  did not prepare for it.  They actually prepared  for\r\n\r\nit  but  the  market had fallen in the one year and  whatever\r\n\r\nsavings  they had to buy the shares had already been depleted\r\n\r\nby  the market.  My question to the Minister is that, in  the\r\n\r\nlast three days of trading, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstock  prices would actually have gone up, implying that  the\r\n\r\nsyndicates had bought more shares to corner the company.   So\r\n\r\nif  the Stock Exchange had nullified the trading by requiring\r\n\r\nthat  it  be  settled in cash, would it  not  be  giving  the\r\n\r\nsyndicates an easy escape route?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are ways to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  a corner situation.  This is a problem which  can\r\n\r\narise in any stock market, and there are established ways  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with it.  There is no totally satisfactory way because,\r\n\r\nby  definition, in a corner situation, there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nshares  to go around.  People have committed to deliver  more\r\n\r\nshares  than  are available because people have shorted,  and\r\n\r\nnow they cannot get hold of shares for delivery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like playing musical chairs - ten people running\r\n\r\naround,  nine chairs to sit upon, and the music has  stopped.\r\n\r\nNow,  you say, \"I am going to sit in this chair\", or \"I  have\r\n\r\nalready \"choped\" this chair.  Therefore, let me do that,  and\r\n\r\nlet  everybody else settle on their own.\"  But you cannot  do\r\n\r\nthat  because you may have \"choped\" this, somebody  else  may\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  I am waiting for you to do this to settle,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  a chance I can settle in scrip too.\"  So  finally,\r\n\r\nthe  most  equitable arrangement which is fair  both  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  who are long in the shares and who are short  in  the\r\n\r\nshares is to say, \"There are not enough to go around, we will\r\n\r\nestablish a fair price that the committee sets.  They  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  the  amount is and, at that price, we settle in  cash.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  later on, if the shares trade again, at that point,  you\r\n\r\nbuy  and  sell the shares for whatever they are worth.   Now,\r\n\r\nthe music has stopped, we settle in cash at a price which  is\r\n\r\nfair to both who are long and who are short.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the suspension was not something which\r\n\r\nthe  Stock Exchange wanted to do.  It was something which was\r\n\r\nunavoidable given the complexities of the investigation  into\r\n\r\nthe  case  because,  in  this case,  many  shareholders  were\r\n\r\ninvolved  and  the Stock Exchange and CAD had to  investigate\r\n\r\nthe relationship between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem to establish whether or not they were acting in concert,\r\n\r\nand  whether or not a corner situation existed.  So they took\r\n\r\none whole year to establish this.  And finally, they declared\r\n\r\nthat  the  corner  situation existed, not because  they  were\r\n\r\nsitting around, but because investigations were complicated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of this happening is always there. When you\r\n\r\nenter  into a contra trade, you hope that you would not  have\r\n\r\nto  pay in full for the shares which you have already bought,\r\n\r\nand  that  you can sell them off and contra it.  But  between\r\n\r\nthe  buying and the contra, several days pass and things  can\r\n\r\nhappen in between which can frustrate that matching.  And  in\r\n\r\nthis  case,  something did happen.  The Stock Exchange  acted\r\n\r\naccording  to its rules which are published.  So  before  you\r\n\r\nenter into a contra trade, everybody must know that there  is\r\n\r\na  risk  of the stock being suspended, and especially in  the\r\n\r\ncase of Links Island, where the prices had been going up, all\r\n\r\nthe  more,  anybody  who  goes  in  knows  that  this  is   a\r\n\r\nspeculative punt, and you are taking a risk.  So I think that\r\n\r\nthe Stock Exchange did the right thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> May I clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister?   Is it not more equitable to require  all  trades,\r\n\r\nwhether  before the suspension or during the  three  days  of\r\n\r\ntrading,  to be dealt through the normal settlement  process?\r\n\r\nThat  means,  those who have bought and sold accordingly  are\r\n\r\ndue,  whether  they sold the shares, they have  to  get  them\r\n\r\ndelivered,  or if they have bought, they have to pay,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  having a retrospective step of removing the three  days\r\n\r\nand  say  that  all trades done during that particular  three\r\n\r\ndays be nullified.  Is it not equitable in that sense?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are on a T-plus-3 settlement. So those are trades which have not been\r\n\r\nclosed,  which  are still open.  At the point of  suspension,\r\n\r\nthese are trades which are left hanging and you have to  find\r\n\r\nsome ways to settle it.  As I explained, you cannot settle in\r\n\r\nstock.   Therefore, some price has to be established and,  in\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase, the committee established a fair market price.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Can I clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister again?  Why did SGX take the three days?  Why did it\r\n\r\nnot  take  T-plus-4, the four days trade, or  the  two  days'\r\n\r\ntrade,  or  just on Wednesday itself, instead of  having  the\r\n\r\nthree days' trade?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure\r\n\r\nwhether the question is why are we averaging over three days,\r\n\r\nor  why are we nullifying the trades over three days.  If you\r\n\r\nask  why  we  are nullifying over three days, the  answer  is\r\n\r\nbecause those were the trades which were not closed, they had\r\n\r\nnot settled, because we are on a T-plus-3 settlement.  So any\r\n\r\ntime,  when  you  intervene, you have three  days'  worth  of\r\n\r\ntransaction  which you have to clean up.  As for  the  price,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  a  fair price?  It is for the committee to  decide.\r\n\r\nThey  deliberated  and they decided that they  would  average\r\n\r\nover three days.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if I may clarify further\r\n\r\nthat  it is actually T-plus-3.  So it is four days of  trade,\r\n\r\nand  not three days.  Effectively, the Stock Exchange is only\r\n\r\nusing  three days which is, if the stock is bought on Friday,\r\n\r\nit  is  still not closed for that matter.  I think the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange has not used the correct calculation, when they used\r\n\r\nonly three days.  They should have used four days instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> That is a different issue which the\r\n\r\nMember  is  raising.

The usual board lot size  is\r\n\r\n1,000  shares, although smaller board lot sizes are  normally\r\n\r\nallowed for counters with a share price of more than $10.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case of SingTel, board lots of 10 shares and 100  shares\r\n\r\nhave  been provided so that Singaporeans who received  shares\r\n\r\nduring SingTel's initial public offer in 1993 can trade those\r\n\r\nshares and the resulting bonus shares easily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standardised board lots facilitate trading among\r\n\r\ninvestors.  Otherwise, it would be difficult to match  buyers\r\n\r\nand  sellers  of  odd numbers of shares.   SGX  has  received\r\n\r\nfeedback  that  abolishing minimum board lots could  increase\r\n\r\nthe  cost of trading as investors may then have to enter into\r\n\r\nmultiple transactions to effect a single sale or purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, abolishing minimum board lots could result in\r\n\r\nlisted  companies  having large numbers of shareholders  each\r\n\r\nholding  a  small number of shares.  This could increase  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  shareholder communication (eg, printing and sending\r\n\r\nannual  reports  and shareholder circulars)  for  our  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major exchanges, such as the New York Stock\r\n\r\nExchange and NASDAQ, also prescribe minimum board lots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that a large number of our listed companies trade\r\n\r\nat  less  than $1.00 per share, the usual board lot  size  of\r\n\r\n1,000 shares is not likely to prevent the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvesting public from participating in the stock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, SGX recognises that investors may\r\n\r\nsometimes  receive odd lots, for example, as a  result  of  a\r\n\r\nbonus  issue,  or  rights issue, by the listed  company.   To\r\n\r\nenable investors to trade their odd lots, SGX provides an odd\r\n\r\nlot  market.   Currently, the odd lot market lacks  liquidity\r\n\r\nbecause it is difficult to find an exact match between buyers\r\n\r\nand sellers of odd numbers of shares.  This is unlike the odd\r\n\r\nlot  markets on New York Stock Exhange and NASDAQ where there\r\n\r\nare  market makers and specialists who stand ready to buy  up\r\n\r\nodd  lots  to form round lots for subsequent sale.

The injection will be made out  of  capital\r\n\r\ncontributions appropriated by Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, statutory corporations are given direct\r\n\r\ncapital  grants, funded out of Government revenue to  finance\r\n\r\ntheir  development projects.  They are not  charged  for  the\r\n\r\ncapital  provided  to  them.  As  a  result  of  this  \"free\"\r\n\r\nendowment of capital, some agencies might not fully economise\r\n\r\non  the  use  of  capital or make effective  choices  between\r\n\r\ncapital and other financial resources.  The best way to bring\r\n\r\nabout  proper  accountability for the use of  capital  is  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  debt-equity financing  structure  in  statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations  as in the case of companies.   This  Bill  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  bring about such a market-based financing structure\r\n\r\nby  making  it  possible  for all statutory  corporations  to\r\n\r\nreceive \"equity\" or capital injection from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides capital injection, statutory corporations should\r\n\r\nalso  be  allowed  to  more freely  take  up  debt  financing\r\n\r\noptions,  such as loans and bonds.  This funding approach  is\r\n\r\nalso in line with the recommendation by the ERP Sub-committee\r\n\r\non  Policies Related to Taxation, CPF System, Wages and Land,\r\n\r\nfor   the   Government  to  use  the  capital  markets   more\r\n\r\nextensively to finance bankable projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital grants to statutory corporations are currently\r\n\r\ngiven  in  the  form of a single upfront cash  outlay.   This\r\n\r\nresults  in lumpy Government spending.  With the new  funding\r\n\r\nframework, payment for capital assets would be spread out  as\r\n\r\nannual  operating  subventions over the useful  life  of  the\r\n\r\nassets.  This is no different from the Government renting  or\r\n\r\nleasing  the  asset.  It gives a proper matching between  the\r\n\r\nuse of the assets and the costing of services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some statutory corporations have developmental\r\n\r\nobjectives.    Capital   injections   into   such   statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations   would  be  funded  out  of  the  Developmental\r\n\r\nInvestment Fund as some returns would be expected from  them.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are other statutory corporations  which  are\r\n\r\npurely   regulatory  in  nature.   For  these,  the   capital\r\n\r\ninjections would be funded out of the annual budget voted  by\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to explain the specific provisions\r\n\r\nof the Bill which are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the amendment of the Financial Procedure Act.\r\n\r\nThe   Financial  Procedure  Act  is  amended  by   inserting,\r\n\r\nimmediately  after  section 7, a new  section  7A.   The  new\r\n\r\nsection  will empower the Minister for Finance to  invest  by\r\n\r\nway of capital injection in any statutory corporation out  of\r\n\r\na  capital contribution appropriated by Parliament  from  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated   Fund.    The  Minister  for   Finance,   after\r\n\r\nconsultation   with   the   Minister   charged    with    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the statutory corporation concerned,  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  the terms and conditions under which  the  capital\r\n\r\ninjection under the section shall be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential amendments to other written laws</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-seven Acts would be amended to allow the statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations constituted under the relevant Acts  to  receive\r\n\r\ncapital injections from the Government, in return for  shares\r\n\r\nor other securities issued to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last two weeks of debates, I gave my views\r\n\r\nabout  the Government's involvement in business; particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  statutory  boards  get into businesses  which  in  turn\r\n\r\ncompete  with  the private sector, it creates a  very  unfair\r\n\r\nsituation  simply because, as a regulator and a  facilitator,\r\n\r\nthe  statutory boards will no doubt favour its own  companies\r\n\r\nor companies owned by other statutory boards.  This situation\r\n\r\nof  an unlevel playing field is further worsened by the  easy\r\n\r\naccess  to  cheap funds by statutory boards, especially  when\r\n\r\nthe  funds come from the Government's budget.  Because of  an\r\n\r\neasier   than   market-practice  advantage,  it   is   easily\r\n\r\nunderstandable  why such statutory-board-operated  businesses\r\n\r\nor  GLCs can easily defeat companies from the private  sector\r\n\r\nwhen they compete with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed changes, statutory boards will be\r\n\r\ncompelled  to make decisions along market-accepted  practices\r\n\r\nand  will  force  them to make assessments of projects  along\r\n\r\ncommercial terms.  I believe, in the long term, it will  make\r\n\r\nthe  statutory boards much stronger and much more  efficient,\r\n\r\nbecause they will no longer have a well-cushioned environment\r\n\r\nand  will no longer have access to easy money and, therefore,\r\n\r\nwill have to sharpen their competencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one concern and two questions for the Minister.\r\n\r\nThe  first concern is that, as the statutory boards will  now\r\n\r\nbe  required to raise funds commercially in some cases, I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned that some statutory boards may take the opportunity\r\n\r\nto increase Government charges and fees, which are already  a\r\n\r\ncause  for  concern.  I would expect that, in the long  term,\r\n\r\nwith  commercial financing, the statutory boards will  become\r\n\r\nmuch more efficient, and this should result in lower and  not\r\n\r\nhigher  costs  and,  therefore, lower charges.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  assure  the House that this  change  will  not\r\n\r\nresult   in  a  round  of  increases,  resulting  in   higher\r\n\r\nGovernment fees and charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I have are: first of all, can the Minister\r\n\r\nelaborate  on how the equity structure will work, perhaps  by\r\n\r\nway  of  some examples?  Will the statutory boards  now  look\r\n\r\nlike  GLCs?   Secondly, for the debt financing  option,  will\r\n\r\neach statutory board be required to go to commercial banks or\r\n\r\nwill  there  be a special channel for them?  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwill they be treated like any commercial entity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is a good start to how the Government\r\n\r\nshould  be repositioning itself, as we try to create a  level\r\n\r\nplaying field and a more entrepreneurial Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me to join in the debate.  I  support  the\r\n\r\nBill and I understand the rationale mentioned by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.  However, I notice that in the Schedule, some of\r\n\r\nthe   statutory   boards,  such  as  the  universities,   the\r\n\r\npolytechnics and the People's Association, are also  provided\r\n\r\nfor.   So, I wonder whether these statutory boards will  also\r\n\r\nbe  given  shares or capital grants, as proposed by him,  and\r\n\r\nwhether   they  will,  in  turn,  be  subject  to   financial\r\n\r\npressures, especially those educational institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I address the\r\n\r\nconcern expressed by Mr Inderjit Singh as well as Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen whether, as a result of this change, fees will increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these are two separate questions: the degree to\r\n\r\nwhich  we  want to subsidise an activity and how we  want  to\r\n\r\nfund  the  activity.  We can fund the statutory  board  by  a\r\n\r\ngrant but, if we do not subsidise the activity, the statutory\r\n\r\nboard  still has to recover the cost of providing the service\r\n\r\nin  order  to  repay the Government, or we  can  fund  it  by\r\n\r\nequity,  which  is an option we will now  have.   But  if  we\r\n\r\ndecide to subsidise the activity, we can subsidise it as  the\r\n\r\nactivity is provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities, the polytechnics and the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation (PA), which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned  by Dr Wang Kai Yuen, are a good example where,  if\r\n\r\nwe decide to give them equity that has nothing to do with how\r\n\r\nmuch we decide we want to recover from tertiary education  or\r\n\r\nwhether  the  PA  is meant to break even, because  these  are\r\n\r\ninstitutions  with educational and social missions,  and  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy policy there is something which is separate and which\r\n\r\nis   not  going  to  change  as  a  result  of  this  funding\r\n\r\narrangement.  It does not mean we have decided  that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing   to   put   equity  into  the  universities   or   the\r\n\r\npolytechnics, but it gives us the flexibility to do so should\r\n\r\nwe need to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there may be occasions in some cases where, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  going to an equity framework, we may discover  in\r\n\r\nfact  that the statutory board has been receiving an indirect\r\n\r\nsubsidy  or  an  implicit subsidy because  it  had  not  been\r\n\r\ncosting  its services properly.  In which case, we will  have\r\n\r\nto  ask  ourselves do we now want to make it explicit and  we\r\n\r\nsubsidise  it,  or  do  we think it  is  not  justified  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we will stop subsidising it over a period of time.\r\n\r\nI  am  speaking hypothetically.  I do not have  any  specific\r\n\r\nexamples, but these are issues which we will have to  address\r\n\r\nexplicitly, and the more transparent we can be, the better it\r\n\r\nis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, as Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed out, with an\r\n\r\nequity  framework, it is more likely that all the costs  will\r\n\r\nbe  laid  bare,  it is more likely that the statutory  boards\r\n\r\nwill  have  an  incentive  to  operate  efficiently  like   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  company  and,  therefore,  provide  services   at\r\n\r\nminimum cost and maximum value to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked also for some examples of how\r\n\r\nthe equity structure would work.  I can give him one example,\r\n\r\nwhich is the Civil Service College which was set up as a self-financing statutory board last year, because it is  not  just\r\n\r\nrunning  courses  in-house, but it is also providing  courses\r\n\r\nexternally.   Even  when  it runs  courses  in-house,  it  is\r\n\r\ncharging Ministries and statutory boards for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses  which  it  provides.   So  it  is  a  self-financing\r\n\r\nstatutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new funding framework, the Civil Service\r\n\r\nCollege can either use equity or debt to raise funds for  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects.  For example, if it needs a new set  of\r\n\r\ncollege buildings, the college buildings will be held on  its\r\n\r\nbooks  as  its  assets  and  against  liabilities,  and   the\r\n\r\nliabilities will be equity which has been injected  into  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board.  It will no longer receive  capital  grants\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government because, previously, if we  gave  it  a\r\n\r\ncapital  grant, it bought the building, the building did  not\r\n\r\nappear  in anybody's balance sheet, and we are not accounting\r\n\r\naccording to proper commercial principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Civil Service College chooses to raise funds\r\n\r\nthrough  equity, then it would have to apply to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  for  capital injection.  The  capital  injection\r\n\r\nwould be funded out of the Developmental Investment Fund  and\r\n\r\nwould  be  subject  to the provisions of the  DIF  Act  which\r\n\r\nrequires \"the Minister or a responsible Minister to establish\r\n\r\nand  adhere  to  investment policies and adopt standards  and\r\n\r\nprocedures that a reasonable, prudent person would apply to a\r\n\r\nportfolio of investments to avoid undue risk of loss  and  to\r\n\r\nobtain  a  reasonable  return.\"  The Civil  Service  College,\r\n\r\nafter  receiving the equity injection, would be  required  to\r\n\r\nissue share certificates to the Government in return for this\r\n\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked the question as to whether\r\n\r\nstatutory boards will now have to go to commercial banks  and\r\n\r\nwill there be a special channel for them.  The answer is that\r\n\r\nthe  statutory boards that want to raise funds  through  debt\r\n\r\nfinancing can do so by taking up commercial bank loans or  by\r\n\r\nissuing  bonds, just like any corporate entity, or  they  can\r\n\r\napproach  the Ministry of Finance for loans, but  such  loans\r\n\r\nwill  be  charged  interest  rates comparable  to  commercial\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising debt financing from the market or borrowing from\r\n\r\nbanks is not a new option for statutory boards.  JTC, HDB and\r\n\r\nLTA have been raising bonds regularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  finance  their  operations.  In fact,  we  encourage  the\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards,  where  possible,  to   raise   financing\r\n\r\ncommercially  rather  than falling back  on  the  Government,\r\n\r\nbecause then we can be quite sure that when they say it is  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  rate, that is the rate which is offered  by  some\r\n\r\nlender, whereas, if they come back to the Government, we will\r\n\r\nhave to estimate the rate and we may get it wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT SECURITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Government\r\n\r\nSecurities  Act  (GSA)  to  allow  the  Government  to  issue\r\n\r\nGovernment securities with early redemption features.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2001, the Government set up the New Singapore\r\n\r\nShares  (NSS)  Fund to issue NSS to Singapore citizens.

These police officers' main duties are to\r\n\r\nconduct  investigations  which require  police  powers.   The\r\n\r\nexistence  of different service schemes in the Department  is\r\n\r\nnot  ideal.   It gave rise, over time, to issues of  internal\r\n\r\nrelativities, as each scheme has its own terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, ISD decided to combine the two schemes of\r\n\r\nservice  into  one, the Intelligence Service.   A  conversion\r\n\r\nexercise  was carried out and serving senior police  officers\r\n\r\nwere  invited  to be emplaced on the Intelligence  scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice.  This enables the Department to attract, retain  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  suitable  and  capable  officers  and  manage  their\r\n\r\ncareers.  More than 94% of the senior police officers took up\r\n\r\nthe  offer  and were converted to the Intelligence scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice with effect from 1st October last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill proposes amendments to the Police Force\r\n\r\nAct to enable officers, who perform investigation duties,  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so with the necessary police powers which they\r\n\r\nhad  before  the conversion into the Intelligence  scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice.  The purposes of the amendments are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to confer on designated intelligence officers the\r\n\r\npolice  powers of investigation under the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  or  any other written law as the Minister may prescribe\r\n\r\nby notification in the Gazette;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide immunities for these officers relating\r\n\r\nto  acts  done  under the authority of a  warrant.   This  is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the protection afforded to all police  officers;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to confer on senior police intelligence officers\r\n\r\nthe  powers  of an Assistant Superintendent of  Police  or  a\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  of  Police under  such  written  law  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister may prescribe by notification in the Gazette.   This\r\n\r\nis  to  allow  these officers to exercise certain  provisions\r\n\r\nunder the Internal Security Act. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample, an officer of the rank of ASP and above can detain a\r\n\r\nperson  for  up  to  48 hours from the time  of  arrest.   An\r\n\r\nofficer of the rank of Superintendent and above can authorise\r\n\r\nfurther  detention  of  up to 28 days.   Beyond  28  days  of\r\n\r\ndetention,  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  has  to  grant\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intelligence officers to be designated are\r\n\r\nthose  doing work that require police powers of investigation\r\n\r\nand  will include former police officers who converted to the\r\n\r\nIntelligence Service.  This enables the officers to  continue\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  their  operational and  investigative  duties\r\n\r\neffectively,   even  after  they  have   converted   to   the\r\n\r\nIntelligence Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the proposed amendments  to  the  Act  will\r\n\r\neffectively  give  absolute discretion  to  the  Minister  in\r\n\r\ndeciding which intelligence officers will be conferred powers\r\n\r\nequivalent to those of a Police Inspector or ASP.   Also,  in\r\n\r\nthe Minister's discretion, these officers would be deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe police officers under the ISA.  These discretionary powers\r\n\r\ninclude  appointment  of intelligence officers  who  are  not\r\n\r\nformer police officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, police powers are very wide. In the context of\r\n\r\ninvestigations,  these  include  powers  to  arrest,   summon\r\n\r\nwitnesses  for the recording of statements, compel  banks  to\r\n\r\nproduce confidential financial statements of their customers,\r\n\r\nwalk  into  premises upon suspicion of certain  offences  and\r\n\r\nseize properties, etc.  There are some areas of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will there be officers without police\r\n\r\ntraining who will be conferred police powers?  If this is so,\r\n\r\nmy  question is:  why is there a need to extend these  powers\r\n\r\nto  those  without police training and experience?  Are  they\r\n\r\nqualified  to  exercise  such  powers,  which  have  a  great\r\n\r\npotential  to  be  used as a repressive  tool?   Can  we  not\r\n\r\nrestrict  officers  who  can  be gazetted  to  former  police\r\n\r\nofficers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave crossed over to the Intelligence Service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, should their conferred police powers be\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the rank structure?  I am of the view  that\r\n\r\nthere should be some restrictions on the equivalent ranks  of\r\n\r\nintelligence  officers  who can exercise  equivalent  powers.\r\n\r\nThe Criminal Procedure Code sets qualifying ranks to exercise\r\n\r\ncertain  powers,  for example, recording of  statements  from\r\n\r\nsuspects  can  only  be  done by  Sergeants  and  above,  and\r\n\r\ncompelling banks to supply confidential information can  only\r\n\r\nbe  done  by  an  Inspector,  etc.   By  allowing  a  blanket\r\n\r\nprovision  and conferring the powers of an Inspector  to  the\r\n\r\nofficers  that  the  Minister  can  designate,  are  we   not\r\n\r\npotentially  allowing for a situation where the Minister  can\r\n\r\ndesignate  officers who are very junior and inexperienced  or\r\n\r\nill-trained to exercise such wide powers?  This may, in fact,\r\n\r\nundermine the integrity of Government as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is: how is the public protected from\r\n\r\nthe  abuse  of  powers by these intelligence officers?    For\r\n\r\npolice  officers,  the procedure for the public  to  complain\r\n\r\nagainst abuse of authority or malpractices is clear.  One can\r\n\r\nsue,   make  a  complaint  which  may  lead  to  disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceedings before the Police Disciplinary Board.   If  there\r\n\r\nis  a  grievance  against an intelligence officer  exercising\r\n\r\nthose  police  powers, what would be the  channel  of  public\r\n\r\nrecourse?   The  Act  is not amended to subject  intelligence\r\n\r\nofficers to the same disciplinary process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a bit concerned\r\n\r\nabout   the  Minister  changing  this  Act  to  empower   the\r\n\r\nintelligence officers just because the scheme of service  has\r\n\r\nbeen  changed.  Perhaps, it would have been better to  change\r\n\r\nthe scheme of service to attract the officers as intelligence\r\n\r\nofficers without changing the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also quite concerned that, in my mind, we are\r\n\r\na  bit  confused  about  what are intelligence  officers  and\r\n\r\npolice officers.  To me, police officers are law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenforcement  officers. They are well-trained  and  understand\r\n\r\nthe  law  very well.  Whereas, in the general public's  mind,\r\n\r\nintelligence  officers can be considered as spies.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhat the public thinks.  We are a bit concerned as to why  we\r\n\r\nshould  designate  intelligence officers and  give  them  the\r\n\r\npowers of police officers when it can be done otherwise.  The\r\n\r\nother point has already been brought up by Mr Low.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think the underlying concern in the\r\n\r\ntwo  Members'  question  is:  why do  we  now  need  to  give\r\n\r\nintelligence officers such police powers? The Members may not\r\n\r\nhave understood what I was just talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1st October 2001, intelligence officers were\r\n\r\nconfined  to  those civilians in the ISD.  And  we  have,  on\r\n\r\nsecondment from the police force, a certain number of  senior\r\n\r\npolice  officers  who perform investigative  and  operational\r\n\r\nduties.   For these police officers, because they are already\r\n\r\npolice officers, they have powers of investigation like other\r\n\r\npolice  officers.  What we try to do in this exercise  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide for one scheme of service so that, while we have  two\r\n\r\ngroups  of  officers  working in the same  department,  maybe\r\n\r\ndoing the same job, they do not have the inequitable position\r\n\r\nwhereby one has a higher salary than the other, and one has a\r\n\r\ndifferent  rate  of progression than the other,  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThat is good for morale because if we have only one scheme of\r\n\r\nservice, then everybody progresses, depending on performance,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  depending on their scheme of service.   We  have\r\n\r\nsituations where police officers in ISD thought that they  do\r\n\r\nnot  advance  as  fast  as  those  officers  working  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police  Force.  We want  to  avoid  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nsituation  and  therefore provide  for  a  common  scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice in the Intelligence Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is not to grant all\r\n\r\nintelligence officers police powers although the Minister may\r\n\r\ndesignate who to grant such powers.  By \"designate\", it  just\r\n\r\nmeans  that  so  and  so officer is given  police  powers  to\r\n\r\nperform his operational and investigative duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill  the  Minister so blindly appoint any person,  a  junior\r\n\r\nperson,  which  is Mr Low's concern, to be  a  senior  police\r\n\r\nofficer  performing those duties if he  is  not  trained?   I\r\n\r\nthink it will be foolish of any Minister for Home Affairs  or\r\n\r\nany  department  head of ISD to make such  a  recommendation.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the concern of abuse may arise if people  are  not\r\n\r\ntrained,  if they do not know their duties and if they  think\r\n\r\nthat just because they have police powers, they can arrest or\r\n\r\ndetain  and search anyone and go into anybody's house.   That\r\n\r\nis  not the state of affairs in our Intelligence Service, nor\r\n\r\nis it the state of affairs in our police force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members and others who may feel that way\r\n\r\nthat  not  all  intelligence officers are given such  powers.\r\n\r\nOnly  those  who  are currently performing investigation  and\r\n\r\noperational duties, and they were former police officers  who\r\n\r\nhave  converted into the Intelligence scheme of service, will\r\n\r\nbe so designated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, we will recruit directly into the\r\n\r\nIntelligence Service.  What happens to these new officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Intelligence  Service  who are  not  trained  as  police\r\n\r\nofficers?  It is just like our Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)\r\n\r\nofficers.   They are given police powers but they go  through\r\n\r\nthe  training  of  a police officer to make  sure  that  they\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Penal Code, the Evidence Act,  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code and all relevant laws that are necessary  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  perform their duties.  Similarly, for  intelligence\r\n\r\nofficers,  in  future,  if  they  are  recruited   into   the\r\n\r\nIntelligence Service, but they do not have a police officer's\r\n\r\nbackground, they will be sent for training before  they  will\r\n\r\nbe  appointed  to perform such a duty.  No Minister  will  be\r\n\r\nfoolish enough to allow anyone to abuse his powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the channel of complaint? Like all civil\r\n\r\nservants,   they  are  subject  to  disciplinary  rules   and\r\n\r\nproceedings.  They are subject to the Instructions Manual  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil service.  They are also subject to the laws of the\r\n\r\nland.  If they, just because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  police powers and they are intelligence officers,\r\n\r\nthey  beat up somebody, whether in the course of duty or not,\r\n\r\nthey can also be subject to investigations.  There are proper\r\n\r\nchannels of redress in these situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. The\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that there is a proper channel of  complaint.\r\n\r\nFor  the  police, it is very clear.  We know who to  complain\r\n\r\nto.  Can he tell us, in the case of intelligence officers, as\r\n\r\nthey are not, by definition, police officers, if there is  an\r\n\r\nabuse of powers, what is the channel of complaint?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The channel of complaint must be to\r\n\r\nthe  Director of the Internal Security Department,  like  for\r\n\r\npolice   officers,  the  channel  of  complaint  is  to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police.

Sir,  let  me  explain the rationale  behind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   decision  to  rationalise  the   food   safety\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of AVA and ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ensuring the safety of food is an increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant public health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcern  world-wide.   The  World  Health  Organisation   has\r\n\r\nestimated   that   one  person  in  three  in  industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries  may get ill from eating unsafe food.  As Singapore\r\n\r\nis  heavily  dependent on food imports, we are vulnerable  to\r\n\r\npublic  health risk from unsafe food from around  the  world.\r\n\r\nFood  production  is  now  a globalised  business.   We  have\r\n\r\nobserved  incidences  of unsafe food causing  food  poisoning\r\n\r\noutbreaks  on an international dimension.  Food made  in  one\r\n\r\ncountry  can  use ingredients from other countries,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhich  may  not meet our safety standards.  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse   may   recall  the  dioxin  incident  that   Singapore\r\n\r\nexperienced  in 1999.  AVA and ENV then had to  take  certain\r\n\r\nimported food products off the shelves, because of the dioxin\r\n\r\ncontaminated food products from Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress in food biotechnology, and the use of new\r\n\r\nadditives in food production, present new challenges  to  our\r\n\r\nfood  safety system.  In view of these new technologies,  all\r\n\r\nnew  chemicals,  which can present new  health  risk  to  our\r\n\r\npopulation, the Government sees a strategic need  to  further\r\n\r\nstrengthen our food safety system to minimise these risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, food safety in Singapore is under the purview\r\n\r\nof  the  AVA  and  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment.   The\r\n\r\ndemarcation  of food safety responsibilities is generally  by\r\n\r\nfood  types.   The AVA regulates the safety of primary  food,\r\n\r\nie,  meat and fish, and their products, raw milk, eggs, fresh\r\n\r\nfruits  and  vegetables.   The Ministry  of  the  Environment\r\n\r\ncurrently regulates the safety of processed foods, as well as\r\n\r\nfor handling of all food at retail.  This demarcation applies\r\n\r\nto both imported as well as locally produced food.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this current mode of demarcation of food safety,\r\n\r\nbetween the AVA and the Ministry of the Environment,  is  not\r\n\r\nalways clear or intuitive.  The general public and the people\r\n\r\nin  the  food  industry  are sometimes  confused  as  to  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of each agency.  In addition,  the  AVA  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment adopt different approaches to\r\n\r\nfood safety control for imported food.  The AVA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemphasises  safe  standards at the sources  of  food  supply,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  Ministry  of  the Environment  relies  mainly  on\r\n\r\nmonitoring of food products at the retail end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to strengthen our food safety system, the\r\n\r\nfood  safety responsibilities of the AVA and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment will be rationalised along the lines of  the\r\n\r\nfood  supply chain, rather than by food types.  AVA will  now\r\n\r\nregulate  the safety of all food from production,  to  import\r\n\r\nand wholesale, right up to just before retail.  AVA will also\r\n\r\nset  food  safety standards, enforce them, and  oversee  food\r\n\r\nlabelling.  The Ministry of the Environment will now regulate\r\n\r\nthe  safety of all food at the retail end, by ensuring proper\r\n\r\nfood  handling, and preparation at restaurants,  supermarkets\r\n\r\nand  other food retailers, such as shops, hawkers and  market\r\n\r\nstalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this rationalisation, both the AVA and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the Environment will continue to work closely to increase\r\n\r\nthe  robustness and responsiveness of our food safety system,\r\n\r\nas  it capitalises on the inherent strengths and expertise of\r\n\r\nthe  two  agencies.  AVA's expertise in pre-market  approval,\r\n\r\nbacked by its up-to-date diagnostic capabilities, will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  food  arriving at the retail end is safe and wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of the Environment will focus its capabilities\r\n\r\nin food hygiene and environmental public health at the retail\r\n\r\noutlets.   The  synergy  attained in such  a  structure  will\r\n\r\nensure that food safety standards are applied consistently to\r\n\r\nlocally  produced,  as well as imported food,  and  all  food\r\n\r\nimports will come under our food safety net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rationalisation of food safety responsibilities\r\n\r\nbetween the AVA and the Ministry of the Environment will take\r\n\r\neffect on 1st July 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"primary food\" has been deleted and\r\n\r\nreferences  to \"primary food\" throughout the Bill  have  been\r\n\r\namended to \"food\", in order to reflect the enlarged scope  of\r\n\r\nthe AVA's food safety responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word \"food biotechnology\" has also been added to the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  the  \"agri-food and  veterinary  sectors\"  in\r\n\r\nclause 2 to include genetically modified food and other types\r\n\r\nof  food  produced as a result of advancements made  in  food\r\n\r\nbiotechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes explicit the AVA's power to liaise,\r\n\r\nor  collaborate,  with any organisation for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\ndetermining standards related to the agri-food and veterinary\r\n\r\nsector  by virtue of clause 4.  This is because the AVA  will\r\n\r\ntake   over  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment's  role   as\r\n\r\nSingapore's  contact point for Kodex Alimentarius Commission.\r\n\r\nThis  is an international foods standards body recognised  by\r\n\r\nthe World Trade Organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating  to the transfer  of  the  Food  Control\r\n\r\nDepartment from the Ministry of the Environment to  the  AVA.\r\n\r\nIt   covers   matters   such  as  staff,  property,   assets,\r\n\r\nliabilities  and  contracts of the FCD.  In this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to stress that the FCD officers who will be transferred\r\n\r\nto  AVA  will do so under employment terms which are no  less\r\n\r\nfavourable  than  those already accorded  to  these  officers\r\n\r\nprior  to their transfer.  This transfer will enable  AVA  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the enlarged scope of regulating the  safety  of\r\n\r\nimported and locally processed food up to just before retail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an administrative note, clause 6 of the Bill amends\r\n\r\nthe   small   \"f\"  in  the  name  \"Agri-food  and  Veterinary\r\n\r\nAuthority\"  to a capital \"F\", to emphasise the  expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe food safety responsibilities of the AVA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing new challenges in food safety. The\r\n\r\nrationalisation of food safety responsibilities will allow us\r\n\r\nto  better  manage  these  challenges,  to  ensure  that  all\r\n\r\nimported food comes under our food safety net, and that  food\r\n\r\nsafety  standards are applied consistently  to  both  locally\r\n\r\nproduced  as  well as imported food.  With these  amendments,\r\n\r\nthe  AVA  and the Ministry of the Environment will be  better\r\n\r\npositioned to deal with the threat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  unsafe  food,  to  further  protect  the  health  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> I just want to seek a few\r\n\r\nclarifications.  May I ask the Minister whether his  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  to  set  up  a  new department to look  after  this  new\r\n\r\narrangement, and how will his Ministry ensure that there  are\r\n\r\nenough  resources and finances to look into this area?   Will\r\n\r\nthis also mean that from now on there will be more inspectors\r\n\r\ngoing round to check on all the retail shops?  May I ask  why\r\n\r\nMND  should not take over from the import stage right through\r\n\r\nto the retail stage?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, let me handle the\r\n\r\nquestions one at a time.  The Food Control Department of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment is being transferred to  AVA,  so\r\n\r\nwe  are not creating a new department.  The staff, and  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and expertise, are coming  across  to  join\r\n\r\nAVA.  Of course, you may ask what about the name \"FCD\", which\r\n\r\na  lot of people are familiar with, in the same way that  the\r\n\r\nname  \"PPD\",  if  you  remember the  old  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment,  was  dropped when we  created  AVA.   With  this\r\n\r\nintegration of the Food Control Department into AVA, we  will\r\n\r\nalso  drop  the  reference  to  FCD.   So  the  staff,  their\r\n\r\nexpertise,  and their resources, will move across.   We  will\r\n\r\nnot  be creating a new structure for the sake of creating new\r\n\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as resources are concerned, let me assure the\r\n\r\nMember  that we are not going to consume more resources  just\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a  re-arrangement of  the  structure.   However,\r\n\r\ndepending on the state of play in food biotechnology, and the\r\n\r\nthreat  assessment  to  our public  health  and  safety,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will, if need be, have to devote more resources into\r\n\r\nthis area.  As I alluded to earlier in my speech, this is  an\r\n\r\narea  which is evolving, and there are potential risks  -  in\r\n\r\nsome   cases,  deliberate,  as  for  instance  in  food  bio-terrorism, or in some cases, inadvertent.  So, the  need  for\r\n\r\nvigilance and the need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  prepared to devote the resources to this matter  will\r\n\r\nalways be there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question was whether there will be\r\n\r\nmore  inspectors  on the retail end.  As I said  earlier  on,\r\n\r\ninspection at the retail establishments will be performed  by\r\n\r\ninspectors  from  the  Ministry of the  Environment,  not  by\r\n\r\nofficers  from AVA.  The purpose of this Bill is actually  to\r\n\r\ncreate a clearer demarcation of responsibilities.  I want  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  proprietors  of these establishments  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not get two sets of inspectors descending on them  and\r\n\r\nchecking  on  them with different standards, and levying  two\r\n\r\ndifferent sets of fines.  This will not occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her last question, the AVA will be responsible for\r\n\r\nfood    from   source,   production,   processing,    import,\r\n\r\nwarehousing, wholesaling and distribution, but we  will  stop\r\n\r\nat retail.  We believe the Ministry of the Environment, which\r\n\r\nhas  got lots of experience and expertise in hygiene  and  in\r\n\r\nmonitoring post-handling of food, is better placed to monitor\r\n\r\nthings  at  the  retail end.  So that is  how  we  intend  to\r\n\r\ndemarcate the system, for now anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SALE OF FOOD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second Time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the House has just passed the Agri-Food and\r\n\r\nVeterinary Authority (Amendment) Bill, which provides for the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the food safety responsibilities of  the  Agri-Food  and  Veterinary Authority.  It also  provides  for  the\r\n\r\ntransfer of the Food Control Department of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment to the AVA.  This Sale  of  Food\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is consequential to this transfer  of  food\r\n\r\nsafety responsibilities to the AVA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill transfers the administration of the Sale of\r\n\r\nFood  Act to the AVA by virtue of clauses 3, 4 and 19.   This\r\n\r\ntransfer  enables the AVA to regulate the safety of  imported\r\n\r\nprocessed  food.  Currently, the Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\nregulates  all  food  establishments  in  Singapore.    These\r\n\r\ninclude restaurants, supermarkets, hawkers, market stalls and\r\n\r\ncaterers.   Food  establishments may also  be  non-retail  in\r\n\r\nnature, such as those that manufacture, process, prepare  and\r\n\r\npack  food for distribution.  The Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nregulates  all local food establishments under  the  existing\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Public Health Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new rationalisation of food safety,\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is between the AVA and the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  The AVA will take over from the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment the regulation of those food establishments which\r\n\r\nare  non-retail  in nature.  The Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\nwill  continue to regulate the safety of food at  the  retail\r\n\r\nend,  such  as  restaurants,  supermarkets,  hawkers,  market\r\n\r\nstalls and caterers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to allow the AVA to regulate these food\r\n\r\nestablishments that are non-retail in nature, the AVA has  to\r\n\r\nbe provided with additional powers for the regulation of food\r\n\r\nestablishments.  The Bill incorporates various provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  current Environmental Public Health Act, as set  out  in\r\n\r\nclauses  2, 11, 12, 17 and 18, to enable the AVA to  take  an\r\n\r\napproach in the regulation of food establishments similar  to\r\n\r\nthat under the Environmental Public Health Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties of the existing Act were determined in\r\n\r\n1973.  Under various clauses of the Bill, such as clauses  6,\r\n\r\n7,  8,  9,  10,  13 and 15, read with section 37F  introduced\r\n\r\nunder  clause 17, many offences committed under the Act  will\r\n\r\nnow carry a maximum penalty of $5,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the first offence, and $10,000 and/or a jail term  of  3\r\n\r\nmonths  for  subsequent  offences.  The  proposed  amendments\r\n\r\nreflect  the  seriousness of offences  in  relation  to  food\r\n\r\nsafety and are commensurate with today's cost of living.  The\r\n\r\nincreases  in  penalties in the Bill take into  consideration\r\n\r\nthe  quantum of fines that can currently be imposed under the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Public Health Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Sale of Food Act has no provision for the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  offences.  But ENV  can  currently  compound\r\n\r\noffences relating to food establishments committed under  the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Public Health Act.  The  new  section  37G  of\r\n\r\nclause  17  provides  the  AVA with  the  power  to  compound\r\n\r\noffences  committed under the Sale of Food Act for  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of $1,000.  This provides consistency in enforcement\r\n\r\npower with the Environmental Public Health Act as well as for\r\n\r\nan effective and expeditious enforcement to be carried out on\r\n\r\nless serious offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments are consequential to the transfer\r\n\r\nof  food  safety  responsibilities from the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment to the AVA.  They are necessary to allow  AVA  to\r\n\r\nimplement these new responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>1.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Objective</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government intends to establish a new statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  the  National Environment Agency (NEA) by integrating\r\n\r\nthe    Environmental   Public   Health   Division   and   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Policy and Management of the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, and the Meteorological Service Department of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Transport.  The Bill before the House  provides\r\n\r\nthe legislative framework for the formation of NEA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for the formation of NEA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the formation of NEA is that the scope\r\n\r\nand  responsibility of the Ministry have  expanded  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   There are new environmental and public health issues\r\n\r\nfacing Singapore, and these have grown both in magnitude  and\r\n\r\ncomplexity.   Our  challenge is to improve our  environmental\r\n\r\nperformance in the short to medium terms.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nit  is  to enhance our environmental sustainability over  the\r\n\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are issues such as the limited land for solid\r\n\r\nwaste  disposal, the problem of emerging infectious  diseases\r\n\r\naround  the  world,  problems  of  trans-boundary  pollution,\r\n\r\nenergy  conservation, and the growing list  of  international\r\n\r\nconventions on the environment that we now have to adhere to.\r\n\r\nAll  these  have diverse policy and operational implications.\r\n\r\nMany  of these issues have now become more pressing,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  future they will become more important as our population\r\n\r\nand our economy continue to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed restructuring will result in a leaner,\r\n\r\nmore  policy-focused Ministry.  The processes in the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be  more streamlined, and the Agency will  become  more\r\n\r\noperation-focused.   The  division of responsibility  between\r\n\r\npolicy formulation and operational implementation will  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to focus on setting strategic policy directions\r\n\r\nand addressing key policy concerns more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEA, on the other hand, can direct its effort\r\n\r\ntowards   the  effective  implementation  and  operation   of\r\n\r\npolicies, and in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensuring a quality living environment for Singaporeans.  This\r\n\r\ndelineation of focus will allow ENV to better tackle existing\r\n\r\nas well as emerging environmental challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the NEA, the Environmental Policy and\r\n\r\nManagement  Division will continue to play a  major  role  in\r\n\r\nprotecting and sustaining our environment.  It will  continue\r\n\r\nto  implement  programmes  to  monitor,  reduce  and  prevent\r\n\r\nenvironmental  pollution.   More importantly,  it  will  also\r\n\r\nspearhead    new   initiatives   to   deliver   environmental\r\n\r\nperformance  and  enhance sustainable development.   Its  key\r\n\r\ngoals  will  be  to  minimise waste generation  and  maximise\r\n\r\nrecycling and resource conservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health Division will meanwhile\r\n\r\ncontinue to maintain a high standard of public health through\r\n\r\ncomprehensive disease surveillance, and improve  measures  to\r\n\r\npromote  food  hygiene,  vector  research  and  control,  and\r\n\r\nenvironmental sanitation.  It will also continue  to  play  a\r\n\r\nlead   role  in  enhancing  our  living  environment  through\r\n\r\nprogrammes  such  as  the Hawker Centres Upgrading  Programme\r\n\r\n(HUP) and the Clean Public Toilet Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the NEA will also allow us to\r\n\r\nbetter harness the complementary expertise in these agencies,\r\n\r\nby  bringing  on board the Meteorological Service  Department\r\n\r\n(MSD).   This  will  help us in areas of climate  change  and\r\n\r\ntrans-boundary haze pollution.  The technical competencies of\r\n\r\nMSD will complement the competencies that are currently found\r\n\r\nin the ENV departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSD is currently a key member of the local Haze Task\r\n\r\nForce.   It  will  also  serve as ENV's delegation  to  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmeetings  on the Environment and on Haze measures.  MSD  also\r\n\r\nprovides  weather  information  to  ENV  for  public   health\r\n\r\nwarnings, such as flooding and haze.  Under the NEA, MSD will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  fulfill  its  role of providing  meteorological\r\n\r\ninformation to the aviation, maritime and military sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new statutory board will be more focused, and\r\n\r\nwith  its  more  focused  mission and greater  administrative\r\n\r\nautonomy  and flexibility, its performance will be  improved.\r\n\r\nIt  will  strengthen its partnership with the people, private\r\n\r\nand public sectors (3P sectors).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore expect to see greater cooperation and\r\n\r\ncollaboration between the NEA and the 3P sectors and, in this\r\n\r\nway,  it  will  jointly  promote environmental  consciousness\r\n\r\namong  our  people, by implementing environmental  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  the  community.  The autonomy and flexibility  that  the\r\n\r\nAgency  will  enjoy  will allow it  to  be  more  nimble  and\r\n\r\ninnovative in discharging its duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the main features of the Bill.\r\n\r\nClause  5  provides for the appointment of the  Board,  which\r\n\r\nshall  consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and five  to\r\n\r\n12 other members.  All are to be appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 set out the functions, duties and\r\n\r\npowers of the Agency.  They are essentially the same as those\r\n\r\nalready   undertaken  by  the  Environmental  Public   Health\r\n\r\nDivision,  the Environmental Policy and Management  Division,\r\n\r\nand the Meteorological Service Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial provisions are in clauses 19 to 27. In\r\n\r\nparticular, clause 23 empowers the Agency to raise loans  and\r\n\r\nissue bonds.  Clause 24 empowers it to issue shares and other\r\n\r\nsecurities  to  the Minister for Finance as a consequence  of\r\n\r\nvesting  of  the  property, rights  and  liabilities  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 32 to 38 provide for the transfer of properties,\r\n\r\nassets and liabilities of the Agency.  All employees affected\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  transferred on terms no less favourable  than\r\n\r\nthose enjoyed by them immediately prior to their transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 39 to 50 cover some of the miscellaneous legal\r\n\r\nprovisions, which are necessary for the effective functioning\r\n\r\nof  the  Agency.  In particular, clause 41 empowers  MSD  the\r\n\r\npower, in case of emergency, to enter upon any land, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable  notice,  to  set up a meteorological  observation\r\n\r\nstation.  Clause 50 provides for the consequential amendments\r\n\r\nto legislation to be administered by the Agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions are standard provisions found in\r\n\r\nthe Acts of other statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, let me reiterate that the formation of\r\n\r\nthe new statutory board will give a sharper focus to our work\r\n\r\nin  ensuring a clean and sustainable environment for all.  It\r\n\r\nwill   allow  us  to  take  advantage  of  the  complementary\r\n\r\nexpertise  in  the three departments to be brought  together.\r\n\r\nIt will also provide greater autonomy and flexibility so that\r\n\r\nthe  Agency can be more agile and innovative, and  work  even\r\n\r\nmore closely and effectively with the 3P sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of a National Environment Agency will\r\n\r\nfacilitate the achievement of the targets as set out  in  our\r\n\r\nGreen  Plan  2012.   The proposed Agency  will  provide  more\r\n\r\nflexibility   and  efficiency  when  administering   policies\r\n\r\nconcerning  environmental  health, environmental  protection,\r\n\r\nresource  conservation, waste minimisation, waste  recycling,\r\n\r\nwaste  collection and disposal.  This will, hopefully, reduce\r\n\r\nadministrative bureaucracy resulting in better and affordable\r\n\r\nservices to businesses and consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the setting up of the National Environment\r\n\r\nAgency has certain benefits, I wish to highlight a number  of\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  its impact on businesses and consumers  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on autonomous agency. The proposed Agency will\r\n\r\nbe  an  autonomous  agency, and thus must  have  a  long-term\r\n\r\nsustainable  business  model.  As a regulator  and  licensing\r\n\r\nbody, I presume it will receive a grant from the Ministry and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollect  licensing  fees.   May  I  ask  the  Minister   what\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the  income will be from licensing  fee?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  any  mechanism in place to moderate  any  increase  of\r\n\r\nlicence  fees  in  the  future?  Furthermore,  what  are  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  savings in transferring these departments  out  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry into this new Agency?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is on set-up cost. As stated in the\r\n\r\nBill,  there  will  be  extra financial  expenditure  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  set up the Agency, but the  details  are  not\r\n\r\nprovided.   I hope that the Minister can enlighten the  House\r\n\r\non  the likely development and operating expenditures of  the\r\n\r\nAgency.   If  possible, I would propose that  the  Agency  be\r\n\r\nlocated  near the Ministry of National Development so  as  to\r\n\r\nprovide a one-stop service centre for the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Minister of State for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  ENV will promote more recycling of construction\r\n\r\nwaste  and  sustainable development in future.  The  proposed\r\n\r\nBCA's   registration  of  construction  firms  also  requires\r\n\r\nenvironmental management accreditation, which is  ISO  14000.\r\n\r\nThis calls for a greater integration between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development and Ministry of the Environment.  The co-location  of  services  of  these two  Ministries  will  help\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  save costs, and facilitate  the  approval  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area of concern is on the potential conflict\r\n\r\nof  interest.  Sir, as stated in clause 12(h), the Agency has\r\n\r\npower,  subject to the approval of the Minister, to  form  or\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the formation of any company, partnership  or\r\n\r\njoint  venture as a shareholder or partner or  in  any  other\r\n\r\ncapacity.  As a regulator and licensing body, there could  be\r\n\r\npotential  conflict  of interest if the  Agency  were  to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  business ventures, especially in  environmental\r\n\r\nrelated businesses.  This will impede open market competition\r\n\r\namong service providers, thus increasing cost of services.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister can clarify on this potential conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest and explain the rationale for allowing the Agency to\r\n\r\nparticipate in business activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also stated in clause 11(1) (b) that the Agency\r\n\r\ncan  provide consultancy services on matters concerning  food\r\n\r\nhygiene in the food retail industry, and in relation to  pest\r\n\r\ncontrol, environmental and other related industries.   Again,\r\n\r\nhow   can   a  regulator  provide  consultancy  services   to\r\n\r\nbusinesses and, at the same time, license and regulate  their\r\n\r\nclients' business activities?  Although the services  may  be\r\n\r\nprovided by different groups of staff in the Agency, both are\r\n\r\nserving  the  same master.  I hope the Minister can  consider\r\n\r\nthe removal of such provision in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area of concern is on protection from\r\n\r\nliability.   Sir, clause 17(3) protects the  Agency  and  its\r\n\r\nemployees from any liability if the Agency provides a service\r\n\r\nto  the public whereby information is supplied to the public.\r\n\r\nThis is an unfair clause and does not offer any protection to\r\n\r\nthe  public, who may suffer losses as a result of  errors  or\r\n\r\nomissions made by the Agency or its employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause does not provide any redress to the public\r\n\r\nfor their losses.  It is also unhealthy to have such a clause\r\n\r\nas  it erodes accountability of the Agency and its employees.\r\n\r\nThe protection clause will result in employees being careless\r\n\r\nwhen  providing services or information to the public.  As  a\r\n\r\nregulatory body, the Agency must be held responsible for  its\r\n\r\nactions.   The public must also have the right to seek  legal\r\n\r\nredress, if necessary.  Thus, I would propose to the Minister\r\n\r\nto delete the unfair protection clause in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we have such an Agency set up to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  focused  attention to matters pertaining  to  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.   As Singapore becomes more and more  congested,\r\n\r\nwith  increasing number of people living in the  country  and\r\n\r\nmore  vehicles congesting our roads, a focused  attention  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make sure that our environment  is  free  from\r\n\r\nunnecessary pollution, be it in the air, water or  from  food\r\n\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that the services of the\r\n\r\nmeteorological  stations are now under the  purview  of  this\r\n\r\nAgency.   Apart  from  providing meteorological  services  to\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies, it has the important role of making sure\r\n\r\nthat  our shipping and aviation communities are supplied with\r\n\r\naccurate  data on the weather.  An environmental agency  with\r\n\r\nthese powers to provide such services would be in line with a\r\n\r\nmore focused view on environmental control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the functions already listed out in the Bill be further\r\n\r\nexpanded  to include environmental issues relating to  nature\r\n\r\nconservation.  It should have the power to monitor  areas  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, such as our natural forest or mangrove swamps that\r\n\r\nare in danger of being lost in the name of progress.  Such an\r\n\r\nexample  is  in the recent issue of the wasteland at  Tanjung\r\n\r\nChek  Jawa  at  Pulau  Ubin, which was saved  by  the  timely\r\n\r\nintervention of concerned members of the public.  These areas\r\n\r\nare, in a sense, natural parks and serve as a reminder of the\r\n\r\nwonders   of   nature.   There,  we  can  learn  the   inter-relationship  of living things with the environment  and  the\r\n\r\nassociated   flora   and   fauna,  something   which   future\r\n\r\ngenerations  of Singaporeans may miss learning from,  if  all\r\n\r\nthese  indigenous ecosystems were to be wiped  out  from  our\r\n\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that we already have the National Parks Act\r\n\r\nto look into nature conservation matters.  But the Act is too\r\n\r\nrestrictive  in  that  it controls and administers  only  our\r\n\r\nnational parks and nature reserves, such as the Sungei  Buloh\r\n\r\nNature   Reserves  and  Labrador  Park.   I  feel  that   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment Agency should be given the power to look  at  the\r\n\r\nbigger picture as compared to the National Parks Board, which\r\n\r\nlooks  after  built-up  parks and gazetted  nature  reserves.\r\n\r\nEvery  bit  of our natural habitat, including the water  mass\r\n\r\nthat  comes with it, once transformed, may never be regained.\r\n\r\nWe need an environmental agency to look into projects such as\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  new golf course at the Kranji marshlands  that\r\n\r\nwill  destroy precious feeding grounds for herons and a  long\r\n\r\ntime habitat for more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan   90  species  of  birds.   If  it  were  not  for   the\r\n\r\nintervention of the Nature Society of Singapore, the  meeting\r\n\r\nbetween  the  developer of the golf course, the URA  and  the\r\n\r\nNational   Parks  Board  may  not  have  taken   place,   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would  have lost another  natural  habitat  for\r\n\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A master plan should be drawn up by this Agency to\r\n\r\npreserve areas of Singapore, not from the standpoint  of  the\r\n\r\nUrban  Redevelopment Authority and the National Parks  Board,\r\n\r\nwhich  may  focus  too much on redevelopment,  but  from  the\r\n\r\nconservationists' view under the Environment Agency.  Through\r\n\r\nthat  course,  we  will not make decisions to  transform  our\r\n\r\nnatural habitat into concrete jungles too quickly.  Even  all\r\n\r\nour  recent reclaimed land, such as Jurong Island,  can  very\r\n\r\nquickly  turn  into natural habitats for birds when  suitable\r\n\r\ntrees  and vegetation grow on them, and in the tropics  these\r\n\r\nthrive  very  quickly.   Such  areas  could  come  under  the\r\n\r\nattention of the proposed Environment Agency for conservation\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to add another suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe  Environment Agency should be given the power under  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  set up mini-meteorological stations in  our  parks.\r\n\r\nThis  would  not  only  serve  to provide  localised  weather\r\n\r\ninformation but would also attract residents to make  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  parks for information and educational purposes.   I  can\r\n\r\nsee  parents bringing their children there to teach  them  or\r\n\r\neven  teach  themselves how our daily  rainfall  and  weather\r\n\r\ntemperatures  are  being  collected  and  measured,  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance of knowing these figures, and how to predict  them\r\n\r\nunder changing wind directions as well as seasonal changes in\r\n\r\nweather patterns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such interest, when generated, may spur the growth of a\r\n\r\nweather industry as well as its related economic benefits  to\r\n\r\nthe  nation.  In fact, I came across an advertisement showing\r\n\r\na  perfect  Father's  Day  gift - a  Galileo  thermometer  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  the weather temperature, not very accurate,  but  it\r\n\r\npromotes awareness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our exposure to the elements, at a special reduced  price\r\n\r\nof  US$18.95,  inclusive of delivery.  Outdoor sportsmen  and\r\n\r\nwomen  may  also  want to carry with them  a  pocket  weather\r\n\r\ntracker, lest they find themselves baking under the  hot  sun\r\n\r\nor  drenched  by the rain.  Such interest would involve  more\r\n\r\npeople  to connect themselves to nature and learn to  respect\r\n\r\nits awesome powers and gentleness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another function given to the Environment Agency, under\r\n\r\nclause 11(1) (n), is to promote energy efficiency, the use of\r\n\r\nclean  energy,  the  use of clean technologies,  the  use  of\r\n\r\nefficient  pollution  technologies and  waste  recycling.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  these  functions fully.  However,  the  Bill  is\r\n\r\nsilent  as to whether any researches need to be done  in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  clean energy.  We have heard much about  this,  but\r\n\r\nwhat is clean solar energy, clean wind energy or some others,\r\n\r\nand  how  do  we know that it is beneficial to  the  country?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  a  clear  definition is needed to help  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nidentify the new age energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the point relating to offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  under this Bill, I would urge the Minister  to  be\r\n\r\nfirm  as  well  as being compassionate when deciding  on  the\r\n\r\nquantum of fines, when the Bill is finally enacted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 46(1), compositions of offences can be\r\n\r\nimposed  on  offenders  for up to $1,000,  and  clause  48(2)\r\n\r\nallows  fines  of up to $10,000, or with imprisonment  for  a\r\n\r\nterm  not  exceeding 12 months or with both.   As  this  Bill\r\n\r\ncovers  acts  ranging from littering on  the  streets  up  to\r\n\r\npollution of our coastal waters, I hope that the severity  of\r\n\r\nthe  offences  will vary with lighter fines bearing  on  acts\r\n\r\nsuch as littering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has no natural resources that we can boast of,\r\n\r\nbut  it  has abundant natural habitats that nature  provides.\r\n\r\nThese  natural landscapes, once carefully crafted  out,  will\r\n\r\nshow the world that we care for the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to compliment the Hon. Minister for his\r\n\r\nwisdom in setting up this Agency, which will not only allow a\r\n\r\ngreater flexibility and interest in managing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  environment,  but  also greater professionalism  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of its daily functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members - Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr\r\n\r\nAndy Gan - for speaking up in support of the Bill.  I will go\r\n\r\nthrough some of the issues raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Dr Teo is concerned whether the National\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Agency (NEA), being an autonomous  agency,  will\r\n\r\nadopt a business model that is revenue-driven.  I suppose  Dr\r\n\r\nTeo  is concerned, firstly, whether this Agency would compete\r\n\r\nwith  the  industry for business and, secondly, whether  this\r\n\r\nAgency will over-emphasise on revenue generation to keep  the\r\n\r\nAgency going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I want to assure the Member that, firstly,\r\n\r\nthe NEA will be an Agency funded by the Government.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  the NEA is not set up to be a self-funding  statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  but  rather a statutory board - to be funded  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to offer public services.  Secondly, the  revenues\r\n\r\ncollected  by the NEA, whether it is through fees, fines  and\r\n\r\nso  on, NEA will not get to keep the revenue for its own use.\r\n\r\nThis  is because every year, NEA will be getting a grant from\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   So whatever revenue the NEA  is  going  to\r\n\r\ncollect,  through  fees, fines and  so  on,  will  be  offset\r\n\r\nagainst  the  grant from the Government.  As far  as  NEA  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it will be operating on an annual budget based  on\r\n\r\nits  operating  requirements.  It is not  driven  by  revenue\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo is concerned whether NEA will compete with the\r\n\r\nprivate sector for business.  Sir, here, I want to assure the\r\n\r\nHouse that, again, it is not the intention of NEA.  The staff\r\n\r\nof NEA, from time to time, will offer consultancy service for\r\n\r\noverseas   projects.   For  example,  we   extend   technical\r\n\r\nassistance to the Riau province in Indonesia, under a G to  G\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Basically, we offer consultancy to organisations\r\n\r\nand projects in the region for the purpose of enhancing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregional  collaboration.  The officers may also be  asked  to\r\n\r\nundertake  some consultancy services - maybe in  places  like\r\n\r\nChina.   These projects are undertaken in order to,  firstly,\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our collaboration on a country-to-country  basis;\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, to enable our staff at NEA, as part of  their\r\n\r\nprofessional  development,  to keep  track  of  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and issues faced in the region.  But, at the  end\r\n\r\nof  day,  I  want  to assure the House that  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  for NEA to function as a business entity,  because\r\n\r\nit is not set up to be a business entity. It will continue to\r\n\r\nbe   a  Government-funded  statutory  board.   And  the  main\r\n\r\nresponsibility, as my MOS has presented, is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nenvironmental  performance in Singapore will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nimproved, and the foundation for sustainability will continue\r\n\r\nto be enhanced.  Most of these works will be done through the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  by the private sector.  ENV  will  set  the\r\n\r\npolicy;  and the NEA will enforce on the operational aspects;\r\n\r\nwhereas the actual implementation will be done by the private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo brought up another point regarding the protection\r\n\r\ngranted  to employees and officers of the Board.  Sir,  here,\r\n\r\nagain,  I want to emphasise that, as public sector employees,\r\n\r\nNEA  employees, from time to time, are asked by  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to  provide information regarding certain aspects  of\r\n\r\nour work.  For example, waste disposal, clean air, and so on.\r\n\r\nBased  on good faith, from time to time, my officers do share\r\n\r\nsome technical information with the private sector.  But  how\r\n\r\nthis  technical information could be applied  to  a  specific\r\n\r\nsituation  is something that the NEA officers should  not  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to take on the responsibility.  Take, for  example,\r\n\r\nif  someone  were to come to NEA and say that if he  were  to\r\n\r\npurchase  a  ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD)  vehicle,  would\r\n\r\nthat ULSD vehicle satisfy NEA's emission standard?  Based  on\r\n\r\ntechnical  specifications, the NEA officers should  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to advise him.  They will say, \"Yes, if you  go  by\r\n\r\nthe  international standard for ULSD vehicles, you should  be\r\n\r\nable  to  satisfy  the requirement.\"  But what  if  the  ULSD\r\n\r\nvehicle turns out to be violating our emission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards   due  to  maintenance  or  operational   problems?\r\n\r\nFirstly,   does  it  mean  that  NEA  officers  cannot   take\r\n\r\nenforcement  action against that person?  Secondly,  does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that once enforcement action is taken against  him,  he\r\n\r\ncan  take counter action against our officers for giving  him\r\n\r\nwrong information?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the day, we have to bear in mind that\r\n\r\nthe more we remove this protection of good faith from the NEA\r\n\r\nofficers,  the  more  it is likely that  the  officers  would\r\n\r\nbehave  in an even more bureaucratic manner.  As my  MOS  has\r\n\r\npointed out, the purpose of the NEA is to strengthen  the  3P\r\n\r\npartnership,  meaning that we would very much  like  to  work\r\n\r\nvery  closely with the people sector, the public  sector  and\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  In that regard, as  we  work  together\r\n\r\nbased  on  good  faith,  it is very important  that  whatever\r\n\r\ninformation  and assistance that the officers  offer  out  of\r\n\r\ngood faith to the industry and private sector, should not  be\r\n\r\ntaken against them.  At the end of the day, it is really  for\r\n\r\nthe recipients of the information to make their own technical\r\n\r\nor  business  assessment on whether they want to  accept  the\r\n\r\ninput of the NEA officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to respond to the points raised by\r\n\r\nMr  Andy  Gan.   Basically, Mr Andy Gan asked whether  nature\r\n\r\nconservation  should come under the NEA.   Broadly  speaking,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  environmental  angle, there  are  three  types  of\r\n\r\nissues.   First  is  the  green  issue  relating  to   nature\r\n\r\nconservation,  bio-diversity, and so on.    The  second  type\r\n\r\nwill  be the brown issue, eg, pollution control, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAnd  the third type will be the blue issue, eg, marine  life,\r\n\r\nmarine diversity, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, all over the world, there is no standard\r\n\r\npractice  on how the government should organise its  agencies\r\n\r\nto  address  the  blue, brown and green  issues.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in the case of USA, the USEPA is basically an agency\r\n\r\nthat looks after the brown issues.  The blue and green issues\r\n\r\nare  looked  after by some other agencies.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nGermany,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  example, one agency takes charge of all three  issues  - green,  brown and blue.  In the case of Singapore,  ENV,  and\r\n\r\nnow  NEA,  will continue to be responsible for  handling  the\r\n\r\nbrown issues.  In the case of NParks, it will continue to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the green issues.  The Marine Port  Authority\r\n\r\n(MPA) will continue to take charge of the blue issues.   This\r\n\r\nis  not  without  good  reasons.  Because,  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, marine resources are used mainly for port traffic.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  it makes more sense for MPA to  regulate  the\r\n\r\ntraffic   flow   in  our  water,  and  enforce  environmental\r\n\r\nprotection measures at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, here, I want to point out that any land-based\r\n\r\npollution, any activities on land that may lead to  pollution\r\n\r\nin the water, will continue to come under NEA and ENV.  There\r\n\r\nis  therefore no gap in our responsibility.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nNParks,  many of our green issues have to do with  land  use.\r\n\r\nMany  of  the  examples mentioned by Mr Andy Gan  really  are\r\n\r\nissues between balancing environmental consideration and land\r\n\r\nuse  consideration.  Up till now, I think the Government  has\r\n\r\nfound it most efficient and most effective for NParks to come\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of National Development, because land  use\r\n\r\nconsideration and environmental management consideration  can\r\n\r\nbest be balanced within the same Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to emphasise that just because NEA is\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  brown issues,  NParks  after  the  green\r\n\r\nissues, and MPA after the blue issues, it does not mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  three agencies will be working in isolation.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  three  agencies  work very closely together.   One  good\r\n\r\nexample is the SGP 2012.  NParks is an integral part of  this\r\n\r\nwhole  exercise.  By the time the SGP 2012 is formulated  and\r\n\r\nimplemented, ENV, NEA, NParks and MPA will collectively  take\r\n\r\njoint  responsibility  in the overall implementation  of  SGP\r\n\r\n2012.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Andy Gan also asked whether we can do something\r\n\r\nto  enhance the interest of our younger generation  in  local\r\n\r\nweather  broadcast and so on, so that in time to come,  maybe\r\n\r\nwe can even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnurture  a weather industry.  Sir, this is a very interesting\r\n\r\nidea.   I will convey this to MSD.  Once it comes under  NEA,\r\n\r\nwe will see what can be done and what needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan also asked whether NEA will set very clear\r\n\r\npolicy directions regarding the research direction for  clean\r\n\r\nenergy.   Sir, the NEA, basically, will pursue management  by\r\n\r\noutcome.   The concern of the NEA will be to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nambient  air  quality  of Singapore will  remain  within  the\r\n\r\nstandard  imposed  by the World Health Organisation  and  the\r\n\r\nUSEPA.  Research is a means to the end.  In other words, NEA,\r\n\r\nin  itself,  will  not undertake research.  Rather,  it  will\r\n\r\npursue  the  3P partnership.  NEA will encourage research  in\r\n\r\nthe  technical community.  NEA will promote innovation in the\r\n\r\nindustry,  and commercialisation in the marketplace  so  that\r\n\r\nthe results of research can be widespread.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other words, NEA will be looking at how upstream\r\n\r\nR&D,  midstream  innovation, and  downstream  deployment  and\r\n\r\ncommercialisation, can be best synergised without getting too\r\n\r\ninvolved directly in any of these areas of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, Mr Andy Gan suggested that the\r\n\r\npenalty  that  we  impose should take into consideration  the\r\n\r\nseverity  of the offences.  I fully agree with Mr  Andy  Gan.\r\n\r\nWhen   we  impose  penalty,  we  will  certainly  take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration the implication and impact on the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the points brought\r\n\r\nup by the Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Balaji Sadasivan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \"\r\n\r\n- [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-Seven</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Two o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation, Communications and the Arts if he  will  give  a\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the  grants given out  by  the  National  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil   by  (i)  type  of  Arts  Groups,  (ii)  number   of\r\n\r\napplications for grants for the years 2000 and 2001 and (iii)\r\n\r\nnumber rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T E Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T E Lim:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown of grants given out by NAC by art forms1\r\n\r\nand by ethnic group is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>                                                  \r\n\r\n      Art Forms              FY2000            FY2001\r\n\r\nTheatre                 $3.03m     40%     $3.15m   38%\r\n\r\nDance                   $1.41m     19%     $1.63m   19%\r\n\r\nMusic                   $1.52m     20%     $1.49m   18%\r\n\r\nVisual Arts             $0.94m     13%     $1.09m   13%\r\n\r\nLiterature              $0.35m     5%      $0.33m    4%\r\n\r\nMulti-Disciplinary   /  $0.24m     3%      $0.66m    8%\r\n\r\nOthers\r\n\r\nTotal                   $7.49m    100%     $8.34m   100%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   \r\n\r\nLanguage/ Ethnic Category2      FY2000          FY2001\r\n\r\nChinese                     $1.93m  30.2%   $1.79m  26.0%\r\n\r\nMalay                       $0.17m   2.7%   $0.27m  3.9%\r\n\r\nIndian                      $0.23m   3.6%   $0.19m  2.8%\r\n\r\nEnglish          Language/  $4.05m  63.5%   $4.63m  67.3%\r\n\r\nContemporary3\r\n\r\nTotal                       $6.38m   100%   $6.88m  100%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grants from NAC do not include funding provided to\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Symphony Orchestra and the Singapore Chinese\r\n\r\nOrchestra by the Government and/or the Tote Board.
