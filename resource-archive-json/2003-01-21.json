There  is\r\n\r\nno  question  of the offset not being adequate  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the latest data from CPF Board, about\r\n\r\n100,336  Singaporeans, or about 5% of the total  of  2.18\r\n\r\nmillion  eligible  Singaporeans, did not  contribute  $50\r\n\r\ninto  their CPF accounts by 31st December 2002.  This  is\r\n\r\nlower  than the earlier reported figure of 128,000, which\r\n\r\nwas  not  the  final count, as last minute  contributions\r\n\r\nwere still being processed by CPF Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed breakdown is in the table (Cols. 2273 - 2274) that I have circulated to Members, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou  should find it on your seats.

There were 9,791 of such\r\n\r\ncases in all (in other words, welfare homes, 1-rooms  and\r\n\r\n2-rooms).

In  August  2002,\r\n\r\nCPF Board sent letters to all Singaporeans to inform them\r\n\r\nof  the  ERS Scheme and to remind those who had  not  yet\r\n\r\ntopped up to do so as soon as possible.  In November  and\r\n\r\nDecember  2002, MOF and CPF Board issued press  releases,\r\n\r\nand ran radio trailers and newspaper advertisements.   We\r\n\r\nmobilised  the  grassroots  organisations  (GROs).    The\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations not only put up reminder posters\r\n\r\nat HDB void decks, but made house visits to those staying\r\n\r\nin 1- to 3-room HDB flats.  If the occupants were not in,\r\n\r\nthey  made repeat visits; sometimes three or four  times.\r\n\r\nIf the residents could not afford the $50, the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  helped them financially on a  case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be many reasons why people did not top\r\n\r\nup  their CPF accounts in time.  Some may have forgotten,\r\n\r\nothers may have been overseas.  There may even have  been\r\n\r\nsome  who  were  not  interested  in  the  shares.    The\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  who  made  the  house  visits   have\r\n\r\nreported that a significant proportion of those  who  had\r\n\r\nnot  topped-up their CPF accounts could not be  found  at\r\n\r\nthe  addresses given.  Conceivably, they had not  updated\r\n\r\ntheir   addresses  on  their  NRICs  with  the   National\r\n\r\nRegistration  Office and hence, would not  have  received\r\n\r\ninformation about the ERS scheme posted to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the lower income households, especially the\r\n\r\nolder  folks, many of those who did not top  up  probably\r\n\r\ndid not have active CPF accounts.  They may have found it\r\n\r\ndifficult to top up their accounts, even though help from\r\n\r\nthe GROs was available.  Some may not have understood how\r\n\r\nthe scheme would help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Lily Neo have asked to waive\r\n\r\nthe  $50  CPF top-up requirement for those with financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Let  me explain the purpose  of  the  $50\r\n\r\ncontribution.    Besides  encouraging   Singaporeans   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  an  active CPF account that helps  provide  for\r\n\r\ntheir retirement, the top-up is a way for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nshow  that they are doing something to receive their ERS.\r\n\r\nIt  is really to put up your hand and say, \"I'm here.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to participate in the scheme\".   It  is  not\r\n\r\ndesirable for the Government simply to give the shares to\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans, without even knowing where  he  is  or\r\n\r\nwhether he wants the shares.  For example, the person may\r\n\r\nhave  emigrated,  and may not have maintained  his  links\r\n\r\nwith Singapore.  Why should we give it to him?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Mr Loh Meng See and Dr Amy Khor have\r\n\r\nasked  if  the Government will give those who missed  out\r\n\r\nanother chance to benefit from the scheme. For those  who\r\n\r\nare  not  poor, and these form the majority of those  who\r\n\r\ndid  not top up, I think we should respect their decision\r\n\r\nnot  to  participate in the scheme.  The Government  made\r\n\r\nthem  an  offer, they decided not to take it up,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould leave the matter there.  We have to be fair to the\r\n\r\n95% of Singaporeans who took the trouble to top up by the\r\n\r\ndeadline,  some of them queuing up to do so on  the  last\r\n\r\nday.   If  each  time the Government sets a deadline,  it\r\n\r\ngets  extended because people did not make the effort  to\r\n\r\nmeet  it, soon the Government's terms and statements will\r\n\r\nnot be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the lower income groups, ie, the 9,791\r\n\r\ncases  of  1-roomers,  2-roomers and  people  in  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes,  I  agree  fully with the MPs that  we  should  be\r\n\r\nflexible and make a further effort to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreach  them.  They are the ones most likely to  have  had\r\n\r\ngenuine financial difficulties and to have been unable to\r\n\r\nmake alternative arrangements.  They are the most in need\r\n\r\nof the ERS shares.  The Government will therefore make  a\r\n\r\nspecial arrangement to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will give all the Advisors to the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations the list of residents staying in 1- and  2-room HDB flats, and welfare homes, who have not topped up\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF.   The grassroots organisations  will  get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  them  and  make  arrangements  for  them  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the ERS scheme, extending financial  help\r\n\r\nwhere  necessary.  As the numbers are not  too  many,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be feasible for us to take this more personalised\r\n\r\napproach.   The special facility will be provided  up  to\r\n\r\n31st  March  2003,  to give the grassroots  organisations\r\n\r\nsufficient  time to identify and reach out  to  those  in\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked whether the unallocated money\r\n\r\nfrom  the ERS will be channelled to provide more  aid  to\r\n\r\nthe  poor and needy.  The special arrangement I have just\r\n\r\nmentioned  will  help  some more needy  Singaporeans  get\r\n\r\ntheir ERS.  The rest of the ERS money will remain in  the\r\n\r\nERS   Fund,   and   become  available  for   future   ERS\r\n\r\ndistributions.  The ERS Fund is set up as a private trust\r\n\r\nfund   specifically  to  distribute  ERS   shares.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has many other schemes to help the  poor  and\r\n\r\nneedy who require assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For future lots of ERS, we are considering possible\r\n\r\nways  to  be  more  flexible with  the  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrequirement,   especially  for  the   lower-income,   the\r\n\r\nelderly,  and Singaporeans staying in welfare homes.

The\r\n\r\nother question that I have is on the almost 10,000 people\r\n\r\n-  the  1-roomers,  2-roomers and  residents  of  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes.    The   Deputy   Prime   Minister   spoke   about\r\n\r\narrangements.  What exactly are these arrangements?

But I am assured that the Advisors have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  it  and  wherever people needed  assistance  and\r\n\r\ncould not afford the $50, it has been forthcoming.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think the number is very large.  I believe they would\r\n\r\nnumber in a few hundreds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what exactly the arrangements will be for the\r\n\r\n10,000  which we are talking about now, I leave  that  to\r\n\r\nthe   Advisors.    I  have  discussed   it   with   them,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Advisors from the constituencies  which\r\n\r\nhave  larger concentrations of the poor and older  folks,\r\n\r\nlike  Dr Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer and a few others who have\r\n\r\nsmaller  flats and older residents.  And they assured  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  financing is not a problem.  The question  is:\r\n\r\ndoes  the  person want to participate and is it really  a\r\n\r\nproblem that he is unable to find the $50?  If it is,  we\r\n\r\ncan  make the arrangements for him.  Because if you  just\r\n\r\nlook  at  it,  10,000 people times $50, it  is  $500,000;\r\n\r\ndivided  by 80 Advisors, it is about $6,000 per  Advisor.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  an  enormous amount of  money.

We  are  asking\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to save 6% of their income in Medisave  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we have to make use of our Medisave correctly.\r\n\r\nThe  policy of Medisave is to target this saving  at  the\r\n\r\nmore  expensive medical treatments, which is largely  the\r\n\r\ninpatient care.  Over the years, we have extended  it  to\r\n\r\nsome outpatient care which is very expensive too.  But so\r\n\r\nfar, we have not allowed Medisave to be used for GP care,\r\n\r\nfor  step-down care, home medical and home nursing  care.\r\n\r\nAnd I think these are very sensible reasons.  Because  if\r\n\r\nwe  allow  Medisave  to be used for  GP  care,  for  home\r\n\r\nnursing  and  home medical, very soon you will  not  have\r\n\r\nvery much Medisave left for your hospitalisation care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we made an exception. We recognised that\r\n\r\nhome  medical and home nursing care for the very severely\r\n\r\ndisabled will cost a lot of money, and that is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy we introduced ElderShield and allowed Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nuse  up to 1% of their Medisave if they insure themselves\r\n\r\nunder  ElderShield.

But if we extend Medisave to all kinds  of\r\n\r\nhome  medical  and  home nursing, then your  6%  Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution  will  not be enough.

And does he agree that this is an  important\r\n\r\narea to develop in view of the demographic profile?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree entirely with the Member.\r\n\r\nI  think  home  medical  and home  nursing  are  critical\r\n\r\ncomponents  of  our step-down care infrastructure.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  last  two years, for example, we have put  in  place\r\n\r\nwhat  we designate as approved providers - nursing homes,\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospitals - who can extend  home  medical  and\r\n\r\nhome  nursing services.  We are trying to build  up  such\r\n\r\nservices, not just by specialised home medical  and  home\r\n\r\nnursing  services like the Home Nursing  Foundation,  but\r\n\r\nalso  extend  the  provision by other  groups  -  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes,  community hospitals - so that these  become  more\r\n\r\nreadily  available.   Recently,  I  announced  that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry is extending training grants for step-down care,\r\n\r\nnot  just  professionals in the community  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nnursing homes, but also people extending home medical and\r\n\r\nhome  nursing services.  So, we recognise that this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important  area.  It is a very  manpower  intensive\r\n\r\narea, despite Singapore being a small island.  If we have\r\n\r\na nurse visiting homes, there is a very limited number of\r\n\r\nvisits she can make every day.  So it is a very expensive\r\n\r\nservice.   But  we  recognise that this is  an  important\r\n\r\nservice  because  it  helps to keep the  elderly  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, in the home, and we intend to build this up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXPULSION OF STUDENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statistics and guidelines)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation (a) how many students, by levels, were expelled\r\n\r\nfrom schools for each year from 2000 to 2002; (b) whether\r\n\r\nthese  numbers  had been increasing over the  years;  (c)\r\n\r\nwhat  are the current guidelines provided by the Ministry\r\n\r\nto school principals regarding the expulsion of students;\r\n\r\n(d) what help and counselling these students are given or\r\n\r\ncan  turn to before and after expulsion; and (e)  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry can provide clear guidelines and assistance\r\n\r\nfor  their re-admission to schools, instead of asking the\r\n\r\nstudents  and  their  parents to apply  directly  to  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of students\r\n\r\nexpelled  at the primary level was 0 in year 2000,  three\r\n\r\nin  year  2001 and four in year 2002.  For the  secondary\r\n\r\nlevel,  the statistics were 118 in 2000, 164 in 2001  and\r\n\r\n94  in 2002.  At the pre-university level, it was six  in\r\n\r\n2000 and none in 2001 and 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students expelled at the primary level\r\n\r\nhas  remained  small  over the last three  years,  and  I\r\n\r\nshould clarify that out of the four who were expelled  in\r\n\r\nyear 2002, two of them were really drop-out cases who had\r\n\r\nMalaysian  parents and went back to Malaysia.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen technically classified as expulsion cases because of\r\n\r\nabsenteeism but they are really drop-out cases.  For  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  and pre-university levels, there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nfalling  trend.  This can be attributed to  the  measures\r\n\r\nput  in place by schools, junior colleges and centralised\r\n\r\ninstitutes  to instill good discipline in their  students\r\n\r\nand to sustain their interest in schooling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student is expelled if he commits a very serious\r\n\r\noffence  such as assault, and if allowing him  to  remain\r\n\r\nwould  threaten the safety of other students or undermine\r\n\r\nschool   discipline.   There  are  also  some  cases   of\r\n\r\nexpulsion   on   account   of   persistent   absenteeism.\r\n\r\nExpulsion is only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndone  as a last resort when measures such as counselling,\r\n\r\nsuspension  and other disciplinary measures have  had  no\r\n\r\neffect  on improving the student's conduct or discipline.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  does  not  have a  set  of  guidelines  on\r\n\r\nexpulsion which principals have to follow.  The principal\r\n\r\nhas  the  full  authority to decide on the  expulsion  of\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  students.  The principal  is  in  the  best\r\n\r\nposition to decide when a student should be removed  from\r\n\r\nthe  school  for serious misdemeanours so as to  maintain\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and good order for the safety and welfare  of\r\n\r\nall students in the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools take a proactive approach to ensure that\r\n\r\nstudents  remain interested in schooling.  The  proactive\r\n\r\nmeasures that schools adopt include pastoral care,  life-skills and career guidance programmes which are aimed  at\r\n\r\nhelping  students build self esteem, take  responsibility\r\n\r\nfor their own actions and develop purposefulness in life.\r\n\r\nEach school has in place a formal structure involving the\r\n\r\nPrincipal,   Vice-Principal  and   teacher   counsellors,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  external agencies, such as the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  and family service centres to counsel and  assist\r\n\r\nstudents with behavioural problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intervention measures that schools adopt include\r\n\r\ncounselling  the  students with the  involvement  of  the\r\n\r\nparents.   Schools  also  work  quite  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor also asked about readmission to schools.\r\n\r\nStudents  who  have been expelled can  be  readmitted  to\r\n\r\nanother  school.  Having students apply directly  to  the\r\n\r\nnew  school  for  readmission is part of the  process  of\r\n\r\nhelping them turn over a new leaf.  In personally seeking\r\n\r\nreadmission to the new school, the student will have  the\r\n\r\nchance to explain why he is deserving of a second chance.\r\n\r\nThe  student will have to give an undertaking to his  new\r\n\r\nprincipal that he would take personal responsibility  for\r\n\r\nhis  conduct and attitude.  This has been found to be  an\r\n\r\neffective approach in helping the student value his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation  and  eventually  improve  in  the  new  school\r\n\r\nenvironment.

Where necessary, MOE  will  assist  in\r\n\r\ntheir  readmission.  Upon readmission,  the  school  will\r\n\r\nprovide  guidance and counselling to the student to  help\r\n\r\nhim  maintain  good behaviour.  Ultimately, however,  the\r\n\r\nstudent must have a desire to learn and benefit from  the\r\n\r\neducational opportunities offered to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to inform the Senior Minister of State  for\r\n\r\nEducation  that I have come across students  and  parents\r\n\r\nwho  are very frustrated because they cannot get into any\r\n\r\nschool  after expulsion.  I would like to ask the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  whether the present  ranking  system\r\n\r\nactually  discourages  principals  from  admitting   such\r\n\r\nstudents,  because it will pull down the overall  ranking\r\n\r\nof the school.

The  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents expelled is actually very small, to begin  with.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is not that students are expelled for performing\r\n\r\nbadly academically as such.  They are behaving badly, and\r\n\r\nthey are affecting the quality of the school environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student has to have the desire to learn and\r\n\r\nconform  with what the school considers to be appropriate\r\n\r\nconduct.  That is the main criterion.  Students who  fail\r\n\r\nto  get readmission are usually those who are not able to\r\n\r\nconvince  the new school to take them in, that they  have\r\n\r\nreformed, that they have turned over a new leaf, and that\r\n\r\nthey are going to put in that extra effort.

I do not think it is\r\n\r\npossible  to put a number on it, because it is really  up\r\n\r\nto  the  students and the parents rather than the school.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  the House that schools go  through  great\r\n\r\neffort to prevent the situation from coming to the  point\r\n\r\nat which expulsion is really necessary.

But who is to decide at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the day?  They do not seem to  be  given  a\r\n\r\nchance.  Does the Ministry check on what is happening  to\r\n\r\nthese  expelled students?  How genuine is it  that  these\r\n\r\nstudents cannot turn over a new leaf at all?  Or  is  the\r\n\r\nprincipals' concern that by admitting such students, they\r\n\r\nare inviting problems to their schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> First, let me reiterate\r\n\r\nthat  the number is very small.

It is usually after several months  of\r\n\r\ncounselling of both student and parent before this action\r\n\r\nis taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not institutionalise the system by having\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education arrange for  readmission  of\r\n\r\nstudents automatically into another school.  There has to\r\n\r\nbe  more than a modicum of effort required on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  student  and  his parents to gain readmission  to  a\r\n\r\nschool.  That effort is required.  It should not  be  too\r\n\r\neasy  to  get  readmission to a school, because  then  we\r\n\r\nchange the whole process, which requires that the student\r\n\r\nreally  turns over a new leaf before getting readmission.\r\n\r\nIf it is a process of central allocation, the student can\r\n\r\nbring a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education letter to the principal  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Please  readmit  me.\"  He does not have  to  change  his\r\n\r\nconduct and his parents do not have to vouch for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, it is a system in which it is not smooth\r\n\r\nsailing for those students who have been expelled to gain\r\n\r\nreadmission.

If  the  students have great  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nseeking  readmission to another school, not because  they\r\n\r\ndo not want to change over a new leaf but because the new\r\n\r\nschool's  principal may think that it is not  appropriate\r\n\r\nto  have  such troublemakers in the school, what  is  the\r\n\r\nbest  approach the Ministry would suggest to students  in\r\n\r\nthat predicament?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> There are two parts to\r\n\r\nthe  question: one, on the process of expulsion, and  the\r\n\r\nother on the process of readmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the process of expulsion, the Ministry respects\r\n\r\nthe  authority  of the principal.  The principal  reports\r\n\r\nall such cases to the Ministry and they give the reasons.\r\n\r\nIf  we come across a case where it is clearly a matter of\r\n\r\npoor judgment on the part of the school, we will want  to\r\n\r\ndo  something.  But we have not come across  such  cases,\r\n\r\nand  we trust our principals to make good judgments.

Because there are many cases\r\n\r\nwhere the principals, for various reasons, do not want to\r\n\r\nadmit  them and the students actually go from  school  to\r\n\r\nschool to apply for readmission before they finally  come\r\n\r\nto see us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> In many ways, it touches\r\n\r\non   the  same  point.

So  there\r\n\r\nis  no  adverse implication in an expelled student having\r\n\r\nto  go to another school.  There is no implication of the\r\n\r\nfirst school having not been convinced as to whether  the\r\n\r\nstudent  is  someone who should be taken  back  as  such.\r\n\r\nVery  often, you will find a principal of a school  which\r\n\r\nhas  expelled a student taking in a student who has  been\r\n\r\nexpelled from another school, if he is convinced that the\r\n\r\nstudent has turned over a new leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIMARY 1 REGISTRATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation (a) how many of the 178 children who could  not\r\n\r\nbe  traced for registration in Primary 1 have since  been\r\n\r\nfound;  (b)  how many of the 312 children who  are  still\r\n\r\nbeing  traced  are  now  in  school;  (c)  what  is   the\r\n\r\nproportion  of  boys  and girls  in  the  cohort  of  467\r\n\r\nchildren  who have enrolled into madrasahs; (d)  what  is\r\n\r\nhis   assessment  of  the  implementation  of   how   the\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education Act has been put into effect by  his\r\n\r\nMinistry;  and (e) what improvements, if needed,  can  be\r\n\r\nmade to get more children into schools under this Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in November 2002, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education reported  that  a  total  of  490\r\n\r\nchildren  either could not be contacted or  were  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of being traced.

To discourage unskilled work permit  holders\r\n\r\nfrom  marrying locals, with the view to sinking roots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  require all existing and  ex-work  permit\r\n\r\nholders to seek approval before marrying a Singaporean or\r\n\r\na  Permanent Resident.

We have to make an assessment of the\r\n\r\nwork  permit  holder or the ex-work permit holder.   Once\r\n\r\ngiven  the chance to sink roots in Singapore, would  they\r\n\r\nbe  able to look after themselves in the long term?   So,\r\n\r\nthe  level  of  skills  that they have,  the  educational\r\n\r\nachievement   that   they   have,   are   all   important\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  There is no hard-and-fast rule.  We look\r\n\r\nat  both  parties.  If the Singaporean has  a  very  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of  education, and also high  skill  level,  then,\r\n\r\nobviously, that can help to compensate if the non-citizen\r\n\r\nparty has lower skill level, and vice-versa.  Overall, it\r\n\r\nis  a question of the ability of both the Singaporean and\r\n\r\nthe  non-citizen to satisfy us that they are able to look\r\n\r\nafter  themselves.   They will not  become  part  of  our\r\n\r\nburden  of  being unemployed, especially if  the  economy\r\n\r\nwere to take a turn for the worse. And if they have lower\r\n\r\nskill, they are most likely to be made redundant even  if\r\n\r\nthey  may be employed now.  So we want to be assured that\r\n\r\nunder  any  circumstances, they should be  able  to  look\r\n\r\nafter themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who lack the skill and they want to apply\r\n\r\nfor  approval, then the advice to them would be to please\r\n\r\ngo  and  make an effort to upgrade their skill, both  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  party and also the non-citizen party.   They\r\n\r\nshould  both make efforts to upgrade their skill and,  if\r\n\r\nthey do so, they could be considered more favourably  the\r\n\r\nnext  time  they  make an application.

It has been  so  for\r\n\r\nmany  years.   The reason is because we  want  it  to  be\r\n\r\nsimple  and  easy to administer.  So in such  cases  some\r\n\r\npatients  will  pay more than the cost of drugs,  if  the\r\n\r\ncost of drugs is lower than $1.40, whereas other patients\r\n\r\nwill pay less than the cost of drugs, if the cost of drug\r\n\r\nis  more  than $1.40 per week's supply.  So  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncross-subsidy in the polyclinic system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restructured hospitals, being corporatised,\r\n\r\nthey  charge  the drugs based on the cost of  the  drugs.\r\n\r\nSo,  as a result, you will find that some drugs cost more\r\n\r\nin the polyclinics than in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this charging system has served us well in\r\n\r\nthe  polyclinics, my Ministry is reviewing  this  system,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the clusters, to explore ways  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe charging system and harmonise the drug charges across\r\n\r\nthe  different public sector institutions.   We  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  into account constraints, such as IT infrastructure\r\n\r\nand  also how to educate Singaporeans to adjust to  these\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  pricing system.  The  results  of  this\r\n\r\nreview will be made known in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question about ensuring that patients\r\n\r\nget  the best deal in drug prices, I would like to inform\r\n\r\nthe House that the two healthcare clusters have set up  a\r\n\r\ncentral agency, called the Group Purchasing Office (GPO),\r\n\r\nto   purchase   drugs  for  all  the  public   healthcare\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  including  the  polyclinics.   The   Group\r\n\r\nPurchasing  Office  has started with bulk  purchasing  of\r\n\r\nhigh  volume standard drugs and would, over time,  extend\r\n\r\nit  to  all  the  other drugs.  Currently, both  clusters\r\n\r\npurchase  around  90% of their standard drugs,  which  is\r\n\r\naround  400  items, through the Group Purchasing  Office.\r\n\r\nCentral  purchasing by the Group Purchasing Office  helps\r\n\r\nto  standardise  the  price of  drugs  and  also  achieve\r\n\r\nsavings, which can then be passed on to patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am worried about this\r\n\r\nreview  on the drug charging system.

Will the cap remain at $1.40 or is it going to be\r\n\r\nbottomless?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think the Member meant the\r\n\r\n\"ceiling\"  and  going over the roof and not \"bottomless\".\r\n\r\nThat  is the reason why we have been taking some time  in\r\n\r\nconsidering this review.  As I explained earlier, in  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics,  we  have a very simple system,  a  standard\r\n\r\n$1.40.   So  for  those drugs which are cheaper  to  buy,\r\n\r\ncheaper  in cost, then you pay slightly more.  For  those\r\n\r\ndrugs,   especially  for  patients   who   have   chronic\r\n\r\nconditions,  they come to the polyclinic very  regularly,\r\n\r\nthis  ceiling of $1.40 helps them.  This system has  been\r\n\r\nin place for a long time.  It has served us well.  We are\r\n\r\nquite reluctant to change it.  But then it gives rise  to\r\n\r\nthis  anomaly that for those drugs which are  very  lowly\r\n\r\npriced, you are charged $1.40, whereas if you go  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital,  it could be 60 or 70 cents.  Then, people  may\r\n\r\nraise  problems.  If we go by charging actual cost, then,\r\n\r\nof  course,  the  cost  will  be  harmonised  across  all\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   But  as Mr Low Thia  Khiang  says,  those\r\n\r\nchronic  patients, who have been paying the low  standard\r\n\r\nprice of $1.40, may now have to pay higher prices because\r\n\r\nthe cost is actually much higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered this last year and we wanted to make a\r\n\r\nchange.   In  the end, we decided not to change  for  two\r\n\r\nreasons:  first, to make the change requires us to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  on  IT,  which will then cause the charges  to  be\r\n\r\nhigher  also.  And, secondly, some people will pay  less,\r\n\r\nbut some will have to pay more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the light of last year's economic conditions,\r\n\r\nwe  decided  to keep the change in view.  But  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nquestions  were raised by Members and also in the  press.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  keep this standard charge forever.   At  some\r\n\r\npoint, we have to move to proper charging by cost.

Since September 11 2001,  security\r\n\r\nchecks  at  all our Checkpoints have been stepped  up  to\r\n\r\nprevent   the  entry  of  undesirable  persons,  weapons,\r\n\r\nexplosives, etc.  Whilst SIR, Customs and other  agencies\r\n\r\nmanning  the  Checkpoints  try  to  clear  travellers  as\r\n\r\nquickly  as  possible,  security cannot  be  compromised.\r\n\r\nHence,  travellers may, at times, have  to  put  up  with\r\n\r\nslightly longer clearance times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has suggested that we should allow\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists holding Singapore passports to  be  cleared\r\n\r\nat  car counter during peak periods.  Sir, we have  found\r\n\r\nthat  this  idea is not very practical.  I  will  explain\r\n\r\nwhy.   Currently,  the  land Checkpoints  adopt  a  sound\r\n\r\npractice  of segregating the different forms  of  various\r\n\r\ntypes of traffic: motorcycles, cars, lorries, buses, etc,\r\n\r\nas  they enter or leave the Checkpoints.  This allows for\r\n\r\neasier  traffic  management.  However,  if  motorcyclists\r\n\r\nwere  allowed to weave in and out of traffic, they  could\r\n\r\nobstruct  cars, lorries and other vehicles from  entering\r\n\r\nthe Checkpoints and even slow traffic down\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfurther,  as had happened in the past.  They  would  also\r\n\r\npose safety problems and even endanger their own lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has suggested adding more staff and opening\r\n\r\nup more immigration counters during the peak period.  SIR\r\n\r\nmonitors  traffic  conditions at the Tuas  and  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoints  very closely and has undertaken measures  to\r\n\r\nalleviate the traffic congestion.  During the morning and\r\n\r\nevening   peak   periods  when  motorcycle   traffic   is\r\n\r\nparticularly heavy, as many motorcycle clearance counters\r\n\r\nare  open  at  the  two  Checkpoints  as  possible.   All\r\n\r\navailable  manpower  is deployed to clear  all  modes  of\r\n\r\ntransport during the peak hours, with more being deployed\r\n\r\nto  the  critical areas.  For example, if there are  more\r\n\r\nmotorcycles,  more  officers will be  deployed  to  clear\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.  SIR has also staggered their shifts and has\r\n\r\na system to call upon off-duty officers to help with very\r\n\r\nheavy volumes of travellers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic congestion, however, is inevitable whenever\r\n\r\na  large number of motorcyclists and other travellers try\r\n\r\nto  pass  through the Checkpoints at the same  time.   We\r\n\r\nurge  all travellers, wherever possible, to adjust  their\r\n\r\ntravelling  times  to avoid the peak periods.   They  can\r\n\r\ncall  the  traffic information hotlines or listen  in  to\r\n\r\nTrafficWatch on our radio stations to find out the latest\r\n\r\ntraffic conditions at the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints.\r\n\r\nIn  some cases, they should consider to car pool or  even\r\n\r\nuse public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the House that all the\r\n\r\nagencies  operating at the Checkpoints are  committed  to\r\n\r\nminimising  traffic  congestion without  compromising  on\r\n\r\nsecurity and safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, does the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary   know   that   most   of   the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists are actually Malaysian workers  going  back\r\n\r\nafter  work and there is no possibility of them  actually\r\n\r\nstaggering  their working hours, unless  their  companies\r\n\r\nagree?   In  a  sense, it takes about one hour  for  them\r\n\r\nevery day to clear the Customs, and something has to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  done.   So, would the Ministry actually increase  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  at peak hours?  After monitoring the situation\r\n\r\nfor  such a long time, they should actually know when are\r\n\r\nthe peak hours and should have more officers manning more\r\n\r\ncounters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, the question asked\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Chia was whether motorcyclists holding  Singapore\r\n\r\npassports  could  be allowed to use the less  jammed  car\r\n\r\nlanes.   In this respect, the suggestion is for  them  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  adjust their time - they should not go into  the\r\n\r\nCheckpoints  when  all the Malaysian  workers  are  going\r\n\r\nback,  because they are going to be trapped in a  traffic\r\n\r\njam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, at the moment, overall, our\r\n\r\nfigures  show  that 85% of motorcyclists are  Malaysians,\r\n\r\nand   they   are  holding  long-term  passes.    At   the\r\n\r\nimmigration counters, they are cleared within 20 seconds,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have their data, and they are cleared faster.\r\n\r\nThe  traffic jam, for most, according to our  survey,  is\r\n\r\nbetween  30-45  minutes, before they reach the  20-second\r\n\r\nclearance time.  This is already much better than in  the\r\n\r\npast.   Because at the previous Checkpoint at  Woodlands,\r\n\r\nfor  example, where most of these workers passed  through\r\n\r\nbefore  the  new Checkpoint was ready, they had  to  wait\r\n\r\nlonger  than one hour before they were cleared.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  because we segregate them, we have been able  to\r\n\r\nclear them, and they get caught in a jam of between 30-45\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers are made available, whenever necessary. In\r\n\r\nfact, at peak hours, we have, if I am not mistaken,  more\r\n\r\nthan 25 counters open to clear the motorcyclists.  During\r\n\r\nnormal  hours, there are about eight counters only.   So,\r\n\r\nwe   have,  in  fact,  trebled  the  number  of  counters\r\n\r\navailable  to clear them, and we will try to do  more  as\r\n\r\nand when it is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I am happy to hear\r\n\r\nthat the waiting time has been cut down from one hour  to\r\n\r\n40 minutes, and I look forward to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepartment cutting down the time to less than 15  minutes\r\n\r\nper waiting time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first part of my question about Singapore\r\n\r\npassport  holders,  I  have the  personal  experience  of\r\n\r\nreaching  the Customs and seeing the car lanes  were  all\r\n\r\nempty.   We  actually wanted to use the car lane  but  we\r\n\r\nwere told, \"No, you cannot.\"  One has to squeeze with the\r\n\r\nother motorcyclists, even though the car lanes are empty.\r\n\r\nOn  such  an  occasion, would the Customs actually  allow\r\n\r\nSingaporean  motorcyclists to use  the  car  lane  to  be\r\n\r\ncleared, so as to divert the traffic away?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, at the moment, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  answer  is  no,  unless  we  can  make  prior\r\n\r\narrangements.   If  once  we allow  for  a  change,  what\r\n\r\nhappens  if 10 seconds later, cars are coming in?   These\r\n\r\nare  the  situations which will become more difficult  to\r\n\r\nmanage.    Anyway   when   we  talk   about   Singaporean\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists,  there is no guarantee  that  the  pillion\r\n\r\nrider  is  also  a Singaporean.  And if  you  go  into  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen counter, your pillion rider cannot  be\r\n\r\ncleared.  So all other practical problems may arise if we\r\n\r\nchange  the system without taking into account all  these\r\n\r\nfactors.   However,  the  point has  been  noted  by  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department.   They  will  see  whether  such\r\n\r\nchanges  are  necessary in the future.   At  the  moment,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have been able to clear the  traffic  faster\r\n\r\nwithout undermining our security and safety, we find  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  system quite useful and it should  be  continued\r\n\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Customs Officer at\r\n\r\nthe  Woodlands Checkpoint aware that at peak  hours,  the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  are actually occupying the  car  lane  way\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Checkpoint and as a result  of  which,  they\r\n\r\nactually cause a traffic jam all the way from the flyover\r\n\r\nto  Woodlands?

So  at  that\r\n\r\npoint, if there is a traffic jam, there is a traffic jam.\r\n\r\nWhat  we have done actually is to divide them into  their\r\n\r\nseparate  zones and, hopefully, to speed up the  process.\r\n\r\nThat  can take about - I do not know how many motorcycles\r\n\r\nor cars - but beyond that, a jam is a jam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.

What  happens  is this.  The peak  period  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning, for example, is between 6 am and 9 am, when  the\r\n\r\nvehicles come in.  It is not possible for the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment,  for example, to open up all the counters  to\r\n\r\ncater  for this big number of vehicles and to clear  them\r\n\r\nas fast as possible.  Because after that period, officers\r\n\r\nwill be there and they will be idling around.  They would\r\n\r\nhave  nothing  to do because all the vehicles  have  been\r\n\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the figures here for Mr Chia's information.\r\n\r\nIn  the  morning  peak hours, we open  up  more  counters\r\n\r\nbecause we understand that they need to reach their  work\r\n\r\nplace as fast as possible.  At the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrival  point, in the morning, we open up 25  car  lanes\r\n\r\nand  44  motorcycle lanes to cater for the vehicles  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.

There were 12,203 claims by non-unionised workers in the year 2001.  In 2002, 11,918,  or\r\n\r\n94%,  of  the  claims were successfully resolved  through\r\n\r\nconciliation  at  the Ministry.  The  majority  of  these\r\n\r\nclaims were over unpaid wages.  The balance of 787 claims\r\n\r\nwhich  could  not  be settled through  conciliation  were\r\n\r\nadjudicated by the Commissioner for Labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 787 workers, 664 of them were awarded\r\n\r\npayments by the Commissioner for Labour, while the claims\r\n\r\nof  the  remaining 123 workers, or about 1%, were  struck\r\n\r\noff  or  dismissed as the workers failed to turn  up  for\r\n\r\ninquiry  by the Commissioner for Labour or were found  to\r\n\r\nhave no valid claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the 664 workers who were awarded payments,\r\n\r\n167 workers were  fully paid by their employers while  17\r\n\r\nwere  given partial payment after orders had been issued.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining 480 workers did not receive payments  from\r\n\r\ntheir  employers within the stipulated period of 14 days.\r\n\r\nOf these 480 workers, 280 were from three large companies\r\n\r\nand  the  remaining 232 were from many  small  companies.\r\n\r\nMajority   of  these  companies  face  severe   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulty or are insolvent already.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 301 of the 480 workers who were awarded payment\r\n\r\nby  the  Commissioner sought my Ministry's assistance  to\r\n\r\nenforce  the orders in the Subordinate Courts  while  the\r\n\r\nrest of 179 workers did not pursue their claims further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in cases where the workers decided to enforce\r\n\r\nthe  orders in the Subordinate Courts, the Ministry  will\r\n\r\nhelp  them prepare the necessary documents.  But  whether\r\n\r\nthe  workers  get  any  payment depends  on  whether  the\r\n\r\ncompanies have any assets left for sale.  The Member  may\r\n\r\nwish  to know that many of these employers are likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  in severe financial difficulty and have no asset left\r\n\r\nfor  payment to the workers.  Our officers would  usually\r\n\r\nadvise  on the chance of recovering the claims but  leave\r\n\r\nthe  decision  to  proceed in the  Civil  Courts  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.

Troubled teens who may  need\r\n\r\nshelter  can  approach  any social  work  agency,  Family\r\n\r\nService   Centre,  children's  home,  or   their   school\r\n\r\ncounsellor.  The agencies function as a form  of  drop-in\r\n\r\nfor  troubled  teens  who require  a  listening  ear,  or\r\n\r\nadvice, as they are open to all who need help.  These are\r\n\r\nlocated all over the island and are easily accessible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelters for teens and children are currently\r\n\r\nprovided by homes for children\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  young persons.  Depending on the circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nsocial  worker  or  counsellor will  determine  the  most\r\n\r\nsuitable  facility for short term stay.  A few  shelters,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Teen Challenge Youth Centre, the Andrew  and\r\n\r\nGrace  Home, The Tent and the Pertapis Centre  for  Women\r\n\r\nand Girls, focus on young persons who need time away from\r\n\r\ntheir  family  while they get help with the  issues  that\r\n\r\ntrouble them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the issues that trouble teens, the\r\n\r\nsocial   workers  will  always  engage  the   family   in\r\n\r\ncounselling therapy and as part of the effort to  find  a\r\n\r\nlong term solution.  The teenage years can be a difficult\r\n\r\ntime  for young people and we will continue to work  with\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  social service agencies  and  families  to\r\n\r\nreach  out to young people who may need help.   We  would\r\n\r\nencourage  young people and parents to come  forward  for\r\n\r\nhelp  early and not wait till things are so bad that they\r\n\r\nneed  to run away from home to seek shelter.  Should they\r\n\r\nneed to do so, they can approach or drop in at any social\r\n\r\nwork  agency, or call the Family Service Centre  hotline,\r\n\r\nor the Tinkle Friend hotline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of the above homes and the various\r\n\r\ncommunity resources like social service agencies,  Family\r\n\r\nService Centre, school counsellors and helplines serve as\r\n\r\nstrategic  contact  points  for  teens  who  may  require\r\n\r\nassistance.

My\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  previously  responded  to  questions   in\r\n\r\nParliament and the media regarding our position  on  such\r\n\r\nrepositories,  also  known as `Baby  Drops'.   While  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  such repositories is to protect  the  baby\r\n\r\nfrom  danger and the anonymity of the parent who abandons\r\n\r\nthe  baby,  they remain controversial even  in  countries\r\n\r\nthat have introduced them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our existing legislation, it is illegal to\r\n\r\nabandon  a  baby.   This is to underline the  inalienable\r\n\r\nresponsibility of parents for the safety and  welfare  of\r\n\r\ntheir children.  The `Baby Drop' scheme could unwittingly\r\n\r\nencourage  child  abandonment, which will,  in  the  long\r\n\r\nterm,  put  far more children at risk.  The anonymity  of\r\n\r\nthe  mother  would  also deprive  her  of  the  emotional\r\n\r\nsupport that she needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to highlight, once again, that we do\r\n\r\nnot  intend  to legalise such schemes as we believe  that\r\n\r\nthere are far more constructive ways to help mothers with\r\n\r\nunwanted  pregnancies.  My Ministry  and  social  service\r\n\r\nagencies prefer to engage the mother, apprise her of  her\r\n\r\noptions  and assist through counselling her, her  partner\r\n\r\nand  her parents, to make an informed decision, including\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  giving her baby  up  for  adoption.\r\n\r\nCurrently, mothers with unwanted pregnancies can approach\r\n\r\nthe  Child Protection and Welfare Service in my Ministry,\r\n\r\nRose  Villa  or the Pertapis Centre for Women and  Girls.\r\n\r\nThere  are also shelters for those who wish to  keep  the\r\n\r\nbaby and a 24-hour hotline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to encourage those who find themselves\r\n\r\nwith  an  unwanted  pregnancy to come forward  early  for\r\n\r\nhelp.

It  is  important  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  regardless  of  their  race,  language  or\r\n\r\nreligion,  to  understand the extent  and  depth  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  threat facing our country.  This threat  deeply\r\n\r\nimpacts  on  our  racial harmony and,  more  importantly,\r\n\r\nundermines our very survival and existence as a peaceful,\r\n\r\nstable and thriving nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we attained our independence in 1965, very\r\n\r\nfew  people  outside Singapore believed  that  we  had  a\r\n\r\nchance  to survive.  Even though we attained independence\r\n\r\nby chance, we never left our survival to chance.  And not\r\n\r\nonly did we succeed, but we prospered.  For more than  30\r\n\r\nyears,  Singaporeans of different races, such as Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalays, Indians and Eurasians, rallied together in  unity\r\n\r\nand  toiled to build this great nation of ours.  We  have\r\n\r\nthrived  and prospered against a backdrop of  social  and\r\n\r\nracial  harmony.   Today,  Singapore's  achievements  are\r\n\r\nacknowledged  world-wide.  Millions  from  all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld come to our country yearly to visit, work or study.\r\n\r\nThey  do so with confidence that Singapore is a safe  and\r\n\r\npeaceful place.  At the same time, thousands of companies\r\n\r\nfrom all over the world have invested billions of dollars\r\n\r\nin our economy with trust and confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have translated into jobs for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  turn,  have  generated growth,  progress  and\r\n\r\nstability  for  our  people  and  country.   Workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  comprising the different races and  religion,\r\n\r\nare determined and committed in continuing our efforts in\r\n\r\nnation-building  as  one united people.   In  short,  our\r\n\r\nsocial  stability has been a fundamental  pillar  of  our\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Today, we learn that the pillar - and, in  every\r\n\r\nsense, Singapore - is threatened by terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the workers, I strongly support\r\n\r\nthe firm actions taken by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  against the threat of terrorism posed  by  JI\r\n\r\nand  other  militant extremist groups in the  region.   I\r\n\r\nalso endorse the recommendations in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the security agencies of the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and the Ministry of Defence have done a good  job\r\n\r\nin  keeping our homeland safe and secure for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nof  all  races  and religions.  But the security  of  our\r\n\r\nnation, be it internal or external, cannot be solely left\r\n\r\nto  the  security  agencies alone  or,  worse  still,  to\r\n\r\nchance.   As  an  open  and  multi-racial  society,   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  always be vigilant  against  external\r\n\r\nadverse influences.  We must forever be mindful that  any\r\n\r\nthreat to our security is a threat to workers' livelihood\r\n\r\nand well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is a very small nation without any\r\n\r\nnatural  resources, except for our people.  A  threat  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  is,  thus, a threat to our  people.   We  have\r\n\r\nnever  left our survival in the past to chance, and there\r\n\r\nis  no  reason to leave our future to chance.  We  should\r\n\r\nnever allow the acts of the few to destroy the efforts of\r\n\r\nthe  many  Singaporeans.   Neither  should  we  target  a\r\n\r\nparticular community for the acts of a few, be it in  the\r\n\r\nemployment  scene or at the inter-community level.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,   we   must  never  be  complacent   or   be\r\n\r\nindifferent  when  it  comes  to  the  security  of   our\r\n\r\nhomeland.  In doing so, it would arguably just fall short\r\n\r\nof betrayal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Prime Minister expressed concern about\r\n\r\ninter-racial and inter-religious relations at a  dialogue\r\n\r\nsession  on the 28th January 2002.  I quote what he  said\r\n\r\nthen:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A minor incident could show up into a major\r\n\r\nconfrontation between the races and religions.   We  must\r\n\r\nprevent this.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is precisely right. We must be\r\n\r\nvigilant  and must never allow a few to ignite the  spark\r\n\r\nthat will set off the fire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to share a personal experience. In\r\n\r\n1984,  I  attended  a leadership programme  in  an  Asian\r\n\r\ncountry.  From the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nday  I arrived in that country and for the next two weeks\r\n\r\nwhile  I  was there, I saw people of different  religions\r\n\r\ngoing  about  their daily lives in the country.   It  was\r\n\r\ncalm  and peaceful.  On the 15th day, there was a serious\r\n\r\nincident caused by a few people.  Immediately, the  peace\r\n\r\nand  unity  broke down.  It totally stunned  me.   I  saw\r\n\r\nracial   fights   between   two  different   communities,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  deaths, loss of homes and properties.   I,\r\n\r\ntoo,  almost fell victim to the situation.  There was  an\r\n\r\nattack  on  the hotel where I stayed, and I  was  hit  by\r\n\r\nbroken  glass.  My head was covered with glass splinters.\r\n\r\nBut,  fortunately, big pieces of glass and  stone  missed\r\n\r\nme.   I  was lucky.  But the many innocent people in  the\r\n\r\nstreets  and in their homes were not so fortunate.   Till\r\n\r\nthis day, whenever I recall that incident, I remember the\r\n\r\nimages of chaos and I still feel very sad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must never allow such incidents to ever\r\n\r\nhappen  in  our country.  The best ways to  achieve  this\r\n\r\nobjective are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Further strengthen inter-racial and inter-religious relations at all levels, starting from the\r\n\r\nschools, community and places of work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) All Singaporeans must exercise strong vigilance\r\n\r\nagainst extremist religious teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) We must be alert to suspicious or clandestine\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  inform the authorities,  if  they  come\r\n\r\nacross any.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call upon Singaporeans of all races and\r\n\r\nreligions  to  rally behind our Government  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nhomeland safe and secure.  The greatest gift we can  give\r\n\r\nto  our children and future generation of Singaporeans is\r\n\r\nto  have  a  homeland which is safe and secure  from  all\r\n\r\nthreats of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupport  the motion in the name of the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin my speech, I would like to make two\r\n\r\npoints of clarification.  Yesterday, the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nmy  GRC,  Mr Sin Boon Ann, talked about the need for  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community here to practise moderation.   I  sense\r\n\r\nhis  pessimism.   I would like to give an assurance  that\r\n\r\nthe majority of the Muslims in this country are moderate.\r\n\r\nThe word \"moderate\" is quite relative in meaning.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  same as the word `fundamentalist'.   What  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted  by  the Muslims as moderate  may  not  be\r\n\r\nmoderate for some others.  As an example, we take a  look\r\n\r\nat  Turkey.  Many in their Muslim community feel that the\r\n\r\nTurkish  people are not only moderate, but too  moderate.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Mustafa Kemal Attaturk era, Turkey had  taken\r\n\r\nactions  to erode its religious and Arabic image  and  to\r\n\r\npromote secularism. However, until today, it has not been\r\n\r\nable  to  bring  down the psychological barriers  Western\r\n\r\nleaders have on them and has not been accepted as a  part\r\n\r\nof  Europe.  Therefore, the meaning of \"moderate\" in this\r\n\r\ncontext  does  not  mean to practise  it  moderately  but\r\n\r\npractising  it  in a way that  would be seen as  moderate\r\n\r\nby  others.  This is the message which I understand to be\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Sin intended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about this view. To me, there must\r\n\r\nbe  acceptance  by  all quarters with  respect  to  being\r\n\r\nmoderate.   The  religious followers here could  practise\r\n\r\ntheir religion but they should also take into account the\r\n\r\ncommon  good of the country as a whole.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nit would not narrow the common space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Sin said that many Muslims are now\r\n\r\nconverging in mosques and there are fewer of them in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.   I would like to  stress  that  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon  of growing religiosity is not only  happening\r\n\r\nto  Muslims.  The Christians, Hindus, Buddhists  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  Taoist  followers  are also  going  in  increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  to  churches and temples.  This is  a  universal\r\n\r\nphenomenon.  I believe, with the firm\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naction taken by the People's Association, there are  more\r\n\r\nMuslims who are active in grassroots bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now address this White\r\n\r\nPaper.   The  world  is  no longer  the  same  after  the\r\n\r\nhorrendous  incident of September 11, 2001.  Many  regard\r\n\r\nthis  as a cliche.  But when the Twin Towers in New  York\r\n\r\ncollapsed, bringing down thousands of innocent lives, and\r\n\r\nthe  Pentagon was attacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists on  the\r\n\r\nsame  day, the words not only make our hair stand on ends\r\n\r\nbut  also  make us nervous.  In fact, it has changed  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  world forever.  It is an  incident  which\r\n\r\njolted us.  It means that there is no place on earth that\r\n\r\nis safe from terrorist acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the case following the detention of\r\n\r\nmembers  of the JI militant group and the statement  that\r\n\r\nthe  mastermind  behind this activity  is  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also voices refuting the existence  of  these\r\n\r\nthreats  and the presence of terrorists in their country.\r\n\r\nA senior Indonesia leader in fact said proudly that there\r\n\r\nwere  no  terrorists in Indonesia.  If anyone  wanted  to\r\n\r\narrest terrorists, they should arrest him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the bomb blasts killed many in Bali on 12th\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year,  then we heard  the  admission  that\r\n\r\nterrorists existed in the country.  I think it was rather\r\n\r\nlate.   But for Singapore, the blasts were another  shock\r\n\r\nthat  the terrorist threats had already arrived in  front\r\n\r\nof our doorstep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our security agencies were not efficient and\r\n\r\nproactive  in  arresting the members of the  JI,  and  if\r\n\r\nthere had not been the concerned Muslim who informed  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  of  the  person who was suspected  of  doing\r\n\r\nsomething  suspicious,  then  it  is  very  likely   that\r\n\r\nSingapore would have suffered the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we all know this frightening fact - that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  chosen  as a terrorist  target,  but  the\r\n\r\nplanned attack was postponed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can sigh a relief because we had been able to\r\n\r\navert the disaster.  But this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelief  is  temporary.  The threat still  exists  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot be caught off-guard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why do I recollect briefly the\r\n\r\nseries  of  these terrorist incidents in  discussing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  White  Paper on the JI?   There  are  three\r\n\r\nreasons.   Firstly, the terrorist threat is global.   Its\r\n\r\nroots  are  found  outside Singapore, in  Afghanistan  or\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  But the branch roots and hair roots  can  and\r\n\r\nhave  spread into Singapore.  Second, in Southeast  Asia,\r\n\r\nthere   are  already  local  movements,  politically   or\r\n\r\nmilitarily, in several countries, for example,  the  MILF\r\n\r\nin  Mindanao,  PULO in Southern Thailand,  GAM  in  Aceh.\r\n\r\nThey are potentials that can be exploited by the Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\nto form its operations networks.  The White Paper reveals\r\n\r\nhow   the   MILF  camp  had  been  used  to  train   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   on  terrorist  operations.    Third,   the\r\n\r\nterrorist group acts in the name of Islam.  This can have\r\n\r\nwide  implications which are not easy to  fathom  on  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reactions of the Muslim community to\r\n\r\nthe  arrests  of the JI members are clear, unanimous  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.  You may have read and heard  through  the\r\n\r\nlocal  media the reactions and views of Muslim  political\r\n\r\nand  organisation leaders and Islamic religious teachers.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to stress in this House that the  Muslims\r\n\r\nunanimously and unequivocally reject the actions  of  the\r\n\r\nJI  members.   We  reject in total that the  JI  members'\r\n\r\nactions  had  anything  to do with  Islam  because  Islam\r\n\r\nforbids such acts.  We are shocked and cannot accept  the\r\n\r\nstatement of one of the JI members now in detention  that\r\n\r\nwhen  he  told  a panel interviewing him that  those  who\r\n\r\ndisagreed with the JI's actions were \"infidels\".  Who  is\r\n\r\nhe  to  pass such a judgement?  Rational thinking  people\r\n\r\nwill know about the thinking of that JI member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the same time, we do not want the\r\n\r\nentire community to be affected because of the actions of\r\n\r\na few.  We know that when Singapore faced the Communists'\r\n\r\nattacks in the fifties and sixties,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  Chinese middle and high school students were  viewed\r\n\r\nas  potential  Communists.  When Indonesia  launched  its\r\n\r\nConfrontation,  a  significant  number   of   Malays   of\r\n\r\nIndonesian  origin  had their houses  raided,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  who  received frequent visits from their relatives\r\n\r\nin   Indonesia.   My  family  in  Lorong   Sinaran   also\r\n\r\nexperienced this when our house was raided at 3.00 am.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, after the attack of the Chechen\r\n\r\nseparatists  at  the theatre in Moscow, the  attitude  of\r\n\r\nRussians towards Muslims in their country changed.   This\r\n\r\nhas  been stressed upon by the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe   Muslims  became  a  suspected  people.   In   fact,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  Bali  bomb blasts, Hindus  who  form  the\r\n\r\nmajority  there  looked  on the Muslims  with  suspicion.\r\n\r\nHence,  Muslim Singaporeans greatly welcome the statement\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's action against  the  JI  and  its\r\n\r\npublication of the White Paper on the JI are not directed\r\n\r\nat  the Muslims.  It is a security issue.  Full stop.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  are also assured when leaders of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce and Industry and the Federation  of\r\n\r\nChinese  Clan  Associations  expressed  the  same   view.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I agree with the concern on its impact  on  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  workers, as mentioned by  Mr  Othman  Haron\r\n\r\nEusofe and other members who had spoken earlier. We  hope\r\n\r\nthe  same  assurances could be extended to the workplace,\r\n\r\nfactories, offices or everywhere else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we can make an analogy of the JI as\r\n\r\n\"mud-covered buffaloes which smear others that come  into\r\n\r\ncontact with them\", then we have already separated  these\r\n\r\n\"wild  buffaloes\" to their own pen.  But the question  is\r\n\r\nnot as simple as we may think.  As our Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid, it is a complex matter.  In the final analysis, the\r\n\r\naction of individual Muslims and the Muslim community  at\r\n\r\nlarge  will be taken into account.  In fact, some  regard\r\n\r\nthis as the deciding factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, what should we do? In my view, this\r\n\r\nis the question that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  give adequate attention.  The White Paper  serves\r\n\r\nas the starting point for us to take the next step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, the White Paper is very important\r\n\r\nbecause of several reasons.  First, it makes us aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  the fault lines in our multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious society can grow bigger as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  irresponsible  action of a few people.   Second,  it\r\n\r\nshows that Singapore is vulnerable to destructive foreign\r\n\r\ninfluences  if  we are not careful and vigilant.   Third,\r\n\r\nthe  way we conduct our religious education needs  to  be\r\n\r\nreassessed and it is important for us to create a  safety\r\n\r\nnet  to  prevent  negative  influences  from  undermining\r\n\r\nstability in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some may think that we have the\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony  Act and the Presidential  Council  on\r\n\r\nMinority  Rights.  Are these not enough, they asked?   In\r\n\r\nmy  view, the Act and the Presidential Council deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  religious issues from different angles or platforms.\r\n\r\nWe  need to address it from the social perspective.   For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  we support the setting up  of  the  Inter-Racial  Confidence  Circles  as  proposed  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the social aspect, the White Paper provides an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  us to reassess our attitude  on  racial\r\n\r\nties in Singapore.  It will open a bigger space for us to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the religious issues which were deemed sensitive\r\n\r\npreviously  to talk about and which many felt  better  to\r\n\r\navoid  or  sweep  them under the carpet than  facing  the\r\n\r\nissues  openly  and  with candour.   A  new  attitude  is\r\n\r\nimportant  if  we want to break the cocoon of  prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe  open  and  mature discussion can expand  and  deepen\r\n\r\nmutual  understanding and trust among  us.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant factor if we want to build a strong and  united\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to other multi-racial countries, we have\r\n\r\nmoved far ahead in social engineering.  We are not shy to\r\n\r\nadmit that our policy is aimed at closing the racial gap.\r\n\r\nWe   practise   racial   quota  in   every   HDB   block,\r\n\r\nneighbourhood and housing estate.  Our children go to the\r\n\r\nsame schools and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattend  the  same classes as the children  of  the  other\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Our sons do National Service with the other\r\n\r\nyoung  men  from the other communities.  We  have  multi-racial  grassroots bodies.  We eat at food centres  which\r\n\r\ncater to the various communities and sit down at the same\r\n\r\ntable  even  though the food is not the  same.   We  even\r\n\r\ncelebrate Racial Harmony Day every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these steps have yet to produce the\r\n\r\ndesired level of cohesion and mutual trust.  Perhaps,  it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  longer time to achieve it.  Maybe  the  various\r\n\r\nefforts  made  are  not strong enough to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  minds and the adoption of common  attitudes.\r\n\r\nThe White Paper actually challenges us to make a paradigm\r\n\r\nshift in our attitudes and minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also calls on us to be more on guard against\r\n\r\nglobalisation and IT revolution as they have been used by\r\n\r\ngroups  such as Al-Qaeda to achieve their own objectives.\r\n\r\nThere are many websites which advocate various issues and\r\n\r\nviews  and  people  who visit these websites  who  cannot\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  between  the  good  and  the  bad  can  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced by them, especially those that discuss  issues\r\n\r\nemotionally  and in a confrontational manner.   They  can\r\n\r\ndivide the people.  It is a fact that writers always  see\r\n\r\nan  issue from their own experience and perspectives  but\r\n\r\nargue  it as a global issue and this can mislead  readers\r\n\r\nwhose  contexts  of  life are different.   This  is  very\r\n\r\ndangerous.   For  Singaporeans,  including  the  Muslims,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  a limited social history, they  need  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned about such a possibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of a local newspaper report on a youth\r\n\r\nwho  complained about his failure in a job interview  but\r\n\r\nwas  seen wearing a T-shirt carrying the picture of Osama\r\n\r\nbin   Laden.   I  do  not  know  the  background  of  the\r\n\r\npublication  of  the report but it has made  many  people\r\n\r\nform  their own opinions and conclusions.  The youth  has\r\n\r\nonly  himself to blame for not getting sympathy from  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I agree with the recommendation that the\r\n\r\nquestion of regulating local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMuslim  religious  teachers or missionaries  as  well  as\r\n\r\nthose  from  overseas  be left to the  Muslim  community.\r\n\r\nFirst,  it  reflects the Government's confidence  in  the\r\n\r\ncapability of the community to tackle the issue.  Second,\r\n\r\nit is in line with the policy of religious freedom in the\r\n\r\nRepublic as long as it takes into account the common good\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore multi-racial society.  Third, it  gives\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  the community to carry  out  its  common\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  deciding what  is  suitable  for  it.\r\n\r\nFourth,  it challenges our Muslim scholars, intellectuals\r\n\r\nand  Muslim organisation leaders to achieve consensus and\r\n\r\nunity  among  themselves.   Such  a  unity  is  vital  in\r\n\r\npreparing the Singapore society and the Muslims  here  to\r\n\r\nface various challenges from inside and outside.  What we\r\n\r\nwill  and  will  not  do  will  be  observed  closely  by\r\n\r\ninvestors and prospective investors.  They want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether we are able to control and manage problems  well.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is proved that there are signs of cracks  in  our\r\n\r\nunity, they will not hesitate to leave and relocate their\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  other countries.  So is  the  case  with\r\n\r\nlocal investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, social unity is an important pillar that\r\n\r\ncan  guarantee  Singapore's survival and well-being.   We\r\n\r\nneed to defend and strengthen it at whatever price.  With\r\n\r\nthis  conviction,  I  support the motion  tabled  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, like my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  colleagues, I support the motion  standing\r\n\r\nin the name of the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter terrorism, we have to be united as one\r\n\r\npeople,  not  only by enhancing our security  means,  but\r\n\r\nalso  by strengthening our social cohesion.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nsend  a  clear signal to our investors and also to ensure\r\n\r\nour survival as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial society. Our main\r\n\r\ncommunities  came  from the two ancient civilisations  in\r\n\r\nAsia.  Because of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour   bilingual   policy  and  our  policy   of   seeking\r\n\r\nsimilarities  among  differences, we  have  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining our traditional values.  For this reason, the\r\n\r\nhistory of the fatherland of our ancestors and the events\r\n\r\nhappening therein would have considerable impact  on  us.\r\n\r\nThis  applies not only to the Chinese community, but also\r\n\r\nthe Malay community, and the Indian community as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the Chinese community and the Muslim community,\r\n\r\nfor  example.   1,000 years ago, the  two  most  powerful\r\n\r\ncivilisations in the world were the Chinese  civilisation\r\n\r\nand   the   Muslim   civilisation.   History   of   these\r\n\r\ncivilisations continues to be taught in our schools, from\r\n\r\nwhere  we  derived  our  traditional  values.   Beautiful\r\n\r\npoetries  we  learn  and appreciate came  from  the  Tang\r\n\r\nDynasty  in  China.  Algebra, trigonometry, and  geometry\r\n\r\nthat  we  learn in school are  products from the  ancient\r\n\r\nMuslim world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the 19th century, the Chinese\r\n\r\ncivilisation and the Muslim civilisation began to go down\r\n\r\nthe  hill.  The fortunes of the Chinese society  and  the\r\n\r\nMuslim society began to turn from bad to worse.  That was\r\n\r\nbecause  they were too complacent with their  development\r\n\r\nand failed to keep pace with technological and industrial\r\n\r\nrevolutions  in  the  west.   They  did  not  strive  for\r\n\r\ngeographical  and scientific discoveries.  As  a  result,\r\n\r\nboth China and the Muslim world were faced with a lot  of\r\n\r\nproblems, both internally and externally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, since the Opium War in 1840, whenever they\r\n\r\nwere at war with foreign countries, it ended as the clear\r\n\r\nloser.   So,  when  the People's Republic  of  China  was\r\n\r\nestablished in 1949, Mao Zedong declared that the Chinese\r\n\r\npeople  had \"stood up\"!  This had created a great  impact\r\n\r\non  the  Chinese  people, both within and outside  China.\r\n\r\nDuring the Korean War in the 1950s,  the Chinese army won\r\n\r\na  battle against a foreign army, for the first  time  in\r\n\r\nmore than a century.  This created a great impact on  the\r\n\r\noverseas Chinese. For this reason, many Chinese people in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSouth-east  Asia  appeared to  be  sympathetic  with  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Communist Party, which enjoyed the peak of  their\r\n\r\nactivities then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I must say is that not all Malayan Chinese and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese  at  that time supported  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party.   In  fact,  most  people  opposed  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the MCP.  But because of  our  historical\r\n\r\nbaggage  and our historical links, most students  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  schools were curious about what  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwere  doing  in  China.  For this  reason,  just  as  was\r\n\r\nmentioned   by  my  colleagues  just  now,  many   people\r\n\r\nsuspected  that  all the students in the Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nwere  Communists.   During that period  of  time,  I  was\r\n\r\nstudying   in  a  Chinese  school.   But  I   can   state\r\n\r\ncategorically that I have never been a Communist.  But in\r\n\r\nmy  young heart, I was very curious about the development\r\n\r\nof China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the 70s, as a student in London,\r\n\r\nI  went  to Chinatown, and the first thing I did  was  to\r\n\r\npurchase  a  copy of Mao Zedong's quotations and  to  see\r\n\r\nwhat  was in them.  Although I found the terminology  and\r\n\r\nphrases used were very impressive, I was not converted. I\r\n\r\nthink  if  there were some Communists around to  convince\r\n\r\nand  brainwash the  young university students, many would\r\n\r\nhave been converted to Communism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I telling this story? Because there was, in\r\n\r\nfact,  similar and   parallel development in  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nworld too.  Since the Ottoman Empire collapsed during the\r\n\r\nFirst  World  War,  people  in  the  Muslim  world   were\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  feel that everything was not  going  their\r\n\r\nway.  Everything seemed to be going against them.  As the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs mentioned yesterday, events  in\r\n\r\nthe  Middle East after 1948 had caused the people to feel\r\n\r\nthat the world was rather unfair to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the revolution in Iran in 1979. This is\r\n\r\nsomewhat  similar  to  the 1949 Communist  revolution  in\r\n\r\nChina.   The Iran Revolution had significant   impact  on\r\n\r\nthe Muslim community at that time, because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  people saw it as a great change.  This country which\r\n\r\nused  Muslim  teaching as the way to  govern  the  nation\r\n\r\nbecame  the role model for the Muslim world.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community in Malaysia  must  have  the  same\r\n\r\nfeeling as the Chinese community in Singapore in 1949.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of JI members must have been a tremendous\r\n\r\nshock  to  the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nwas  particularly  so after the second arrest.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  and  members of the Malay/Muslim  community\r\n\r\nhere  were  very clear in their mind that these  sabotage\r\n\r\nactivities of the JI must be condemned, and they did just\r\n\r\nthat!   They  made it very clear that  the  JI  does  not\r\n\r\nrepresent the Malay/Muslim community here.  My colleague,\r\n\r\nMayor  Othman Haron Eusofe, had openly said that  he  was\r\n\r\nvery  angry  over this incident.  We all know  our  Mayor\r\n\r\nOthman.   He  is  not a person who would get  very  angry\r\n\r\neasily.   But  this event made him very angry.   This,  I\r\n\r\nfeel, is an exemplary  representative of our Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, fortunately, a great difference between\r\n\r\nthe  JI  and our brothers and sisters in the Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Otherwise, our social cohesion and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony  would have been undermined - and this is exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  the  terrorists  wanted.   This  is,  in  fact,   a\r\n\r\npsychological  warfare.   They  want  to  make  us   feel\r\n\r\ninsecure,  to feel threatened.  Had we fallen into  their\r\n\r\ntrap,   they  would have succeeded and we  would  be  the\r\n\r\nlosers.  We do not want to be losers.  We want to be  the\r\n\r\nwinners.   We do not want them to win.  So,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nunited and stick to the spirit and principle of the White\r\n\r\nPaper, to be even more united as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at the situation in China and the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  China and  the  Chinese  community\r\n\r\nhere.   The feeling is quite different from that  in  the\r\n\r\n50s  and  60s.  No one will suspect that I am a Communist\r\n\r\nnow.   Why?   Because since 1976, China has  adopted  the\r\n\r\neconomic  reform  and  open-door  policy.   The   Chinese\r\n\r\nleaders realised that economic development,   modernising\r\n\r\nits defence capability\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand raising the standard of living of their people should\r\n\r\nbe their main targets.  At the same time, they also began\r\n\r\nto realise that pursuing the old route of Communism would\r\n\r\nlead  them nowhere near the attainment of these  targets.\r\n\r\nThe  reform  and  open-door policy has  resulted  in  the\r\n\r\nseverance of their relationship with the Communist groups\r\n\r\nin  Southeast  Asia.  As a result, in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese people in Southeast Asia, the Communist Party has\r\n\r\ndisappeared into thin air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese community in Singapore has also advanced\r\n\r\nwith  the time.  We have clearly stated that we  have  no\r\n\r\nlink  whatsoever  with the underground Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  We focused on how to raise the educational  level\r\n\r\nof  our  people so that when our economy took off in  the\r\n\r\n60s, 70s and 80s, we could rise to the occasion and enjoy\r\n\r\na  better  standard  of  living.  Through  our  bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy,  through our clan associations, we  maintain  our\r\n\r\ntraditional culture and values.  For example, the  dragon\r\n\r\ndance,  the  lion dance, the traditional  Hokkien  music,\r\n\r\nnanying  and the various traditional dialect operas,  are\r\n\r\nbeing promoted and developed among the Chinese community.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese community has also cooperated with the other\r\n\r\ncommunities to jointly build up our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot expect life to go on plain\r\n\r\nsailing  all  the time without some trouble.   There  are\r\n\r\nbound to be some sensitive issues among us.  For example,\r\n\r\njust  over  a  year  ago, there was this  blunder  in  an\r\n\r\nofficial  literature  of  a  certain  Government   agency\r\n\r\nwhereby   the   \"Festival  of  the  Hungry  Ghosts\"   was\r\n\r\nmistakenly  translated  as  the  \"Festival  of  Hungarian\r\n\r\nGhosts\",  causing an uproar among the Chinese  community.\r\n\r\nYears  ago, when there was this anti-Chinese campaign  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  the  Chinese  community  here  acted   rather\r\n\r\nvigorously,  showing not only sympathy but  also  support\r\n\r\nfor  the victims there. More recently, people were  again\r\n\r\nraising  the  Nantah  issue.  There are indeed    certain\r\n\r\nsensitive issues among our communities.  However, we  are\r\n\r\nable  to  look  at  the  big  picture.   When  there  are\r\n\r\nsensitive issues, we deal with them through the proper\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchannel,  rationally and professionally, such  as  having\r\n\r\ndialogue   sessions  where  the  issues   are   analysed,\r\n\r\ndiscussed  and  explained. We  do  not  use  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  way  of  threatening  the  people   and\r\n\r\nexerting  pressure on our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sincere hope and wish is that our brothers and\r\n\r\nsisters  in the Malay community would cooperate with  the\r\n\r\nother  communities here and build up better  relationship\r\n\r\namong  us.   We  accept  the fact that  there  are  still\r\n\r\nsensitive issues which have to be resolved, but let us do\r\n\r\nit  rationally  and  professionally  through  the  proper\r\n\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy has brought with it many challenges\r\n\r\nand  opportunities.  We  have to be  forward-looking  and\r\n\r\nseize  the opportunities that are open to us. To do that,\r\n\r\nwe   have   to   raise  our  educational  standard,   our\r\n\r\ntechnological level, and upgrade our skills.   We  should\r\n\r\nnot look for solutions from terrorist activities, because\r\n\r\nthere  is  no way out from there.  I think we  should  do\r\n\r\nwhat  the  mainland  Chinese are  doing.   We  must  have\r\n\r\neconomic reform and adopt the open-door policy.  We  must\r\n\r\nbe  forward-looking. We must cooperate with one  another.\r\n\r\nGo regional, go global,  to attain our target.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people are afraid that economic\r\n\r\nprosperity would affect the pursuit for religious growth.\r\n\r\nActually,   there   is  no  conflict   between   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity and religious fervour. In the new economy,  we\r\n\r\nare  faced with great challenges and intense competition.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that we may have losses and defeats from\r\n\r\ntime and time.  Very often, we will be extremely stressed\r\n\r\nup  and  pressurised. This is when we may  want  to  seek\r\n\r\nsolace  from  our  religious beliefs.   Being  pious  and\r\n\r\nfervently  pursue  good values through our  religion  is,\r\n\r\nafter all, not a bad thing!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that our Singapore Malay/Muslim community\r\n\r\nwould  likewise  work  hard to  raise  their  educational\r\n\r\nstandard and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic standing.   I must say the other communities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  ever  ready  and  eager  to  support  one\r\n\r\nanother.  I can remember that soon after the September 11\r\n\r\nevent,  we held a farewell party for our Muslim  brothers\r\n\r\nwho  were  going for their haj.  In Joo Chiat, there  are\r\n\r\nnot  many Malays.  On that occasion, we had only some  20\r\n\r\nto  30  Muslim brothers going for their pilgrimage.  Yet,\r\n\r\nsome  300 grassroots leaders and supporters turned up  to\r\n\r\nbid them farewell.  I asked them why they were turning up\r\n\r\nin  such a large number.  They said, \"Oh, we want to show\r\n\r\nour  support  for our Muslim friends.\"  So, deep  in  our\r\n\r\nhearts,  we  are  still brothers  and  sisters.   Let  us\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  good  brothers  and  sisters.   Let  us\r\n\r\nmaintain the good relationship among us. Then, we will be\r\n\r\nable  to  find  more  common space  among  us.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  cooperate, to stand  united  for  a  better\r\n\r\nfuture for our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   having  heard  the   speeches   of   my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues, I am glad that we are  able  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss   so  candidly  this  issue  of  how  to  counter\r\n\r\nterrorism. No doubt, the question of religion is always a\r\n\r\nvery  sensitive issue.  As the Minister for Home Affairs,\r\n\r\nMr  Wong Kan Seng, has said, we want to be frank and open\r\n\r\nin  our discussion of this issue, and I hope that we will\r\n\r\nall  try to be as objective as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of this White Paper has led me to ask\r\n\r\nthis  question:  \"What kind of Singapore do  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant?\"  The significance of the White Paper lies in  what\r\n\r\nkind  of  Singapore do we want.  There are two  kinds  of\r\n\r\nresponse from our people to this White Paper.  On the one\r\n\r\nhand,  there  are  people who feel that the firm  actions\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Government against  the  JI  members  are\r\n\r\nappropriate  and  that our security  agencies  should  be\r\n\r\napplauded  for  a job well done. On the  other  hand,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  Professor Chin yesterday, there  are  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are simply indifferent  to  the  whole\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the campaign to counter terrorism, the Government\r\n\r\nhas been positive and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthorough.   However,  the  fight  against  terrorism   is\r\n\r\ninternational  in  scope  and long-term  in  nature.   As\r\n\r\nreported by the Home Affairs Minister to this House,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken various measures  to  counter  the\r\n\r\nthreat  to our security posed by the JI group.  What  the\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this  House should do is to  promote  mutual\r\n\r\ntrust  and confidence among the various ethnic groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Apart from strengthening our security,  this\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper also seeks to enhance our awareness  of  the\r\n\r\nterrorism threat so as to prevent any terrorist act  from\r\n\r\ntaking  place in Singapore, thereby restoring the foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors'  confidence in Singapore.   This  is  also  to\r\n\r\nensure that such acts of terrorism will not undermine our\r\n\r\nracial harmony that has been built up over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been terrorism since time immemorial, but\r\n\r\nthe  September 11 incident and the Bali bombing have made\r\n\r\nus more keenly aware of the fact that the threat is right\r\n\r\nin front of our doorstep.  Therefore, we cannot afford to\r\n\r\nbe complacent.  We cannot compromise our resolve to fight\r\n\r\nterrorism.   You  may  think that if you  avoid  visiting\r\n\r\ncountries where terrorist acts are likely to take  place,\r\n\r\nnothing  will happen to you.  Some may ask what  could  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country  like Singapore do in the  gigantic  fight\r\n\r\nagainst terrorism.  However, one must not forget disaster\r\n\r\nmay  strike even if you are sitting right in your sitting\r\n\r\nroom  at  home.  Terrorism is insidious  and  ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nThough Singapore is small, we have to be prepared.   Like\r\n\r\na  hedgehog,  we  must  have  the  capability  to  defend\r\n\r\nourselves.   Otherwise, the bombing that  took  place  in\r\n\r\nBali could well take place in some corner in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to work together with other\r\n\r\ncountries in the fight against terrorism, as suggested by\r\n\r\nour  colleague,  Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung.   We  should  work\r\n\r\ntogether   with  our  neighbouring  countries  to   fight\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask one question. Now that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  made great effort in this  regard,  what\r\n\r\ncontributions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  individuals, grassroots organisations and  religious\r\n\r\nbodies  make?  Since the release of the White  Paper,  we\r\n\r\nare glad to see Malay MPs and Muslim organisations making\r\n\r\nimmediate and positive response on the White Paper.  They\r\n\r\ncondemn such terrorist acts and express their support for\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy on counter-terrorism.  They will  not\r\n\r\nallow  any  individual  or  organisation  to  engage   in\r\n\r\nterrorist activities under the name of Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We applaud them for this correct attitude. I am\r\n\r\npleased  to  note  that the Deputy  Mufti  would  form  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  comprising representatives  from  the  various\r\n\r\nmainstream  Muslim organisations.  This committee,  after\r\n\r\nconsulting  the  views  of  local  Muslim  scholars   and\r\n\r\nreligious teachers, would formulate a code of conduct for\r\n\r\nthe local Muslims to follow in their daily life to comply\r\n\r\nwith  their  religious laws.  They  would  also  ask  the\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers  to  explain to  the  public  certain\r\n\r\nIslamic  terminology, so that terms such as  jihad,  etc.\r\n\r\nare  not  misused  to  glorify  violent  activities.   We\r\n\r\nwelcome the setting up of such a committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the other religious bodies might want to\r\n\r\ndo  the  same - to formulate certain code of conduct  for\r\n\r\ntheir followers, and to educate their people so that they\r\n\r\ncan  have a better understanding of one another's culture\r\n\r\nand religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot avoid the reality that the threat posed by\r\n\r\nthe   JI  group  has  generated  a  negative  impact   on\r\n\r\nSingapore, even though its earlier plot has been  foiled.\r\n\r\nIt  may  well shake our confidence and the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  potential  foreign investors. This is especially  so\r\n\r\nsince  the  bombing incident in Bali.  This incident  has\r\n\r\nforced  our  Muslim  brothers to be constantly  defensive\r\n\r\nabout their religion. It has also  caused members of  the\r\n\r\nother  ethnic  groups  to  look  at  the  Muslims  in   a\r\n\r\nsuspicious   light.   Many  Muslims  in   Singapore   are\r\n\r\nattributing  their   retrenchment and inability  to  find\r\n\r\njobs to discrimination from employers against their race.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we consolidate the racial harmony that we\r\n\r\nhave achieved so far?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMany  foreign  leaders  and visitors  to  Singapore  have\r\n\r\npraised  us  for being an international model  of  racial\r\n\r\nharmony.  I asked the CEO of a MNC what he thought  about\r\n\r\nSingapore's  progress  in achieving  racial  harmony.  He\r\n\r\nreplied  that he was impressed by what we had  done,  and\r\n\r\nthat  very few countries in the world can claim  to  have\r\n\r\npeople from different racial and religious groups working\r\n\r\nat  the  same  place,  studying in the  same  school  and\r\n\r\nshopping at the same shopping mall and eating in the same\r\n\r\nhawker centre, while at the same time retaining their own\r\n\r\ncultures  and  faiths.  I am very glad to  hear  such  an\r\n\r\nendorsement from a MNC official.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see churches, temples and mosques located in the\r\n\r\nsame  housing estate.  How are we going to seek unity  in\r\n\r\ndiversity?   We cannot force other people to behave  like\r\n\r\nus.   We  have to respect the differences of other races.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not a theocratic state.  It is  a  secular\r\n\r\nstate.   Our racial and religious harmony is  not  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  for  granted.  Hence, we have to  nurture  it  and\r\n\r\nconsolidate it.  We cannot allow a few religious fanatics\r\n\r\nto undermine it in the name of religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect the religious freedom of the various\r\n\r\ngroups and we respect their religious values.  But things\r\n\r\nthat   touch  on  national  interest,  such  as  defence,\r\n\r\neducation and internal security, must be looked  at  from\r\n\r\nthe perspective of national interest.  On this, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  various  racial  groups  have  the  same  consensus.\r\n\r\nHence,  we shall all view the White Paper rationally  and\r\n\r\nwith a mature outlook.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more important is that we have to be\r\n\r\nexemplary  in  our behaviour, especially  as  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   We have to try and understand  the  customs\r\n\r\nand  religions of other racial groups.  We must also have\r\n\r\ngood communication skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do people strengthen their psychological defence\r\n\r\nand strengthen their confidence?  This is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fight against terrorism should be\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Government, we,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  people, should be vigilant at all times and  not  to\r\n\r\nharbour  suspicions  against  each  other.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen    the    people's   psychological    defence.\r\n\r\nGrassroots  organisations in the  various  constituencies\r\n\r\nhave  been conducting mutual visits for believers of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  faiths.  Many religious  bodies  such  as  the\r\n\r\nMuslim organisations, the Buddhist organisations and  the\r\n\r\nTaoist  organisations have also come  together  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds  and carry out social welfare work, for the  common\r\n\r\ngood  of  our  society.  We also  encourage  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration to value their own ethnic cultural heritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southwest CDC is now actively working on a\r\n\r\nfashion  show and a food fair to be participated  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious    racial   groups,   showcasing   the   cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the various ethnic groups.  Through  these\r\n\r\nactivities,  it  is  hoped that  there  would  be  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the customs and cultures of the  various\r\n\r\nethnic  groups. This is particularly useful and necessary\r\n\r\nfor  our younger generation of Singaporeans.  The various\r\n\r\nreligious   groups   should  take   the   initiative   to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have spoken about the moderate faction\r\n\r\namong the Muslims. In fact, the concept of moderation  is\r\n\r\nnot  confined  to  the  Islam  faith  but  to  all  other\r\n\r\nreligious groups too. Therefore, the nine major religious\r\n\r\ngroups  in  Singapore should come together to generate  a\r\n\r\ncommon  code of conduct which is acceptable  by  all  the\r\n\r\nmoderate  followers.  But most of the moderate  followers\r\n\r\nare  silent  in  nature. They should come out  and  speak\r\n\r\ntheir  minds  so  as  to  isolate the  few  militant  and\r\n\r\nextremist groups.  If the moderate group can enlarge  its\r\n\r\ninfluence, it would be better for our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the history of civilisation, we can find many\r\n\r\nexamples  of  religions  being  naturalised.   These  are\r\n\r\nBuddhism  in  Thailand and Japan,  Islam  in  China,  and\r\n\r\nHinduism  in  Bali, where they have integrated  with  the\r\n\r\nnative  cultures.  The four main racial groups  and  nine\r\n\r\nmajor  religions in Singapore must try to  adapt  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal  circumstances and forge a distinctive multi-racial\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people have different views on this issue,\r\n\r\nbut the views must be presented and discussed frankly and\r\n\r\nopenly. I suggest that grassroots organisations, and even\r\n\r\nthe  schools, should hold discussions on the White Paper.\r\n\r\nOur  National Education channel should be used to educate\r\n\r\nthe  public  on the significance of the White  Paper,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can have a better understanding of this  issue\r\n\r\nand rebuild their confidence.  This will help to build up\r\n\r\nconfidence and mutual respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of Singapore do we want? Our ultimate\r\n\r\nobject  is  to build up a secular and democratic  society\r\n\r\nbased  on  meritocracy, regardless of race,  language  or\r\n\r\nreligion.

If we really think\r\n\r\nabout  it, there are very few things under the sun  which\r\n\r\nare  new.   The ideological basis and the means  and  the\r\n\r\ndimension might be new, but not the threat in itself.  If\r\n\r\nwe  listen to the voice of Singapore's history,  we  will\r\n\r\nactually  hear  a very loud echo of what  we  are  facing\r\n\r\ntoday.   Let  me  just  take  Members  back  to  life  in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1964, ie, about a year and a half after  I  was\r\n\r\nborn,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand probably before many people in Singapore were born.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the headline in the Straits Times of 22nd\r\n\r\nJuly 1964:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore curfew after clashes. The Acting Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, Tun Abdul Razak, made an appeal for calm  in  a\r\n\r\nbroadcast  tonight  on  the  clashes  which  occurred  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to which 74 people were killed and  about  178\r\n\r\ninjured, leading to the imposition of a curfew from  9.30\r\n\r\npm to 6.00 am.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quoted Mr Lee Kuan Yew at that time saying:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Each one of us shares a responsibility in keeping\r\n\r\nthe situation here sane and rational.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbance had actually occurred during a mammoth\r\n\r\nprocession  which started from the Padang where,  earlier\r\n\r\nin  the  afternoon, about 25,000 Muslims had gathered  to\r\n\r\ncommemorate  the birthday of the Prophet.   The  incident\r\n\r\nwhich started the clashes was not immediately known,  but\r\n\r\nscattered incidents were reported as the main body of the\r\n\r\nprocession moved eastward towards Geylang.  A  series  of\r\n\r\nincidents  then  occurred near Lorong  3,  Geylang,  just\r\n\r\nopposite the Gay World, where ice-water and other  stalls\r\n\r\nwere overturned.  Fighting broke out between stallholders\r\n\r\nwho  grouped  together and retaliated.  The  police  were\r\n\r\ncalled out in force, and the entire area from Arab Street\r\n\r\nto Changi Road was cordoned off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John Jacobs, the President of the then Malayan\r\n\r\nIndian Congress, said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At this time, when we are threatened by external\r\n\r\nforces,  the  people of Malaysia should  be  united.   We\r\n\r\nshould  remain  calm and do what is necessary  to  create\r\n\r\nunderstanding and mutual trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the Straits Times of 25th July\r\n\r\n1964 reported:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"First Peace or Goodwill Committee was set up and\r\n\r\ntheir  aim  was  to make effective arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\nmutual  protection  of residents regardless  of  race  to\r\n\r\nprevent unruly elements from outside the area to come  in\r\n\r\nand  stir  up trouble or communal hatred and  to  impress\r\n\r\nupon   each  race  living  in  the  area  the  need   for\r\n\r\nrestraining their own irresponsible members from creating\r\n\r\nagitation and communal misunderstandings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Singapore's Deputy Premier, Dr Toh\r\n\r\nChin Chye, and three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinisters  set  out to meet leaders in  their  respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies  with  the common purpose,  which  was  to\r\n\r\ninstill in people the urgency of maintaining inter-racial\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony  in an inter-racial  society  and  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of  allowing rumours to disrupt  the  peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony  in  the  State.  By 27th July 1964,  there  were\r\n\r\nPeace or Goodwill Committees in all 51 constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers also reported something else. They\r\n\r\nreported  that  some Chinese shopkeepers had  refused  to\r\n\r\nextend  credit to Malay customers, and some  hawkers  had\r\n\r\nrefused to sell to them at all.  Steps were then taken to\r\n\r\nhave  the  Chinese  Chamber of  Commerce  and  the  other\r\n\r\nChambers  of Commerce to step in.  At the same time,  the\r\n\r\nCCCs  -  there  were CCCs back then - together  with  the\r\n\r\nkampong penghulus and ketuas did a good job of easing the\r\n\r\ntension and fear caused between neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also reported on 27th July 1964 when Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew  was  speaking  at an  Extraordinary  Delegates\r\n\r\nConference  of  the Singapore NTUC, he  called  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople  to keep down extremists who may emerge  from  any\r\n\r\nracial  group in the State.  He warned that if  this  was\r\n\r\nnot  done, then the extremist elements would also  emerge\r\n\r\nfrom  other groups.  And he said to the unions - make  an\r\n\r\neffort  in  your union in the next few days to renew  the\r\n\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation slowly stabilised until it flared up\r\n\r\nagain  in  September 1964, and the Straits Times headline\r\n\r\nof  5th September 1964 read as follows:  \"8 Dead, 60 Hurt\r\n\r\nIn  New  Rioting - Singapore A Danger Zone.\"  A state  of\r\n\r\ndanger  had  been  proclaimed  in  Singapore  where   the\r\n\r\ncasualty toll in 48 hours of sporadic Indonesian-inspired\r\n\r\nclashes  was given as 8 killed and 60 injured.  A  curfew\r\n\r\nwas  imposed  and, over the next few days,  more  arrests\r\n\r\nwere made.  A few days later, the Central Government  had\r\n\r\nswooped  down  on the ringleaders of the Indonesian  plot\r\n\r\nand  they slowly restored order.  Eventually, as we know,\r\n\r\nthese problems were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstamped out and we moved into an era of racial harmony in\r\n\r\nthe 1970s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point that I wanted to make was the very\r\n\r\ninteresting  historical parallels.  Then, as  now,  there\r\n\r\nwere  foreign  elements instigating our local  people  to\r\n\r\ncause  strife  and enmity.  Then, as now,  the  favourite\r\n\r\nmeans were violent means.  Then, as now, there was racial\r\n\r\ntension because the Malays felt after the event that they\r\n\r\nwere  being  discriminated against, and the  others  felt\r\n\r\nthat  they were upset with them.  And then, as now, there\r\n\r\nwere  peace and goodwill committees.  Now, we  call  them\r\n\r\nIRCCs,  but the basic purpose and function is  the  same.\r\n\r\nThen, as now, there was the call to be rational, tolerant\r\n\r\nand  understanding and a call to reach out and bridge the\r\n\r\ngap  and heal the hurt.  And, very importantly, then,  as\r\n\r\nnow, the objective of the foreign elements was the same - it was all about gaining political power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we have to understand about terrorism is\r\n\r\nthat it is a form of war.  Anyone who studies the history\r\n\r\nof  war  will be familiar with the work of Clausewitz  on\r\n\r\nwar.   And he defined war as \"An act of violence intended\r\n\r\nto  compel our opponents to fulfil their will.\"  And this\r\n\r\nis exactly what the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Al-Qaeda are\r\n\r\ntrying to do.  They are trying to use violence as a means\r\n\r\nto  compel  us to fulfil their will.  And what  is  their\r\n\r\nwill?   To  create a Daulah Islamiyah in the  region  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  do it through violent means because  they\r\n\r\ncannot  do  it through democratic means.  And  they  know\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not fall into the trap of thinking\r\n\r\nthat  the  JI's  cause  is about religion.   It  is  not.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  their  objective is political.   It  is  all\r\n\r\nabout   gaining  political  power,  and  they   have   no\r\n\r\nhesitation in using and misusing religion in order to  do\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might say that was a very interesting history\r\n\r\nlesson,  but what was the point of that?  The points,  or\r\n\r\nwhat  we  can  draw  from the historical  parallels,  are\r\n\r\nthese.   One, we have faced this threat before.  Two,  we\r\n\r\nhave  overcome it before.  Three, we can overcome it now.\r\n\r\nAnd from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  experience in the past, we have the key  to  dealing\r\n\r\nwith the present.  When you actually look at what we  did\r\n\r\nin  the past, you will see that what the White Paper  has\r\n\r\nset  out  does  contain the basic  points  that  will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to deal with this present threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that we have done, and that is what\r\n\r\nthe White Paper is about, is exposure.  Anything which is\r\n\r\ngood,  anything  which is wholesome,  anything  which  is\r\n\r\nright  can stand up to public scrutiny and can  stand  up\r\n\r\nwhen you shine a light on it.  And that is what the White\r\n\r\nPaper purports to do.  It sets out the activities of  the\r\n\r\nJI  to show everybody and to expose them so that we  know\r\n\r\nexactly  what they are, what they are about,  what  their\r\n\r\nobjectives are, so that we can deal with them.  The White\r\n\r\nPaper  is not about Muslims in general.  It is about  the\r\n\r\nextremist elements and how every Singaporean, Muslim  and\r\n\r\nnon-Muslim alike, can cope with the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of the White Paper, obviously, is\r\n\r\nhow do we counter the threat.  And there are three things\r\n\r\nidentified there, which are extremely important.   First,\r\n\r\nenhancing   security  measures;  second,   policing   the\r\n\r\nterrorists   and   extremist  ideologies;   and,   third,\r\n\r\nstrengthening social cohesion and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the first one, enhancing security measures is\r\n\r\nobviously  the  role  of  the  Government  and   security\r\n\r\nagencies, and I think we can leave this safely  in  their\r\n\r\nhands.  The second, the policing of ideology is something\r\n\r\nwhich I believe is best done by the Muslim community  and\r\n\r\ntheir leaders.  The only thing that the non-Muslims would\r\n\r\nhave to do, obviously, is to be vigilant and to look  out\r\n\r\nfor  things  which  may seem suspicious  and  inform  the\r\n\r\nauthorities.  But it is the third strand of our  strategy\r\n\r\nin  dealing  with  this threat that is very  important  - strengthening  social  cohesion  and  religious  harmony.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the one task that we cannot delegate to anybody\r\n\r\nelse.   This  is  the responsibility of  each  and  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  As it was in 1964, so it is now.  It is not\r\n\r\nthe task of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is not the task of the MPs, CCCs, IRCCs or\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders alone.  It is the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nevery taxi driver, every hawker, auntie, uncle, pak chik,\r\n\r\nmak  chik,  lawyer, doctor, engineer, secretary,  student\r\n\r\nand   factory  worker.   It  is  the  responsibility   of\r\n\r\neveryone, whether you live in a condominium, a  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nor   landed  property,  the  responsibility  of  everyone\r\n\r\nsitting in this Chamber, up in the Gallery and who  walks\r\n\r\non   the  streets  of  Singapore  outside.   It  is  your\r\n\r\nresponsibility and mine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how do we do this? The funny thing is that the\r\n\r\ncomplex  is  often achieved by the simple.  The  simplest\r\n\r\nthing to do is to look at the points of contacts that  we\r\n\r\nhave with people and other races, and that is not just at\r\n\r\ngrassroots  activities.  That is our everyday life,  when\r\n\r\nwe  go about our jobs, when we go about interacting  with\r\n\r\npeople.  It is the small things that matter.  Do we  take\r\n\r\nthe  time  and  trouble to wish our neighbours  of  other\r\n\r\nraces  and  religion, or do we just walk  past  them  and\r\n\r\nignore them?  If you are an Indian or Malay, do you pause\r\n\r\nat Chinese New Year to wish your Chinese friends?  If you\r\n\r\nare a Chinese, do you pause at Deepavali or Hari Raya  to\r\n\r\nwish your Indian and Malay friends?  Are you a parent who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  let your children play with children of  other\r\n\r\nraces?   When  your  children reach perhaps  the  teenage\r\n\r\nlevel, do you tell them that they cannot have a boyfriend\r\n\r\nor a girlfriend of other races?  It is the little, little\r\n\r\nthings like that.  Because they all impact on the way  we\r\n\r\nthink and act and behave towards somebody else.  So  that\r\n\r\nis very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, it is important as well. It\r\n\r\nis important to reach out and I will just give an example\r\n\r\nof something which happened in my constituency.  For Hari\r\n\r\nRaya,  the  Buddhist Lodge, which is in  our  area,  very\r\n\r\nkindly  offered to contribute the sum of  $10,000  to  be\r\n\r\nused  as ang pows or to buy things for the poor and needy\r\n\r\nMuslim Malay citizens in our constituency for Hari  Raya.\r\n\r\nIt  was given with sincerity and goodwill.  When the  ang\r\n\r\npows and the goodies were distributed, they were received\r\n\r\nwith appreciation.  And it is things like that which help\r\n\r\nbridge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe gap.  So every Singaporean can contribute in part  to\r\n\r\nthis strategy of dealing with the JI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing which, of course, has\r\n\r\nsurfaced in the course of the debate in the past few days\r\n\r\n-  the  concern of the Malay/Muslims that they  might  be\r\n\r\nassociated with the JI and blamed for what the  JI  tried\r\n\r\nto do. If you think about it, this is not so distant from\r\n\r\nback  in  1964  when the Malays were then concerned  that\r\n\r\nthey  were discriminated against.  At that time,  it  was\r\n\r\nabout   the   extension  of  credit  and  the   sale   of\r\n\r\nnecessities.   Today, in this environment,  it  is  about\r\n\r\nfear  of  not being able to get jobs.  This is where  the\r\n\r\nemployers  can step in.  How you treat your  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nemployees will make a big difference in the way that they\r\n\r\nreact  to you.  As a non-Malay and non-Muslim MP, I would\r\n\r\nhave  this to say to the Malay/Muslims in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\ndo not blame you for the acts of the JI members.  We know\r\n\r\nthat you did not do anything wrong, and it is unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat as a result of a few misguided people, the spotlight\r\n\r\nis  on  you  and your community.  You have to  understand\r\n\r\nthat  obviously  some  people of other  races  will  have\r\n\r\nconcern  - that is normal.  But I think I can safely  say\r\n\r\nthat  I,  and  I think every other MP in this  House  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders, regard you as one  of  us.   We  will\r\n\r\nstand  for  you and ensure that you are not discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst.   But  in turn, we ask that you stand  with  us.\r\n\r\nStand  with us against the JI and against the extremists.\r\n\r\nStand with us in making sure that Singapore is kept  safe\r\n\r\nand  whole,  because it is your home  as  well  as  ours.\r\n\r\nStand  with  us in making sure that our way of  life  and\r\n\r\nfreedom is preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if I might just take the liberty to\r\n\r\ntranslate into two sentences what I have just said  \"kami\r\n\r\nakan   bediri   bersama  kamu,  dan  akan  sedaya   upaya\r\n\r\nmemastikan   yang   masyarakat  tidak   akan   menghadapi\r\n\r\ndiskriminasi\".  I stand together with you to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malays will not be discriminated.

That the terrorist threat  is\r\n\r\nreal and present is highlighted by many recent events  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   The  Bali bomb blast  and  the  subsequent\r\n\r\narrests  of the personalities involved confirmed  earlier\r\n\r\ninformation  and  intelligence  that  many  were  key  JI\r\n\r\nleaders  and operatives.  The discovery of bombs, weapons\r\n\r\nand   ammunitions  in  the  Philippines,   Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, showed that the JI movement and its associated\r\n\r\nideological  partners are operating in  the  vicinity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's security perimeters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confirmation of information that the JI\r\n\r\nattempted to purchase 21 tons of ammonium nitrate  to  be\r\n\r\nused  as  truck  bombs  in  Singapore  worries  everyone.\r\n\r\nFurther  confirmation  that  some  of  the  Singapore  JI\r\n\r\nmembers  had gone to Afghanistan, Mindanao and  Indonesia\r\n\r\nfor  military  training  and  were  ready  to  serve   as\r\n\r\noperatives to sabotage action in Singapore is a  poignant\r\n\r\nreminder how lethal they are and how close they  came  to\r\n\r\ncarrying  out their plans.  We also know that many  local\r\n\r\nsites  were  carefully selected for destruction  of  both\r\n\r\nlives and properties.  They were surveyed and matters had\r\n\r\nprogressed to the planning stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further confirmation that two of the Singapore JI\r\n\r\nmembers  had  hands-on  experience  in  bombing  civilian\r\n\r\ntargets  as  shown in their participation  of  the  Batam\r\n\r\nbombings  on  Christmas eve in 2000 is another  important\r\n\r\nfactor  that is very worrying.  With some key JI  leaders\r\n\r\nlike  Hambali,  Malaysian JI member Azahari  Hussain  and\r\n\r\nSingapore JI member Mat Salamat are on their run and have\r\n\r\nyet to be apprehended is also a cause for concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also many sleeper cells lying low and can\r\n\r\nbe activated when required, as shown repeatedly by recent\r\n\r\narrests in Indonesia and the Philippines.  In fact,  what\r\n\r\nis  clear is that because the heat is on, many have  gone\r\n\r\nunderground in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is estimated that many of these JI\r\n\r\nmembers and their ideological partners are to be found in\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  pesantren  in Indonesia, so much  so  that\r\n\r\namong the pesantren members, there is a feeling that what\r\n\r\nJI  members  and the ideological partners  have  done  is\r\n\r\nright and not wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of what I have stated, I support\r\n\r\nthe  strong  action taken by the Government  against  the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah group and other militant and  extremist\r\n\r\ngroups   in  the  region.   I  also  support   the   many\r\n\r\nrecommendations put forth in the White Paper in the three\r\n\r\nareas.  Let me now focus on the three areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, enhancing security measures. It is clear\r\n\r\nthat the Al-Qaeda and its affiliated regional associates,\r\n\r\nlike  the  JI, KMM, MMI, Laskar Jihad, have well educated\r\n\r\nand   intelligent  leaders  and  members  who  understand\r\n\r\nGovernment  terrorist counter-measures,  and  accordingly\r\n\r\ntarget soft targets to achieve their goals.  They pose  a\r\n\r\nreal  challenge to the security forces in the  region  by\r\n\r\nadopting  asymmetrical warfare as their  modus  operandi.\r\n\r\nIn  the aftermath of September 11, they have shown  their\r\n\r\ncreative  side by targeting new targets in novel  ways  - explosives   in  shoes  in  an  aircraft,  surface-to-air\r\n\r\nmissiles in Kenya, suicide boat bombs off Yemen, car and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuicide  bombs in Bali and many more.  Stocks of ammonium\r\n\r\nnitrate  discovered in Philippines and Indonesia  clearly\r\n\r\nshow  that  the  preparatory materials for terrorism  are\r\n\r\nalways in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these show that the terrorists we are dealing\r\n\r\nare  on  a class of their own.  Our security forces  have\r\n\r\nshown that they can deal with any class of terrorists and\r\n\r\ndeter  them  with  our  counter  terrorist  efforts   and\r\n\r\nmeasures.  I thank our security forces and their services\r\n\r\nfor a job well done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our security agencies must continue to address the\r\n\r\nsecurity challenges thrown up by this new terrorism  that\r\n\r\nis   facing   us.   The  creation  of  the   Home   Front\r\n\r\nCoordinating Committee to oversee the terrorist threat is\r\n\r\na  welcome  move.   Greater inter-agency cooperation  and\r\n\r\ndevotion of more resources are needed to check the threat\r\n\r\nin its formative stage.  No doubt, many of these security\r\n\r\nmeasures  will entail inconveniences and loss of  privacy\r\n\r\nto  many, but it is a price to pay for a safe and  secure\r\n\r\nhomeland.   We  must  also  continue  with  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational efforts and share intelligence  to  cripple\r\n\r\nthe terrorist movement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the comprehensive range of\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken to counter terrorism will help  to  deter\r\n\r\nterrorist acts in Singapore.  Tighter border controls  at\r\n\r\nthe  airport, causeways and ferry terminals entail  great\r\n\r\ninconvenience, but we must accept these as the  necessary\r\n\r\nprice  for  a secure homeland.  Of course, at  times,  we\r\n\r\nhave   misinformed   and   mischievous   politicians   in\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries who make frivolous and  scandalous\r\n\r\nallegations  when  we  conduct such searches  within  our\r\n\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean must not think that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  take  care of the problem and go about  their  life\r\n\r\ncomplacently.  As responsible citizens and  residents  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, all of us must be vigilant and alert and be on\r\n\r\nthe  lookout  for matters which arouse our suspicion  and\r\n\r\nalert the authorities.  I am confident that collectively,\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  overcome the challenge of  the  terrorist\r\n\r\nthreat.  But that was only the hardware part.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the software part, which is\r\n\r\nthe  second  topic, policing the spread of terrorism  and\r\n\r\nextremist ideology.  Sir, the method adopted by the JI is\r\n\r\nthat they start out as legitimate religious teachers  and\r\n\r\nonly  later isolate the vulnerable ones and recruit  them\r\n\r\nas  cell  members.  The method of recruitment of   JI  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  well explained in the  White  Paper.   One\r\n\r\ncannot  also overlook the excellent details furnished  on\r\n\r\nsuch recruitment practices which are contained in the ICG\r\n\r\nreport  dated 11th December 2002 on \"How the JI Terrorist\r\n\r\nNetwork Operates\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI method of recruiting from an internal process\r\n\r\nwithin the Muslim community does pose a challenge for the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community in what measures they should  adopt  to\r\n\r\nnip the problem in the bud.  The JI leaders exploited the\r\n\r\ntrust  and  respect that members of the Muslim  community\r\n\r\ntraditionally accord to religious teachers and  scholars.\r\n\r\nAnd  this is something which is also common in many other\r\n\r\nreligions.   The  foreign terrorists also  exploited  the\r\n\r\ndeeply  felt sense of Islamic brotherhood among  Muslims.\r\n\r\nThe  important factor that stands out is the  involvement\r\n\r\nof  foreign  religious teachers.  They stayed  away  from\r\n\r\nmainstream  religious activities and kept to  themselves.\r\n\r\nThey also had a code of secrecy and they took an oath  of\r\n\r\npersonal allegiance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of Political Islam and the extreme\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of Wahabism in the world are  issues  that\r\n\r\nneed  to be addressed within the Muslim community.  To  a\r\n\r\ncasual  observer, one cannot deny that there are  changes\r\n\r\nthat  have  occurred in our Muslim community.  To  assert\r\n\r\nthat  one has become pious and is now a true Muslim is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  overt answer to thwart a deeper understanding  of\r\n\r\nour Muslim friend's complex make-up today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Barry Desker in an article entitled \"Islam and\r\n\r\nSociety in South East Asia After September 11\", published\r\n\r\nin the Australian Journal of International Affairs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecently, summed it up crisply by stating that \"there  is\r\n\r\nstruggle  for the soul of Islam within the global  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  today\".   He states that  \"the  small  Islamic\r\n\r\nmonarchy  of  Brunei and the significant Muslim  minority\r\n\r\npopulations  in Thailand, the Philippines  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  influenced  by  trends  and  developments  affecting\r\n\r\nMuslims  in  Malaysia  and Indonesia\".   He  cites  \"that\r\n\r\nIslamisation race in Malaysia has resulted in the Islamic\r\n\r\ndiscourse  domain being dominated by conservative  ulamas\r\n\r\nand  advocates of Wahabi austerity\".  The tidal  wave  of\r\n\r\ninfluence  from  our  neighbouring  countries  has   made\r\n\r\ninroads  into our Muslim community.  Where do we go  from\r\n\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the call made in the White Paper for\r\n\r\ngreater cooperation of the Muslim community and the wider\r\n\r\ncommunity of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened to note that both the Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nMPs  and  the Malay/ Muslim organisations, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim  religious leaders, have  come  out  to\r\n\r\ncondemn the JI and its extremist agenda.  I support their\r\n\r\ncall that non-Muslims play a critical role by getting  to\r\n\r\nknow  better  their  Muslim  neighbours,  workmates   and\r\n\r\nclassmates.   I am equally inspired that MPs  have  urged\r\n\r\nthe   community  to  contribute  in  the  mainstream  and\r\n\r\nactively  reach out to other Singaporeans  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nunderstanding and trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that MUIS has taken upon itself the task\r\n\r\nof    regulating   Islamic   religious   education    and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   The  online registration  system  and  the\r\n\r\nformal  accreditation  system  are  moves  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.  I am confident that this measure will  go  to\r\n\r\nsome  measure in tackling the spread of extremist Islamic\r\n\r\nteachers and teachings and help identify deviant teachers\r\n\r\nand teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot deny that it is not an easy task to build\r\n\r\nconsensus within the Muslim community in the light of the\r\n\r\nfact  that  just  like  many other religions,  there  are\r\n\r\ndifferent    schools    of    thought    and    differing\r\n\r\ninterpretations of the holy text.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the issue facing the Muslim community in\r\n\r\nthe  area  of  religious teaching and the  regulation  of\r\n\r\nIslamic  teachers was raised in an article by  a  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes journalist, Mr Marfoot Simon, on 12th January 2003.\r\n\r\nHe stated some of the difficulties:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was difficult to look out for individuals\r\n\r\nlike Ibrahim Maidin as it is not easy to distinguish them\r\n\r\nat the registration stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the power to require the asatizah\r\n\r\n(religious  teachers) to register does not  exist  within\r\n\r\nthe  power  of  MUIS  and  also that  MUIS  has  no  real\r\n\r\nauthority to monitor and take the necessary action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) He highlighted the weakness of MUIS in not\r\n\r\nhaving control over madrasahs or even their curriculum  - save  for  one  madrasah.  He also  raised  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  the same fate will befall a MUIS-led  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework for religious education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is perhaps timely to see whether we need to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the   hand  of  MUIS  by  making   necessary\r\n\r\nlegislative  changes  and also  consider  other  ways  to\r\n\r\nempower  MUIS  and  the other relevant  organisations  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  deviant teachers and deviant teachings  are\r\n\r\nalways in check.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that the Muslim community has its\r\n\r\nown  set of problems and priorities to sort out just like\r\n\r\nall the other communities.  If there is one thing that is\r\n\r\nclear,  it  is that all in the Muslim community,  whether\r\n\r\nthey are individuals or organisations, must work together\r\n\r\nand  overcome the problem and challenge boldly.  If  they\r\n\r\nare  unable to do so, there would come a time when  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a call for the state to get involved to  police\r\n\r\nreligious teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are religious deviants and religious\r\n\r\nextremists to be found in all religions.  History is full\r\n\r\nof  them.  They will claim divine and exclusive right  to\r\n\r\ninterpret  their  religions.  Tackling them  is  no  easy\r\n\r\ntask.  But not tackling them will only allow bigger  harm\r\n\r\nto befall the wider community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, the White Paper has starkly\r\n\r\nprojected the challenge that all religious communities in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will face at some stage of their  development.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  matter that I hope all religious  leaders  and\r\n\r\ngroups  will take heed and pay attention.  If  necessary,\r\n\r\nthey  should also build safeguards and monitor  religious\r\n\r\nteachers and preachers in their own communities  so  that\r\n\r\nproblems like the JI and extremist religious teachings do\r\n\r\nnot surface among their flock in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the third topic, which is\r\n\r\nstrengthening social cohesion and religious harmony.  The\r\n\r\nvast majority of Singapore Muslims are moderate, tolerant\r\n\r\nand  law-abiding, and they do not support the actions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  militants.  The setting up of the  IRCC  and\r\n\r\nHarmony Circles can help in building better understanding\r\n\r\nand  trust among the various communities.  I believe that\r\n\r\nit  is essential that all communities assess how they can\r\n\r\ncreate better bonding and better interaction between  all\r\n\r\nraces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an increasing number who think that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from the various races are not  interacting\r\n\r\nenough,  although the official statistics show otherwise.\r\n\r\nMany  are too polite to discuss the matter openly as they\r\n\r\nconsider it a sensitive matter.  If such a trend is  true\r\n\r\nindeed,  then I think all the communities have  to  share\r\n\r\nthe blame for perpetuation of this negative trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good starting point is to ask some pertinent\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are we truly interacting with people of other\r\n\r\nraces?   Do  we harbour prejudices and do we  pass  these\r\n\r\nprejudices to our children?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do the different communities, as a whole,\r\n\r\nencourage interaction and an attitude of give and take or\r\n\r\nhave we become too rigid?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Do the minority communities sincerely try to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  desires  of  the  majority   community?\r\n\r\nDoes the majority community, in turn, sincerely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  the  same?  Or is it a case of each  community\r\n\r\nonly desiring engagement on their terms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the public domain, have we put sufficient\r\n\r\neffort   to  ensure  that  there  is  no  room  for   all\r\n\r\ncommunities to participate and develop true bonds?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Have some of our community's attitude changed\r\n\r\nto  the  extent that it is a futile effort  to  turn  the\r\n\r\nclock?   Is  the religious and racial divide a  temporary\r\n\r\ndivide or is it a permanent divide?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we address these issues\r\n\r\nsquarely as the answers to these questions will determine\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of society we will evolve into and whether  we\r\n\r\nare  going to encourage more radicals or even terrorists,\r\n\r\nbe it a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or a Buddhist one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked a good Muslim friend what causes many of our\r\n\r\nMuslim  friends  to look to the Middle  East  and  absorb\r\n\r\nMiddle  Eastern  cultures, traditions and even  dressing.\r\n\r\nHis  simple answer was that for the Malay Muslims,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  history  in  Singapore beyond the  period  before\r\n\r\nRaffles.   It  is a sore point among the Malays  but  one\r\n\r\nthat sometimes we overlook.  They want to identify with a\r\n\r\nrich  and  proud  tradition.   They want their  own  rich\r\n\r\nheritage  to  identify with.  The Middle East  offers  an\r\n\r\nalternative  to them.  But that package also  comes  with\r\n\r\nits  own idiosyncrasies and others like Arabism and  Arab\r\n\r\npolitical  views, etc.  But I saw the pride in my  Muslim\r\n\r\nfriends  when heritage centres like the Lieutenant  Adnan\r\n\r\nCentre was opened at Pasir Panjang Hill.  They need  more\r\n\r\nsuch  icons  and  symbols and rich heritage  to  identify\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member, Mr K. Shanmugam, highlighted a\r\n\r\nfew more reasons for the prevailing self-esteem among the\r\n\r\nMalays.  These are subtle matters which are not discussed\r\n\r\nopenly.   But  the problems are there.  We must  identify\r\n\r\nthe  pull  and  push factors that are prevailing  in  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community and take the necessary steps.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nwe can focus on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese and work with them and help resolve them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an MP, I try very hard to get the various\r\n\r\ncommunities  to  mingle  and bond.   To  community  event\r\n\r\norganisers,  I emphasise the importance of having  multi-racial  programmes,  multi-racial participation,  and  to\r\n\r\nhave programmes in the language that all Singaporeans can\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Despite this, I am aware that many community\r\n\r\norganisations  overlook the same.  Just  last  month,  my\r\n\r\nsister bought many tickets for her family for a RC  block\r\n\r\nparty  near her home.  Imagine, to her disdain,  all  the\r\n\r\norganisers had was karaoke singing in one language.  I am\r\n\r\nquite  sure that there are many more culprits out  there.\r\n\r\nWhat  they do not realise is that first impression counts\r\n\r\nfor them.  If increasingly community organisations ignore\r\n\r\nparticipation by all communities, then many will withdraw\r\n\r\nto their own communities and that will not augur well for\r\n\r\nour future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am equally heartened that there are gems in\r\n\r\nour  midst who are shining examples of those who help and\r\n\r\nwork   with  different  communities.   The  four  Chinese\r\n\r\ngentlemen  who  contributed  to  help  the  JI   members'\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  one,  and  this  was  highlighted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  yesterday.   I was also heartened  to  see  the\r\n\r\nBuddhist  Lodge  volunteers helping out during  Thaipusam\r\n\r\nlast week.  There are many more fine examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is equally important for the minority\r\n\r\ncommunities to be engaged and to participate actively  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  events.   Stay away  at  your  own  peril  for\r\n\r\nhistory  shows  the  necessity  for  interaction  by  the\r\n\r\nminorities.  The majority can live without the  minority,\r\n\r\nbut the minority cannot do the same.  So I would like  to\r\n\r\ncall  on all communities to come forth and work together.\r\n\r\nLet us strengthen the Singapore Team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on  the Jemaah Islamiyah  Arrests  and  the\r\n\r\nThreat of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTerrorism  brings into focus several issues,  which  have\r\n\r\ndominated  much  of  the  past  year,  both  locally  and\r\n\r\ninternationally.   Since  9/11,  there  has   been   much\r\n\r\ndiscussion  about  the  threat  of  global  terrorism  by\r\n\r\nextremist  Muslim groups, and the need for more  moderate\r\n\r\nvoices  within  the Muslim world.  To  some  extent,  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion has also centred on the faith itself.  Being a\r\n\r\nMuslim  and  believing  in Islam became  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nintense  scrutiny  and,  in  some  instances,  even   the\r\n\r\nreceiving end of hatred and violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests in Singapore of a group plotting violent\r\n\r\nterror  and  with links to other terrorist  groups,  both\r\n\r\nregionally  and internationally, brought home a  chilling\r\n\r\nreality,  which all Singaporeans hitherto could not  have\r\n\r\nimagined: that there are Singaporeans who are prepared to\r\n\r\nsacrifice innocent lives for their cause.  For the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity   in   Singapore,  this  is  an  entirely   new\r\n\r\nphenomenon  - the group's total disdain for the  sanctity\r\n\r\nof  human  life  is totally unfamiliar to the  community.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this new phenomenon brought undue  attention\r\n\r\nto  the Muslim community here in Singapore.  For the non-Muslim community, it was a test of their trust and  faith\r\n\r\nin  fellow Muslim Singaporeans.  It was a difficult  time\r\n\r\nfor all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have the White Paper - a report that puts\r\n\r\ninto perspective these issues and provides enough clarity\r\n\r\nabout the JI group and the threat of global terrorism  to\r\n\r\nestablish a rational basis for all Singaporeans  to  move\r\n\r\non with their lives.  The Paper has correctly defined the\r\n\r\nthreat of terrorism as a national problem, which must  be\r\n\r\ntackled by all Singaporeans.  The Paper has also made  it\r\n\r\nclear that the JI ideology and its exclusivist tendencies\r\n\r\nand  millenarian orientation is but the belief of a small\r\n\r\ngroup  of  Muslims  in Singapore.   The  Paper  has  also\r\n\r\noutlined  steps to be taken by all groups and  Government\r\n\r\nagencies to tackle the threat of terrorism.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  is  it possible for us now to go back to the  pre-9/11  and  pre-JI  arrests days?   Things  cannot  remain\r\n\r\nunchanged.  What has happened cannot be erased.  Negative\r\n\r\nimpacts will take time to be addressed, or removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I am encouraged by the strong consensus\r\n\r\nshown  in this House and by the public in general on  the\r\n\r\nneed  to unite against the terrorist threat. There  is  a\r\n\r\nstrong  determination by everyone not to let  this  issue\r\n\r\nsow suspicion and destroy the bonds between Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a recognition that greater security challenges\r\n\r\nare  a given in the foreseeable future.  There is a valid\r\n\r\nconcern that the security threat is one, which also poses\r\n\r\na  challenge to social harmony.  What will be critical is\r\n\r\nhow  Singaporeans  pull together to overcome  these  twin\r\n\r\nchallenges, so that we become more resilient as a people,\r\n\r\nand come out stronger and more cohesive as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Response of the Malay/Muslim community</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim community and religious leaders are\r\n\r\nunited in their determination to tackle these challenges.\r\n\r\nThe  responses of the various Malay/Muslim organisations,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  MUIS,  Mendaki, Pergas,  Perdaus,  and  various\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders  to the White Paper  again  underscore\r\n\r\nthis commitment.  We want to play a constructive role  in\r\n\r\nthis important effort of building trust and strengthening\r\n\r\nties across all groups in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for the House to know that the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community had embarked on this process  long\r\n\r\nbefore  the  appearance of the White Paper.   During  the\r\n\r\npast  two  years  or  so,  Muslim community  leaders  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions have come together to work on measures  that\r\n\r\nwill   strengthen   Islamic   religious   education   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in Singapore.  The Muslim Religious  Council\r\n\r\nof Singapore (MUIS) has initiated a variety of programmes\r\n\r\nto  strengthen both the full-time and part-time  madrasah\r\n\r\nsystems,  and to train and upgrade the skills of  Islamic\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers in Singapore so that they  understand\r\n\r\nthe  context in which they operate.  MUIS has also sought\r\n\r\nto  organise  public  seminars for both  the  public  and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders on issues of importance, and to  invite\r\n\r\nnon-Muslim Singaporeans to visit our mosques.   MUIS  has\r\n\r\nformed a committee with other Malay/\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMuslim  organisations  to  study  ways  to  improve   the\r\n\r\ntraining  of local religious teachers.  These are  but  a\r\n\r\nfew  examples  of  the efforts that are already  underway\r\n\r\nwithin the Malay/Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What more will be done?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other measures are also being considered. We will\r\n\r\nstrengthen the safeguards against adverse influences from\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.  There is already a vetting system for\r\n\r\nforeign   speakers.   We  will  also  leverage  on,   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen   information   sharing   among   Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\norganisations  and  mosques so that we  can  more  easily\r\n\r\ndetect  activities  that are out of  the  ordinary.   The\r\n\r\nWhite Paper has helped in educating the public on how  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  potentially  untoward activities.   MUIS  will\r\n\r\nprovide  guidance to students in selecting  the  overseas\r\n\r\ninstitutions in which to pursue religious education.   It\r\n\r\nwill also undertake pre-departure programmes and keep  in\r\n\r\ntouch with the students while they are overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, other than adopting a defensive\r\n\r\napproach,   we   want  to  strengthen  our   own   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity's  religious education system, not  only  as  a\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against deviant teaching, but also to  support\r\n\r\nthe holistic development of the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening   of  part-time  religious  education   for\r\n\r\nchildren and adults</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong and vibrant part-time religious\r\n\r\neducation   system  within  the  Malay/Muslim  community.\r\n\r\nAlmost  every  mosque  in Singapore provides  classes  in\r\n\r\nreligious  instruction  for  both  children  and  adults.\r\n\r\nThere  is also a thriving private sector market  in  this\r\n\r\narea.   Given the extensive reach of this system,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we pay close attention to it.  MUIS  will\r\n\r\nset  up  a Religious Education Advisory Panel.  And  this\r\n\r\npanel will make use of a collaborative approach that will\r\n\r\nbring  together all stakeholders, and seeks out the views\r\n\r\nof parents, teachers, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstudents   on  religious  education.   The  comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  will  look  into  the  appropriate  content   and\r\n\r\nteaching  methods relevant to different  age  groups,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  training for our teachers.  It will  also  look\r\n\r\ninto enhancing the quality of the network of teachers and\r\n\r\ninstitutions providing religious education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing asatizah and enhancing their role</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim religious teacher, or asatizah, holds a\r\n\r\nrespected  place in the Muslim community.   Many  Muslims\r\n\r\ncan  recall  fondly  a teacher who has  made  a  positive\r\n\r\nimpact  on  his/her  life and values.   This  respect  is\r\n\r\nsomething the teacher earns through continuously learning\r\n\r\nand being able to address the concerns of the students of\r\n\r\ntoday.  We want to systematically enable our asatizah  to\r\n\r\nenhance  their  knowledge and exposure.  MUIS  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with relevant Malay/Muslim organisations to  look\r\n\r\ninto  their  professional  development  and  recognition.\r\n\r\nCurrently, MUIS has platforms to engage religious leaders\r\n\r\nand  teachers to discuss professional issues, as well  as\r\n\r\ngenerate  new  ideas  for programmes.   MUIS  also  gives\r\n\r\nscholarships  to  assist individuals to pursue  religious\r\n\r\neducation  at  reputable institutions of learning.   MUIS\r\n\r\nwill   build  on  existing  initiatives  and  develop   a\r\n\r\nstructured training and development framework.  This  can\r\n\r\nthen  form  the  foundation  for  the  consideration  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of other measures, such as the accreditation\r\n\r\nof  our religious teachers.  To help point the public  to\r\n\r\nqualified teachers, MUIS will work to maintain an updated\r\n\r\nand comprehensive database for their reference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of the above initiatives are components of\r\n\r\nthe  comprehensive  regulatory  system  that  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  is putting together as proposed by  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  With time and greater experience in managing  the\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects  of the system, MUIS  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more precise guidance to Muslim Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\ntheir religious education needs, either independently  or\r\n\r\nin collaboration with other Malay/Muslim organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, Mr Ravindran, noted the issue of\r\n\r\nthe  credibility  of  MUIS in the  eyes  of  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    I   think  it  is  important   for   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community to give their support and  respect\r\n\r\nto  MUIS.   As the highest religious body in  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore, Muslims have  a  duty  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  with  MUIS  to  build  it  into  a  strong  and\r\n\r\nresponsive organisation.  I would also urge our religious\r\n\r\nleaders  to  work  closely with MUIS  in  our  effort  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen Islamic religious education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building Social Cohesion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building social cohesion is an issue for all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  not  just the Muslim  community.   The  JI\r\n\r\nsecurity  challenge has been a test of  our  cohesiveness\r\n\r\nand  resilience  as a people.  Although the  issue  is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  one, it is good that the Muslim community  has\r\n\r\nnot  withdrawn into itself, but actively reached  out  to\r\n\r\nothers  - and built bridges across communities.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  non-Muslims should understand that  communal\r\n\r\nworship is an integral part of Muslims' lives, and should\r\n\r\nnot  view  this as Muslims `retreating to the mosque'  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of social interaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that other communities have not stood and\r\n\r\nlooked on as bystanders or commentators, but have made  a\r\n\r\nsincere effort to better understand and reach out to  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need that understanding and trust not just at the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  the  community  leadership  but  also  at  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots level.  Community leaders have a critical role\r\n\r\nin  modelling  the  attitudes and  actions  that  promote\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding.  As leaders, they can also help dispel\r\n\r\nmisperceptions, prejudices and encourage members in their\r\n\r\ngroups  to interact socially with people in other  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities.   The IRCC is one important  platform  where\r\n\r\nthese  initiatives are taking place.  But  the  principle\r\n\r\napplies  to  all  social environments  such  as  schools,\r\n\r\nworkplaces,  and community clubs.  While  the  Government\r\n\r\nand community can provide platforms\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand facilitate social bonding, Members of this House have\r\n\r\nrightly pointed out that individual Singaporeans have  to\r\n\r\nmake the effort to interact and understand one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out by the White Paper, there is no\r\n\r\nquick  solution  to  counter  the  threat  of  terrorism.\r\n\r\nGroups,  like the JI, took a long time to form and  morph\r\n\r\nand  can exist in our midst without anyone knowing  about\r\n\r\nit.   Similarly, building cohesion and trust is  a  long-term  process  requiring  every  one,  Muslims  and  non-\r\n\r\nMuslims,  to stay focused on the real issues.   The  real\r\n\r\nchallenge  for  us  here, in Singapore,  is  to  build  a\r\n\r\nclimate where extreme views will not take root.  We  must\r\n\r\ncreate  an  environment that is conducive  to  a  healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  every  one's faith  and  belief  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of a multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parliamentary Malay/Muslim colleagues and I are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to this process.  We had started a process  of\r\n\r\nconsultation   with   the  Malay/Muslim   community   and\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders long before the attacks  on  the  twin\r\n\r\ntowers and the JI arrests.  The process will now continue\r\n\r\nwith a sharper focus on what needs to be done within  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.   I  recently met a group of such  leaders  to\r\n\r\nshare  with them my views on the White Paper and  what  I\r\n\r\nintend to say today.  I found the process useful and will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to consult community and religious  leaders  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my discussions with many Malays from all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life in the past year or so, I heard  concerns\r\n\r\nabout  jobs and livelihood, as well as how the  community\r\n\r\nwas  being  put under the spotlight.  These are  concerns\r\n\r\nthat  the Government, community and business sectors  are\r\n\r\naddressing.  However, the Malays certainly did  not  view\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore system as being stacked against them.  Nor\r\n\r\ndid  they  think  that  the  community  is  marginalised.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  this view is borne out by objective measures  of\r\n\r\nthe  community's progress in education, income and social\r\n\r\nand  material  well-being.  Our own  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven us the data of the past 10 years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachievement  of  the Malay/Muslim community.   The  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  has  seen  successful individuals  in  diverse\r\n\r\nfields   in  line  with  the  overall  progress  of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Over time, we will see more of  them.   With\r\n\r\ngreater  interaction between Muslims and  non-Muslims  at\r\n\r\nall  levels  and  more  visible  examples  of  Malays  in\r\n\r\nleadership,  we  will strengthen the mutual  respect  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding between our various communities  and  build\r\n\r\non  the cohesion that we have achieved in the last  three\r\n\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Finding the Common Ground</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community has gone through an\r\n\r\nentire  year of discussions, dialogues, meetings,  cross-cultural  sessions and many other forms of trust building\r\n\r\nefforts.   The  community wants to move  on.   While  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper has been well received by most Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nI  understand why some in the Malay/Muslim community feel\r\n\r\nuneasy  about being in the spotlight again and they  want\r\n\r\nto move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is useful for us to reflect exactly on\r\n\r\nwhat  moving on means in the context of what is happening\r\n\r\naround  us.   Moving on does not mean  ignoring  and  not\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the  JI  incident  and  its  implications.\r\n\r\nMoving  on  requires understanding what  the  issues  and\r\n\r\nchallenges  are all about and what needs to  be  done  in\r\n\r\norder to avoid a similar incident in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For non-Muslim Singaporeans, Sir, I hope they do not\r\n\r\nview  the White Paper as proof of a fundamental  flaw  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim  community.   Muslim  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nequally  shocked  at the emergence of a  terrorist  group\r\n\r\nwithin  our midst.  We did not create this group.   Most,\r\n\r\nif  not  all, of us are saddened that there exist  within\r\n\r\nthe  community  people who are prepared to use  violence,\r\n\r\neven towards fellow Muslims, to further their own goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the need to move on and the need for\r\n\r\nconcrete action to prevent the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemergence of terrorist or extremist groups, lies a common\r\n\r\nground where all Singaporeans should converge.  And  that\r\n\r\nis  to understand this global phenomenon correctly and to\r\n\r\nsee  that  it  affects  all of us,  irrespective  of  our\r\n\r\nreligious or ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Understanding this global phenomenon</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any religious group, as pointed out by Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran,  there  can emerge, and have  emerged,  groups\r\n\r\nthat  are  prepared to be different and, in  some  cases,\r\n\r\neven  pursue a path of violence to achieve their  vision.\r\n\r\nMartin  E.  Marty and R. Scott Appleby are editors  of  a\r\n\r\nfive-volume  work  on the study of fundamentalism.  These\r\n\r\nstudies  have noted that fundamentalists share a tendency\r\n\r\nto  separate  from  fellow believers,  and  to  establish\r\n\r\nstrict   boundaries  between  insiders   and   outsiders.\r\n\r\nFundamentalists also define the opposition  as  including\r\n\r\nboth  non-believers and believers who do not share  their\r\n\r\nviews.   While  the term \"fundamentalist\"  is  frequently\r\n\r\nassociated  in the popular press with Muslim  extremists,\r\n\r\nfundamentalist  thinking  can  exist  in  any   religious\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fundamentalist groups, like the JI, who\r\n\r\nsee  the  modern  world as offering no future  for  them.\r\n\r\nThey manifest this as a struggle between their vision  of\r\n\r\nhow  society  is  to  be  organised  against  models   of\r\n\r\nsocieties  developed in the West.  These groups  perceive\r\n\r\nsecular  nationalism  as  a Western  construct  that  has\r\n\r\nfailed  to address their concerns.  This struggle,  which\r\n\r\nis  ideological in nature, has been termed by one  author\r\n\r\nas  a  conflict of the \"ideologies of order\".   One  side\r\n\r\nmaintains that secular nationalism is the glue  that  can\r\n\r\nbind  groups  into  a coherent nation,  while  the  other\r\n\r\ninsists  that  it must be religion.  And  true  to  their\r\n\r\nfundamentalist traits, their vision harks back to a  past\r\n\r\nwhich they deemed glorious and perfect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve their vision, these groups are\r\n\r\nprepared to use violence.  In their minds, they  see  the\r\n\r\nworld dominated by Western ideals and which holds nothing\r\n\r\nfor them.  Hence the need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndestroy  in  order to build something  new.   People  who\r\n\r\nbelieved   that  all  symbols  of  the  West  should   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed, carried out the 9/11 attacks and the Bali bomb\r\n\r\nblasts.   And that in doing so, their own death serves  a\r\n\r\nperceived  so-called  higher  purpose.   This   form   of\r\n\r\nrevolutionary violence has been noted by some writers  as\r\n\r\nbeing similar to the way in which revolutionary socialism\r\n\r\nand  violent anarchism have seduced young Westerners into\r\n\r\nterrorism in a previous generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The JI and Terror</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we juxtapose all of the above against what the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper has described to us about the JI, we will see\r\n\r\na    picture    emerging   reflecting    the    so-called\r\n\r\nfundamentalist  mindset.  The JI is  an  exclusive  group\r\n\r\nthat mistakenly believed that they had found the path  to\r\n\r\nsalvation.   Those  who  do not share  their  belief  are\r\n\r\nconsidered as \"unbelievers\", a demarcation that in  their\r\n\r\nmind  legitimises  the use of violence against  everyone,\r\n\r\nincluding Muslims.  Their vision of a Daulah Islamiyah or\r\n\r\nIslamic state is anchored in the past, with no scope  for\r\n\r\nchange  or  adaptation,  and no tolerance  of  diversity.\r\n\r\nWhile  not  all fundamentalist groups support  terrorism,\r\n\r\nthey  indirectly provide the ideological  motivation  for\r\n\r\nreligiously inspired terrorism.  The JI showed us that it\r\n\r\nis  a short step indeed from religious fundamentalism  to\r\n\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may all appear academic. But the point I\r\n\r\nam  trying  to  make is that both Muslim  and  non-Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  owe  it to themselves  to  understand  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon.  This phenomenon is not about Muslims  versus\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims.   It  is  about  a  particular   orientation\r\n\r\ntowards life that insists that the modern world offers no\r\n\r\nsalvation;  it is about returning to an idealised  notion\r\n\r\nof  a religious past and accepting a rigid interpretation\r\n\r\nof religion as the true path.  It is about justifying the\r\n\r\nuse  of  violence for this purpose.  We must oppose  this\r\n\r\norientation  towards life; we must believe  there  is  no\r\n\r\ninconsistency in being both religious and modern  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diversity and Tolerance: Best Guard Against Extremism</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community here cannot pretend that\r\n\r\nnothing  has  changed in the last 20  years.   The  White\r\n\r\nPaper  calls  for  a  comprehensive  system  to  regulate\r\n\r\nreligious  education within the Muslim community.   This,\r\n\r\nas  I  have explained earlier, is being done by  MUIS  in\r\n\r\ncollaboration with other Malay/Muslim organisations.  But\r\n\r\nis  this sufficient to safeguard against the emergence of\r\n\r\ngroups like the JI?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in the White Paper, Ibrahim Maidin and his\r\n\r\nJI  members attended religious classes, like other Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would do.  But slowly, over time, and for  a\r\n\r\nselect group of members, the JI ideology gets introduced.\r\n\r\nHaving  taken the oath of allegiance, the JI ideology  of\r\n\r\nviolence,  hatred and extremism was never  challenged  by\r\n\r\nanyone in the group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, as a community, allow intolerant and\r\n\r\nextremist  views  and ideas to go unchallenged,  then  we\r\n\r\ninadvertently allow such views to take root here.  If  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to a question on how Muslims should  deal  with\r\n\r\nbanking  interest,  a  foreign Muslim  religious  speaker\r\n\r\ntells a crowd in Singapore that they do not need to  live\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,  and  we  allow  such  a  comment  to  go\r\n\r\nunchecked, then we unwittingly sow the seeds of  conflict\r\n\r\nand  fundamentalism.  The response by a foreign religious\r\n\r\nspeaker  echoes  that  of the local  JI  leader,  Ibrahim\r\n\r\nMaidin, who wrote to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar,  on\r\n\r\nwhether Muslims should all migrate to Afghanistan  as  he\r\n\r\nbelieved then that, under the Taliban, Afghanistan was  a\r\n\r\ntrue  Islamic state.  Both Ibrahim Maidin and the foreign\r\n\r\nspeaker  reflect the same mind.  And this is the  nub  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem:  what  we are dealing with  is  a  peculiar\r\n\r\norientation of the mind.  If we allow myopic, extreme and\r\n\r\nradical  views to go unchallenged, even if  they  do  not\r\n\r\nadvocate  violence,  then  we  inadvertently  provide   a\r\n\r\nconducive environment for the growth of intolerance and a\r\n\r\nrigid fundamentalist orientation to life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the fundamentalist groups who reject\r\n\r\neverything Western without a clear understanding, we find\r\n\r\ntoday  such  thinking permeating the  Muslim  mind  in  a\r\n\r\nvariety of ways.  Articles and journals that present  the\r\n\r\nWest  as  the  great evil of modern society  and  present\r\n\r\nalternatives, on matters such as politics and  economics,\r\n\r\ncouched in religious terms as the absolute truth, reflect\r\n\r\nthe   fundamentalist  traits.   But  these  articles  get\r\n\r\npublished   while   those   with   a   more   rationalist\r\n\r\ninterpretation are blocked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge, as has been suggested by several\r\n\r\nMuslim  and non-Muslim scholars, is for the moderates  to\r\n\r\nspeak up.  And I know the term \"moderate\" is loaded  with\r\n\r\nmeaning.  But it must be so.  To those who view the world\r\n\r\nas  incompatible  with their version  of  religion,  they\r\n\r\nwould  see people who advocate a multitude of voices  and\r\n\r\ninterpretations  of  the religion  as  being  the  enemy.\r\n\r\nTheir insistence on a monolithic interpretation of Islam,\r\n\r\nwith  no  room  for disagreement, must necessarily  clash\r\n\r\nwith  those who advocate diversity.  Hence, we see groups\r\n\r\nissuing edicts of death to those who advocate a different\r\n\r\nview  from them.  We must collectively reject these views\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best safeguard we can put in place is to allow a\r\n\r\ndiversity  of views and opinions to emerge.  Muslims  all\r\n\r\nover   the  world  will  never  have  disputes   on   the\r\n\r\nfundamental principles of Islam, such as the  oneness  of\r\n\r\nGod,  the  Prophecy of Muhammad, the five daily  prayers,\r\n\r\nthe  payment of wealth tax, and fasting.  But in the  way\r\n\r\nwe  order  our  lives,  cherish our women,  organise  our\r\n\r\nreligious  life,  exist  in  a  multi-religious  society,\r\n\r\neducate  our  young, and so on, there can be differences.\r\n\r\nOf course, the diversity cannot be unlimited.  Certainly,\r\n\r\nif  some  advocate violence as a basis of their struggle,\r\n\r\nthen  we must all condemn it.  As rightly pointed out  by\r\n\r\nseveral  Muslim  scholars, the proper  interpretation  of\r\n\r\nIslam is compatible with democracy and human rights.  And\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is about respect for differences  of  opinions\r\n\r\nand  consensus building by the strength of arguments  and\r\n\r\nnot by the size of your arsenal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Way Forward - Building the Good Society</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Islam encourages all Muslims to build the good\r\n\r\nsociety.   Elements of the good society include a  system\r\n\r\nto  protect weaker members of society, measures to insure\r\n\r\na  corruption-free  environment, the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nsafe   and   secure   environment,   the   provision   of\r\n\r\nopportunities  for everyone to grow and develop,  a  good\r\n\r\nhealth  care system, and an economic system that promotes\r\n\r\ndevelopment for all in that society.  Our contribution to\r\n\r\nSingapore  must be to help build this good  society.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  would argue that elements of the  good  society\r\n\r\nexist  in  Singapore, and that it is  our  duty  as  good\r\n\r\nMuslims and good Singaporeans to protect this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am encouraged by the achievements of Ms\r\n\r\nMisnati  Dollah  and Mr Zainul Sarib who  are  among  the\r\n\r\nwinners  of the National Productivity Award for the  year\r\n\r\n2002  in  Singapore.  In their own quiet ways,  they  are\r\n\r\nhelping  to promote the productivity movement,  which  is\r\n\r\ncentral to an efficient economic system.  They, like many\r\n\r\nother Malay/Muslim workers in Singapore, are building the\r\n\r\ngood  society in Singapore.  Our meritocratic system  has\r\n\r\nalso  allowed  us  to identify talented  Malays  for  key\r\n\r\nappointments  on  the  boards  of  statutory  bodies  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-related agencies.  And we have been doing this\r\n\r\nfor a very long time, ever since your days as Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Sir.  So, today, we find Malays\r\n\r\non  the  boards  of  organisations, such  as  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, MPA, CAAS, LTA, Science Centre,  MDA,\r\n\r\nNational  Heritage  Board  and the  Singapore  Management\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other ways in which Muslims can\r\n\r\ncontribute to the building of the good society.  The  BBC\r\n\r\nreported  last  week on the discovery by a  group  of  US\r\n\r\nresearchers in the fight against cholera.  Using old sari\r\n\r\nmaterial  folded four times as a filter for river  water,\r\n\r\nthey  found  that  they could cut down the  incidence  of\r\n\r\ncholera by half among villagers in Bangladesh.  I  traced\r\n\r\nthe  report  and found that one of the researchers  is  a\r\n\r\nMuslim from Bangladesh who is currently working in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMaryland  with  other  non-Muslim  scientists   on   this\r\n\r\nproject.  I communicated with him, and he told me that he\r\n\r\nand  his colleagues have been working for 27 years  in  a\r\n\r\nsearch for a cure for cholera among poor villagers.  As a\r\n\r\nMuslim,  Professor Anwar Huq is contributing to the  good\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As various Members of the House have pointed out,\r\n\r\nthe  current  challenges present a window of  opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to stand up to defend  the  society  we\r\n\r\nwant to preserve and build upon.  Muslims and non-Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  have a role to play in ensuring  that  the\r\n\r\ngood society prevails.  Apart from the need to reach  out\r\n\r\nto  one another and to strengthen our social cohesion and\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding,  it  is  also  necessary  for  us  to\r\n\r\nencourage  good  behaviour and  contributions  from  each\r\n\r\nother.   By  expanding  our  common  space  through   the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of the adoption of healthy common  values,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  respect  for diversity,  a  commitment  to\r\n\r\nsecuring peace and harmony for Singapore, a determination\r\n\r\nto build a strong economy, a desire to provide assistance\r\n\r\nto  the weaker members of society, and to provide a  safe\r\n\r\nand  secure  environment,  all Singaporeans  will  surely\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the good society.  It is by ensuring  that\r\n\r\nwe  all,  Muslims and non-Muslims, work together  towards\r\n\r\nthe  common  good  that  we can  ensure  a  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nharmonious, cohesive and resilient Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the threat of terrorism is a complex challenge.\r\n\r\nOur  efforts  at strengthening our social  cohesion  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  renewed vigour and focus.  Everyone  must\r\n\r\nunderstand that he or she has a role to play,  be  it  in\r\n\r\nschools,  workplaces, recreational centres, and  even  in\r\n\r\nplaces of worship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also argue that the solution to this\r\n\r\nproblem lies more in the hands of those with the power to\r\n\r\neffect meaningful change.  Those in leadership positions,\r\n\r\nin  whichever  organisations or  institutions  that  they\r\n\r\nbelong  to,  play  a  key  role  in  this  fight  against\r\n\r\nterrorism.  If we fail to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiagnose  and understand this phenomenon correctly,  then\r\n\r\nwe   risk  the  well-being  of  our  nation.   Simplistic\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the global terrorism threat  and  distorted\r\n\r\nviews of history and of contemporary Muslim societies and\r\n\r\ncountries  serve  only to confuse and detract  from  real\r\n\r\nunderstanding.   Fashionable  ideas  of  the   clash   of\r\n\r\ndifferent religious communities as the outcome of  modern\r\n\r\nhistory   are  no  different  from  the  views   of   the\r\n\r\nfundamentalists  who divide the world into  two  opposing\r\n\r\nethical  communities.   Such ideas  give  fodder  to  the\r\n\r\nfundamentalist mind.  We should not give space  for  such\r\n\r\nideas here in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Government  fought  the  Communists  and   the\r\n\r\ncommunalists,  it was the call to, and  support  for,  of\r\n\r\nthose within the Chinese community who were committed  to\r\n\r\nthe idea of a modern and multi-racial Singapore, to stand\r\n\r\nup  against  such  elements, that  helped  win  the  day.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, today we should give notice to those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared   to   use  religious  sentiments   to   provoke\r\n\r\nresentment  towards the State or any  other  group,  that\r\n\r\nthey  will suffer the wrath of the people and the  State.\r\n\r\nSuch  elements  are  destructive to  our  nation-building\r\n\r\neffort  and should never be allowed to grow.   Space  and\r\n\r\nsupport  should be given to the progressive  elements  in\r\n\r\nthe Malay/Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a struggle for the hearts and minds of our\r\n\r\npeople.  The path of moderation and tolerance is the only\r\n\r\nway  for Singapore to survive as a nation.  Terror of any\r\n\r\nkind,  and  carried out by any group,  will  bring  great\r\n\r\nharm.  We must engender in our people the spirit that  is\r\n\r\nconstructive towards our nation building effort.  This is\r\n\r\nthe  spirit that was seen in Whampoa recently when a fire\r\n\r\nbroke  out  near a lift-landing and a couple was  trapped\r\n\r\ninside  the lift.  A Malay family living closest  to  the\r\n\r\nlift-landing  rallied  other  neighbours  to  assist  the\r\n\r\ncouple.  It was the same spirit that drove my late father\r\n\r\nand  other  villagers, both Chinese and Malays,  to  form\r\n\r\nwatch  groups  to  protect our kampong  during  the  1964\r\n\r\nriots.   It is this spirit that supports the common  good\r\n\r\nthat is needed now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise in support of the motion in the name of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore has\r\n\r\ntravelled   a  long  way.   We  have  witnessed   several\r\n\r\nmilestones  in  its development as the community  becomes\r\n\r\nincreasingly  educated and economically  stronger.   Even\r\n\r\nthough  the  JI  is  not  representative  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore, their arrests and the threat that\r\n\r\nwas  posed  sets us back many years, and this saddens  me\r\n\r\ntremendously.   While I do not defend  what  took  place,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  a sense of responsibility  arises.   Their\r\n\r\nactions have hijacked the community and at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, the Muslims cannot help but feel victimised.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.31 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just yesterday, over the radio on the BBC news\r\n\r\nprogramme World Today, there was this gentleman  who  was\r\n\r\nlamenting  that the developing and third world  countries\r\n\r\nare feeling the impact of uncertainty in security and the\r\n\r\nthreat  of terrorism.  He claimed that the resources  and\r\n\r\nattention  towards  voluntary service organisations  that\r\n\r\noperate in these countries are dwindling significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we can see that the victims also include the\r\n\r\nimpoverished nations of the world.  The world cannot seem\r\n\r\nto  run  away from the dollars and cents, and we can  see\r\n\r\nthe  economic  ramifications of  the  way  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  threat has been dealt so far.  Let us  honestly\r\n\r\nlook  at  the state of the world today.  Heads of states,\r\n\r\nespecially  America,  and numerous  other  countries  and\r\n\r\norganisations are spending huge amounts of  resources  in\r\n\r\nthis  area.  Since funds are limited, then logically  the\r\n\r\nequation of opportunity cost arises.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthreat  of terrorism is real and is being felt  all  over\r\n\r\nthe world.  The fact that we are spending time and effort\r\n\r\nto debate this issue in this Parliament also reflects the\r\n\r\nimportance  and  urgency of the matter.  Nevertheless,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  but  ponder  upon  and calculate  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nresources in terms of finance, manpower and time that the\r\n\r\nworld is dispensing to tackle this issue.  I am not quite\r\n\r\nsure  how  one  can  justify pouring  sinful  amounts  of\r\n\r\nresources and funds in the area of security threat at the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  starving  children  and  millions  who   are\r\n\r\njobless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources are being rechanelled and the pinch is\r\n\r\nbeing felt by developing countries that require aid.  Let\r\n\r\nus  not  forget  that  the world is still  divided  among\r\n\r\neconomic   lines.   Though  it  is  important   that   we\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  vital  it is to  tackle  the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  it is similarly sad that the developed  world\r\n\r\nis  now  pre-occupied with this threat, to a  point  that\r\n\r\nmany  other issues are put in the back-burner.  Thus,  to\r\n\r\nput  it  simply,  there are many victims of  the  present\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs that was brought about after terrorism\r\n\r\nbecame  a  globalised phenomenon.  Maybe we cannot  blame\r\n\r\nthe  pre-occupation of the world leaders to minimise  the\r\n\r\nthreat of terrorism, but we should not expect the goal of\r\n\r\nstamping  out terrorists to be a universal goal,  knowing\r\n\r\nvery well that other equally urgent problems lay upon us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may feel somewhat unsettled with the release of\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper.  The issues of terrorism and Islam have\r\n\r\nreceived  extensive  coverage  since  the  September   11\r\n\r\nattack.  Many Muslims were put on the defensive.  Just as\r\n\r\nthe  attention wanes with the coming of the new year, the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper surfaces and once again putting the Malays in\r\n\r\nSingapore in an uncomfortable spotlight.  This may be the\r\n\r\nperception of some but, to them, I say this is  certainly\r\n\r\nnot  the  case.   The White Paper did precisely  what  it\r\n\r\nintended to do, and that is to put the JI issue  and  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  terrorism in perspective.  The JI  terrorists\r\n\r\nhave  been singled out as a deviant group, and  one  that\r\n\r\nthe majority of Singaporean Muslims completely reject and\r\n\r\ndenounce.  The White Paper contained information\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat needed to be shared with the nation.  It was, indeed\r\n\r\neducational, to say the least.  It explained the  arrests\r\n\r\nand how the threat was effectively dealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, history reveals to us how many\r\n\r\nhave  committed great crimes against humanity in the name\r\n\r\nof  political ideology or belief system.  The  systematic\r\n\r\ncampaign  of  extermination of  people  carried  by  Nazi\r\n\r\nGermany,  the  Cambodian genocide of 1975-79,  Catholics'\r\n\r\nand Protestants' troubles in Northern Ireland, Israel and\r\n\r\nArab conflicts in the Middle East and, more recently,  in\r\n\r\nEast  Timor,  Guatemala, Yugoslavia  and  Rwanda,  having\r\n\r\nproven how one can combine extremist ideology with ethnic\r\n\r\nanimosity  and a diabolical disregard for human  life  to\r\n\r\nproduce repression, misery and murder on a massive scale.\r\n\r\nIt  is indeed tragic when something as revered and sacred\r\n\r\nas  religion  is  used  as  a scapegoat.   We  have  just\r\n\r\nwitnessed  how its pure preachings can be manipulated  to\r\n\r\nserve one's own hidden agenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JI's heinous plans and the would-be consequences are\r\n\r\nharrowing, to say the least, for all Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nboth Muslims and non-Muslims.  The group, though small in\r\n\r\nnumber,   poses  a  national  threat.   The  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  must  take  concrete steps  to  police  itself\r\n\r\nagainst  the spread of terrorists and extremist  ideology\r\n\r\nthrough  religious teachings.  It is clear that the  onus\r\n\r\nis  on  every one of us to convince the rest that we  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  threat.  That we are part and parcel of the  same\r\n\r\ncommunity.   We  do not feel that we are exclusive.   But\r\n\r\nhow do we give off the right signal?  Given the fact that\r\n\r\npublic  opinion is shaped more by television,  radio  and\r\n\r\nfilm,  than anything else, and sad to say, generally  the\r\n\r\nmedia  shows  negative  images of  Islam,  the  challenge\r\n\r\nbecomes  more  daunting.   We  must  all  become   active\r\n\r\nparticipants  and  not  mere observers  and  hoping  that\r\n\r\nsomeone  else will do all the work for us.   If  this  is\r\n\r\nabout defining and projecting a positive identity of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  then the responsibility rests on all  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also highlighted the importance of\r\n\r\npreserving harmony with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe vast majority of Singapore Muslims who practise their\r\n\r\nreligion peacefully and are generally law-abiding.   This\r\n\r\ncategory  must not be made to feel awkward or  apologetic\r\n\r\nfor  being  Muslims, nor made to sacrifice the principles\r\n\r\nfor  the sake of acceptance.  They have harmed no one and\r\n\r\nmust  be  given the basic respect any fellow human  being\r\n\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all that has taken place, let us not lose\r\n\r\nsight  of  the grander scheme of things, and that  is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  building  and  developing  the  skills  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity to face the many challenges ahead of  us.   The\r\n\r\nneed   to   improve  knowledge-based  skills  and   other\r\n\r\ncompetencies  all  require serious  attention.   We  must\r\n\r\nremain  committed  and  focused on  the  bigger  picture.\r\n\r\nDuring an economic downturn, such as the one that we  had\r\n\r\nrecently,  the lower skilled and lower income groups  are\r\n\r\nbadly hit.  Statistics have shown that the impact on  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community is quite significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not marginalising the importance of other\r\n\r\nissues  pertaining to the community, an urgent  challenge\r\n\r\nthat   has  far-reaching  consequences  is  the  academic\r\n\r\nachievement  and  the  economic  standing  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity.  The means of a livelihood is critical.  While\r\n\r\nwe  acknowledge that a growing number has done  well  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  the community must realise  that  it  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to sit on its laurels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Malay/Muslim community has\r\n\r\nmade  lots of progress over the past 30 years.  This  was\r\n\r\nclearly shown in the recent release of study conducted on\r\n\r\nthe  progress of the community.  But we still have a long\r\n\r\nway to go.  We should put our efforts together to further\r\n\r\nimprove  the  academic achievements of our students.   We\r\n\r\nmust  imbibe  in our young the value and the  concept  of\r\n\r\nexcellence in their daily life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community has benefitted from the system of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  and  it  has  made  us  stronger  and   more\r\n\r\nresilient.   I believe that we would not have arrived  at\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are  today,  that is being proud  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nstanding tall as equal among the other races, if  we  had\r\n\r\naccepted tokenism and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharity.  Yes, there are more things to achieve.  Yes, we\r\n\r\nare still lagging behind in some areas, but we should not\r\n\r\ndespair.   We  should,  and will continue,  to  work  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  the community and improve the community for  the\r\n\r\ngood of not only the Malays but for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, there is still a long way to go\r\n\r\nin  terms  of creating awareness among the people.   They\r\n\r\nmust  be  made to see that social mobility is a way  out.\r\n\r\nThey   must   be   flexible   and   adapt   to   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   They  must be willing  to  pick  up  new\r\n\r\nskills, explore new industries and areas.  The jobs  that\r\n\r\nare  typically held by Malays in the production line, for\r\n\r\nexample,  are  vulnerable to down-sizing when  the  going\r\n\r\ngets tough.  The changing paradigm takes time and efforts\r\n\r\nmust begin now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would sincerely like to thank\r\n\r\nthe community leaders and religious leaders of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity, among others, from MUIS and Pergas,  who  have\r\n\r\ncome  forward and clearly registered their stand  on  the\r\n\r\nissue of terrorism.  They have unanimously spoken against\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  violence in the name of Islam.   They  have\r\n\r\ndenounced  this unacceptable tenet.  This will  certainly\r\n\r\nallay any fear or anxieties that may still linger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often asked myself this question: where is\r\n\r\nthe  kampong  spirit of the 60s and 70s that was  earlier\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  Dr  Yaacob?  Do  people  smile  easily  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  No, I do not think so.  Do we often hear  the\r\n\r\n\"thank  you\"  and  the \"please\"?  Just the  other  day  a\r\n\r\nforeigner who has been working here for two years related\r\n\r\nto  me how many times he bent to pick up a dropped ticket\r\n\r\nor  handphone, but never received a thank you, and how he\r\n\r\noften  witnessed  an elderly or an expectant  lady  being\r\n\r\nmade  to  stand  in the MRT train, because  no  seat  was\r\n\r\noffered  to  that  individual.   Does  this  sound   very\r\n\r\nfamiliar?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nation progresses, how did something as\r\n\r\nfundamental as being a compassionate and kind human being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nerode?   Often, being rude and cold is mistaken to  being\r\n\r\nefficient,  sophisticated  and  successful.   This  is  a\r\n\r\ngrotesque equation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is success? Bill Clinton profoundly explained\r\n\r\nthat \"Getting what you want is not really success.  Doing\r\n\r\nthe  right thing with what you have is.  True success  is\r\n\r\nabout  relating to other people until your time runs  out\r\n\r\non earth.  The most important thing in life is just being\r\n\r\na human being.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we know of Singaporeans who would never\r\n\r\ngreet their neighbours, even as they share the same lift,\r\n\r\nfeeling  of suspicion lurks beneath.  Why should  wearing\r\n\r\nthe  sarong mean asserting one's ethnic roots?  For  fear\r\n\r\nof  our  own safety, we so quickly group people according\r\n\r\nto visible references, eg, a bearded man or a man wearing\r\n\r\na  turban.  What happens if the next terrorist attack  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by a group of people wearing casual  shirts\r\n\r\nand pants?  Do we then have to go around without anything\r\n\r\nat all?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us back to the question: do we all need\r\n\r\nto  dress  alike to forge mutual respect?   We  recognise\r\n\r\nthat each Singaporean has the right and the privilege  to\r\n\r\nbe different.  This is the basis of our humanity.  Let us\r\n\r\nnot  judge  and jump to conclusions from one's  look  but\r\n\r\nrather  by  his or her actions.  I believe the  key  word\r\n\r\nhere  is  \"respect\".  Respect for others  does  not  mean\r\n\r\nhaving  to  conform to their belief systems or practices,\r\n\r\nbut  a  greater  sensitivity and an acceptance  of  these\r\n\r\ndifferences.   In  fact, in the past, we have  celebrated\r\n\r\nour  differences and remain one united Singapore.  We can\r\n\r\nlearn from our past forefathers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to emphasise the\r\n\r\nrecommendations put forth in the White Paper, and that is\r\n\r\nwith  psychological strength and mutual respect terrorism\r\n\r\ncan never take root here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  stand to support the motion by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs regarding the threat of terrorism.   I\r\n\r\nsupport the statement that it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  for us to accept that the terrorist threat  at\r\n\r\npresent,  especially from the Jemaah Islamiyah group,  is\r\n\r\nreal  and we support the actions that have been taken  by\r\n\r\nthe Government against the group and any other groups  in\r\n\r\nthis  region  that can pose a threat to the  security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any doubts on the action taken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  detain the members of the  JI  under  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Act, the Bali bomb incident has  opened\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of the people of Singapore that terrorism  can\r\n\r\nhappen  anywhere, including our country.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community also feels likewise.  If there are\r\n\r\nstill those from any group in Singapore, especially  from\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim  community on  the  JI  threat  towards\r\n\r\nnational  security and with that the safety of themselves\r\n\r\nand  their  own family, I hope they will read  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  which  we  are discussing now.  Read  the  actions\r\n\r\ntaken by Malaysia and Indonesia to counter terrorism.  In\r\n\r\nshort, the action taken by the Government is not directed\r\n\r\ntowards  the  Malay/Muslim community,  and  it  does  not\r\n\r\nintend   to  put  the  Malay/Muslim  community   in   the\r\n\r\nspotlight.   The reactions of the Malay/Muslim  community\r\n\r\nand  religious leaders who are against terrorism  and  JI\r\n\r\nhave  shown  that the Malay/Muslim community too  desires\r\n\r\npeace  in the pursuit of progress together.  However,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  discuss  this issue because of the  significant\r\n\r\nthreat  posed  by this group against the welfare  of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  the  survival  of  Singapore,  and   this\r\n\r\nincludes the Malay/Muslim community as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the extensive and tight security measures\r\n\r\ntaken by the Government, the community in general has  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  to play to ensure that  these  terrorist\r\n\r\nelements do not take root and expand in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nhas  been  suggested by many Members of Parliament  since\r\n\r\nyesterday  and  should be undertaken by the  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity and the non-Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by Mr Shanmugam, all parties should self-examine the inter-racial and inter-religious ties.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the Malay/Muslim community should reassess its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninternal  relationships,  realign  their  priorities  and\r\n\r\nenhance  their  religious practices in  ways  that  could\r\n\r\nimprove their well-being in this plural society.  To  me,\r\n\r\nthe proposal for getting Malay/Muslim bodies in Singapore\r\n\r\nsuch  as  MUIS,  MENDAKI and PERGAS to  be  an  important\r\n\r\nmachinery  to reinforce the community's defences  against\r\n\r\ndeviant   practices  and  teachings   is   an   important\r\n\r\ninitiative to avoid potential disaster in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the leaders of the community is to\r\n\r\nreach  a consensus on matters which can improve the well-being  of  the Malay/Muslim community and,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  to  ensure that Singapore has continued peace  and\r\n\r\nprogress.   But there are groups who have doubts  on  the\r\n\r\nlegitimacy of the detention of the JI.  Luckily, they are\r\n\r\nsmall in number.  Community leaders should identify these\r\n\r\ngroups that could bring confusion to the community and to\r\n\r\ncorrect such views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep introspection should be done by the community\r\n\r\nleaders   themselves  with  respect  to   its   religious\r\n\r\npractices  and views.  I am attracted by the exchange  of\r\n\r\nviews  between  PERGAS and the Institute  of  South  East\r\n\r\nAsian  Studies  (ISEAS), in what PERGAS feels  as  \"views\r\n\r\nthat will bring about confusion, and could be questioned,\r\n\r\nthat  could  harm the faith and practices of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity\".   This is in respect of a forum organised  by\r\n\r\nISEAS  recently.  I am not sure what these specific views\r\n\r\nraised  by PERGAS that could harm the faith of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity are.  If it is true and proven, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant for ISEAS not to repeat it again in the future.\r\n\r\nBut  if  it is on differences of opinion, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  of the Malay/Muslim community should  allow\r\n\r\nand  discuss  it  in the spirit of introspection  I  have\r\n\r\ntalked  about.  This discussion should be done among  the\r\n\r\nleaders of the Malay/Muslim community themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, in which 90% of its people are\r\n\r\nMuslims, the tradition of debating religious matters  has\r\n\r\nexisted  within acceptable norms.  I suggest we read  the\r\n\r\narticle  written by our former Singapore's Ambassador  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Mr Barry Desker, entitled \"Islam and  Society\r\n\r\nin South-East\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsia  after 11th September\", which was published  in  the\r\n\r\nAustralian Journal of International Affairs to have  some\r\n\r\nidea about the tradition of debate on religious matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this discussion could ensure that the Muslims do\r\n\r\nnot  see Islamic practices from a narrow perspective  was\r\n\r\ndiscussed in the article.  It reflects tolerance  towards\r\n\r\ndifferent views in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the views of the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nand  non-Muslim  leaders who give their  support  to  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community here after the September 11 incident and\r\n\r\nthe  detention  of the JI members.  But I would  like  to\r\n\r\nremind  them  to be concerned about the feelings  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community.  This is not the time for  us  to\r\n\r\npoint  fingers  or apportion the blame  on  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nparticipation  from  the  Malay community  on  grassroots\r\n\r\nactivities.   On the other hand, we should find  ways  to\r\n\r\nincrease the involvement and participation of all  races,\r\n\r\nincluding the Malay/Muslim community, in our activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also avoid saying that the increased\r\n\r\nreligiosity  among  the Malay/Muslim community  had  made\r\n\r\nthem  become more fundamental.  In this respect, I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Sin Boon Ann on the need to practise moderation\r\n\r\namong the Muslim community.  In fact, I would like to add\r\n\r\nthat  moderation should be the practice of all religions.\r\n\r\nBut it is not right to say that social cohesion cannot be\r\n\r\nachieved within the moderate Islamic context if only  the\r\n\r\nmosques  here  become  the  focal  point  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, a conservative practice of\r\n\r\nreligion only cannot lead to an isolationist attitude, it\r\n\r\nhas  also  not  led  to  the formation  of  transnational\r\n\r\nterrorist networks.  What is important for us to do is to\r\n\r\nattract more Muslim followers who frequent the mosque  to\r\n\r\ncome  together  to participate in social activities  that\r\n\r\ncould  promote  understanding and  solidarity.   In  this\r\n\r\naspect, we should continue to attract all communities  to\r\n\r\ninteract with one another at the grassroots level.  I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naddressing  this to all groups because, generally,  those\r\n\r\nwho   participate  in  social  activities  or  grassroots\r\n\r\nactivities  are  from the same group of people  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken part in grassroots activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I agree with Mr Tan Tarn How, the writer\r\n\r\nof  the  column  \"From  the Gallery\",  published  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times today, that finger-pointing is not the best\r\n\r\nthing to do at this moment.  However, I disagree with  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  with  respect  to  self-examination,  which  he  had\r\n\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan concluded from the speeches of Mr Shanmugam\r\n\r\nand  Mr Low Thia Khiang that the JI members who have been\r\n\r\ndetained   are  from  those  who  felt  they  have   been\r\n\r\ndiscriminated,  that their religion has  been  suppressed\r\n\r\nand  they  have  been marginalised.  Mr Tan  raised  more\r\n\r\nquestions than answers.  But to me, the answer is  clear.\r\n\r\nThe  members of JI who have been detained are from  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  a  total and unquestioned obedience  to  their\r\n\r\nteachers,  which include the foreign teachers who  taught\r\n\r\nthem to achieve their goal of setting up an Islamic State\r\n\r\neven  if  it has to be done  through violent means  which\r\n\r\nthey  thought are the teachings of Islam.  This is proven\r\n\r\nby  the findings of psychologists who interviewed the  JI\r\n\r\nmembers,  who said that they will be treated as  infidels\r\n\r\nif  they  go  against their oath of allegiance  to  their\r\n\r\nreligious leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their educational level is the cause of their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction, then we could conclude  that  more  than\r\n\r\nhalf of the Singapore population from all communities who\r\n\r\ndo  not  have the level of education up to the   GCE  `O'\r\n\r\nlevels  would be seen as potential terrorists.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause they have the same level of education as half  of\r\n\r\nthe  members  of  JI  who  are  detained.   Likewise,  if\r\n\r\nreligious  education  is said to  be  the  cause  of  the\r\n\r\nevolvement of the JI members, then it could be  concluded\r\n\r\nthat  most  Muslim  Singaporeans, who  form  15%  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore population, are also potential terrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a right analysis. In fact, it is not\r\n\r\nthe  reality  here. Most Malays and Muslim  families  are\r\n\r\nmoderate.  This  is  evident from  the  joint  statements\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Malay/Muslim community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  religious leaders in Singapore which  oppose  JI  or\r\n\r\nterrorism.  These community and religious leaders want to\r\n\r\nensure  that  this spirit of moderation and rejection  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  and violence will continue to exist among  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Shanmugam's view regarding the need to\r\n\r\ngive motivation to the Malay/Muslim community here, which\r\n\r\nhas  been described as a modified affirmative action,  is\r\n\r\ninteresting.  I believe this is not what the Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  want.  They want to be proud of  the  progress\r\n\r\nthey  have  made on their own ability in this competitive\r\n\r\nsociety.  I think self-confidence is hard to assess.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  important  to  the  pride  and  identity  of  any\r\n\r\ncommunity,  including the Malay/Muslim  community.   They\r\n\r\nhave  progressed  year  by year in  terms  of  education,\r\n\r\noccupation, housing, etc.  The Malay/Muslim community has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  build modern mosques and  also  propagate\r\n\r\nIslam  in  this  plural community.  I  am  confident  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  community will continue  to  progress  with\r\n\r\npride.  They want to be independent and be seen as equals\r\n\r\nwithout  support from the Government.  They will be  able\r\n\r\nto achieve more if they practise tolerance and moderation\r\n\r\nin  their religious and cultural practices in this plural\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to touch on\r\n\r\ninstilling  tolerance, solidarity and to have  confidence\r\n\r\nin  one another among our students of different races  in\r\n\r\nschool.   At least three Members - Assoc. Prof. Chin  Tet\r\n\r\nYung,  Mrs  Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Steve Chia - have  talked\r\n\r\nabout this.  I would like to give my assurances that  the\r\n\r\nschools have taught them the best, be it in classrooms as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in their extra-curricular activities or through\r\n\r\ntheir   academic  curriculum.   There  are   a   lot   of\r\n\r\nopportunities   for  our  students  to  interact,   build\r\n\r\nfriendships, learn to be tolerant and respect one another\r\n\r\nthrough classroom activities, ECA and project work.  This\r\n\r\nyear,  more  new initiatives will be carried out  in  the\r\n\r\nschools  in order to bring about social cohesion.   I  am\r\n\r\nproud  that this debate on social cohesion has  given  us\r\n\r\nanother  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  community   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But we can achieve it only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  we  are open, moderate and ready to tolerate  without\r\n\r\nhaving to affect our religious practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Opposition Members also give their\r\n\r\nsupport to this White Paper today.  But I found that some\r\n\r\nof  them are still trying to gain political mileage.   Of\r\n\r\nthe  things  that was brought forward by  PERGAS  in  its\r\n\r\npress statement, Mr Steve Chia quoted one paragraph,  and\r\n\r\nthat is, \"We are worried that side issues important to  a\r\n\r\nparticular  group  because of  their  religion,  are  not\r\n\r\nreceiving due attention.\"  Mr Chia added, \"In particular,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should stop questioning the  loyalty  of\r\n\r\nMalays  in Singapore.\"  Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  question what had been said by Mr Chia.   He  advised\r\n\r\nall  levels  to  concentrate on bigger issues  than  side\r\n\r\nissues  which could affect the survival of Singapore  and\r\n\r\ntheir own well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any minority group in any country, the practice\r\n\r\nof  moderation in a secular country would guarantee  that\r\n\r\nthey would be able to practise their religion and culture\r\n\r\nwithout  hindrance.   The  loyalty  of  the  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nshould  not be a question and should not be an  issue  in\r\n\r\nour debate today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to state that we would be able\r\n\r\nto  achieve  more as a united country, provided  all  the\r\n\r\ncommunities  together  preserve  what  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have\r\n\r\nyour  permission  to  clarify because  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary has referred to my speech yesterday?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, you can seek your\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I want to clarify that I was\r\n\r\nnot  referring to the arrest of JI members for the reason\r\n\r\nthat  they  might feel discontentment in the society.

We\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  very  clear about whether  these  are  side\r\n\r\nissues, or whether these are integral issues, that affect\r\n\r\nthe community as a whole.  I think there are issues which\r\n\r\nare peripheral and we should continue to put these issues\r\n\r\nin  the periphery of our attention.  But if we focus  our\r\n\r\nattention on the wrong matters, then we will not be  able\r\n\r\nto focus on matters that could enhance cohesion, not just\r\n\r\namong  races, but between the people and the  leaders  of\r\n\r\ndifferent levels in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

I have the confidence\r\n\r\nthat  with  the strong appeal by the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nconcerted  efforts of Singaporeans, our Malay compatriots\r\n\r\ncan also overcome the present predicament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, when the Minister was talking about the\r\n\r\ninconveniences suffered by the Chinese-educated  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  it  stirred up my memory of all those  restriction\r\n\r\norders,  banned books, banned movies, banned songs,  etc.\r\n\r\nBit  by bit, the world map then was being painted red  -- the  Soviet Union was red, China was red, and many  other\r\n\r\ncountries were turning red. It was feared then  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  world was turning red, but it turns out  now  that\r\n\r\nthe  real world is technicolour. It will not turn totally\r\n\r\ngreen as the terrorists would want it to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present-day terrorism is global and borderless.\r\n\r\nIn  the past, when technology and transportation were not\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvanced,  the  communists then and  terrorists  now  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  The  communists at that time were  localised,\r\n\r\nand  not  cross-bordered. That was why we  had  then  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communists,   the  Vietnamese  Communists,   the\r\n\r\nIndian  Communists, the Burmese Communists,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nCommunists   and   so  on.   There  were   no   Singapore\r\n\r\nCommunists,  because Singapore and Malaya were  one  same\r\n\r\nterritory at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the new economy, terrorism has been brought to\r\n\r\na  higher  plane by    the development in technology  and\r\n\r\ntransportation.  They have become global and  borderless.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the JI members would have to take years before\r\n\r\nthey  could  go  to  Afghanistan and back.  In  the  Tang\r\n\r\nDynasty, when the High Priest Tipitaka went from China to\r\n\r\nIndia to get the sutra, he met with a lot of difficulties\r\n\r\nand  danger. If not for his three skilful and resourceful\r\n\r\ndisciples  who  were  armed with supernatural  power,  he\r\n\r\nwould not have succeeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Government's recommendations in the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper for a three-fold counter measures against the\r\n\r\nterrorist  threat: (1) Enhancing security  measures;  (2)\r\n\r\nPolicing  the spread of terrorist and extremist ideology;\r\n\r\nand  (3)  Strengthening  social  cohesion  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to present my view on enhancing\r\n\r\nsecurity and strengthening unity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In enhancing security, the problem we have is that\r\n\r\nthe  sense of crisis of our people is not strong  enough.\r\n\r\nLet  me  illustrate:  In order to enhance  security,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  has put up barricade at night-spots to  be  ready\r\n\r\nfor  all eventualities.   But, we receive complaints from\r\n\r\nthe  business  community  that this  has  affected  their\r\n\r\nbusiness. Some feel that they are being inconvenienced as\r\n\r\nparking  was made difficult. No doubt, we want  business,\r\n\r\nbut  do  they  want  their lives?   We  want  to  counter\r\n\r\nterrorism,  and we need also to prevent terrorism.   Only\r\n\r\nthen can we be safe and sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the SIA's $288 package to Bali\r\n\r\nattracted more than 20,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  during  the  school holiday  month.   SIA's  Bali\r\n\r\npackage  was our show of support for Indonesia.  It  also\r\n\r\nserved  to  boost  the  outside  world's  confidence   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Why did so many people want to go  to  Bali?\r\n\r\nSome  people  told me that the most dangerous  place  was\r\n\r\nactually the safest place. However, there were only  some\r\n\r\nwho  thought  that many people went there simply  because\r\n\r\nBali  was  the cheapest destination.  We could visit  the\r\n\r\nplace, but the question is with what frame of mind do  we\r\n\r\ngo  there.  In my view, we can visit Bali to support  its\r\n\r\ntourism industry, and at the same time to appreciate  the\r\n\r\ndanger  of terrorism. This is killing two birds with  one\r\n\r\nstone. We should not be going there simply because it  is\r\n\r\n\"cheap, cheap\"!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance unity among the various ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups,   the IRCC and Harmony Circles should place  more\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  dispelling the mutual suspicion  among  the\r\n\r\ncommunities. The mutual visits to the places  of  worship\r\n\r\nis  just a warming-up exercise.  What we should really do\r\n\r\nis  to  cultivate the spirit of comrade-in-arms  to  face\r\n\r\ndifficulties togther, and not to suspect each other  when\r\n\r\nproblems arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small debate between the Member for\r\n\r\nHougang  and  Mr  Hawazi.  There was some complaint  that\r\n\r\nsome   Chinese  employers  persisted  in  employing  only\r\n\r\nworkers  who  could  speak Mandarin.  From  the  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions  I  conducted for the Feedback Unit, I  observed\r\n\r\nthat  employers  were  more concerned  with  the  working\r\n\r\ncapability of the workers during the recruitment  process\r\n\r\nthan  the colour of their skin.  If the ability to  speak\r\n\r\nMandarin  is a necessity for the job, it would  naturally\r\n\r\nbecome a pre-requisite that the successful applicant must\r\n\r\nspeak   Mandarin.  As  such,  I  would  urge  our   Malay\r\n\r\ncompatriots to learn Mandarin as a kind of skill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. I know of a Malay\r\n\r\nworker in Koh Brothers Limited, whose father was also  an\r\n\r\nemployee there. His boss is a Chinese and they get  along\r\n\r\nvery  well.  The Chinese boss would speak  Malay  to  the\r\n\r\nMalay employee,  and the Malay employee would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspeak to his Chinese boss in Teochew.  I asked him how he\r\n\r\npicked  up Teochew and whether it was hard to learn.   He\r\n\r\nreplied to me in  Teochew, \"Tieh gu jiu wei (Listen  more\r\n\r\nand  you  will  know)!\"  I think we should look  at  this\r\n\r\nmatter in this light, then there should be no problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is my recent visit to Turkey. I was\r\n\r\nvisiting  the bazaar  in Istanbul when a shopkeeper  came\r\n\r\nup  to  me  and spoke to me smilingly in Mandarin,  \"Huan\r\n\r\nying,  huan ying! Qing jin lai canguan (Welcome, welcome.\r\n\r\nPlease  come in and look around)!  Hen pianyi, hen pianyi\r\n\r\n(Very cheap, very cheap)!\"  In the past, whenever I  went\r\n\r\noverseas,  especially in Europe and the United States,  I\r\n\r\nwould  be taken as a Japanese, and the shopkeepers  would\r\n\r\ngreet  me \"Irashaimase (Welcome)\" in Japanese.  Nowadays,\r\n\r\nthere are lots of Mainland Chinese tourists visiting Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  European and Asian countries, including Singapore,\r\n\r\nand they are big spenders. So now, I am being looked upon\r\n\r\nas a Chinese.  These are market forces!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, jobs are hard to come by, and this is due\r\n\r\nto  recession, coupled with the fact that many  companies\r\n\r\nare  relocating  and  many jobs  were  lost.   Our  Malay\r\n\r\ncompatriots  have  problem  finding  jobs,  so  have  the\r\n\r\nMandarin-speaking  Chinese compatriots!     This  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   We  should look at the problem in  the  proper\r\n\r\nprospective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I suggest we enhance the unity among our\r\n\r\nvarious   ethnic   groups   by   clarifying   all   these\r\n\r\nmisconceptions  to avoid mutual suspicion  and  mistrust.\r\n\r\nThat is the important thing to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI would like to speak in support of the motion from three\r\n\r\naspects, namely, why the need for a White Paper on the JI\r\n\r\nthreat,  the White Paper itself and what are the  desired\r\n\r\nresponses to the Singapore society to the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having to put the spotlight once again on\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community, I believe it is timely  that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper was released.  I say so because the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities in Singapore have quite different perceptions\r\n\r\nregarding  the  JI threat.  This has become  quite  clear\r\n\r\nfrom  the  feedback  received by the Feedback  Unit.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  over  the  past  week,  the  Feedback   Unit\r\n\r\nconducted  three  dialogue  sessions  with  the   various\r\n\r\ncommunities, specifically on this White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share some of the findings with the House\r\n\r\nwhich,  I believe, are quite representative.  Some people\r\n\r\nperceived that the terrorist threat to Singapore at  this\r\n\r\npoint  in time to be quite minimal as the Government  has\r\n\r\nbroken the back of the JI organisation and has taken  all\r\n\r\nthe  necessary precautions.  As a result, they  are  more\r\n\r\nthan happy to leave it to the Government to deal with the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore as a target for terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks,  they  believe that, being a  hard  target,  the\r\n\r\nterrorist would choose other easier ones, as demonstrated\r\n\r\nby  what happened when the JI carried out the October  12\r\n\r\nbombing  in  Bali.  To them, as long as there are  easier\r\n\r\ntargets around, Singapore will be safe, and will be lower\r\n\r\ndown the list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other end of the scale, others think that\r\n\r\nSingapore, being an icon of modernity and being indeed  a\r\n\r\nhard   nut   to  crack,  would  make  it  all  the   more\r\n\r\nattractive,  as the psychological impact of a  successful\r\n\r\nstrike  would  be  all  the  more  greater.   After  all,\r\n\r\nterrorism feeds on publicity of the greatest suffering of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings.  The more audacious the target, the higher\r\n\r\nthe number of casualties, the greater is the value of the\r\n\r\ntarget.  Most Singaporeans feel that the Government has a\r\n\r\nhandle on the threat and, therefore, they do not need  to\r\n\r\nbe  personally involved.  Life goes on as per normal.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Police and ISD do their jobs properly, then  all  is\r\n\r\nwell.   I  believe the White Paper, by going  into  great\r\n\r\ndetails, will educate those who hold such views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe we are not facing up\r\n\r\nto the truth if I do not point\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout that from the feedback received by the Feedback Unit,\r\n\r\nthere  are  segments  in the Muslim  community  who  feel\r\n\r\nsympathy for the JI members.  Some even expressed  doubts\r\n\r\nabout  the  Government's case against the JI.  While  all\r\n\r\nMuslims  reject  the violent means advocated  by  the  JI\r\n\r\nbrotherhood,  many  could not reconcile  with  themselves\r\n\r\nthat  the JI members are bad Muslims.  Since Muslims  are\r\n\r\ntaught  from  young to defend themselves  when  they  are\r\n\r\noppressed,  many  Muslims felt that the JI  members  were\r\n\r\njust  carrying out their Muslim duties when  they  joined\r\n\r\nthe JI in the defence of Islam.  Of course, in this case,\r\n\r\nthey  are not rising to the defence of Islam in Singapore\r\n\r\nbut   to  the  suffering  of  Muslims  elsewhere  at  the\r\n\r\noppression of the western world.  Hopefully, the  details\r\n\r\nof  the  White  Paper would convince these Muslims  that,\r\n\r\nindeed,  JI members are misled Muslims and had  been  led\r\n\r\nastray by false religious teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to point out to the House,\r\n\r\nespecially  to Mr K Shanmugam and Mr Low Thia Khiang,  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  all  the  feedback  collected  from  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity, either in open and free dialogue or  anonymous\r\n\r\nsurveys, no one has asserted that the social and economic\r\n\r\nconditions   of   the   Malay  community   in   Singapore\r\n\r\ncontributed   to  the  increasing  religiosity   of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  I am, in fact, very disturbed by Mr Tan  Tarn\r\n\r\nHow's  article  in  the  Straits  Times  which  questions\r\n\r\nwhether the Government has swept this aspect of the issue\r\n\r\nunder  the carpet.  Yes, there are pleas from the  Muslim\r\n\r\nparticipants  in the feedback process to accept  them  as\r\n\r\nthey  are,  as  just another human being.   But,  to  the\r\n\r\ncredit  of  the Muslim community, they do not  blame  the\r\n\r\nsociety for some of their members being misled into JI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the exchanges between Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  and Mr Hawazi Daipi that Mr Low is quite  skilled\r\n\r\nin  putting across his point.  He is so skilful  that  he\r\n\r\nmisled Mr Tan Tarn How in stating in his article that the\r\n\r\noccurrence  of  the  JI  could  be  attributed   to   the\r\n\r\npolitical, social and economic factors that may be making\r\n\r\nthe Muslims behave as they do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  think  that article is like coming out with an apology\r\n\r\nfor a murderer.  Instead of asking whether the upbringing\r\n\r\nof  the  murderer was at fault, such as whether he  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  a  broken  family, whether his moral education  was\r\n\r\nweak, an apology is offered.  The apologist looks for the\r\n\r\npresence  of  a  defective gene in his  DNA  make-up,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  the murderer was basically inclined to  violence\r\n\r\nbecause he grew up in a poor and violent neighbourhood or\r\n\r\nhe  watched too much violent kungfu movies.  To look  for\r\n\r\nan  apology for an individual might give the apologist  a\r\n\r\nsatisfaction in being a do-gooder.  But to  look  for  an\r\n\r\napology  for the whole community would be to lampoon  the\r\n\r\nsweat  and blood put in by the community and to  belittle\r\n\r\nthe  progress made by the community - in this  case,  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community since Singapore's independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I suggest that we all go and\r\n\r\nread  the  booklet titled Progress of the Malay Community\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  since  1999  which  carried   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech  at  the  Malay/Muslim  Organisations'\r\n\r\nTribute  to  the Prime Minister's 10 Years of Leadership,\r\n\r\ndated  21st  January  2001.  In it,  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ngrabbed  the bull by the horns by answering the question,\r\n\r\n\"Are the Malay Singaporeans marginalised?\" directly.   He\r\n\r\nlooked  at  the progress made by the Malay  community  in\r\n\r\nfour  domains: education, occupation, income and  quality\r\n\r\nof   life.   In  every  domain,  the  Malays  have   made\r\n\r\nsubstantial and significant progress.  The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nalso compared the education and economic profiles of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Malays  with  the Malays  in  Malaysia.   Even\r\n\r\nthough  it is true that there are more Malay millionaires\r\n\r\nand  more Malays holding top positions in the public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors  in  Malaysia,  overall,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMalays  have fared well compared to the Malaysian Malays.\r\n\r\nSince  Singapore  Malays have done equally  well  as  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Malays, the argument that the Malay  community\r\n\r\nis marginalised does not hold water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Ms Indranee Rajah had also touched upon a\r\n\r\ncomparison  of  then  and now when relating  the  factors\r\n\r\nleading to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe racial riots in 1964.  She pointed out that there are\r\n\r\nmany  similarities.  But she neglected to point out  that\r\n\r\nbetween  then  and now, there are also many  differences.\r\n\r\nJust  in case hon. Members of the House may be misled  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that history might repeat itself, perhaps we  can\r\n\r\nlook at the differences between then and now.  Firstly, I\r\n\r\nthink the difference is that we Singaporeans are in total\r\n\r\ncharge of our own destiny.  Now, there is the absence  of\r\n\r\nracial  enclaves in Singapore through the  HDB's  housing\r\n\r\npolicy.    Finally,  the  progress  made  by  the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity, as indicated by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge this House not to be swayed by\r\n\r\nthe  arguments  of the apologists in drawing  conclusions\r\n\r\nabout  the  large number of individuals as complex  as  a\r\n\r\ncommunity,  but to look at the cold facts and  figures  - facts  and figures in the booklet I mentioned, and  facts\r\n\r\nand figures in the White Paper on the JI terrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all these misconceptions and complacency and\r\n\r\ndoubts, it is indeed appropriate that this White Paper is\r\n\r\nreleased.   If  we  look  at  the  profiles  of  the   JI\r\n\r\ndetainees, we will find that many of them hold good  jobs\r\n\r\nwith reasonable incomes and are house-owners.  Those  who\r\n\r\nhave read the Senior Minister's memoirs would recall  the\r\n\r\nepisode   of  a  bicycle  owner  carrying  his   precious\r\n\r\npossession up to his flat away from harm's way during the\r\n\r\nracial  riots  in  1964.  This convinced Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  a  stakeholder would be a better citizen, since  he\r\n\r\nwould prefer stability, in order to protect his stake  in\r\n\r\nthe   nation.   In  this  case,  the  JI  detainees   are\r\n\r\nstakeholders, yet they are prepared to give up all for  a\r\n\r\ncalling.   Perhaps, instead of looking for reasons  which\r\n\r\nmoved  these  men into joining the JI, from  the  social,\r\n\r\npolitical   and  economic  backgrounds   of   the   whole\r\n\r\ncommunity,  maybe,  indeed, it is a simple  case  of  men\r\n\r\nlooking  for the true meaning of life.  For those  of  us\r\n\r\nwho are past 50 years of age, I would say that we are all\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  feel  the cold of  the  grave.   We  stare\r\n\r\nmortality  in  the  eye, and have to reconcile  ourselves\r\n\r\nwith the fact that one of these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndays  we will die - the strong, powerful, weak or  simple\r\n\r\npersons.   Some of us will have to live with  it;  others\r\n\r\nwould  seek  solace in religion.  I surmise that  the  JI\r\n\r\ndetainees seek the true meaning of being human and, in so\r\n\r\ndoing, were misled by the religious teachers.  Those  who\r\n\r\nsit  down and read the White Paper with an open mind will\r\n\r\nfind that this is indeed the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, since its release, the White\r\n\r\nPaper  is  of indeed great interest to Singaporeans.   It\r\n\r\nseems  to fulfill a need among Singaporeans to know about\r\n\r\nthe  threat  that prompted the arrests  of  close  to  50\r\n\r\nindividuals under the ISA.  There was a rush to  buy  the\r\n\r\nprinted copies, and the number of attempts to access  the\r\n\r\nwebsite  hit  an  all-time high.  Unfortunately,  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived feedback that the White Paper is priced at $22 a\r\n\r\ncopy.  This has made it unaffordable to many in the lower\r\n\r\nincome  bracket to get a copy.  This led to some  of  the\r\n\r\nindividuals  raising questions about the  motive  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  setting  such a high  price.   Since  the\r\n\r\nobjective of the Government in releasing the White  Paper\r\n\r\nmust  be  to  disseminate the information  as  widely  as\r\n\r\npossible,  it  is fair to set the copy price  as  low  as\r\n\r\npossible.   Perhaps the Government could take  this  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  in pricing future White Papers.   But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the pricing really did not deter those who  were\r\n\r\ninterested  to  find  out  more about  the  White  Paper,\r\n\r\nbecause the content is widely reported in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThus,  anyone who is interested in the content will  find\r\n\r\nmost of the major findings reproduced in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the content of the White Paper\r\n\r\nitself.  Reading through the Paper, one can conclude that\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge and the expertise within the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs regarding the JI have increased by leaps and\r\n\r\nbounds  since December 2001, when the first batch  of  JI\r\n\r\nmembers  was  arrested.   The  White  Paper  paints   the\r\n\r\nlandscape of globalisation of Islamic fervour originating\r\n\r\nfrom  Saudi  Arabia.   This fervour drives  the  Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\nmovement  to take on the strongest nation on  earth,  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.  The White Paper also describes the  dream\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIslamic  movement  to  create a  new  pan-Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nstate,  Daulah  Islamiyah  Nusantara,  based  on  Islamic\r\n\r\nvalues  and  how the local JI movement is linked  to  the\r\n\r\nglobal   network.   The  analysis  of   the   source   of\r\n\r\nrevolutionary fervour makes it very clear to  the  reader\r\n\r\nthat  unless  the  global Islamic revival  subsides,  the\r\n\r\ndeviant ideology to pursue changes by violent means  will\r\n\r\nalways   continue   to   influence  Muslims   world-wide.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be no exception.  We cannot  wish  this\r\n\r\nrising tide away, and the world has to learn to live with\r\n\r\nit for a long time to come.  As Encik Othman Haron Eusofe\r\n\r\nhas  said, there is really no quick fix.  It is true that\r\n\r\nthe  arrests have disrupted the existing network, but the\r\n\r\nfundamental motive force driving the fervent  Muslims  to\r\n\r\nits cause will remain for a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper details how fire-brand religious\r\n\r\nteachers,   like  Ibrahim  Maidin,  identify,  cultivate,\r\n\r\nrecruit  and  control  the JI members,  using  techniques\r\n\r\nbordering   on  mind-control  that  are  reminiscent   of\r\n\r\nreligious  cults.  The use of oath of allegiance  is  one\r\n\r\nsuch  example.   Once  converted to  the  cause,  the  JI\r\n\r\nmembers  will  stay true to the cause for  a  long  time.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, they truly believe that they are serving  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of a higher calling.  I believe that  since  the\r\n\r\nfirst  batch of JI members was detained in December 2001,\r\n\r\nfew,  if  any, of them, are repentant.  It does  beg  the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  the authorities have a  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  return these detainees ultimately  to  the\r\n\r\nmainstream  of  Singapore society,  given  the  difficult\r\n\r\ntasks ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that the authorities have now a much\r\n\r\nmore  robust  understanding  of  the  motive  of  the  JI\r\n\r\nmovement  and  the  modus operandi  on  how  members  are\r\n\r\nrecruited,  I would say that most Singaporeans  can  rest\r\n\r\neasy  to know that counter-measures would be put in place\r\n\r\nto  curb the spread of the deviant teachings.  Confidence\r\n\r\nof the authorities in these areas has indeed increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, what does this House hope to\r\n\r\nachieve in debating this motion?  The Minister, in moving\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmotion, has touched upon many aspects.  My personal  list\r\n\r\nof desired outcomes is as follows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this White Paper has attracted world-wide\r\n\r\nattention, in particular, among security agencies in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It demonstrates the competencies of our ISD.  The\r\n\r\nreport  will  serve to reassure the world that  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  good  grasp of the threat and takes  this  threat\r\n\r\nseriously.   We  have the will and the means  to  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  long-term measures, such as restricting  vehicular\r\n\r\naccess  to  Jurong Island, despite increasing  costs  and\r\n\r\ngreater   inconvenience.   This  will  increase  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore despite it being in the midst  of\r\n\r\na turbulent region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second desired outcome is the acceptance that\r\n\r\nthe  JI  movement  is a low-level, hard-to-detect  secret\r\n\r\norganisation  comprising many cells.  Such  organisations\r\n\r\nare difficult to infiltrate and difficult to exterminate.\r\n\r\nSince  the  threat is a long-term one, we  cannot  depend\r\n\r\nentirely  on  the  authorities to eliminate  the  threat.\r\n\r\nEvery  citizen has a role to play.  Every one of us  must\r\n\r\ntake  on  the responsibility to eliminate this rogue  DNA\r\n\r\nfrom  our society to prevent the cancer from taking  root\r\n\r\nand spreading beyond control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third desired outcome is the need of the Muslim\r\n\r\nleaders  to come out loudly to reassure the rest  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  that the majority of Muslims in  Singapore  do\r\n\r\nnot  subscribe to the ideology of the JI.   That  Islamic\r\n\r\nvalues  are  consistent with democracy and do not  impose\r\n\r\nchanges through violent means.  I am glad to note that in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  most of the Malay MPs who have spoken  have\r\n\r\nindeed  done  so.   And it is also true that  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nleaders  have in the past repeatedly stepped  forward  to\r\n\r\nissue such reassurance.  However, perhaps the message  is\r\n\r\nworth  repeating,  so that it could be  driven  into  the\r\n\r\nconsciousness of the rest of the community.   In  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  dialogue  sessions, one Muslim  participant  pleaded\r\n\r\nwith  the group, asking what sort of reassurance  do  the\r\n\r\nother  communities need.  She was particularly  disturbed\r\n\r\nthat   there  were  participants  who  called   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to legislate against deviant Islamic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteachings.   This motion provides yet another opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  Muslim leaders to state clearly the condemnation  of\r\n\r\nthe JI terrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to most non-Muslim lay persons that\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community has undertaken  a  self-regulatory\r\n\r\nrole  to monitor deviant teachings of religious teachers.\r\n\r\nIf  such  teachings  could be curbed,  the  rank  of  the\r\n\r\npotential recruits in the JI would be thinned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth desired outcome is the recognition that\r\n\r\nthe burden of containing this threat does not rest on the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community alone.  As I have said  earlier,  every\r\n\r\none  of  us  has  a  role to play.  At  the  moment,  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  religiosity  of the  Muslim  community  which\r\n\r\nfinds expression in more rigid adherence with respect  to\r\n\r\nattire,  food and conduct towards the opposite sex,  such\r\n\r\nas  not shaking hands, is viewed with some anxiety by the\r\n\r\nother  communities.  Instead of greater integration after\r\n\r\nso  many  years  of nationhood, this development  in  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community seems to lead to greater segregation and\r\n\r\nless  interaction.   This need not be  so.   I  think  it\r\n\r\nbehoves the non-Muslims to develop greater awareness  and\r\n\r\nappreciation  of the Islamic culture.  Every  one  of  us\r\n\r\nshould extend our hands across the racial lines to gain a\r\n\r\nbetter   understanding  of  each  other's   customs   and\r\n\r\nreligious  practices.  You yourself, Mdm Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nand  Mr  K  Shanmugam, both believe that it is  important\r\n\r\nthat  everyone, in particular, the majority, to take this\r\n\r\nstep.   We should banish ignorance and eliminate fear  of\r\n\r\nthe  unknown  through knowledge.  As one Muslim  dialogue\r\n\r\nparticipant  pointed  out,  a stricter  adherence  is  an\r\n\r\nindication  of the desire to become a better  Muslim.   A\r\n\r\nbetter Muslim makes for a better member of the community,\r\n\r\na better citizen of the nation.  This cannot be but for a\r\n\r\nbetter Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, prior to the discovery of the JI\r\n\r\nmovement,  we  all thought that racial harmony  could  be\r\n\r\nachieved  through mutual respect and protection  of  each\r\n\r\nother's  rights,  as we have done so since  independence.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  inclined to leave it to time for a common Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity to emerge.  There is this faith that we will gel\r\n\r\nas   a  nation,  as  a  people,  over  time,  as  if  the\r\n\r\namalgamation process would take place naturally.   It  is\r\n\r\nlike  managing  the health of our body.  So  long  as  we\r\n\r\nprovide our body with food and water, the heart will pump\r\n\r\nthe  blood, the blood will nourish the various organs  so\r\n\r\nthat the whole body will function well.  The discovery of\r\n\r\nthe  JI  is akin to the discovery of cancer cells in  our\r\n\r\nbody.   Left unchecked, the cancer will grow and  spread,\r\n\r\nultimately leading to death.  Active treatment is  called\r\n\r\nfor,  such  as  surgery,  followed  by  chemotherapy  and\r\n\r\nthereafter continuous life-long monitoring and treatment.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we no longer can let nature take its course in\r\n\r\nmanaging  the racial harmony and social cohesion  of  our\r\n\r\nnation.  The active participation of every stakeholder is\r\n\r\nneeded.  I agree with Mr K Shanmugam that now is the time\r\n\r\nfor action so that our children will continue to live  in\r\n\r\npeace and harmony in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular situation is forced upon us. We\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must rise to the occasion.  I am  confident\r\n\r\nthat together we will overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Debate be now adjourned. - [Assoc.

In the last 5 years alone, some 70,000\r\n\r\nwere trained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of SCDF's public education and training\r\n\r\nefforts include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Training members of school uniformed groups in\r\n\r\nbasic CD skills, including CPR;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Educating residents on CD skills through\r\n\r\nCommunity Safety and Security Programmes (CSSPs);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Conducting courses to equip volunteers with the\r\n\r\nnecessary CD skills;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Conducting CD Awareness Training Programme at\r\n\r\nthe Fire Stations and Satellite Fire Posts for members of\r\n\r\nthe public; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Conducting Basic Cardiac Life Support Courses\r\n\r\nfor members of the public at the Civil Defence Academy to\r\n\r\nequip participants with the necessary knowledge on CPR.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCDF has also, over the past 2 years, introduced\r\n\r\nnew  initiatives to train more Singaporeans in CD skills.\r\n\r\nThe   CD   Awareness  Training  Programme  is  now   more\r\n\r\naccessible  to  the  public as it is  conducted  at  Fire\r\n\r\nStations and Satellite Fire Posts, which are conveniently\r\n\r\nlocated in residential estates. The SCDF has also trained\r\n\r\nvolunteer  instructors to help train members  from  their\r\n\r\nown  community in CD skills. Specifically on CPR  skills,\r\n\r\nSCDF  has developed the musical CPR programme where music\r\n\r\nis incorporated into the CPR drill to help them learn and\r\n\r\npractise their CPR skills in an interesting way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCDF also encourages and supports community-led\r\n\r\nefforts  to  train  Singaporeans in  CD  skills.  A  good\r\n\r\nexample  is  the CPR programme jointly run by  the  Boys'\r\n\r\nBrigade,  Alexandra Hospital and Central  Singapore  CDC.\r\n\r\nMore  than  2,000  people have been  trained  under  this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more trained CD instructors, training\r\n\r\nprogrammes and community partnerships in place, the  SCDF\r\n\r\nis  confident  in  building up the pool  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntrained in CD skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARK CONNECTORS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  in  view of the need to  encourage  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyles among Singaporeans (a) what is the progress in\r\n\r\nthe  development of park connectors in Singapore; and (b)\r\n\r\nwhether   his  Ministry  will  consider  expediting   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Park Connector Network (PCN) was initiated\r\n\r\nin   1991,  we  have  completed  21  stretches  of   park\r\n\r\nconnectors,  totaling 51 km.

These  are\r\n\r\nabandoned animals and their offspring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animals and Birds Act was amended in July 2002.\r\n\r\nAn  owner  who abandons his pet without reasonable  cause\r\n\r\nmay  be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months  or\r\n\r\nboth.  As it is difficult to catch an owner in the act of\r\n\r\nabandoning  his  pet, AVA is studying the feasibility  of\r\n\r\nrequiring   pets  to  be  micro-chipped   to   facilitate\r\n\r\nidentification of pets and their owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, AVA inculcates responsible pet ownership\r\n\r\nthrough  its  public education programme such  as  giving\r\n\r\ntalks  and  exhibitions in schools, libraries and  public\r\n\r\nevents,  as well as producing educational pamphlets.  AVA\r\n\r\nalso  enlists  the community's participation  to  control\r\n\r\nstray  dogs  and  cats through sterilisation  and  proper\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA does not support the renting of pets as it\r\n\r\ncompromises the welfare of the animals. An animal that is\r\n\r\nrented out constantly faces different environment and new\r\n\r\nowners  which cause stress and suffering to  the  animal.\r\n\r\nAVA  had  investigated the shop reported in the press  as\r\n\r\noffering a rent-a-pet scheme. This shop allows owners  to\r\n\r\nexchange  the  animal for another that is  more  suitable\r\n\r\nwithin  a certain time period.
