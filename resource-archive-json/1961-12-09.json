Members will remember that when the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power, they created Political Secretaries  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber of Ministries. There was no creation of such  a\r\n\r\npost in the Ministry of the Deputy Prime Minister. But\r\n\r\nin  1960  when the Political Secretary in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law came out into the open as a sort of\r\n\r\nrebel   against  the  P.A.P.,  it  was  felt  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that his continued presence  as  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary in the Ministry of Labour and Law  would  be\r\n\r\nvery  embarrassing to the Government.  The  Government\r\n\r\nconsidered that his actions there were inimical to the\r\n\r\npolicy of the P.A.P., and yet it did not do the  right\r\n\r\nthing  as  it would have done had the culprit  been  a\r\n\r\ncivil   servant.  He  was  not  summarily   dismissed.\r\n\r\nInstead, a special post of Political Secretary had  to\r\n\r\nbe  created  in  the  Ministry  of  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in order to contain this rebel. At that  time\r\n\r\nlast  year,  there  was  a lot of  discussion  on  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  this  post. I  think  it  was  not  only\r\n\r\nexplained by the Government, but some Members  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Bench even went to the extent of  defending\r\n\r\nthe  holder of this post - Mr Fong Swee Suan. The  post\r\n\r\nwas  created in this Ministry in order to contain  Mr\r\n\r\nFang  Swee Suan and his continuation in this  job  was\r\n\r\nexplained by the Government. He was defended, in fact,\r\n\r\nvery  vigorously. Today, Mr Fong Swee Suan is no more\r\n\r\nwith  the Government. Not only is he no more with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but the Prime Minister in his series of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawful  disclosures  described him as  a  Communist.  It\r\n\r\nwould appear that the Government had misused this post.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  had felt it necessary to  give  public\r\n\r\nfunds to a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

When he was\r\n\r\nappointed  Political Secretary to me, he was  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  learn new subjects and  to  prove  his\r\n\r\nqualities and ability in assisting me in my Ministry. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that was sometime in the middle of  1960.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  made his series of broadcasts  only  a\r\n\r\ncouple of months ago. Unfortunately - I must say it  was\r\n\r\na  disappointment to me - my ex-Political  Secretary  did\r\n\r\nnot prove his mettle.

It was this quality in the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that persuaded the Prime Minister to transfer\r\n\r\nMr  Fong Swee Suan from the Ministry of Labour,  where\r\n\r\nhe  had  to deal with the present Minister for  Health,\r\n\r\nto;  the  Ministry of the Deputy Prime  Minister.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  post  existed. Therefore, the Government  created\r\n\r\nthe  post without reference to the Assembly because  it\r\n\r\nhad  to  be done quickly on a Special Warrant, and  Mr\r\n\r\nFong Swee Suan was put there. It is fairly certain  and\r\n\r\nas  clear  as the nose on one's face that the post  was\r\n\r\ncreated specially to contain Mr Fang Swee Suan. It was\r\n\r\nnever  the  intention  of  the  Government  to  have  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  to  the  Deputy  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nbecause,  if  one  looks at the departments  under  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, it is quite clear that there  is\r\n\r\nnot  much point in appointing a Political Secretary.  I\r\n\r\nthink even the Deputy Prime Minister will admit that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other point is that Mr Fong Swee Suan has left the\r\n\r\nGovernment and has left the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I ask the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\nfollow  Establishment practice in these matters,  which\r\n\r\nis  this: if the use for the post has disappeared, then\r\n\r\nthe  post must be abolished. The use for this post  has\r\n\r\ncertainly  disappeared,  and I  ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  how  he,  in fairness to the finances  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, can tolerate this post in the Budget. We  know\r\n\r\nwhat  a strict Minister for Finance he is. We know  how\r\n\r\ndifficult he is with the Establishment Branch on posts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he should apply the same yardstick  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  He is not concerned with the politics  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  He  is  the Finance Minister of  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

If he wishes to do so, he can do so.  Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is going to be a recurring\r\n\r\nsubject. I myself will be sooner or later involved.  It\r\n\r\nis  just as well to dispose of it at this moment. There\r\n\r\nare  two  points.  If I remember correctly,  when  this\r\n\r\nbusiness of Political Secretaries was discussed earlier\r\n\r\non,  I  think it was made quite clear that in principle\r\n\r\nevery  Minister was going to have a Political Secretary\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  had  been explained, the  function  of  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  was to assist  Ministers  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical aspect of their work. To that extent,  if  at\r\n\r\nany particular time a Minister does or does not have  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary, it does not mean that  he  should\r\n\r\nnot have one at some subsequent date when he feels that\r\n\r\nhe  can  get a man more suited to the post.  The  other\r\n\r\npoint  is  this. It is not necessarily true  that  just\r\n\r\nbecause  Mr  Fong Swee Suan failed very badly  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  job to which he was assigned, that  the  job\r\n\r\nshould  be  abolished. As you know, Sir, I  think  five\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries have also defected.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot   mean   that  we  should  abolish  the  posts   of\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary. In fact, there was a time when\r\n\r\nfour or five Ministers had no Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nfor a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fact that the post is vacant at any particular\r\n\r\ntime  does not necessarily mean that there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor  its existence, because if and when we can  find  a\r\n\r\nsuitable man to fill it we will certainly do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T.

But I think the Member for Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\nmade  his point, that there is practically nothing,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as I can see, in the Ministry of the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister which calls for a Political Secretary's  post,\r\n\r\nhaving regard to the sort of work that Political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretaries in the Ministry of Labour and Law  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education are doing. I  do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nlabour this point. All that I am trying to do is to put\r\n\r\nthis  question  of Political Secretary  in  its  proper\r\n\r\nperspective  so that, as the Minister for  Culture  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  when  we  come  to  the next  Head  and  discuss\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries, we may understand what it is all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start off with this question of Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nwas here when we discussed this same topic under the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's Ministry, and I did indicate that two\r\n\r\naspects of the topic had to be discussed and disposed\r\n\r\nof yesterday. The first was the principle as to why\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries are necessary. That has been\r\n\r\ndisposed of. The other point is the increase of $250 in\r\n\r\nsalary. That too has been disposed of. Now we are\r\n\r\ndealing with any reason why a Political Secretary is\r\n\r\nrequired in any Ministry, and we have come to the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's Ministry. That is the subject\r\n\r\nof debate now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to say things that are related\r\n\r\nto  what has transpired so far as Mr Fong Swee Suan is\r\n\r\nconcerned. In the first place, Sir, Mr Fong Swee  Suan\r\n\r\nwas not transferred from the Ministry of Labour and Law\r\n\r\nbecause   he   needed  technical   training.   He   was\r\n\r\ntransferred  because  he  criticised  the  Government's\r\n\r\nlabour  policy when he spoke as a trade unionist  at  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union meeting. The Government did not  have  the\r\n\r\nguts  to sack him because they knew that if they sacked\r\n\r\nhim  they would lose the confidence of the workers.  So\r\n\r\nwhat they did was quietly to transfer him to some place\r\n\r\nwhere  he  would  be considered least  harmful  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Mr Lim Ching Siong was already  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary in the Ministry of Finance where they thought\r\n\r\nhe  would be least harmful. So they could not have  Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan in the Ministry of Finance, and  their\r\n\r\nnext  obvious  choice was the Ministry  of  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister.  Therefore,  Sir,  the  question   of\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaryship in the Ministry of the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  was  purely for the purpose of  accommodating\r\n\r\nMr  Fong Swee Suan. Now Mr Fang Swee Suan is no  more\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P., and I do not think Mr Jek Yuen Thong or\r\n\r\nInche Rahim Ishak, the two Political Secretaries at the\r\n\r\nmoment,  would ever be required to take a  transfer  on\r\n\r\nthe same basis as Mr Fong took. Even if that happened,\r\n\r\nSir, the post of Political Secretary in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance being vacant, I therefore do not think there is\r\n\r\nany need to have the post contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  has  said,  if Mr Fong  Swee  Suan  had  felt\r\n\r\nunhappy in my Ministry as Political Secretary,  and  if\r\n\r\nit  was thought that the idea was to contain him,  then\r\n\r\nthe  obvious  step for him to take would have  been  to\r\n\r\npack up instead of accepting the post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I am far\r\n\r\nfrom being certain, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Political\r\n\r\nSecretary is not necessary in the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Ministry.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the main\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in this matter is this, that the Government\r\n\r\nis  taking  a particular stand on this. They  made  the\r\n\r\nfirst  move  in this. Right. The whole thing  has  gone\r\n\r\nwrong  and,  if  I may use the Finance  Minister's  own\r\n\r\nexpression - a suitable expression - the Government is in a\r\n\r\nstate  of  \"zugzwang\". Any single move they  make  with\r\n\r\nregard to Political Secretaries would be a wrong  move.\r\n\r\nSo  the Minister for Finance, who is a chess player, is\r\n\r\nin  a state of \"zugzwang\". He refuses to carry out  his\r\n\r\nduties   as  Minister  for  Finance  and  allows   this\r\n\r\nappointment  to  continue.

In my capacity as Deputy Prime Minister, I\r\n\r\nhave  to receive Ministers and statesmen from overseas.\r\n\r\nBeing  also  in charge of several technical departments\r\n\r\nand  the  Polytechnic, I have to meet  technicians  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  people  who come to Singapore  either  to\r\n\r\nadvise  me  or  to  offer  material  assistance  to  my\r\n\r\ndepartments   or  to  the  Polytechnic.

If  it  is  necessary for the present  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer  to  be  retained, cannot he be  retained  as  a\r\n\r\nsupernumerary officer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as far as the policy\r\n\r\nof  Malayanisation is concerned, I can assure the  House\r\n\r\nthat  I am one of its champions.

There  may  well  be\r\n\r\nperiods  in  which they are charged with  duties  in  an\r\n\r\nexecutive  field.

The previous salary scale of this post was one\r\n\r\nof  the  few anomalous scales carried over from  former\r\n\r\nyears.   In   1958,   the  Civil  Aviation   Department\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the post be regraded and  the  salary\r\n\r\nscale  revised  to equate that of the Higher  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer,  as  the  duties  and  responsibilities   were\r\n\r\ncomparable,  but  this was not then  approved.  Further\r\n\r\nrepresentations were made and it was also  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  officer  holding this post  would  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  compete with the other  Higher  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficers  in  the  Department for the post  of  Airport\r\n\r\nCommercial Manager. Therefore, in the reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe  Department the regrading of this post was approved\r\n\r\nfor  1962.  The former salary scale for this  post  was\r\n\r\n$655-25A-905. The scale now shown against item (40)  is\r\n\r\nthe H.E.O. scale, i.e., $690-30A-930.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would appear from the\r\n\r\nMinister's  explanation that  the  post  has  not  been\r\n\r\nadjusted.

But what I want to know from the Deputy Prime Minister is this. As far as I know, a few\r\n\r\nmonths  ago there appeared in the newspapers the  story\r\n\r\nthat  the  Master Attendant and a few others, one  from\r\n\r\nthe National Seamen's Union, Mr Teo Chan Toon, and Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong, visited Europe in connection  with  a\r\n\r\nseamen's   employment  delegation.  I   wish   to   get\r\n\r\nclarification  as  to  the  results  achieved  by   the\r\n\r\ndelegation. But what happens? Mr Teo was recalled back\r\n\r\nto   Singapore.   Was  it  because  of  the   political\r\n\r\nconditions   in  Singapore?  Why  was  this  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer permitted to go alone by himself? Why could not\r\n\r\nlocal  officers, who will be taking his place, be sent?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, the most important thing is what are  the\r\n\r\nresults  achieved  by  this delegation?  Nothing, was\r\n\r\nheard about it in the newspapers. As for the nomination\r\n\r\nof  other  representatives, there was  no  consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  other  seamen's  organisations.  Is  it  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  view that the other seamen's organisation\r\n\r\nshould be ignored?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan is quite correct when he\r\n\r\nsays there was a little party which included Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong on this trip to visit shipowners in Europe\r\n\r\nand the United States. Originally, a little party\r\n\r\nheaded by the Master Attendant, in his capacity as\r\n\r\nChairman of the Seamen's Registry Board, and a member\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry of Labour, was to Visit all\r\n\r\nshipowners in Europe and the United States in order to\r\n\r\nfind out the prospects of recruiting Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nas seamen on board their ships. Unfortunately, when the\r\n\r\ndates and the itinerary had been fixed, tie Master\r\n\r\nAttendant fell ill. Our local officer from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour, who was already in Europe, was left to\r\n\r\nhimself. So a cable was sent to him saying that the\r\n\r\ntrip had to be postponed, and he returned to Singapore.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Master Attendant recovered from his\r\n\r\nsickness and he went off by himself on my own\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we do not wish to consult the unions.\r\n\r\nHis  trip was mainly exploratory, to find out what  are\r\n\r\nthe   possibilities   of  foreign  shipping   companies\r\n\r\nrecruiting  Singapore seamen. As  you  are  aware,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we have to look for new avenues of employment\r\n\r\nfor  our  citizens. One of the avenues  which  we  have\r\n\r\nconsistently emphasized is that our people must  go  to\r\n\r\nsea. The Master Attendant has come back and he has just\r\n\r\ngiven  me  a  report of the results of his  talks  with\r\n\r\nshipowners  in  Europe and the United States.  This  is\r\n\r\nrather  a lengthy report which I do not think  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment I am prepared to read out to the House. But at a\r\n\r\nsubsequent  date  I  am  quite  prepared  to   make   a\r\n\r\nministerial statement on the report or even to  lay  it\r\n\r\nbefore the Assembly for consideration. However, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to say that it is quite encouraging that we  have\r\n\r\nnow  found  1,000 new jobs for Singapore  seamen.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, as a result of his trip abroad,  it  has\r\n\r\nturned  out  that a minority of our seamen  are  giving\r\n\r\nconsiderable trouble to shipowners, and the  result  is\r\n\r\nthat  we have lost 200 jobs. 200 Singapore seamen  have\r\n\r\njust been discharged because of the trouble created  on\r\n\r\nboard ship,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  because of desertion, or because of refusal  to  do\r\n\r\nwork  for which they have signed under contract.  These\r\n\r\nare some of the problems which the Master Attendant has\r\n\r\nrelated  in his report. A large part of these  problems\r\n\r\nrelate  to discipline among our seamen. However,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to enlarge in detail on this subject  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.

Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister please explain the confusion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I may as well give the House a\r\n\r\nhistory  of  this  post.  It was  created  in  the  1958\r\n\r\nEstimates in the salary scale of $560-630-660-690  X  30A-930/960  X  35A-1,240. The holder of the post has to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  a  large  volume  of work in  the  Marine  Surveys\r\n\r\nDepartment and does not require the attention  of  fully\r\n\r\nqualified surveyors who are engaged in statutory  safety\r\n\r\nat sea requirements. The duties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the post are supervision of maintenance of machinery,\r\n\r\nhouse  and  the treatment of all Government vessels  and\r\n\r\nlaunches.  The  poet  was held  from  November  1958  to\r\n\r\nOctober  1960 by Mr Alfred Heng who is now promoted  to\r\n\r\nEngineer and Ship Surveyor. When the 1961 Estimates were\r\n\r\nframed,  $8,310 was provided for Mr Heng's  salary.  In\r\n\r\nthe  1962  Estimates, as the post was  vacant  when  the\r\n\r\nEstimates were drafted, the mean of the salary scale was\r\n\r\nprovided   for.  This  accounts  for  the  increase   in\r\n\r\nprovision to $11,580 which will be required to meet  the\r\n\r\nsalary  of  the present holder. The P.S.C. has  selected\r\n\r\nand  an  offer of appointment has gone to a certain  Mr\r\n\r\nPeterson  who  is  the  Dredging Superintendent  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department. He is a first-class  engineer\r\n\r\n(steam  and motor) in the Mercantile Marine. His present\r\n\r\nsalary  in  the  P.W.D. is  $1,030.  Mr  Peterson  has\r\n\r\nrequested  the Establishment to reduce the three  years'\r\n\r\nprobation to a one year's trial as he had already served\r\n\r\nthe three years' probation in his previous post with the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. with  similar duties.

That decision was welcomed by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us now examine how this decision has been\r\n\r\nimplemented in the Budget that is before us. Sir, the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Vehicles, on his City Council salary scale\r\n\r\nof $1,280-45A-1,370-50A-l,620, now has his salary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscale regraded to a Government Super-scale Grade G post\r\n\r\ncarrying  a salary of $1,520 a month. The City  Council\r\n\r\nsalary  scale for the Registrar of Vehicles  carries  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $1,620, whereas it is  now  changed  to  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  Superscale Grade G  carrying  a  salary  of\r\n\r\n$1,520.  That  is a difference of $100  a  month.  That\r\n\r\ncertainly,  Sir,  is  a change from  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nsalary  scale to a Government salary scale. Of  course,\r\n\r\nto  make  that  up, the salary to be paid  in  1962  at\r\n\r\n$1,520  gives an increase of $120 a month on  the  1961\r\n\r\nsalary. If it is the same holder, then he will be given\r\n\r\nin  1962  an increase of $120 a month instead  of  $50,\r\n\r\naccording  to his City Council salary scale. But  then,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  the same holder, he will be losing  $100  a\r\n\r\nmonth  on the top of the timescale. Sir, is this not  a\r\n\r\nchange in the declared policy of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Not at all, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do\r\n\r\nnot think there is any deviation from what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  said.  In order to explain  this,  I  had\r\n\r\nbetter give the House the history of this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, this post was a City Council post\r\n\r\ncarrying a salary of $1,280-45A-1,370-50A-1,620  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member for Cairnhill. Prior  to  July\r\n\r\n1961 this year, the holder of this post was Mr Goh Kee\r\n\r\nSong.  He  was on a fixed salary of $1,400 on contract,\r\n\r\nand  he was seconded as the Registrar of Vehicles  from\r\n\r\nthe  City Engineer's Department in September 1958.  Now\r\n\r\nthe  present  person who is acting in  this  post,  Mr\r\n\r\nSchubert, the legal adviser and prosecutor of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, is drawing a basic salary of $965 in the scale\r\n\r\nof $785-45A-1,280 per month plus C.O.L.A. (30 per cent)\r\n\r\nand  an  acting allowance of $90. So when Mr  Goh  Kee\r\n\r\nSong  vacated his post, the Establishment regraded  the\r\n\r\npost of Registrar of Vehicles. They considered the post\r\n\r\nas    a    purely   administrative   post.   In   fact,\r\n\r\nadvertisements  were  placed in the  Press  asking  for\r\n\r\napplicants  to  fill this post. The P.S.C. interviewed\r\n\r\nthe applicants,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately found none of them  suitable.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the P.S.C. recommended that an administrative\r\n\r\nofficer should act in the post. So it is proposed  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Registry  of Vehicles is finally  integrated\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government,  this  recommendation  will   be\r\n\r\nadopted.  Then, of course again, this post is  open  to\r\n\r\nanybody  who fills the requirements.

It  has already been touched  upon  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance in his Budget Statement  when  he\r\n\r\nwas  dealing  with the question of the fall  in  petrol\r\n\r\nconsumption - I think it was. He did say that there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  brought on to the roads of Singapore a number  of\r\n\r\nsmall  scooters.  Sir,  I have  nothing  against  small\r\n\r\nscooters, but when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  produce a noise totally out of all proportion  to\r\n\r\nthe  smallness of their structure, when they emit fumes\r\n\r\nwhich  are  sometimes nauseating if you  happen  to  be\r\n\r\nclose  to  them, and when they seem to be  so  flimsily\r\n\r\nconstructed  and  yet carry pillions on  them,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink it becomes a matter for public concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a newsboy who comes to my home to deliver\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in  the  morning. He  has  now  acquired  a\r\n\r\nscooter for himself and he scoots into my house  making\r\n\r\na  terrible noise. The noise is enough to wake  up  the\r\n\r\ndevils  in the neighbourhood, including myself. I  have\r\n\r\nto  get  up, for which I am duly thankful to him.  But,\r\n\r\nSir, when he has left the house for well after five  to\r\n\r\nten  minutes,  the  fumes are still definitely  in  the\r\n\r\nhouse.  Now,  if one small scooter could do  that,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  imagine  the hundreds  of  scooters  in\r\n\r\nSingapore emitting their noxious fumes on the  streets.\r\n\r\nI am sure it cannot be doing the health of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nany good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister whether this matter has\r\n\r\nbeen considered by the Registrar of Vehicles. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether it is he who licenses these vehicles.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is, I would request the Minister to ask him to take\r\n\r\nthese  factors  into  consideration  before  he  allows\r\n\r\nscooters on the roads. They may serve a useful purpose,\r\n\r\nSir, but I think the overriding policy of the Registrar\r\n\r\nshould  be whether the vehicle is fit to be put on  the\r\n\r\nroad. As to whether it is fit, I think the questions of\r\n\r\nnoise,  fumes and safety are vital factors which should\r\n\r\nbe taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, in May 1960 we did try\r\n\r\nto  persuade  drivers and owners of motor  vehicles  to\r\n\r\nexamine  their exhausts and so prevent obnoxious  fumes\r\n\r\nfrom being poured out into the atmosphere. In fact,  we\r\n\r\ndid  issue several statements over the radio and in the\r\n\r\nPress  warning  all owners that action would  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  them if there were reports that their vehicles\r\n\r\nwere emitting excessive and obnoxious fumes.

There is also under the Motor  Vehicle\r\n\r\nRules a regulation which compels all vehicles propelled\r\n\r\nby  internal  combustion engines to be  fitted  with  a\r\n\r\nsilencer,  an  expansion chamber or  other  contrivance\r\n\r\nsuitable and sufficient for reducing as far as  may  be\r\n\r\nreasonable  the  noise  caused by  the  escape  of  the\r\n\r\nobnoxious gases from the engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, from January to\r\n\r\nAugust, 54 cases were dealt with by the Traffic Police;\r\n\r\n12  summons cases; 35 cases were compounded; 7 cases of\r\n\r\nwarnings  issued to owners. I may as well  repeat  that\r\n\r\nthe maximum fine for the first offence is $400, for the\r\n\r\nsecond  or subsequent offence, there is a maximum  fine\r\n\r\nof  $1,000 or three month's imprisonment - a fact which\r\n\r\nI  think  the Member for Farrer Park should inform  his\r\n\r\nnewspaper  boy.  If  he  has  a  justifiable  complaint\r\n\r\nagainst his newspaper boy, he has got one of two things\r\n\r\nto  do - either  report to the Registrar of Vehicles  the\r\n\r\nnumber of the scooter, or to tell the newspaper boy not\r\n\r\nto go to his house anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe  thrill of riding a motor-bicycle lies in the noise\r\n\r\nit   gives.

The\r\n\r\neffective way of taking off the fumes from scooters,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is  to  provide  chimneys  as  we   have   in\r\n\r\nFederation lorries. Then our scooter drivers will  have\r\n\r\nan  aerial for the radio in front and a chimney for the\r\n\r\nfumes at the back.

What I  said\r\n\r\nwas that it was a scheme intended to give assistance to\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed by giving them useful work to do in the\r\n\r\nway   of   building  rural  roads,  digging  irrigation\r\n\r\nditches,  levelling hills, and so on and so forth.  But\r\n\r\nthe  work is so arranged that it makes use of more  men\r\n\r\nthan machines. It is what people sometimes call \"labour\r\n\r\nintensive\".  If  you want to, say, level  a  hill,  the\r\n\r\nquickest, cheapest, easiest and most economical  method\r\n\r\nis  to use bulldozers. You employ a few people and  the\r\n\r\nwork is done very quickly and cheaply. But that is  not\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of the operation. The purpose of the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  is to give work to as many people as  possible\r\n\r\nwithin  the  limits of the Budget. Now, this  does  not\r\n\r\nmean that you can do things any old-how. We have in the\r\n\r\nBrigade more than 2,000 members already. They are sited\r\n\r\nin camps; and camps have to be located and built. Water\r\n\r\nsupply  and  lines have to be laid down. Power,  light,\r\n\r\nrations, clothes, leave, establishment matters  and  so\r\n\r\non   have  to  be  arranged.  I  mean,  it  is  a  huge\r\n\r\norganisation. You do need a person with some  technical\r\n\r\nskill because he has to see that the design of the work\r\n\r\nis  well planned and executions well supervised.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave said, this is a major organisation, though at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  it is running into certain snags.

In other words,  the\r\n\r\nmembership of the Work Brigade is a temporary thing - six\r\n\r\nor  nine months perhaps. When a youth is unemployed, we\r\n\r\nput  him  there,  and give him useful work  and  useful\r\n\r\ntraining if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  can either in the Polytechnic or on actual training\r\n\r\ncourses;  but in the meantime he makes his contribution\r\n\r\nto society by taking part in construction work by which\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to  instil in them a sense of pride.  And  in\r\n\r\nreturn  for  this,  he does not get  paid.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nintended  that he should be paid a salary. He gets  his\r\n\r\nkeep,   food,  accommodation,  clothing  and  a   small\r\n\r\nallowance of $1.50 per day to keep him going until  the\r\n\r\ntime  when the Brigade get him a permanent job outside.\r\n\r\nAnd the Work Brigade has found jobs for about 1,000  of\r\n\r\nits members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is quite wrong to say that the Brigade\r\n\r\nmembers have a right to form a union or that, in  fact,\r\n\r\na trade union is an appropriate organisation to advance\r\n\r\ntheir interests. They say, \"Well, look, why not pay  us\r\n\r\nthe  same  pay as the Government daily-rated  workers?\"\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is, \"If we do so, then we  might  as  well\r\n\r\nabsorb  you into the Government daily-rated force,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are no vacancies at present.\" If they  want  the\r\n\r\nsame terms of pay as permanent workers, then I say that\r\n\r\nthe  logical consequence of that is that we shall close\r\n\r\ndown the Work Brigade, engage a few of them to fill the\r\n\r\nvacant  posts in the Government service, and  tell  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  them,  \"Well, you do not want this  temporary\r\n\r\nscheme  whereby you are given some useful  work  to  do\r\n\r\nuntil  we  get a few permanent jobs for you.\"  This  is\r\n\r\nknown to the members of the Barisan Sosialis because we\r\n\r\nworked  out the scheme with them when they were in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment; but for reasons of their own they choose to\r\n\r\nmisrepresent  the position to the Work Brigade  members\r\n\r\nand  stir  up trouble. This has been going on for  some\r\n\r\nmonths now. As I have said, it is likely to come  to  a\r\n\r\nhead  in  the  near future when round  No.  4  will  be\r\n\r\nenacted.

This is  very\r\n\r\nunfair because we know that the pay of a member of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade  is only  $1.50  per  day.  The\r\n\r\nmembers of the Work Brigade have been working  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  year and they still go  on  drawing\r\n\r\n$1.50 per day. How can they live on $1.50 per day?\r\n\r\nSo  it  is proper for them to form a union.  Maybe\r\n\r\nthey  want  to form a union in order to fight  for\r\n\r\nbetter working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Why does the Government\r\n\r\nput  the  blame  on the Barisan Sosialis  for  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  things? For example,  if  one  day  our\r\n\r\nSpeaker  in  this  House should disappear,  should\r\n\r\nMembers of the Barisan Sosialis be blamed for that\r\n\r\nby  the Government?

The\r\n\r\nvacancies have not been advertised in the  papers.\r\n\r\nWe  have  approved the vote for these  posts,  but\r\n\r\nthey have not been advertised. I wonder where  the\r\n\r\nholders of these posts have come from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. Is it not the duty of a\r\n\r\nCamp  Supervisor to go round the camp to supervise\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Work Brigade  and  to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether they remain in the camp? Is it his duty to\r\n\r\ncheck  the travelling bags of members of the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  to  see whether they contain  papers  and\r\n\r\nnewspapers?   Some  members  are   interested   in\r\n\r\npolitics and so they buy political magazines  such\r\n\r\nas  The Political Science Society and The Torch of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Socialist Party.

What the Member for Pasir Panjang has  brought\r\n\r\nup, I think, occurred very recently due to the troubles\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  having in the camps. For the  past  l\ufffd\r\n\r\nyears,  the Work Brigade was able to function according\r\n\r\nto  the Disciplinary Code, but the troubles are due  to\r\n\r\nthe agitation from the Barisan Sosialis - I particularly\r\n\r\nrefer to the Member for Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice also in this amendment paper that the\r\n\r\nMember from the Barisan Sosialis Front has not made any\r\n\r\namendment whatsoever in respect of the Work Brigade. He\r\n\r\nwas  closely connected with the Work Brigade,  because,\r\n\r\nwhen I tock it over from the Labour Ministry, he was at\r\n\r\nthat  time one of the Supremos. Later on, the  Supremos\r\n\r\nwere  abolished  and I appointed  him  as  one  of  the\r\n\r\nliaison  officers  between the  Work  Brigade  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.

In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, Sir, I have reliable information  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Toa Payoh has been meeting leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade who are agitating to form a union now.

The  Camp  Commandants in  several  camps  have\r\n\r\nalready  thrown overboard the Disciplinary  Code  which\r\n\r\nthey were supposed to use on their subordinates as well\r\n\r\nas  members in the camps. In view of the fact that  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of the Work Brigade could not get his  orders\r\n\r\ndown  through the Camp Commandants, he had to  use  the\r\n\r\ncamp  supervisors to do the duties which were  supposed\r\n\r\nto be done by the Camp Commandants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  accused me  of  being  involved  with\r\n\r\nmembers  who want to form a union.

So much\r\n\r\nhas  already been said on the Work Brigade that we need\r\n\r\nnot  say  very much more on this. In the 1962 provision\r\n\r\nthere  is  an increase of nearly $3 million. Last  year\r\n\r\nthe  vote  was  for $3 million, and this year  what  is\r\n\r\nasked for is $5,890,000, i.e. nearly double. Last  year\r\n\r\nit  was  explained  that  the money  was  required  for\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure, like construction and maintenance\r\n\r\nof  camps,  provision of beds, food,  and  purchase  of\r\n\r\ntools. Now with this doubling of the vote for 1962,  is\r\n\r\nit  envisaged  by the Government that they  propose  to\r\n\r\nincrease the Work Brigade contingent? Or is it for some\r\n\r\nother  scheme? During last year's Budget sitting,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  pointed out that what was being paid to the members\r\n\r\nof  the Work Brigade at $2 a day was inadequate and was\r\n\r\nnot  fair.

In\r\n\r\nQueenstown, they are working on the outer ring road, Jalan Bukit Merah, and\r\n\r\nalso  working  on  the Jurong link road. The earthworks,  foundation  work,\r\n\r\nlaying of run curbs, pipes, construction of roadside drains, footpaths  are\r\n\r\nall  done  by  the  Work Brigade. In addition, they are  doing  earthworks,\r\n\r\nclearing  of undergrowth, cutting of slopes and levelling of banks  of  the\r\n\r\nSungei Api Api. When we had the drought and there was an acute shortage  of\r\n\r\nsand,  the Kaki Bukit camp of the Work Brigade was operating a sand  quarry\r\n\r\nand supplying sand. In the resettlement areas, the Work Brigade are engaged\r\n\r\nin  construction of new agricultural roads, timber bridges, roadside drains\r\n\r\nand  the  laying of pipe culverts. In the rural areas, they are  doing  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance and the reconstruction of rural drains, de-silting and widening\r\n\r\nof  drains, as well as the laying of culverts. In addition, there is  other\r\n\r\nwork like camp construction, repair of public stand-pipe platforms and  the\r\n\r\nslabbing  of  drains. This, Sir, has provided a lot of  amenities  for  the\r\n\r\nrural areas which are benefiting the rural folks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I wonder whether anybody did ask the question: How old are these 3,000\r\n\r\nodd members? As far as my recollection goes, they are all under 21. If I remember rightly,\r\n\r\nthe Work Bridage is especially intended for youths - so I understood from the hon. the Finance Minister. \r\n\r\nSo I take it that most of them are under 21. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always felt that, from the \r\n\r\nGovernment point of view, it is a desirable social project. But when one considers this desirable\r\n\r\nsocial project, one must weigh it against the background of the ultimate benefits which society derives \r\n\r\nfrom these social experiments. On the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI am inclined to view that, on balance, the State loses out on this. The position is that the Government takes in these boys either from school or two or three years after school, 18, 19, 20, 21. By taking them in and putting them to the type of work that they are being put, somebody else is being deprived of a job. That is most definite and certain. These people have normally been in charge of a family. They have been dependent on such type of work in order to maintain themselves and their own families. The direct effect of this social experiment is that you might keep some boys off the streets, but you are depriving one person who maintains two or three members of the family, and those persons are the direct sufferers as a result of this social scheme. If the social scheme is a success, at least one might say there are compensating benefits and therefore, perhaps, it is all right. But as against that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fairly clear from the break-up given by the Hon. the Minister for National Development that the maintenance charges connected with this Brigade far outweigh the direct work they put into all these projects. For instance, on the personal emoluments for the Singapore Work Brigade on page 143. Now, that, I take it, is the civil service organisation which is paid (and that comes to over $200,000 a year) to keep this Brigade ie function. Now, that is waste of money. These people, originally, were civil servants doing some other form of social good. I believe they were civil defence and civil fire brigade officers, or some thing like that. These officers who were responsible for civil defence and the civil fire brigade have been put into this. I notice from the break-up figures given by the Minister for National Development that the figure of $2 million for wages and the rest of it seems to be concerned mostly with utensils or articles used in these projects which in 2, 3 or 4 years' time will be written off completely, and it will be a waste of money. All these things could be better done if the Government went to tender and the people who have been normally doing these works could then do it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to give employment to 3,000, it seems to me we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  depriving another 3,000 of this employment, and those 3,000  not  only\r\n\r\nkeep themselves, but keep two or three others in addition to themselves. So\r\n\r\nI ask the Minister: is it really a worthwhile social experiment which, even\r\n\r\nif it does help these 3,000, only adds confusion and misery to 3,000 others\r\n\r\nand the 9,000 who are dependent on these 3,000? I think, on balance, it  is\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member for Farrer Park says\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould have substance if, in fact, creating the Work Brigade meant that it is worth an equivalent number of people who would be put out of job. Sir, I do not think his contention could be sustained by facts. Whether or not there is unemployment created by the Work Brigade could be judged by the level of activity in the construction industry - building of houses, levelling of land, building of roads and so on and so forth. We all know today, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the construction industry is going at full blast. In fact, the Government is always keeping an eye on building and construction costs to see that we do not over-stretch the industry with the result that we just pay higher prices for the same volume of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I do not think it can be said that the existence of the Work Brigade has brought about unemployment among other people. I may add this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sort of work given to the Work Brigade to perform would normally be the less urgent categories of public works which the Government could wait to be performed if funds were not available, or the designing and planning capacity of the Public Works Department were otherwise engaged, or if the construction industry itself could not cope with the work. We do not give to the Work Brigade the very urgent or top priority jobs. The P.W.D. have a number of long-term projects in hand for long-term improvements of roads, drainage, irrigation and such like. These are the projects which we give to the Brigade to perform. So, to sum up, they do not take away jobs from other people. There is a long-term addition to the amenities and services that Singapore has.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the claim by the Member for Hong Lim that his special squad\r\n\r\nperformed prodigious work-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes.

Why is it that some houses have numbers and the  other\r\n\r\nadjoining houses in the same locality do not have numbers yet? I would like\r\n\r\nclarification and an explanation from the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the normal procedure is that the application for\r\n\r\nhouse numbers goes to the Assessment\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  the Prime Minister's Ministry, but since the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan has inquired about this, I will say that I am not aware\r\n\r\nof  what  the position is like as far as his case is concerned.  But  the\r\n\r\nnormal  procedure  is that applications for house numbers  for  temporary\r\n\r\nbuildings go to the Assessment Department, the Assessment Department will\r\n\r\nrefer to the Chief Building Surveyor's Department of my Ministry, and the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor's Department, will send inspectors out to have  a\r\n\r\nlook  at  these houses and see whether they comply with the building  by-laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they comply with the building bylaws, then the Chief Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor  will  recommend  to  the Assessment  Department  to  issue  the\r\n\r\nlicence.  I  do not know whether these houses have the recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Building Surveyor, and I am not in a position to  answer  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member. But if he could give me details of these cases, I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  I  will look into them and see whether they comply with the building\r\n\r\nby-laws. If they do, they, will be recommended.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister is\r\n\r\naware  that  during  the time when the City Council was  under  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMayor,  rumours  went  round all over Singapore that  the  P.A.P. was  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the poor and that therefore they could build  houses  and\r\n\r\nthey would get numbers. Many poor people under that delusion built a  lot\r\n\r\nof  houses  and those that were lucky enough - I would not like to  suggest\r\n\r\nhow they got them, but they somehow managed to pull strings with the City\r\n\r\nCouncil - did  get  the  numbers at that time. As the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  has  said, there are some houses which have  numbers  but  the\r\n\r\nothers by their side do not have any numbers. This has gone on ever since\r\n\r\nthat  time, and until today the people living in such houses are dreading\r\n\r\nthat one of these days - especially in view of what has happened in Malcolm\r\n\r\nRoad - they will suffer the same fate. They were not the type of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  whom  the Prime Minister referred to as \"trying to beat  the  gun\".\r\n\r\nThey  were disillusioned at the time when the P.A.P. really had the reputation of working for the poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, would the Minister tell us what would happen to such people,\r\n\r\nespecially  if  they happen to have a mandatory order due to  no  fault  of\r\n\r\ntheir own? Could the Minister do something about it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. Just now I\r\n\r\nhave heard the Member for Mountbatten mention unauthorised structures, that\r\n\r\nsome  can  get  numbers  and  others cannot.  Was  it  perhaps  in  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan? To refresh the memory of the Member for Mountbatten, I think  in\r\n\r\nthose  days  Kampong Kembangan came under the control of  the  Rural  Board\r\n\r\nwhich  was  under the direct supervision of her colleague, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> On a point of information, Sir. I am talking about\r\n\r\nKampong Amber and not Kampong Kembangan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, there is a difference between houses built without\r\n\r\nthe  permission of the landlord and without proper plans, and  those  built\r\n\r\nwith the permission of the landlord. I think the Member for Mountbatten  is\r\n\r\nconfusing the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those cases in Kampong Amber - which are her problem - I have\r\n\r\nlooked  into  them  and found that these people were building  unauthorised\r\n\r\nhouses.  That is quite a different kettle of fish. If a man is prepared  to\r\n\r\nrisk  and  build  an  unauthorised house  without  the  permission  of  the\r\n\r\nlandlord, the Land Office, and the City Council, then he is, faced with two\r\n\r\ncourses  of  action. One is, that immediately it is discovered,  the  house\r\n\r\nwill  be  demolished. On the other hand, if he escapes the  notice  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Building  Surveyor, then when the time comes and it  is  discovered,\r\n\r\nthere  is a possibility that because of long occupation-the house will  not\r\n\r\nbe  pulled  down, but the process of law takes over, and that is a  summons\r\n\r\nwill be served on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe occupier to demolish the house.

The problem is of some importance. I will make the point as\r\n\r\nshortly and quickly as I can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a matter which comes under the control of the people under\r\n\r\nthis head. Sir, quite recently - over the last year or 18 months - there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a spate of building (if I may put it this way) in the backlanes  of\r\n\r\nthe  city, on the side-tables of roads, and sometimes on pavements.  They\r\n\r\nstart  off in a small way and end up with domestic living premises.  This\r\n\r\nis  a fact, Sir. Anybody who goes round town can see it. The only persons\r\n\r\nwho do not see it are the people working in this department. It is public\r\n\r\nknowledge  now. Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were a purely hawking  concern  -\r\n\r\nlittle  hawkers - one does not mind it so much. But this has become  a  big\r\n\r\nestablishment.  Now what is worse is that the establishment  is  changing\r\n\r\nhands  at  big  sums of money. The man has a goodwill in respect  of  the\r\n\r\npremises. He sells it to somebody. He goes and establishes somewhere else\r\n\r\nand then establishes a goodwill in respect of that;\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  goes  again somewhere else. This has become a good thriving  business.\r\n\r\nSir, one can carry this a little too far, and I ask the Minister not to let\r\n\r\nSingapore  go to ruin. Let us not build up problems today and  continue  to\r\n\r\nlet  them  grow,  which some other government has to tackle,  because  some\r\n\r\ngovernment must eventually tackle it. So I beg of the Government to step in\r\n\r\nand  solve  this  problem and not let it get out of hand so  that  it  will\r\n\r\neventually  become  a  social problem which some  agitators  use  to  upset\r\n\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing, Sir, which I want to bring quickly to the Minister is\r\n\r\nthis. We have discussed buildings on Crown lands. I would like to bring  to\r\n\r\nthe notice of the Minister buildings on private lands by similar persons on\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\nbig  scale - business enterprises that go in, develop quickly and sell.  They\r\n\r\ngo  in  and  then the owner and the Building Department are  unable  to  do\r\n\r\nanything  on  human  grounds. So the Minister should try  and  devise  some\r\n\r\nscheme  which  will  prevent  these building  operators  from  fooling  the\r\n\r\ninnocent public who go and buy them and so create a social problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, this problem of unauthorised building has become,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member for Farrer Park has said, mare and more serious. But  until\r\n\r\nsuch  time as the Local Government Integration Bill comes into force, there\r\n\r\nare  certain fields over which the Chief Building Surveyor's Department has\r\n\r\nno jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Farrer Park that we have looked into this\r\n\r\nquestion  very  carefully. In cases where we have to move  in  to  demolish\r\n\r\nsummarily,  we have been accused of being hard-hearted. But,  Sir,  without\r\n\r\nthe  proper  legislation, it is difficult for the Government to  carry  out\r\n\r\nwhat it\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwants  to  do;  that  is,  the control of unauthorised  buildings.

I  raised\r\n\r\nthis question previously in the last Estimates and the answer given  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  present Director of Public Works was being paid out  of  this\r\n\r\nvote on page 163. The\r\n\r\nquestion  I  then asked was whether it was intended that  one  of  these\r\n\r\nposts was to be abolished. I understand that the incumbent of this  post\r\n\r\nis being paid out\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the vote on page 163 - he calls himself the Director of Public Works  and\r\n\r\nnot  the  City Engineer. I think the two departments, insofar as  the  City\r\n\r\nEngineer's Department in the City Council and the Director of Public  Works\r\n\r\nare  concerned, have been sufficiently integrated in fact.  For  the  vote,\r\n\r\neither  one  or the other should disappear. But this is merely a formality.\r\n\r\nBut  what is more important is this. The holder of the post of Director  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Works is not a permanent official, because the person  who  is  now\r\n\r\nholding  the  post  of  Director of Public Works originally  was  the  City\r\n\r\nEngineer, under the previous administration of the Mayor of Singapore,  who\r\n\r\nwas  holding it on a temporary contract. So that legacy has been taken over\r\n\r\nby  the Government. The Director of Public Works is also being held against\r\n\r\nthe  post  on contract. Now directly under this officer, who is a  contract\r\n\r\nofficer,  there  are  a number of officers, architects and  engineers.  The\r\n\r\nposition  is  not  satisfactory from a staffing point of view  or  from  an\r\n\r\nestablishment point of view. I know there is frustration there. I  mean  no\r\n\r\ndisrespect  to  the holder of the post. There is absolutely  no  reason  to\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  he is an efficient man - I am not criticising that at  all.  But\r\n\r\nthey  feel  that  the situation of keeping such a person  as  head  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  for the last two or three years with permanent officials  under\r\n\r\nhim  is  a  frustrating  business. It is felt  that  this  officer  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently interested in the department's staffing, because he is only  a\r\n\r\ntemporary officer himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a permanent officer. He has no obligations to the department.\r\n\r\nHe  does  not  feel  that the department is his. And therefore  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  make up their minds - they must make this  post  a  permanent\r\n\r\npost. Unless they make it a permanent post and give this officer a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the department, there is going to be this  frustration.\r\n\r\nThe  Public Works Department is a very important department because  it  is\r\n\r\nthe spending arm of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment. If the spending arm of the Government is not fully geared  to\r\n\r\nall  the  projects, all the Government's intentions as  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget must necessarily fail. It is important that all the architects and\r\n\r\nengineers who are working under this officer should work happily. If they\r\n\r\ndo  not  work  happily, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is reflected in their  work.\r\n\r\nThat  is only human. I do ask the Minister to look into this and come  to\r\n\r\nsome  definite arrangement: either make this officer permanent, or if  he\r\n\r\ncannot be made permanent, then some other permanent arrangement should be\r\n\r\nmade.

Sometimes, Sir, things get to other  people's\r\n\r\nears which do not get to the ears of the person most responsible for it.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  know one or two cases which are frustrated. Sir, this  business\r\n\r\nof  working  under  a chief is a question of faith and loyalty.  It  is  as\r\n\r\nsimple  as  that  and as difficult as that. If one owes  loyalty  to  one's\r\n\r\nchief,  one works oneself to death practically to get the job done. But  if\r\n\r\none  has no loyalty, one has no faith, one has no friendship towards  one's\r\n\r\nchief, one just works to rule, and we know what work to rule means. Nothing\r\n\r\nmuch  gets done. That is the position so far as some people in the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department are concerned. I only mention this. But if  the  Minister\r\n\r\nthinks he does not want to investigate this further, well and good.  But  I\r\n\r\ndo  assure him that unless this loyalty moves from the staff to the head of\r\n\r\nthe  department, none of his works will be carried out in the way he  hoped\r\n\r\nand as he intended.

The Ministry is working very efficiently now.  The\r\n\r\nacting  Director of Medical Services was a City Council officer. He  was\r\n\r\nquite senior in the City Council service. In the process of integration,\r\n\r\nit  might not be possible for him to be appointed substantively  to  the\r\n\r\npost  of  Director  of  Medical  Services.  Even  if  he  was  appointed\r\n\r\nsubstantively, he would be absorbed on his existing City  Council  term\r\n\r\non  a  different salary scale. But what the Member for Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\nstated  is not how professional men behave. They are not concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  fact that their superiors are contract officers or not, so long  as\r\n\r\ntheir superiors are qualified and competent men. Once\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat is established, I think they are quite happy to serve under competent\r\n\r\ncontract officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not want to drag this on, for we might keep this\r\n\r\ngoing for well over an hour. I entirely agree with the Minister. I am also\r\n\r\na professional man and I know what professional reactions are. We all know,\r\n\r\nbut this is the point I want to make to the Minister: that the staff should\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied  in their own minds that they have a head of  department  who\r\n\r\nwill  fight for them and look after their interests. And that frame of mind\r\n\r\nis  more  easily  induced if the head of that department  is  a  permanent\r\n\r\nofficial.  That  is  the point I am trying to make,  not  the  point  about\r\n\r\nprofessional  jealousy. Let me put this way. If he is  a  contract  officer\r\n\r\nwith  one  year  more to go on his contract, he is not  going  to  get  too\r\n\r\ndifficult  with the Government. He is only human if he wants his  contract\r\n\r\nrenewed.  He is looking over his shoulder all the time. To the extent  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  looking  over  his shoulder, he is not fighting  the  case  of  his\r\n\r\nprofessional  officers. If once that feeling is created  in  a  department,\r\n\r\nthen  efficiency  is  gone.  That is all I  say.  I  am  as  interested  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  efficiency  of  the Public Works Department  as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself.  We  are  all involved in this. Therefore, I ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  seriously  making this post permanent. I am not  saying  anything\r\n\r\nelse.  I  am not saying this contract officer is inefficient. I  say:  make\r\n\r\nthis  a  permanent post. Let him not all the time think, \"Is  my  contract\r\n\r\ngoing  to be renewed next year or not?\" He will then know what the position\r\n\r\nin the Government is, that after permanent appointment he will be protected\r\n\r\nby the Public Service Commission. But a contract officer is not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I do not agree with the Member for Farrer Park on this\r\n\r\npoint, i.e. whether an officer is permanent or not does not ensure that  he\r\n\r\nwill  fight  for his staff.

To say\r\n\r\nthat an officer of the calibre of the Director of Public Works would go to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of doing things just to please the Government and  would  not\r\n\r\nfight for his subordinates is really unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just one further point on what the Member for Farrer Park has\r\n\r\nsaid, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Under  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment, Sir, the Report states that there is an extreme shortage among\r\n\r\nthe senior members of the staff of the Public Works Department, especially\r\n\r\nin  experienced engineers and architects. There is also an acute  shortage\r\n\r\namong  the  junior architects and a shortage of electrical and  mechanical\r\n\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Committee has made two recommendations. I wonder whether the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development can say whether these  recommendations\r\n\r\nare  being implemented. One of the recommendations is that these technical\r\n\r\nexperts  should not be made to do administrative chores. They  have  recom\r\n\r\nmended,  therefore, that the post of Administrative Officer in the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department, which was abolished in January 1958, be restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also recommended that, since the present terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice  are  not  sufficiently  favourable  to  attract  experienced  men,\r\n\r\nsomething  should be done about senior posts. They also stated,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board offers better terms than the Public Works Department.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  the fact that the Public Works Department is the technical  agent\r\n\r\nfor various Ministries, it is very important, therefore, that steps must be\r\n\r\ntaken to strengthen this Department, otherwise the money, that we vote  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment may not be spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, when I answered the previous question, I had\r\n\r\nalready touched on the question of shortage of technical staff, both senior\r\n\r\nand junior, in the Public Works Depart\r\n\r\nment.  As regards the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into  the\r\n\r\nConstructional  Capacity of Singapore, its recommendation  to  restore  the\r\n\r\npost of Administrative Officer has been implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the remuneration offered in the Public Works Department\r\n\r\ndoes  not  attract  young people who have come out from  universities  with\r\n\r\ntheir degrees. To this end we have already made adjustments to the point of\r\n\r\nentry of such salary scales.

It may well be that if I do not remind the Minister that the  work\r\n\r\nis important, then maybe the Commission might be abolished. I suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  be  allowed  to continue.

I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to one point, i.e.,\r\n\r\nthat  I  believe that there should not only be public street lighting,  but\r\n\r\nkampong  lighting  as  well  in the lorongs that  have  been  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Most of the kampong lighting facilities, however, have overhead\r\n\r\nwires  which  are  naked. There was an accident in the past  because  these\r\n\r\nnaked wires snapped, as a result, a child in the kampong was injured. If we\r\n\r\ndo  wish to provide lighting facilities in the kampongs, I feel the  safety\r\n\r\nof  the  kampong folks must also be taken into account. One  of  the  steps\r\n\r\nwhich I think should be taken, if there is no other alternative but to  use\r\n\r\nnaked   wires   overhead,  is,  at  least  to  fell  the  adjacent   trees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lighting facilities have already been installed  in  the\r\n\r\nkampongs.  The  trees, however, have not been felled. In the  interests  of\r\n\r\npublic  safety  in the kampongs I think this matter should receive  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration from the department concerned. At least those trees which are\r\n\r\nconsidered dangerous must be felled or other alternative arrangements made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member for the Southern Islands\r\n\r\nthat  the welfare and the safety of the kampong folks should be safeguarded\r\n\r\nand, in this respect, Sir, if he could bring specific examples of where the\r\n\r\ndanger would come from, I will certainly look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Is it the intention of the Minister that I\r\n\r\nshould submit specific cases before the Government will take action to fell\r\n\r\nthese trees which are in line with the wires?

As we\r\n\r\nknow, the Out-patient Departments in the hospitals have been overworked. It\r\n\r\nwas  the general policy of the P.A.P. Government to make sure that if  they\r\n\r\never came into power, the facilities for the Out-patient Departments would\r\n\r\nbe  improved  so that the general health of the people would  not  only  be\r\n\r\nlooked  after  but  that  it  would  also  be  attended  to  swiftly   and\r\n\r\nefficiently.  Now because of the unfulfilled promises of 1960,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, $3.7 million from the Ministry of Health has not been used.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  that, the out-patient service has not been improved. There  was\r\n\r\ngeneral  talk of having combined clinics, poly-clinics and the Kallang  out\r\n\r\ndoor  dispensaries. But what do we see? Only a token sum has been spent  on\r\n\r\nall  this. In the case of the combined clinics, two are supposed  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  built; but one was actually a conversion from some other  building - I\r\n\r\nbelieve it was a community centre. Only one, Sir, was actually built.  This\r\n\r\nshows  what  service  the P.A.P. Government has given  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as regards outpatient service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering, Sir, if the Government would care to look into\r\n\r\nthese matters and make sure that the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout-patient  service would be improved so that all the people - especially\r\n\r\nthe  poor - in  Singapore would not have to wait for hours and  hours  for\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring up is this matter of direction finding. I\r\n\r\nsee it is already earmarked in the Development Estimates, but this scheme\r\n\r\nwas  raised  by  Assemblymen in the P.A.P. quite some time  ago.  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain.  A  lot of people who visit the General Hospital for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime  do  not  know  how  to  go to the Surgical  Wards,  Medical  Wards,\r\n\r\nOrthopaedic Wards, Out-patient Department or even the Mortuary.  What  we\r\n\r\nwould  like,  Sir, is that the Ministry take note of this and  when  they\r\n\r\nreally  start  on this direction - finding scheme - if that  is  the  actual\r\n\r\nscheme  that is earmarked in the Development Estimates - then we hope  they\r\n\r\nwill  make large simple signs or symbols so that any person will be  able\r\n\r\nto find the place he wants to go to. We want to make sure that any person - whether  he be Chinese, English, Malay or Indian - will be able  to  locate\r\n\r\nthe place that he wishes to go to. If, for example, we could have a large\r\n\r\ndrawing  of  an eye for the Eye Department, everybody will be  helped  in\r\n\r\nfinding the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is the dental service. As we\r\n\r\nknow,  there is only one adult dental service in the whole of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is centred in the General Hospital. We have seen crowds waiting  from\r\n\r\nearly morning until the afternoon to be attended to, and we know of cases\r\n\r\nwhere  people  have to wait for at least one year in order to  get  their\r\n\r\ndentures  made. We know that certain people like the Minister for  Health\r\n\r\ncould get things done more easily because he has enough \"pull\". But there\r\n\r\nare  a  lot of people who have to wait for a very long time. We hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  look into this matter and expedite all services  to;  the\r\n\r\npublic as regards the Dental Department. Of course, this is partly due to\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of dental officers and dental technicians. We would suggest\r\n\r\nthat in future, if the Government should decide on any district hospitals\r\n\r\nor poly-clinics, a dental wing be put in so that everybody would\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbe  served more easily. As regards the dental service, I would also like to\r\n\r\nmention  that there is a complaint of a lack of post-graduate opportunities\r\n\r\nfor   advancement  for  the  whole  Dental  Service  as  well  as  for  the\r\n\r\ntechnicians.  There  have  been no post-graduate  study  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ndental  officers since 1959. As a result, a number of them  have  resigned,\r\n\r\nand  in  such  a  small dental service, the small number who  resigned  has\r\n\r\ncaused a certain amount of dislocation in the service. We hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill look into that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a very unhappy subject, and that is in respect\r\n\r\nof  the Japanese doctors. It is a subject in which the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nis interested.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is a lot of unhappiness and misunderstanding at\r\n\r\nthe present moment amongst the local staff in the hospitals.

I\r\n\r\ndo  not  mean we should emphasise the fact that they are Japanese,  but  it\r\n\r\njust  happens  that  they are Japanese. I will give you one  example,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThere  is  one  doctor  now  in  the Pathological  Laboratory  who  has  no\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the  work  he  is supposed to  do.  In  fact - so  far  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir - he is not up to local standards. He has been used to  doing\r\n\r\na certain type of work that requires electron-microscopy, but unfortunately\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  they have to use only the ordinary light microscope  and  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular field of work, he is not as efficient or as  qualified  as\r\n\r\nour  own local men. In fact, Sir, this particular doctor is now doing post-mortem  work  for  the first time. In other words, we are inviting  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  Japan in order that we may train them. On top of that, Sir, they also\r\n\r\nhave no experience\r\n\r\nof  medico-legal work, so that in anything concerning the courts, they have\r\n\r\nto  ask for advice. In fact, this particular person was transferred to  the\r\n\r\nTrafalgar\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHome.

But they do not have the experience of our local  doctors\r\n\r\nand  they come here to be trained by our local doctors! Surely, Sir, this\r\n\r\nis entirely different from what we have been told.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against the principle of recruitment of foreign doctors.

But we urge the Government to make sure that if they\r\n\r\nwant  to  recruit people from outside Singapore, they recruit  the  proper\r\n\r\nmen,  men who can teach us something. Do not let them be men whom we  have\r\n\r\nto teach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point about these foreign doctors, Sir, and it is this:\r\n\r\nthat in any department a certain number of people [Laughter].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

A certain number of doctors are assigned to every Unit, and if a\r\n\r\nnon-Singapore doctor is assigned to that particular Unit,  it  means  one\r\n\r\nlocal  doctor is deprived of the opportunity of learning things  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular   Unit.   We  realise,  Sir,  that  non-local, doctors   are\r\n\r\nsupernumerary. But in spite of that, only a certain number of people  can\r\n\r\nbe assigned to any one Unit or any one Department, and because of, say\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nX  occupying  the place in a particular Unit a local doctor is denied  that\r\n\r\nopportunity.  And it means, Sir, the loss of opportunity  of  training  and\r\n\r\nexperience  for  the local men. We hope the Minister will  also  look  into\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Sir, a letter has been sent inviting all nursing sisters who\r\n\r\nresigned  as a result of the pay cut to rejoin the service. They have  been\r\n\r\noffered  the same basic salary as when they left the service. To  that,  we\r\n\r\nagree. It is a very good thing. But -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Could the Member for Queenstown tell me on what\r\n\r\ncriterion he would distinguish a nursing sister who resigned as  a  result\r\n\r\nof the pay cut, from one who resigned as a result of marriage, or from one\r\n\r\nwho resigned for other reasons?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is no elucidation, Sir. He has puzzled me more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am asking you to distinguish -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not waste time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But these nursing sisters, Sir, are only asked to do\r\n\r\nduty  from 8 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the afternoon,  whereas\r\n\r\nthose  who have been faithful to the service and who have remained in spite\r\n\r\nof  the pay cut are asked to do night duty. Now, we are not going into  the\r\n\r\npros and cons of this matter, Sir. Probably there are reasons for it; we do\r\n\r\nnot   know.   We  hope  the  Minister  can  enlighten  us.  But   this   is\r\n\r\ndiscrimination, and any discrimination can only engender resentment. Let us\r\n\r\nhope this resentment will not cause more resignations later on, because  it\r\n\r\nonly  means  that our health service will be depleted of more  sisters  and\r\n\r\nmore nurses. Although this seems to be a small matter, we hope it will  not\r\n\r\ngo unnoticed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also understand, Sir, that the nursing service at the present moment\r\n\r\nis  actually short of staff nurses. Since such a generous offer has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  to the nursing sister, would the Minister not also consider making\r\n\r\nthe  same offer to those staff nurses who left because of the pay cut and\r\n\r\nwho wish to rejoin?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one more matter to raise, Sir, and this I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncould  explain,  especially  in regard to,  this  so-called  merger.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, that Federal citizens can get permanent employment  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  medical service, but this does not  hold  true  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen who wants to get into the Federation medical  service.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no equality as regards opportunities offered to the\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  and' the Federation citizen.  If  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law would care to get details from me later on, I  am  quite\r\n\r\nwilling to give him examples and the names of people, especially in  the\r\n\r\ndental  service, who have not been able to get jobs in Singapore because\r\n\r\nthose  jobs have been taken up by Federation citizens, and yet Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  have  not been able to get a chance in the Federation  medical\r\n\r\nservice.  This alone shows, Sir, how important it is that we  get  equal\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member for Queenstown is not going\r\n\r\non  that  tack.  The  complaint, I think,  should  be  confined  to  his\r\n\r\nallegation  that  Singapore citizens cannot be employed  in  the  Health\r\n\r\nDepartment in the Federation. That is all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the Minister for Health and Law will not\r\n\r\ndeny what I have said, Sir,I can give him facts if he likes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the, health\r\n\r\npolicy, we cannot forget what the P.A.P. promised the electorate in  the\r\n\r\n1959  general  elections. This could be read from the  pamphlet  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  There is a statement on the Government's health policy  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  present  Minister  for Home Affairs to the people  during  election\r\n\r\ntime. He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Within the next five years, the Health policy of the P.A.P. government\r\n\r\nwill be to make improvements to the existing health\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem so that the benefit from public expenditure on health will go\r\n\r\nprincipally to the board masses of Singapore. It cannot be denied that in\r\n\r\nSingapore the medical situation leaves room for improvement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This passage is very important. If we pay attention to Government's work in\r\n\r\nregard  to health, we can easily find out that Government has done only  20\r\n\r\nper  cent of the work as provided in the Estimates. In 1959 it promised the\r\n\r\npeople  many things in regard to health, but the Government has not carried\r\n\r\nout its promises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to mention is that a few months ago, strange to\r\n\r\nsay,  there  was a lot of mosquitoes around my house. I remember  I  raised\r\n\r\nthis  point with the Minister concerned. I asked him whether this  was  the\r\n\r\nresult  of abolishing the Anti-Mosquito Unit. Otherwise how could there  be\r\n\r\nso  many mosquitoes around my area? So I hope the Minister will pay special\r\n\r\nattention to this point, because it does not only concern me but some other\r\n\r\nareas may also be affected by mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister should be given time to reply.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just trying to be help\r\n\r\nful.  There was mention about helping the poor people to find their way  to\r\n\r\nthe different departments. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to\r\n\r\nwhat  is  done  in S.A.T.A., which he might like to adopt. They  just  have\r\n\r\nlines - black lines, white lines, red lines, for instance  - that lead  to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  departments. And the poor people have just to  be  told  by  the\r\n\r\ndoctor,  \"Follow the black line\" or \"Follow the red line and it  will  lead\r\n\r\nyou to the right department.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I just want to ask the Minister what he intends\r\n\r\nto  do  or  has he done anything about the dirt in the drains that  I  have\r\n\r\ncomplained about?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first deal with the complaint by the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown that though we have been in the government for  the\r\n\r\npast  two  years, their has been very little done in the way of  building\r\n\r\nclinics,  outpatient clinics and combined clinics. Sir, he must  remember\r\n\r\nthat  a doctor was the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\nHe  was the political head who must bear the responsibility for all this,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have looked through the files and I\r\n\r\nknow  the position. I shall indicate what has happened, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  only  clinic we have completed is the clinic at Lim Ah  Pin  Road  in\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon. There was a community centre in Lim Ah Pin Road and  next\r\n\r\ndoor to it there was an ante-natal clinic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An approach was made to me, when I was Minister for Labour, to release\r\n\r\nthat community centre and convert it into an outpatient clinic. That  was\r\n\r\ndone.  That community centre was given to the Medical Department  and  it\r\n\r\nwas converted into a clinic. By the time the conversion was completed, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  was able to build a new community centre opposite  Lim  Ah  Pin\r\n\r\nRoad. That was about the 40th community centre we built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other clinic that is being built is the clinic in\r\n\r\nStill  Road.  It will provide outpatient as well as maternity  and  child\r\n\r\nwelfare services. There will be a dental hut in that clinic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have been in the Ministry, I have met all the\r\n\r\ndoctors  concerned with planning. We have devised plans for  stepping  up\r\n\r\nthe  building  of outpatient clinics. We have zoned the island  off  into\r\n\r\nfive  major districts, with the main thoroughfares as dividers. One  zone\r\n\r\nwill be all the area east of Geylang/Changi Roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the present moment, extension work is going on at\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang/Mountbatten  Road Clinic. That used  to  be  the  old  Civil\r\n\r\nAirport canteen. It has been extended to double\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nits  size. It copes with about 600 patients every day. It is the  biggest\r\n\r\noutdoor clinic after the General Hospital Outpatient Clinic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building outpatient clinics at this very moment. Plans are\r\n\r\nafoot  to transform the Siglap Community Centre into an outpatient clinic.\r\n\r\nWe  have  plans also to build another outpatient clinic in Somapah Road  at\r\n\r\nChangi.  The  Still  Road clinic is in the course of  construction  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment. Once we get those clinics built, we will zone off the East\r\n\r\ncoast  area,  so that all persons who want treatment and who live  in  that\r\n\r\narea  will  receive their outpatient treatment at the clinics  within  that\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose also to build clinics in the housing estates. One will be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in Aljunied Road Estate. In the Serangoon Road district, we  propose\r\n\r\nto  .build  a clinic at Yio Chu Kang. There is a very small and old  clinic\r\n\r\nnow at the junction of Paya Lebar and Yio Chu Kang Roads. But that junction\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be turned into a roundabout very soon, and we will  probably\r\n\r\nlose  that  clinic. We, therefore, propose to build another one further  up\r\n\r\nthe  road. Further up in Kampong Kayu, a clinic has already been built.  We\r\n\r\npropose  also  to  build a clinic in the Thomson Road area,  an  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinic  in  the  grounds  of the Thomson Road Hospital.  In  the  Sembawang\r\n\r\ndistrict an outpatient clinic will be built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah area, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already a small\r\n\r\noutpatient unit, and a maternity and child welfare clinic at the corner  of\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah  Road and the junction of Bukit Batok Road. It is proposed  to\r\n\r\nbuild a big outpatient clinic in the vacant ground behind the maternity and\r\n\r\nchild  welfare  clinic at Bukit Timah Road. There is already an  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinic in Bukit Panjang. We are also going into J wrong Road. We propose to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  small outpatient clinic at the 16th mile. The Thong  Ho  Village\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre is being converted now into a maternity and child  welfare\r\n\r\nand  outpatient clinic. Along Pasir Panjang Road, there is a maternity  and\r\n\r\nchild welfare clinic at Kampong Kay Hai Road. An outpatient\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclinic  is  at  the  5th milestone, Pasir Panjang. We  propose  to  build\r\n\r\nanother  new outpatient clinic in the area of the Harbour Board. Once  we\r\n\r\nget  these clinics built, we will zone off these five areas, and  require\r\n\r\nall the people who need treatment to have it at the clinics in one of the\r\n\r\nfive  areas  where they live. That will reduce the pressure  on  the  Out\r\n\r\npatient  Clinic  in the General Hospital. The Outpatient  Clinic  at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  attends to about 3,000 patients  a  day.  It  is  very\r\n\r\ncongested  and  treats  besides  outpatients,  patients  in  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to this unhappy state of affairs in the\r\n\r\noutpatient  clinics, there is also tremendous congestion in  the  various\r\n\r\nmedical and surgical units in the General Hospital, so much so that these\r\n\r\nunits  themselves  have  their own problems as  far  as  outpatients  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  These  medical  units  have  to  have  their  own  in-service\r\n\r\noutpatient  facilities. So to relieve that congestion, we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nprovide a third medical unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose also to get all the chronic sick out of the General Hospital\r\n\r\ninto the new Chronic Sick Hospital which is to be built in the Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital  grounds.  In  fact  there are two vacant  wards  which  we  are\r\n\r\nconverting right now into a chronic sick hospital So, that would  relieve\r\n\r\nthe bed space in the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope in the course of this year the situation will\r\n\r\nhave considerably improved as far as outpatient facilities are concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as to direction finding notices, Mr Speaker, Sir. The suggestion\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  that  I should have a look at the direction  notices  in\r\n\r\nS.A.T.A. I hope to go round and see what these notices are like. We might\r\n\r\nintroduce  these improvements in the General Hospital and  in  the  other\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the dental services are concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\ntrue  most of the facilities are at present concentrated in the  General\r\n\r\nHospital,  although,  there  has been some dispersal.  There  have  been\r\n\r\ndental chairs provided in community centres. I have seen dental\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nchairs  for children at the Sims Avenue Community Centre as well as at  the\r\n\r\nBuona  Vista Community Centre and at the schools. I will have to look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter. In the short time that I have been in the Ministry, I have had\r\n\r\nsuch  a lot of work to do that I really have not had the time to give  this\r\n\r\nmy personal attention. But I can assure the Member for Queenstown that this\r\n\r\nquestion will not be overlooked. I will look into it immediately. I was not\r\n\r\naware  that  there  was  a complaint that there were not  sufficient  post-graduate  scholarships for dental officers. I will look  into  this  matter\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Japanese doctors, Mr Speaker, Sir, I know it is true this has\r\n\r\ncaused considerable dissatisfaction amongst our local doctors. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  at  one time there was a shortage of highly skilled medical officers.\r\n\r\nWe thought we should try to get specialists from overseas to come and train\r\n\r\nour  local officers. We have been able to recruit two, very skilled Israeli\r\n\r\ndoctors  who  are  holding  specialist  superscale  appointments   in   the\r\n\r\nBacteriological  and the Pathology Departments and are doing  good  service\r\n\r\nthere. They have improved conditions in these Departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third Israeli doctor is serving as a Senior Registrar. We had hoped to,\r\n\r\nget four Senior Registrars from Israeli. In point of fact, we have only got\r\n\r\none. Another Israeli doctor was offered appointment, but he has turned down\r\n\r\nthe  offer.  I do, not think there is any possibility of getting  any  more\r\n\r\nIsraeli  doctors. As far as Japanese doctors are concerned,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nable to get five of them. From the reports I have received, one of them  is\r\n\r\nof  Senior  Registrar  standard. I do not think the others  are  of  Senior\r\n\r\nRegistrar  standard. At most, they are of the same standard as our  medical\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Below.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With regard to the doctor from the Pathology Department, as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  I  heard  he  was a misfit there, I took steps  to  send  him  to\r\n\r\nTrafalgar Home.

As  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation  I  had, received from our  local  doctors,  I  met  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Consul and explained the position to him. I told him  that  if\r\n\r\nany more doctors, were to come from Japan, I wanted an assurance that we\r\n\r\nwould  get  doctors  of  the competence and experience  we  require.  He\r\n\r\nassured me that if the Japanese sent us any more doctors, they would be\r\n\r\nof the competence and experience that we require.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these Japanese doctors have come in to help us and\r\n\r\nare  here  through  no fault of their own. We have offered  them  Senior\r\n\r\nRegistrar  terms  and they get on well with our doctors.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nblocking  the  promotions  of  our  local  doctors.  They  are   filling\r\n\r\nsupernumerary posts of Senior Registrars. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  32\r\n\r\nposts of Senior Registrar on our establishment dispersed throughout  our\r\n\r\nhospitals.  We  have  18  senior local officers who  have  already  been\r\n\r\nappointed Senior Registrars. We have another 17 local doctors  who  have\r\n\r\njust come back with the requisite specialist qualifications and who are\r\n\r\nqueuing  up  for appointment as Senior Registrars. These  vacancies  are\r\n\r\nbeing circulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided funds to employ all our doctors who have received\r\n\r\nhigher  training abroad as Senior Registrars. They cannot complain  they\r\n\r\nare  being done out of jobs by the presence of these Israeli doctors and\r\n\r\nJapanese, doctors now in service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter raised was the recruitment of sisters at new rates of\r\n\r\npay. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have an authorised establishments of 211 posts\r\n\r\nfor  nursing sisters, and the number of persons in these posts  is  136,\r\n\r\nleaving  a  vacancy  position of 75. In the  establishment  for  trained\r\n\r\nnurses,  there is an authorised establishment of 1,175 posts..  We  have\r\n\r\n1,021 persons in these posts, leaving a vacancy position of 154.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion in the medical service, Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nenvisage that we would need to create another\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n14  posts  of nursing sister, so that the vacancy position will be  89  for\r\n\r\nnursing  sisters. For trained nurses, we would need to create  another  144\r\n\r\nposts, so\r\n\r\nthat the vacancy position will be 298.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have an establishment of 550 assistant nurses. We have 530\r\n\r\npersons  in  those posts, leaving 20 posts vacant. With such a big  vacancy\r\n\r\nposition,  something has had to, be done to attract back into  the  service\r\n\r\nall  those  who had left the service. With that end in view,  we  sent  out\r\n\r\ninvitations asking all sisters and staff nurses who had left the service to\r\n\r\ncome  back.  Many of them had left the service on marriage and  we  thought\r\n\r\nthat  if  we offered them employment in the outpatient services where  they\r\n\r\nwould  not have to do night work, they would be prepared to return  to  the\r\n\r\nservice.  Seventy letters were sent out and to date, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to re-employ 12 temporary sisters and 8  temporary  staff\r\n\r\nnurses.  One  more temporary sinter and three more temporary  staff  nurses\r\n\r\nhave  told us they will be prepared to come back at the beginning  of  next\r\n\r\nyear. So that in that effort we were able to get only 20 more persons  into\r\n\r\nthe  service. We have had to offer them some inducement to come  back.  We\r\n\r\nhave offered that all those who have had service of less than a year would\r\n\r\ncome  back on their previous salary plus the cost of living allowance  they\r\n\r\nget  now.  All those who had left the service between one and  three  years\r\n\r\nshould  get  one  additional increment as an inducement to come  back.  All\r\n\r\nthose  who  had  left the service for over three years should  receive  two\r\n\r\nadditional increments. With this inducement, Mr Speaker, Sir, none of them\r\n\r\nwho  come back into the service can ever supersede those who are at present\r\n\r\nin the service. So that those who are in service cannot complain that these\r\n\r\ninducements  are  unfair. We have had to offer this inducements  and,  even\r\n\r\nwith  this offer, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have only been able to get  20  back\r\n\r\ninto the service. I have already indicated what the vacancy position is - 89\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvacancies for sisters and 298 vacancies for staff nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will notice, there are two minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I see. Well, the last point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the appointment of Federal citizens. This affects  not  only\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  nurses,  but it also affects other officers  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  The  rules  for entry are such that only Federal  citizens  can\r\n\r\nenter  the  Federal civil service, whereas in Singapore,  those  who  are\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens can also enter the Singapore civil service. I  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer the point the Member for Queenstown has made just now. He says  we\r\n\r\nare  taking  Federal citizens into the Singapore civil  service  in  such\r\n\r\nnumbers  that  our own locally qualified persons are being  done  out  of\r\n\r\njobs.
