On 30th October 1996, the Australian Parliament unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution introduced by Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley denouncing racial intolerance. When the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for the Environment and I went to Canberra for the inaugural meeting of the Singapore-Australia Joint Committee from 30th to 31st October 1996, the Australian Foreign Minister and his colleagues expressed their regrets to us over any racial harassment against Singaporeans. From our discussions with them, we are satisfied with the assurances they have given us that they do not tolerate such incidents and that they will take whatever measures necessary to protect Singaporeans and other foreigners who are visiting or residing there.

It would be very difficult for GIC to monitor from the performance itself because the amount would be small relative to the total funds managed. I would like to point out that when a fund of a sizeable amount is managed by a fund manager, normally the performance depends on market conditions and the ability to earn a return based on their investment portfolios. If the company is doing reasonably well, to be able to identify malfeasance on the part of a particular trader is extremely difficult.

This has happened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendaki has generous study loans and scholarship schemes to help Malay families who have genuine difficulties paying the partial or full fees. No Malay student admitted to our polytechnics or universities has been deprived of the opportunity to go to these institutions because of this scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, the Government also gives out Edusave Merit Bursaries and the Edusave Scholarships in schools, ITEs, polytechnics and universities. These are also open to Malay students. They will alleviate the financial burden of households who also have children in school and other educational institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money saved from the TTFS Scheme goes to Mendaki, not the Government. It has helped Mendaki to fund programmes to help many more less successful members of the Malay community who are in need of help. These include the Weekend Tuition Scheme and the Learning Support Programme for Normal stream students. The Mendaki Awards are also funded from these savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the income ceilings for the TTFS Scheme would mean cutting back on these other activities which have played an important part in raising education standards of the community. This would not benefit the Malay community in the long term. Mendaki therefore has no plans to raise the income ceilings for the TTFS Scheme at the present moment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, could the Minister get Mendaki to consider, on a per capita basis, the number of children that is going to university?

Would the Minister please comment on that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> On the second question whether a family with an income of $2,000 and one child in university is better off than a family earning above $3,000 but with five school-going children, it really depends on the actual expenditure of the family. A person could be earning thousands of dollars a month but the expenditure may be high. This is also tied up to the Member's first question, ie, whether we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> do consider the per capita income. The answer is, we do. In other words, we look at each case on its own merits. Those whose income is $2,000 and below will be given full subsidy whereas those whose income is between $2,000 and $3,000 the subsidy will vary up to 70% and this will take into consideration the per capita expenditure of the children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> In that case, could Mendaki consider favourably applicants whose family income is more than $3,000 and who are not qualified for this scheme so that they could be given the subsidy if they have, say, a few children who are in university or school? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would not give a definite answer to this simply because we have to look at each individual case closely.

Our review indicated that despite the 25% foreign worker dependency ceiling, Town Councils still face a shortage of manpower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our review also indicated that there is still scope for further mechanisation, automation and application of labour reduction methods in cleaning and refuse collection work. New technologies that reduce manpower requirements have not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been fully exploited in Singapore, compared to developed countries. Our strategy should therefore be to step up our mechanisation efforts and look into areas to reduce manpower needs in the industry. Liberalising the supply of unskilled non-traditional source (NTS) labour should not be our only or long-term solution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, to achieve the long-term objectives and yet meet the short-term needs of Town Council cleaning contractors, my Ministry has decided to implement a special scheme to enable some Town Council cleaning contractors to employ foreign workers from non-traditional sources. Under the scheme, Town Council cleaning contractors that are registered with the Construction Industry and Development Board and have at least $500,000 paid-up capital will be allowed to employ a limited number of NTS workers. They are also required to have an investment of at least $100,000 in labour-saving equipment. Eligible Town Council contractors will be allowed to hire NTS workers depending on the number of housing units they are servicing and subject to a 25% dependency ceiling. The levy for these NTS workers will be $440 per worker monthly, in line with the levy for a majority of other NTS workers. The Town Council cleaning contractors must also undertake to provide housing for NTS workers, that is, proper accommodation, and not temporary structures at work site or in estates, or in non-residential premises such as bin compounds or utility rooms in the HDB flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will be consulting MND, HDB and Town Councils on the implementation details. I expect the scheme to be ready in three to four months' time. I hope that this measure will help Town Councils meet their short-term needs for more cleaning workers without undermining the long-term objectives of upgrading the industry, increasing its productivity and reducing its manpower requirement. Finally, I also hope that Singaporeans living in public \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> housing estates will take it upon themselves to keep their estates clean.

Getting more people to use public transport is key to having smooth flowing roads. Over the years, our public transport has improved significantly. We need to raise awareness of this and improve the image of public transport so that more people are encouraged and persuaded to use it. The publicity campaign is a joint effort between the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and all public transport operators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car companies spend a great deal of time, money and effort packaging their cars as a superior class of transport and as status symbols. Public transport operators must not only strive to continuously improve their service but also market the improvements made. They must offer public transport as a viable transport alternative, otherwise the public will increasingly believe that cars are the only means of convenient and comfortable travel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With higher ridership, bus operators can operate more direct bus routes, and the Government can justify the expansion of the MRT and LRT network. If the campaign succeeds in persuading more people to use public transport, we will be able to build a better public transport system for Singaporeans.

Copies of the Command Paper are placed on Members' seats in the Chamber. The notice required under Standing Orders of the allotted day for consideration in the Committee of Supply has also been submitted to the Clerk of Parliament this morning and the allotted day will be 11th December 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed that pursuant to Article 148(B)(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, Parliament will approve the Estimates tabled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sum to be appropriated under the vote on account is $11.399 billion. This is to meet projected operating and development outlays in the first five months of FY97/98, that is, over the period 1st April 1997 to 31st August 1997. Of this total sum, $4.771 billion is to be appropriated from the Consolidated Fund for operating outlays, with the remaining $6.628 billion to be appropriated from the Development Fund for development project expenditures and loans to statutory boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 65 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the present Parliament stands dissolved on 5th January 1997, five years after its first sitting on 5th January 1992, unless it is dissolved at an earlier date by the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has indicated that he would like the present Parliament to run its full term of five years. He could call for the dissolution of Parliament in the first week of January 1997 or allow Parliament's mandate to run out on 5th \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> January 1997. In either case, under Article 66 of the Constitution, a General Election would have to be called within three months of Parliament's dissolution, that is to say, before 5th April 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From past experience, after the elections we will need about two months for the Government to formulate its programmes for the new term of office and for the President's Address and debate thereon. Thereafter, there will be a break of one month before the Government presents its FY97/98 Budget proposals to Parliament. The debate on the Budget Statement and the proceedings of the Committee of Supply which follow will take another three weeks or so. Overall, this process will take about four months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Prime Minister chooses to call for elections immediately after the dissolution of Parliament in the first week of January 1997, the President's approval of the FY97/98 budget can only be obtained towards the middle or end of May 1997. Legislative authority to make payments and drawdowns against the Consolidated and Development Funds will in the meantime have lapsed on 31st March 1997. However, if the Prime Minister decides to defer the holding of fresh elections until nearer 5th April 1997, the approval of the FY97/98 Budget will correspondingly be delayed until the middle or end of August 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for expenditures that need to be incurred between 1st April 1997 and the approval of a new Budget for FY97/98, I am tabling Estimates containing a vote on account to be approved by the present Parliament. The vote on account is for $11.399 billion, or 21.2% of the FY97/98 estimates, to cover projected outlays over the 5-month period from 1st April 1997 to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 31st August 1997. The amount requested is 95.7% of actual total outlays over the same period in FY96. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not misunderstand the amount requested under the vote on account to be a signal that the elections will be held later than earlier. This is only to provide the Prime Minister with flexibility should he decide not to hold the elections earlier. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, a vote on account is not without precedent in Singapore. In December 1961, the then Finance Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, secured a vote on account for the first half of FY63 amounting to 55% of the Estimates for FY62. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum approved under the vote on account will form part of the Estimates of Expenditure for FY97/98 when these are subsequently tabled for Parliament's approval. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Property Tax Act (Chapter 254 of the 1985 Revised Edition)\", recommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament; and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Government Proceedings Act (Chapter 121 of the 1985 Revised Edition)\", presented by the Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament; and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES REPORT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion* is to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approve the recommendations of the Committee of Privileges.
