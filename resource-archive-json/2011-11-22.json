funding and programmes are delivered through our Community\r\nDevelopment Councils (CDCs). ComCare beneficiaries are a diverse\r\nmix of needy Singaporeans who need different forms of assistance\r\nand for varying periods of time. Examples include elderly persons who\r\nare unable to work and need long-term assistance, families who require\r\nshort-term help because the breadwinners have been retrenched from\r\ntheir jobs, families with members recovering from chronic illnesses\r\nand parents who require financial support so that their children\r\ncan attend preschool. ComCare complements other support which the\r\nbeneficiary may receive from his family as well as the help provided\r\nby various other help agencies in the community.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e5c130a0-b585-43a2-b39d-9854438c2f82\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-e5c130a0-b585-43a2-b39d-9854438c2f82\"><!--a--></a>Mrs Lina Chiam asked about\r\nthe amount of help each beneficiary receives each month. CDC officers\r\nwill look at each individual's or family's circumstances, including factors\r\nsuch as household size and composition. Depending on the specific circumstances,\r\nthe CDCs put together a package of assistance to address their needs. The\r\nhelp can be in form of cash assistance, free or subsidised medical\r\ncare, vouchers for food, rental, utilities, service and conservancy\r\ncharges, and preschool and student care subsidies. Because of this,\r\nit is not meaningful to provide an average figure on how much each\r\nbeneficiary receives per month. However, we can give some typical examples.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8e5cecff-1d15-4e44-9d0d-a2e7f877fdef\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-8e5cecff-1d15-4e44-9d0d-a2e7f877fdef\"><!--a--></a>For a family of four, where\r\nthe male breadwinner with a homemaker wife and two preschool age\r\nchildren has recently lost his job, his family may be provided with\r\n$600 a month in cash allowances as well as vouchers for utilities\r\nand service and conservancy charges for three months. In addition,\r\nhis children can receive up to $340 a month each in preschool subsidies,\r\nwhile the parents look for work. This is on top of the universal childcare\r\nsubsidies which his children are already entitled to. For a couple\r\nwhere the husband has to stop working temporarily due to ill health\r\nand the wife has to be his primary caregiver, but has savings and\r\nsome support from their children, he may receive $300 in cash a\r\nmonth while he recovers at home. They may also receive assistance\r\nfor utilities and service and conservancy charges as well as rental\r\nassistance if they reside in a rental flat. For a single needy elderly\r\nwithout family support, he or she may receive $400 in cash allowances\r\na month. In addition, there are other support such as free medical\r\ntreatment at polyclinics and restructured hospitals, rental and\r\nutilities vouchers and community help. This additional support can\r\namount to about $1,000 a month.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6cfa360d-a4a6-4e54-b7d6-0b63ee7815f9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-6cfa360d-a4a6-4e54-b7d6-0b63ee7815f9\"><!--a--></a>Ms Denise Phua asked how\r\nhelp services provided by the CDCs and other helping hands can be\r\nbetter coordinated and communicated to minimise their falling through the\r\ncracks. We agree on the importance of the CDCs to work with the\r\nvarious help services within their respective districts. Currently,\r\nthis is done through the ComCare Local Networks. Today, nine ComCare\r\nLocal Networks bring together various agencies comprising voluntary\r\nwelfare organisations, citizens consultative committees, other social\r\nservice agencies and even schools, hospitals and self-help groups.\r\nThrough these networks, agencies come together to collectively identify\r\nand sort out systemic issues as well as work out processes to facilitate\r\nthe referral of cases among the ComCare Local Network (CLN) partners\r\nand closing of referral loops. Working together, they are better placed\r\nto decide on the best approach to reach out to and assist the needy\r\nwithin their communities.

We constantly\r\nensure that we test the waters and assess the environment in order\r\nto make sure that those who need help are getting the help that\r\nis available for them. Of course, we can always look into the possibility\r\nof conducting a much more comprehensive survey in order to see whether help\r\nis reaching the beneficiaries. In fact, we did a survey of 2,000\r\nlow-income households, those in the bottom 20%, and we received\r\nsome feedback from them. They are the primary targets of our ComCare\r\nassistance schemes. We found that one out of 10 of these beneficiaries\r\ndo feel that they need help but they have some difficulties getting\r\nit. What is also surprising to us is that about 60% of them, although\r\nthey belong to the bottom 20%, indicated that they prefer to be\r\nself-sufficient and that they do not need assistance. And so, we\r\ndo have some surveys on and off to assess the situation on the ground.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5188bbf0-b7b3-4d57-8317-02464df45765\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-5188bbf0-b7b3-4d57-8317-02464df45765\"><!--a--></a>On Ms Phua's second question\r\nas to when we will complete the review, this is an ongoing process.\r\nWe share with the Member her sentiments that we should try to do\r\nit as quickly as possible, and that is obviously something that\r\nwe are looking into. Just to reinforce the point that our primary\r\nconsideration is that those who need help will get the help. They\r\nmust get the help. This is where we are also strengthening our CLN,\r\nby working with the CDCs, our primary agencies, our family service\r\ncentres and other VWOs. In the longer term, we are looking at other\r\npossible structures as well like, developing the service hubs. We\r\nhave in mind two models.

I\r\nwould like to ask two supplementary questions. First, would the\r\nMinistry set up a one-stop assistance centre where officers can\r\nwork with community and social workers to provide details on all\r\nschemes, including those run by charitable and non-governmental\r\norganisations so as to achieve on a coordinated and targeted basis,\r\nthe best way to address the needs of the poor and needy in getting\r\nthe right help at the right time, like assistance in terms of housing,\r\nchildren's education, medical needs and financial counselling in\r\nregard to retrenchment in jobs and advice on dealing with creditors?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4438e177-21fb-4a95-b59a-91660e896f1c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-4438e177-21fb-4a95-b59a-91660e896f1c\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, to ensure that\r\nthe needy who are poorly-educated and unaware of such schemes do\r\nnot fall through cracks in our social safety system, will the Ministry\r\nset up a committee\r\nto brainstorm ideas for more publicity through the mass media on\r\nthe financial help offered by the ComCare schemes?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-611569bf-fb68-4bf1-9913-7afd4fab5af0\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-611569bf-fb68-4bf1-9913-7afd4fab5af0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 665</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-92d66ecb-72ef-4860-b51a-c917acd9e7be\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-92d66ecb-72ef-4860-b51a-c917acd9e7be\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mdm Halimah Yacob</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I\r\nwant to thank Mrs Lina Chiam for those questions. I think the crux\r\nof the issue underlining both questions is how we ensure that the\r\nneedy and those who need help are able to access the help that are\r\navailable to them. That is the basis of her question for having\r\na one-stop centre and also in having a committee in order to look\r\nat these issues. On the question of a one-stop centre, the problem\r\nwith having just a one-stop centre is that it can become a bottleneck.\r\nAnd especially when we want to make sure that the touch points that\r\nwe have are spread all over the island and not just within a one-stop\r\ncentre. Instead of having a one-stop centre, what we have now is\r\na situation where we work very closely with our partners. So, we\r\nhave nine ComCare Local Networks under the CDCs and through those\r\nComCare Local Networks, we bring together all the touch points needed\r\nthroughout the island. So, there are the CDCs, the family service\r\ncentres, and the VWOs dealing with different areas of needs of our beneficiaries\r\nand our needy persons. All of them are brought together under the ComCare\r\nLocal Networks. The ComCare Local Networks act as a focal point\r\nwhere it also provides a platform for all the various agencies providing\r\nhelp to the needy to come together to discuss and share experiences\r\nand notes on how to extend assistance and help to the needy. Instead\r\nof a one-stop centre, what we have in mind, as I mentioned earlier,\r\nis to develop service hubs. Service hubs are structures where we\r\neither have it as programme-centric or client-centric located in\r\none location, and where we bring all the service providers together.\r\nFor instance, if we need to take care of the elderly, we need to\r\nbring all the providers together, whether it is the family service\r\ncentre or the VWOs taking care of the elderly needs. They will then\r\nbe co-located. As Members are aware, a structure like this takes\r\na bit of time to develop but this is one of it.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6b8c2e65-18d1-48a6-a596-9b2c00b54acc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-6b8c2e65-18d1-48a6-a596-9b2c00b54acc\"><!--a--></a>The Member's second question\r\nis whether we can have a committee. We all know very extensively\r\nand comprehensively the issues, challenges and problems that we\r\nface. It is not necessary for us to set up another committee to\r\nlook into this issue. What we need to do is to identify what are\r\nsome of the gaps, which we are doing right now, and also to address\r\nthose concerns and issues. I must say that looking at the structures\r\nthat we have, it is for the moment able to reach out to the needy\r\nand the beneficiaries. There are areas where we need to do more\r\noutreach, particularly for those who are at the bottom 20%. One\r\nout of 10 in our survey says they do face some difficulties. This\r\nis where we will then work very closely with our grassroots organisations\r\nand VWOs to work out an outreach strategy for them.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-2a1b8ee5-aa83-447d-bb88-ab1e0fe7c8f8\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-2a1b8ee5-aa83-447d-bb88-ab1e0fe7c8f8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-231dcfb0-3a92-413a-8d62-098be88bf32e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-231dcfb0-3a92-413a-8d62-098be88bf32e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nI thank the Minister of State for her reply.

In recent years, ridership on the SPLRT\r\nsystem has increased, with year-on-year growth of about 10% from\r\n2008 to 2011. Passenger loading levels have consequently also risen,\r\nwith crowding observed during the morning peak travel at the last\r\nstation on the Sengkang East loop in the direction of Sengkang Town Centre,\r\nwhere most commuters alight to transfer to the North-East Line. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-462c7218-028b-4220-aae6-0913ebec76f6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-9864442c-5a89-4606-852f-211467c7425b__id-462c7218-028b-4220-aae6-0913ebec76f6\"><!--a--></a>LTA is currently undertaking\r\na comprehensive review of the long-term capacity needed for the\r\nSPLRT system.

Specifically, with respect to the\r\nlast-mile concept for public transport which often is a friction\r\nfor people to change their behaviour when a family moves in to a\r\nnew location and buys a new BTO flat. This is an opportunity for\r\nthem to reconsider and change their lifestyle with respect to public\r\ntransport, perhaps. And very often, it is that last mile which is\r\nthe determining factor. So, have there been lessons learnt from\r\nthe experience in Sengkang which we will use to change either our\r\noperational approach or policy approach? And last question, would\r\nthe Ministry consider either a structure or incentive system for\r\nthe private transport operators to make them more likely to service\r\nthis last mile in a way that our residents are likely to use even\r\nif in the short term it loses money?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-0b50a8f7-2aa3-4194-88f3-a65a28c4d7d3\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-9864442c-5a89-4606-852f-211467c7425b__id-0b50a8f7-2aa3-4194-88f3-a65a28c4d7d3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 670</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1b8ab238-962d-40d6-aa67-878ea82d6bae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-9864442c-5a89-4606-852f-211467c7425b__id-1b8ab238-962d-40d6-aa67-878ea82d6bae\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs\r\nJosephine Teo</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank the Member for those questions.\r\nI will take the easier one first \u2013 how long the study will take.\r\nIt is a comprehensive review and so it will take a few more months.\r\nI urge the Member to be patient.

Indeed, the\r\nLTA is in the process of doing a detailed study on how we can improve\r\nlast-mile connectivity to make sure that as many residents as possible who\r\nmay now find that last-mile connectivity is not as good as they\r\nwould like it to be, can experience enhanced connectivity when they\r\ntry to access the public transport network through the nearest station\r\nto them.

These street hawkers\r\nwho were, in a sense, resettled from the streets, therefore, enjoyed\r\nsubsidised rentals. Currently, to date, the National Environment\r\nAgency (NEA) manages about 15,000 cooked food and market stalls.\r\nOf these 15,000 stalls, about 42% of them are paying subsidised\r\nrentals. So, these would be, in a sense, a legacy from the original clearance\r\nprogramme. For the remaining stalls,\r\nthe rentals are pegged at the market rate.

The reason for that\r\nclearance was to first ensure public safety and hygiene, because\r\nclearly street hawkers would not have access to clean running water\r\nand would not be able to maintain the cleanliness of their used utensils,\r\nplates, forks and spoons. So the plan was to relocate all of them\r\ninto a proper hawker centre. It will improve hygiene, it will also\r\ncentralise the infrastructure, facilities and supplies that they\r\nneed, and it will also be more convenient for the public because they\r\nwill know where to go for their regular fix of hawker food.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-093e9ccd-489e-449b-aa15-419ae9526949\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-093e9ccd-489e-449b-aa15-419ae9526949\"><!--a--></a>I explained all this so\r\nthat Members understand that it did not originate from a social policy.\r\nIt originated from a public hygiene, safety and convenience point\r\nof view. But having said that, hawker stalls then took a life of\r\nits own and, today, they have become almost an icon of Singapore\r\nlife in that you cannot imagine a Singapore without hawker centres,\r\nwithout access to freshly cooked food at a very affordable rate,\r\nin which people from\r\nall walks of life can get together, whether you are wearing a jacket\r\nor a tie, or in shorts, tee-shirts and slippers. That is where the\r\nsocial dimension came in. It did not necessarily start, nor is it\r\neven today, as an option for providing jobs for people who have\r\nno other occupations available. That almost, in a sense, is an incidental\r\neffect. In the earlier years \u2013 I think you have to go back to before\r\nthe 1990s \u2013 there was a programme for people who had difficulty\r\nin making ends meet and could not find any other job, they would\r\nbe allocated a stall. I think that policy was discontinued more\r\nthan 20 years ago.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 672</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d957d5a7-0f81-4b5e-a606-83c86647f73f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-d957d5a7-0f81-4b5e-a606-83c86647f73f\"><!--a--></a>So, what we have today,\r\nif you look at the mix, half of them are enjoying subsidised rentals.\r\nAs I said, these were legacy issues, people who previously enjoyed\r\nsubsidised rentals were also allowed to transfer their entitlement\r\nto subsidised rentals to their family members. In a sense, they\r\nwere the second generation hawkers. But for all the others, the\r\nMinistry at that point in time decided that it would be best and\r\nfair to allocate the stalls according to market demand. These stalls,\r\nyou would have realised, do have a market value because they generate\r\nincome for the operator. The fairest way of doing it was to let\r\nthe market price discovery mechanism occur. And that explains the\r\nway it has worked since then. But even with that in place, because\r\nof the way our hawker centres are structured, you will find that\r\nthe market rentals paid in a hawker centre are still significantly\r\nlower than that in a private food court or certainly in any restaurant.\r\nSo, there is a clear difference.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-058cfcc0-c3ff-44e4-8c47-453aa563e5a8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-058cfcc0-c3ff-44e4-8c47-453aa563e5a8\"><!--a--></a>The Member's other supplementary\r\nquestion was about the impact of market rentals on the final prices\r\nthat hawkers charge their customers. I think we should acknowledge that\r\nthe rental that a hawker pays in a hawker centre is one component\r\nbut it is not the only factor that determines the final price that\r\na hawker charges. This is a free market and we do not control the\r\nprices that hawkers set. Therefore, it is a combination of what the\r\nmarket can bear \u2212 the competition, the traffic, the number and the\r\nfame of that individual hawker \u2013 which allows him to set a price,\r\nand then determine the viability of his business. I am not convinced\r\nthat we should change that free market model. But having said that,\r\nthere is a supply and demand equation, and I believe that by increasing the\r\nsupply, we will put downward pressure on the market rentals. But,\r\nultimately, whether hawkers lower their prices in response to that\r\nis a market test which time will prove one way or the other. So,\r\nit is not a simple equation where I can offer a subsidised rental,\r\ncontrol the price that he charges and ensure a social policy of\r\nensuring that there will always be cheap food freely available to\r\neveryone. That is not the business model for the hawker centres.\r\nIt has never been that, and I do not believe that will be a viable model\r\nfor the future.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2867d15a-260c-40a7-9806-8a68dfb25b59\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-2867d15a-260c-40a7-9806-8a68dfb25b59\"><!--a--></a>His final point was on arrears.\r\nNEA would obviously work with the hawker to find out why he is having\r\ndifficulty coping with the rental. For instance, if he fell ill\r\nor, for some reason, his business went down because of local factors,\r\nthen, of course, NEA will exercise forbearance. But, in the long\r\nrun, this is a business and the revenues must be sufficient to cover\r\nthe cost of doing a business, including rentals, paying for ingredients, manpower,\r\nutilities, water, etc. So, we have to be clear that this particular\r\nhawker is viable in the long term and if he is, of course, we will\r\ndo our best to help him. If he is not, then, perhaps, that is not\r\nnecessarily the wisest business enterprise for him and we will have\r\nto look for ways for him to exit and to look for alternative jobs\r\nor avenues, or even an alternative venue to go to where the rentals\r\nmay be lower, and maybe for someone else with perhaps better business\r\nmodel or more tasty food or a more loyal clientele to replace him\r\nin that particular centre.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-25bbd1b1-fc26-4eb4-8f71-b4f1f8885895\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-25bbd1b1-fc26-4eb4-8f71-b4f1f8885895\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 673</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7470c916-8fa1-49aa-a212-99bead3e45ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-7470c916-8fa1-49aa-a212-99bead3e45ae\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms\r\nDenise Phua Lay Peng</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I just want to ask the Minister\r\na supplementary question.

Just building on the Member, Mr Lim Biow\r\nChuan's concern about the cost of food in food centres, beyond market\r\nrate for the rental of food stalls in food centres, I believe that\r\nthere is this practice of allowing a COV, sometimes of up to as\r\nhigh as $300,000. That is the transaction happening on the ground,\r\nwhen stalls are transferred. I believe this practice further pushes\r\nup the cost of food in food centres. This has probably taken on\r\na life of its own. It is very unlike the HDB rental flat policy\r\nwhich stipulates that when there is a transfer of ownership, the\r\nHDB actually takes back the rental flat when the tenant quits. I\r\nam sure he does not approve of the additional transfer cost that\r\nis happening on the ground and I wonder what the Minister would\r\ndo about this.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ccd911c2-3ee5-481b-b6fd-3a1fd62e61e5\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-ccd911c2-3ee5-481b-b6fd-3a1fd62e61e5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd8ecf74-dd94-48dc-a0e0-535265d1af7d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-bd8ecf74-dd94-48dc-a0e0-535265d1af7d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nit is a peculiar, almost unique, feature of doing business in Singapore,\r\nin hawker centres and sometimes in coffee shops. Whenever you have\r\nthis phenomenom of \"coffee money\" or you hear this exorbitant sum\r\nof $300,000, in fact, it should make you pause and understand that\r\nwhat is really happening from an economic point of view is arbitrage\r\nbecause of regulatory mismatch. The fact that someone else is willing\r\nto pay $300,000 in order to receive the assignment for the stall for\r\nwhich NEA is probably collecting a few hundred dollars or maybe\r\n$1,000 a month, illustrates precisely why we should not blindly\r\ngo into artificially pegging prices in the name of subsidies. The\r\npoint I am trying to make is that, in fact, subsidies distort the market\r\nand do not necessarily lead to optimal outcomes. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5efd730d-73d6-48c1-b0db-4539803139ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-5efd730d-73d6-48c1-b0db-4539803139ee\"><!--a--></a>The policy position of the\r\nMinistry is that our hawker centres should:</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8d673ccd-51ef-4211-a293-bcb40c393838\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-8d673ccd-51ef-4211-a293-bcb40c393838\"><!--a--></a>(1) be in the heartlands;</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cc93a127-e12d-417e-8666-57e6c5f6d3ce\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-cc93a127-e12d-417e-8666-57e6c5f6d3ce\"><!--a--></a>(2) reflect tropical architecture,\r\nthat means, no air-conditioning;</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d5f7a696-a91d-4bb8-97c8-2a401dfe43ba\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-d5f7a696-a91d-4bb8-97c8-2a401dfe43ba\"><!--a--></a>(3) be operated by Singaporeans\r\nor Permanent Residents with a Singaporean dependant;</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c8fbf8a8-c81f-4f58-b3c0-2ee305fbba1d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-c8fbf8a8-c81f-4f58-b3c0-2ee305fbba1d\"><!--a--></a>(4) be operated by the person\r\nwho has tendered or rented the stall, and this should be the hawker\r\nbusiness and not the rental arbitrage business. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7513acee-a712-4d94-85da-f3c32841c63d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-7513acee-a712-4d94-85da-f3c32841c63d\"><!--a--></a>So, I am aware of these\r\npractices and we will look at how best to address these in order\r\nto take the arbitrage out of this and to focus on the business of\r\nhawking rather than the business of selling and trading and assignment\r\nof subsidised privilege which they have enjoyed for legacy purposes.\r\nBut as I said, if we come back to fundamentals, there is a market\r\nprice for any stall.

Firstly, on inter-agency cooperation: indeed, that is the\r\nway the work has been done. To repeat the point: It is not that\r\nthe taskforce will convene in mid-2012. The plan of action will\r\nbe completed by mid-2012. That is the estimate. In terms of inter-agency\r\ncooperation, therefore, it is reflected in fact in the way even\r\nthe taskforce is composed. We have the Ministries of Home Affairs,\r\nManpower, MCYS, as well as the Police, immigration and various other\r\nagencies which have a vested interest and a role to play in this whole-of-Government\r\neffort. Indeed, that is the way we will continue to proceed. In\r\nsome of the raids that have been conducted and enforcement actions\r\ntaken, that has also been the case, and the Home Team agencies typically\r\nwork together on many of these efforts. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 676</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-406f673b-d4c0-4498-a036-79f3f64a8e63\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a5d636bf-2056-4eb7-a69a-d6ead9cb0efb__id-406f673b-d4c0-4498-a036-79f3f64a8e63\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, on international\r\ncollaboration and whether we can leverage on Interpol, indeed, the\r\nInterpol facility that is going to be established here will be an\r\nimportant asset for us. But it is not just what we have in Singapore,\r\nbut indeed, that is an approach that have been taken by the Police\r\nand the other agencies involved, that we need to find partners across\r\nborders because we often want to interdict at the source rather\r\nthan wait for it to come to our jurisdiction. And that has been\r\none of the key measures that has underpinned the way they have conducted\r\ntheir enforcement activities.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 676</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Re-integrating Ex-Offenders into Society<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-f7583e02-006e-4788-8ef3-9fc6ed74065f\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-f7583e02-006e-4788-8ef3-9fc6ed74065f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-a24de66e-5af9-435c-8cdf-14a0b3bfc36f\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-a24de66e-5af9-435c-8cdf-14a0b3bfc36f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-88ff9951-8f25-495b-a61d-f66ca8f58214\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-88ff9951-8f25-495b-a61d-f66ca8f58214\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">7</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs of all ex-offenders\r\nwho have re-integrated into society (a) what is the percentage of\r\nthose who have been re-employed; and (b) what is the percentage\r\nof those who have been re-employed in the Civil Service, Government\r\nagencies and statutory boards.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-78aac111-9ca9-4e65-8fdb-59cb15f906f9\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-78aac111-9ca9-4e65-8fdb-59cb15f906f9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b4de1f76-65f7-4b4d-b904-cf63e2bce455\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-b4de1f76-65f7-4b4d-b904-cf63e2bce455\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr\r\nMasagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Home Affairs)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, every year, about\r\n9,000 local offenders complete their sentences and are released\r\nfrom prisons and the drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs). </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a5ca8a6e-55ba-4612-9b62-c32ba8cf130b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-a5ca8a6e-55ba-4612-9b62-c32ba8cf130b\"><!--a--></a>Those who need help with\r\nemployment can approach the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative\r\nEnterprises (SCORE), a statutory board under the Ministry of Home\r\nAffairs which provides employment assistance for offenders and ex-offenders\r\nin the pre-release and post-release stage. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-985f7d44-0698-4edf-aba5-e618353a1b9b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-63ca318c-c2ee-43c6-846d-47f7d9b6fe2e__id-985f7d44-0698-4edf-aba5-e618353a1b9b\"><!--a--></a>In 2010, SCORE assisted\r\n1,292 inmates at the pre-release stage through Placement Exercises.\r\nSCORE provided job coaching for inmates, covering topics such as\r\ninterview and communication skills.

Nevertheless, students have the opportunities\r\nto learn to play the games and take part in competitive games through\r\nother opportunities \u2013 through the CCA, inter-class games, carnivals,\r\nand so on. Many schools use the SEP Fund which is an initiative\r\nof SSC and MOE. So I would like the Member to consider that taking\r\npart in sports should not necessarily be just based on sports CCAs.\r\nIt should be done through PE lessons which are now more structured.\r\nWe have introduced more PE lessons in primary schools now and the\r\nstudents have the opportunities to learn to be able to like the\r\ngames and to play on their own. So playing games should not be confined\r\nto taking part in CCAs in school. We can provide more opportunities\r\nby working together with the community organisations.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-649ba454-7fd4-4b4f-a285-347c48bb0018\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-ea933fa2-45ae-47f6-8284-8c2418146233__id-649ba454-7fd4-4b4f-a285-347c48bb0018\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-528127cf-0169-44f7-8754-4d58438b8ece\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ea933fa2-45ae-47f6-8284-8c2418146233__id-528127cf-0169-44f7-8754-4d58438b8ece\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan,\r\nlast question.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-9dc9c030-1294-4de2-a957-7178dc4e1bff\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-ea933fa2-45ae-47f6-8284-8c2418146233__id-9dc9c030-1294-4de2-a957-7178dc4e1bff\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-68133d46-8e91-4332-bf01-6ab9f519b723\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ea933fa2-45ae-47f6-8284-8c2418146233__id-68133d46-8e91-4332-bf01-6ab9f519b723\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: May I\r\nask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary this: I have received feedback\r\nthat students who are interested in certain sports were told that\r\nthey must take part in the sports CCAs to represent the school,\r\notherwise they are not allowed to take part in the sport as a matter\r\nof leisure.

Government subvention\r\nto the public hospitals for their subsidised patient services alone\r\namounted to $2.2 billion. Generally, services that are not subsidised,\r\nsuch as Class A ward admissions or private day surgery, are charged\r\non a cost-recovery basis. The public hospitals generated an aggregated\r\nsurplus of about $11 million, or around 1% of the revenue, from\r\nsuch services in 2010. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f2910be3-1e13-4e46-9434-d676c47bbc83\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ac0638a2-7dc5-479e-ace3-5a4fa0a2001c__id-f2910be3-1e13-4e46-9434-d676c47bbc83\"><!--a--></a>At our public hospitals,\r\nevery admitted patient is assigned a specialist who will lead the\r\ndelivery of care, usually through a team-based system comprising\r\nother doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals.

For example, in terms of manpower,\r\nwe increased the number of specialists last year by about 8%, from\r\n1,850 to about 2,000. We are also expanding our healthcare infrastructure.\r\nPublic sector acute hospital beds increased by over 600 beds, or\r\nabout 10%, over the period 2000 to 2010, with the completion of\r\nKhoo Teck Puat Hospital last year.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 683</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d543ac5f-4b31-47b0-829b-a265a4b8c692\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ac0638a2-7dc5-479e-ace3-5a4fa0a2001c__id-d543ac5f-4b31-47b0-829b-a265a4b8c692\"><!--a--></a>But bed numbers are just\r\none measure of healthcare capacity.

The polyclinics play an important\r\nrole in delivering primary care, especially to the lower income.\r\nThrough the years, the Ministry of Health has ensured that our polyclinics\r\nprovide the best care possible for their patients. This includes\r\nupgrading our polyclinics and equipping them with the appropriate\r\nmanpower and equipment to care for their patients. Last year, we completed\r\nthe upgrading of Choa Chu Kang and Toa Payoh Polyclinics. We will\r\ncontinue to upgrade other polyclinics, such as the Geylang and Tampines\r\nPolyclinics, in the coming years.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c7c9b794-0508-47ca-ae2f-92d8b3a9121d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-c7c9b794-0508-47ca-ae2f-92d8b3a9121d\"><!--a--></a>Even as we upgrade and expand\r\nour polyclinics, we are aware that the long-term primary healthcare\r\nburden cannot be borne by the polyclinics alone. The more logical and\r\nsustainable primary care model is to enhance the partnership between\r\nour polyclinics and GPs to provide quality healthcare that is more\r\naccessible and affordable for patients. We have more than 2,000\r\nGPs in the community who are located near to their patients and\r\ncapable of managing patients with both acute and chronic illnesses. Many\r\nof them have also taken up postgraduate courses to further enhance\r\ntheir skills and knowledge in Family Medicine. We have now more\r\nthan 800 doctors with the Masters of Medicine in Family Medicine\r\nand the Graduate Diploma in Family Medicine. This is an invaluable\r\nresource for the country as we seek to meet the growing healthcare demands\r\nof a larger and ageing population.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c59dd5cd-cf11-46b1-a268-7ad9210d7cc7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-c59dd5cd-cf11-46b1-a268-7ad9210d7cc7\"><!--a--></a>We are therefore in the\r\nprocess of jointly developing the Primary Care Masterplan with our\r\nGP partners to enable GPs to play a bigger role in chronic disease\r\nmanagement. To ensure affordability of care when patients see their\r\nGPs, we recently announced the enhancement of the Primary Care Partnership\r\nScheme (PCPS) which will take effect from early next year. PCPS\r\nis a portable subsidy scheme that allows Singaporeans to receive subsidised\r\ncare at private GPs and dental clinics. The age eligibility criteria\r\nwill be lowered from 65 years to 40 years while the income cut-off\r\nwill be raised from $800 to $1,500 per capita monthly household\r\nincome to enable more Singaporeans to benefit from the scheme. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 685</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6fa00629-14eb-451a-aa3a-1573a6f67351\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-6fa00629-14eb-451a-aa3a-1573a6f67351\"><!--a--></a>Under the draft Primary Care Masterplan,\r\nwe are proposing new primary care entities to support better management\r\nof chronic diseases in the community. For example, GPs can come\r\ntogether to set up Family Medicine Clinics with larger spaces and\r\nonsite ancillary support services. Or they may refer their patients\r\nfor ancillary support services such as nurse educators or diabetic\r\nretinal photography at neighbouring Community Health Centres. In\r\naddition, we intend to set up medical centres in the community to provide\r\nambulatory procedures, specialists would work with GPs to co-manage\r\npatients and enable right-siting of patients from the specialist\r\ncentres of our acute hospitals. We hope that our efforts in this\r\narea will result in much stronger primary care delivery and service\r\nfor Singaporeans. By leveraging on both our polyclinics and GPs,\r\nwe can deliver the most appropriate care to patients in the most\r\ncost-effective way. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestionTimeEnd\" id=\"id-7c6a2d6a-50ca-41d3-8b34-853c0563cabd\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-7c6a2d6a-50ca-41d3-8b34-853c0563cabd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-5d0aba1c-b6a6-4677-aac7-80dec9f44ad1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-5d0aba1c-b6a6-4677-aac7-80dec9f44ad1\"><!--a--></a>3.00 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b6189c86-2688-428b-8cf7-20aed5235ca3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-055d5be2-86ba-4f07-996c-c4ae5be79026__id-b6189c86-2688-428b-8cf7-20aed5235ca3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Order.

I think this tax will go some way to helping them deal\r\nwith the pressures of global competition. Over the past couple of months,\r\nI have met a couple of residents who were working in the maritime\r\nsector, and these residents were retrenched over the past couple\r\nof months. Usually they are able to find new jobs but they have\r\ndifficulty finding similar jobs in the maritime sector.

It is really\r\npart of a comprehensive PIC incentive to encourage pervasive innovation\r\nand to promote improved productivity. The benefits were specifically\r\ntailored to favour the SMEs so that they can gain from this to the\r\nlargest extent possible. And so, as a result, we included as many\r\ntypes of investments that could contribute to productivity. Six\r\ncategories to be exact, including R&amp;D. For expenditure on training,\r\nwhich is another category under the PIC, we do not discriminate\r\nbetween local and foreign employees. Again, the aim is mainly to\r\nget businesses to value skills training and upgrading as a way to\r\nimprove their productivity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e8c76312-77e8-4227-85bd-c761dcf25693\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a4c871d7-f831-4c88-9387-2876dd07aa90__id-e8c76312-77e8-4227-85bd-c761dcf25693\"><!--a--></a>To the question of why we\r\nallow R&amp;D done outside of Singapore to qualify for the PIC scheme:\r\nWe want a strong incentive for the companies to undertake R&amp;D\r\nin the first instance; in other words, please get started on R&amp;D,\r\nnever mind where it is done. Therefore, as an exception, we have\r\nbeen prepared to be generous to allow the expenses incurred on R&amp;D,\r\nwhether done in Singapore or abroad, to enjoy the PIC deductions,\r\nup to the expenditure cap of $400,000. R&amp;D spending beyond $400,000\r\nwill enjoy 100% tax deduction if done outside of Singapore and 150%\r\nif done within Singapore.\r\nSo, there is a differentiation in the benefit depending on the location\r\nwhere the R&amp;D is conducted, but this happens after the first\r\n$400,000 of deduction. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 691</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6672b88-aed6-4cd3-81a2-57c2a908fe3f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a4c871d7-f831-4c88-9387-2876dd07aa90__id-d6672b88-aed6-4cd3-81a2-57c2a908fe3f\"><!--a--></a>The thinking is that if\r\nwe restricted costs supportable under the PIC to local employees'\r\ncosts and to R&amp;D conducted within Singapore only, it will make\r\nit difficult for SMEs to benefit fully from the PIC and we are less\r\nlikely to achieve our objective.

First, I would like\r\nto point out that our personal income tax rates are generally already\r\nlow and progressive. Only 43% of our resident workforce pays income\r\ntax at all. So, the lower income earners do not pay income tax.\r\nFurther, I should point out that with this round of enhancements,\r\nall tax payers will pay less personal income tax, but the middle-income\r\nearners will enjoy the largest percentage reduction in their taxes.\r\nIn fact, these changes were made in line with the objective to improve\r\nour progressivity of the personal income tax. It is estimated that\r\nthese changes would result in a revenue loss of $519 million. Quite\r\nsignificant. A sum which, in fact, could alternatively have been\r\nused to provide very targeted assistance to the needy. So, the changes\r\nhave been introduced to benefit the middle-income earners, and taking\r\ninto consideration that our low-income earners already do not pay\r\npersonal income taxes, this is a fair approach.

In fact,\r\nthis year, Customs launched Document Exchange or Doc X to enable\r\nauthorised business partners to share documents securely and easily. On\r\n1 January 2012, very soon, Customs will be launching version 4.1\r\nof TradeNet, the latest version of Singapore's electronic data interchange\r\nsystem, for the clearance of trade documentation. Users who are\r\nfamiliar with TradeNet will know that it is not only well accepted,\r\nit is regarded in the international community as one system that\r\nhas contributed greatly to the efficiency of our trade clearing\r\nprocedures. These are just some examples of the continuous efforts\r\nmade by Customs to stay abreast.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7d1decf8-e118-4ebf-af5d-192e36c13010\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4ea846b3-cc27-4c7d-b754-8d3e53a4cf5d__id-7d1decf8-e118-4ebf-af5d-192e36c13010\"><!--a--></a>As to the Member's important\r\nquestion on how Singapore Customs keeps up with international alerts,\r\nyes, it actively monitors the relevant UN decisions and sanction\r\nlist. When a trade-related sanction is imposed by the UN Security\r\nCouncil, Singapore Customs enforces it through compliance and audit\r\nchecks on companies trading in strategic goods to ensure that Singapore\r\nfulfils our obligations. Customs officers also conduct frequent\r\noutreach to keep the trading community informed of new developments\r\nand key issues so that they, in partnership with Customs, can help\r\nto ensure that our trade flows remain secure. Singapore Customs\r\nperforms dual roles in trade facilitation and supply chain security.\r\nIt also works closely with other Government agencies, including\r\nthe Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the border checkpoints\r\nto maintain the integrity of our trading system and to facilitate\r\nlegitimate trade.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-35ac462e-e5de-4651-9ab3-5930c7929951\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4ea846b3-cc27-4c7d-b754-8d3e53a4cf5d__id-35ac462e-e5de-4651-9ab3-5930c7929951\"><!--a--></a>The Member has raised a\r\nnumber of queries that really relate to the ICA's purview, for example,\r\nquestions on bio-security and infectious diseases control at the checkpoints.\r\nThese are perhaps better addressed by the ICA.

We welcome ideas from the public and MPs on\r\nhow we can enhance information literacy among our people. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 699</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Values-Driven\r\nEducation in Schools<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-70a07273-2cce-41e1-87a4-530440dd0664\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-70a07273-2cce-41e1-87a4-530440dd0664\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-2d359342-3503-43b7-87b3-aa408db75fd7\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-2d359342-3503-43b7-87b3-aa408db75fd7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6679629e-1558-4369-b584-8254f43da8f9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-6679629e-1558-4369-b584-8254f43da8f9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">21</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Education (a) how will the Ministry increase capacity\r\nfor, and equip teachers with, the skills and knowledge needed to implement\r\nvalues-driven education in schools; (b) how does the Ministry intend\r\nto support schools in their outreach to parents to partner them\r\nin this effort; and (c) how will the Ministry monitor the progress and effectiveness\r\nof this renewed emphasis on values-driven education.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-764670e9-0932-4e4e-a0b2-a9b3a6eff0db\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-764670e9-0932-4e4e-a0b2-a9b3a6eff0db\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 700</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db22cb80-f113-4cf8-9d13-b3403ecb47ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-db22cb80-f113-4cf8-9d13-b3403ecb47ec\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">22</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Janil Puthucheary</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Education what efforts will be made to reach out\r\nand engage parents in driving the change in mindset and societal\r\nnorms that will be required as part of the shift of our education\r\nsystem to one that is values-based. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-02b76c55-6c43-4e45-97f0-7b669887973a\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-02b76c55-6c43-4e45-97f0-7b669887973a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8282757e-5016-4ce0-ad44-ac1b271f6b6a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-8282757e-5016-4ce0-ad44-ac1b271f6b6a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Ms Tin\r\nPei Ling and Dr Janil Puthucheary are right in highlighting the\r\nimportant roles of teachers and parents in our effort to sharpen\r\nour focus on values education.

Different countries adopt\r\ndifferent approaches to help those in need, depending on their own\r\nunique situations. Some establish a poverty line to identify those\r\nwho need help. For example, in the United States, the 2010 threshold\r\nfor a family of four works out to be about US$1,860 (S$2,390) per\r\nmonth. Based on this threshold, the US' poverty rate is about 15.1%.\r\nOn the other hand, other countries like Canada and New Zealand do\r\nnot have an official poverty line. Canada, for instance, adopts\r\nan income threshold, determined using family expenditure data, in\r\nguiding its assessment of the populace's needs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6523e71d-e444-4bf6-8222-89d6c9dce875\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-6523e71d-e444-4bf6-8222-89d6c9dce875\"><!--a--></a>There is no hard and fast\r\nrule on how to determine needs. In Singapore, we take an approach\r\nof tailoring our social safety net to different groups, depending\r\non their needs and circumstances. This approach is more flexible\r\nand no less effective than countries that choose to adopt a poverty\r\nline. Our help schemes typically cover the bottom 20th percentile\r\nof households, with the flexibility to go beyond if the family's\r\ncircumstances merit special consideration. This approach allows\r\nus to provide more targeted and customised forms of assistance with\r\nreal outcomes for families and individuals.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 708</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4bbcd50b-f751-4cac-94f8-2a162408c6d9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4bbcd50b-f751-4cac-94f8-2a162408c6d9\"><!--a--></a>\tLet me elaborate on an\r\nexample. For a family of four where the male breadwinner has lost\r\nhis job, assistance from ComCare will help the family manage financially\r\nand put food on the table. The vouchers for utilities, service and\r\nconservancy charges given to the family ensure that they continue\r\nto have electricity, water and gas for their daily needs. The two young\r\nchildren can go to childcare with the help of subsidies from ComCare.\r\nThis not only allows for the children to continue to attend preschool\r\nand socialise with other children, but also enables both parents\r\nto look for work. The working parents, if eligible, may receive\r\na Workfare Income Supplement as an addition to their wages and CPF\r\nsavings, as well as an encouragement for them to stay employed. Different\r\nhelp schemes, in this case ComCare and Workfare, complement each\r\nother to help our clients in their journey. This is what I mean\r\nby our approach to provide targeted assistance with real outcomes\r\nfor families and individuals.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4911f274-a74b-40a5-93fd-639a9cb27b03\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4911f274-a74b-40a5-93fd-639a9cb27b03\"><!--a--></a>\tDr Lily Neo has also asked\r\nwhether more assistance could be rendered to needy households. The\r\nGovernment has regularly reviewed its assistance programmes and subsidies\r\nin anticipation of evolving needs. Over the years, we have raised\r\nthe level of help given to needy households. For instance, our population\r\nis rapidly ageing and more elderly would need eldercare services.\r\nTo increase the accessibility of community-based eldercare services,\r\nMCYS has extended subsidies to such services up to the 50th income percentile\r\nin October this year. We have also increased funding to senior activities centres\r\nthat serve low income elderly. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7fb92211-1fb2-43d5-9966-4cc3901567ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-7fb92211-1fb2-43d5-9966-4cc3901567ae\"><!--a--></a>We also recognise the importance\r\nof developing children. For this reason, ComCare assistance schemes\r\nfor young children were enhanced in April this year to go beyond the\r\n20th percentile of households. Therefore, a family with two young\r\nchildren for instance, and earning a gross household income up to\r\n$3,500 \u2013 which previously exceeded the old $1,800 household income\r\nthreshold \u2013 can now benefit from such pre-school subsidies.
