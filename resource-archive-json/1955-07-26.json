S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> The following are the details of the Government's plans for the provision of veterinary and animal husbandry services in the rural areas during 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disease control measures and medical aid to farmers' livestock. The extension of the free poultry inoculation service to farmers is under way. Over four million birds a year are inoculated. This has created a major rural industry for some tens of thousands of farmers as a part or whole time occupation and large infertile areas otherwise unsuited to farming are put to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive work on disease control in other species of animals is also being undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations into breeding and nutrition. Investigations are being conducted in respect of poultry, pigs, cattle and goats. Breeding stock are available on a limited scale at Lim Chu Kang Station. Trials have indicated that it is possible to reduce the cost of production of local pork by at least 40 per cent by new methods which are not traditional to Chinese farming systems. Stud animals are being used increasingly among low breeding stock and interest in this work will increase as farmers see the result on their stock of this and other work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of District Stations. Additional work at the Lim Chu Kang Station is to be undertaken in the immediate future. Arrangements are being made for veterinary staff to live in the rural areas in order to establish closer contact with farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One poultry inoculation unit operating from Lim Chu Kang has resulted in the north-west corner of the Island being converted into a virtual poultry farm with nearly two million birds. This area has infertile soil and is therefore unsuited for any other form of mixed farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site is being acquired for a second Animal Husbandry Station to serve the north and central parts of the Island. The work of this second station will cover the farming areas from Sembawang to Serangoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments are being made in the construction of cheap animal houses which farmers will be encouraged to build on their own farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing demands for veterinary services in rural areas have far exceeded expectations but it is hoped that with the early completion of the two new Animal Husbandry Stations and the recruitment of further qualified and subordinate staff it will be possible for the Veterinary Department to meet these demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT STOCKPILE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Rice)</b></div>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether it is still the policy of Government to maintain a stockpile of rice and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto sell it on a non-profit basis to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.
