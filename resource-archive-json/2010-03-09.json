Before I go on to my cut, I would like to declare my interest as a director on the board of the Agency for Integrated Care. Our ageing population has given rise to a need for a whole spectrum of services in geriatric medicine and healthcare. I can assure you, it is no fun growing old. Your mind does not think it is old but your body starts behaving otherwise. I am going to be 47 very soon and I can attest to that fact. After a while, the mind slows down and a whole range of other challenges pop up. From my interaction with the elderly, it appears that the range of needs is extremely diverse. Medical conditions range from&nbsp;osteoporosis and macular degeneration to senile dementia. Correspondingly, the range of services required is extremely diverse. You need, for example, acute care in hospitals, outpatient treatment for age-related medical conditions in hospitals and polyclinics, step down care in community hospitals, day care centres for the aged, nursing homes for the critically ill. For those who are not so critically ill,&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;full-time nursing services at home, day care&nbsp;or part-time nursing at home.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether MOH is equipped to deal with this varied and diverse range of healthcare needs for the aged. Also, to what extent geriatric care needs to be handled by the hospitals and to what extent it can be handled by step down care or&nbsp;the community. How MOH can help people better understand and navigate the different types of services, so that we can have a better delivery of healthcare services to those in need.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><p align=left>Column: 3482</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Ageing</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, statistics have shown that the aged destitute has the highest number of Public Assistance recipients, consistently amounting to approximately 85%. Statistics have also shown that there is an approximate 1% increase in the total number of residents in old folks&rsquo; homes. In view of the rapid ageing population, this rate will definitely increase. There are many pressing questions of the care of the elderly that I would like to ask Minister to address, namely:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;How are we to cope with the rapid demands from the ageing population?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;Will we be able to build more step down medical and&nbsp;rehabilitation care in the neighbourhood? How many of these step down medical and rehabilitation centres will be planned in relation to population?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;What will be the funding like? Are we proceeding with the \"many helping hands\" approach? Will we do it like the way kidney dialysis centres are located in the heartlands?&nbsp;What is the Ministry's basic funding model if the Ministry proceeds with the \"many helping hands\" approach?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) How are we going to train a pool of medically-trained personnel to take care of the elderly and volunteers who can provide the medical and nursing care for the elderly in the heartland? Presently the elderly homes do not have medical support. To give an example, until&nbsp;recently my family&nbsp;had to take care of our late father-in-law who passed&nbsp;away late last year. We had to fetch him to hospital; once he was dehydrated and got the basic drips, and we brought him back after his condition had stabilised. If there is some basic&nbsp;medical care in the community, <p align=left>Column: 3483</p>there is no need to travel to and fro and more efficient use of the hospital care.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;How are we to make outpatient geriatric care more available at the heartlands? Could the services at GP clinics be reviewed to prepare them to take on some of these roles with the co-funding from the Ministry for the cost of geriatric care? Many of the elderly would not be able to walk to the one polyclinic in an estate. The journey is too long and the long waiting time.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi) How can we manage costs so that the services for nursing, rehabilitation, therapy and medication stay affordable in the years ahead for our elderly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need the Minister to&nbsp;show us the masterplan of how&nbsp;his Ministry&nbsp;is going to plan all these rehabilitation and care centres in our living environment to support the elderly.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Mobile medical services</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, Singaporeans are ageing rapidly. The Ministerial Committee on Ageing reported in 2007 that by 2030, 20 years from now, one in five will be aged 65 and above, up from one in&nbsp;12 today. It further projected that by 2050, 40 years from now, Singapore will be the fourth oldest country in the world. Currently there are segments within our population that face difficulties in travelling to the nearest clinic or hospital for treatments. Sometimes, these treatments or checkups can happen more than once in a week. Most patients have chronic illnesses that impede their physical mobility. To keep up with these treatments, patients sometimes find it stressful, a burden to the families and even contemplating suicide. In addition, caregivers of these patients are facing problems, such as time-off from work,&nbsp;job insecurity and higher transportation cost. In anticipation of our <p align=left>Column: 3484</p>fast growing population, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously consider providing mobile medical services in their respective zones. Using mobile medical services to reach out to people less accessible is not something new. In other countries, it has been done to a large extent. Similarly, in Singapore, some of these mobile services are already provided by private institutions. However, they are not widespread and not affordable to the low-income families. I believe these mobile medical services will enhance workers' productivity and bring comfort and graceful living to the deserving old Singaporeans who have contributed much&nbsp;to the nation-building of Singapore.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, my questions for the Minister are focused on the healthcare needs of our ageing population. Given our rapidly ageing population and increase in prevalence of chronic ailments, is there a sufficient number of physicians and nurses to manage the expected increase in demand for geriatric care? How many physicians are currently trained in geriatric care? Will there be incentive to encourage young physicians to specialise in geriatrics,&nbsp;as opposed&nbsp;to, say, cosmetic surgery? How will the expected rise in foreign worker levy affect the supply of nursing care, especially for our nursing homes? One way to keep healthcare cost low is to provide safe options and alternatives to biomedical care. Can the Minister comment on the role traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)&nbsp;plays in eldercare? Are the existing regulatory measures sufficient to raise the professional profile of TCM and level up the alternative healing sector to be effectively complementary to the former healthcare sector? Finally, what measures has MOH taken to avail support services to augment step-down home care for the chronically-ill elderly?&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><p align=left>Column: 3485</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Mental health</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, as more people are living longer, the incidence of age-related degenerative diseases of the brain, such as&nbsp;Alzheimer's and senile dementia, is expected to rise. Other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression and addiction are also on the rise. Unfortunately, the stigma attached to mental illness is still very apparent and people tend to shun mental patients due to lack of knowledge and understanding of mental conditions. More should be done to educate the public on mental health and diseases so as to help&nbsp;de-stigmatise this problem. There should also be better support from MOH in the form of mental health promotion and caregivers support. There is also an urgent need for the better integration of the services provided by VWOs and the Government agencies in the areas of social integration and community rehabilitation of patients with mental illness. I will, therefore, like to ask the Minister for an update on MOH's strategy in managing mental health and illness in Singapore.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Sir, mental illness is one of the most&nbsp;maligned and stigmatised illnesses that is least understood but is rising fast. Last year, IMH treated 33,000 patients, an increase of 14% from 2005. After raising this issue over a number of Budget debates, I am happy that there is now greater focus on mental illness. Hence, I urge the Minister to focus on the three areas.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, cover mental illness under MediShield, as the cost of hospitalisation is increasing and is becoming a burden to families. There appears to be no&nbsp;compelling reason to exclude mental illness, even if&nbsp;there is such a wide range,&nbsp;from the mild to&nbsp;the severe,&nbsp;which is not something insurmountable as the&nbsp;limits can be prescribed.&nbsp;Other countries' healthcare systems already covered&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3486</p>mental illness&nbsp;and studies have shown that we will not necessarily increase premiums significantly, especially&nbsp;if coverage enables&nbsp;patients to receive treatments earlier and, therefore, avoid the higher&nbsp;cost involved if their&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;worsen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, establish more community-based services&nbsp;and provide more funding support to&nbsp;VWOs running&nbsp;shelters in other services for the mentally ill. This would help to reduce the relapse rate which also means less cost&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Government.&nbsp;A big problem for&nbsp;most families is&nbsp;that after a mentally-ill person is discharged from hospital, there is no place for them to go to for help&nbsp;or support, especially during periods of crisis, so they&nbsp;end up sending the patient back to hospital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, provide more workplace support for those who are mentally ill, through educational programmes to&nbsp;raise awareness and reduce the stigma against them, and&nbsp;also help them in better job placement assistance. &nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100309/20100309VS_121439.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a> *.]&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is seeing a steady increase of people suffering from mental illnesses.&nbsp;In 2006 alone, the Institute of Mental Health treated close to 33,000 patients for mental illnesses.&nbsp;The Government passed the Mental Health Bill in 2008, which mandates the provision of proper care and treatment to the mentally ill.&nbsp;The law also provides for detention of mental patients, both for the sake of the patients and the public.&nbsp;In this regard, since the passing of the law, how many patients have been detained and for how long?&nbsp;Equally important is the Minister&rsquo;s assurance to this House that no patient has been unnecessarily detained.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related issue is the projected rise of age-related degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and senile <p align=left>Column: 3487</p>dementia.&nbsp;The number of senior citizens aged 65 and above is expected to reach 19% of our population by 2030 and Singapore is expected to have the world&rsquo;s fourth oldest population by 2050.&nbsp; I would like to seek assurance from the Minister that we have adequate trained psychiatrists and nursing staff to care for senior citizens with mental illnesses.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3685-3686.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, one of the problems encountered by MPs on the ground is patients with mental health problems who have been released from IMH back into the community, but who do not take their medication, with the result that there is a resurgence of their mental problems. For example, one of my residents is firmly convinced that the neighbour upstairs is doing something to cause water to flood down from the ceiling into her flat. There is, in fact, no such problem. The HDB and Town Council have looked into it. But she is convinced that there is a problem, she comes to see me regularly in great distress and ask for a transfer of the flat. There are others, whose mental conditions lead them to engage in anti-social behaviour and, in some cases, they can be violent. There is less of an issue if they are staying with family members. However, some of them live alone or do not have people to look after them. Very often, the mental conditions are not so serious as to require that they remain in IMH. The mental conditions can be addressed provided that they take their medication. But the problem is that once they are released from IMH and they are staying alone, there is no one to ensure that they do take their medication. I would like to ask the Minister what steps can be taken to address the need for follow-up care of patients with mental health problems and whether this can be addressed by MOH or whether there are plans to address it through other agencies or community networks.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Chairman, the area of mental health and <p align=left>Column: 3488</p>illness has long been de-emphasised, due to the many stigma and complexities associated with it. Thanks to the Ministry of Health, there has been much more focus on these&nbsp;issues of late. Increase fundings towards this area, including almost double research funding in mental health. The cost of institutionalising these patients are many and varied. Once suitable for ambulatory community care, doctors will discharge them. Can MOH work and coordinate with more VWOs, NGOs, volunteers and community leaders to strategise and coordinate community support groups who can lend a&nbsp;hand and an ear to these people;&nbsp;tasks they can take part, including befriending, advising, social outings,&nbsp;ensuring and supervising taking of medications, giving appropriate feedback to medical personnel and IMH on observed behaviours, etc?

The family has been assisted by my grassroots and the Southwest CDC for years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After her father passed away, her mentally sound brother had asked me to appeal to IMH to institutionalise her as he was unable to take care of her. She was then still an inpatient of IMH.&nbsp; IMH subsequently replied that she was assessed to be no longer suicidal and had asked to be discharged everyday. IMH had informed her brother that if their medical social worker could not contact him to explore alternative accommodation, such as a nursing home, for his sister or he was unable to place her in a nursing home, they would have to discharge her once she is assessed to be mentally stable and no longer a danger to herself or others.&nbsp; IMH said that they would then put her under close community supervision and follow-up by members of the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Sadly, she committed suicide in February this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This incident begs several questions. Should patients be discharged into the community if they lack the necessary family support to continue with their medication and follow-up treatment? Does the IMH have a robust system of <p align=left>Column: 3490</p>monitoring mentally-ill patients&rsquo; recovery in the community, and intervening if they suffer a relapse?&nbsp; How can IMH better track and care for its outpatients?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Prof. Chong Siow Ann, Vice-Chairman of the IMH&rsquo;s medical board and Director of Research, an estimated one in two patients drop out of the treatment programmes.&nbsp; They need to be better monitored and engaged by health-care providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully understand IMH&rsquo;s approach of not institutionalising all mentally-ill patients but constantly seeking to rehabilitate them in the community instead.&nbsp; To facilitate this, the&nbsp;CMHT programme was&nbsp;started in 2007.&nbsp;The CMHT now have a staff strength of 51, comprising doctors, nurses, medical social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been reported that regular house calls have cut re-admission rates by 43% and hospital stays by two-thirds.&nbsp; While this is commendable, one wonders if the CMHT programme&rsquo;s resources are adequate to handle the estimated more than 30,000 mentally-ill patients known to the IMH who are living in the community under rehabilitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, the family should be the first line of support for these patients.&nbsp; But their families may not know what to do or may not have the means to provide support, such as in the case of my resident. The patients could then become a menace to society and/or themselves.&nbsp; Such patients with little or no family support should receive more attention from IMH or CMHT.&nbsp; Otherwise, IMH should consider institutionalising them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary welfare organisations, religious organisations as well as grassroots volunteers could be roped in to work with IMH and the CMHTs to make sure mental outpatients can live and function as <p align=left>Column: 3491</p>normally as possible in the community.&nbsp; But the Ministry would have to provide resources to help these volunteers so that they can render appropriate support and assistance.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann is not here.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>The mentally challenged</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;most of us are fortunate not to have to care for a child who is mentally challenged.&nbsp;But for those who face this challenge, I would like to bring up their plight. The stigma that follows the parents of children with mental deficiencies often hold them back from reaching out to their communities for help. The Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) has been a great source of support for both the child and the caregivers. I truly admire the passion that is driving the people in MINDS. Can we learn from this establishment and provide such establishment for the mentally ill?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, we are doing very little for the mentally ill&nbsp;at home. What can we do for them? Can&nbsp;we have more day care or drop&nbsp;in centres for them to be able to socialise&nbsp;so that we could at least give them some quality of life and to give some reprieve for their caregivers?&nbsp;How about training courses for them to upgrade their skills or hone them into some living skills to enhance their quality of life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need more financial assistance for these families too.&nbsp; Many of them are not in the tax paying&nbsp;bracket and&nbsp;do not enjoy the higher tax relief introduced in this Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to act more swiftly because as&nbsp;one ages, dementia does set in. To care for the elderly is challenging and to care for the dementia elderly is even more <p align=left>Column: 3492</p>strenuous. What is the Ministry doing to prepare for this group of people? Where can the caregivers turn to for help as the normal elderly care centre is unable to cope with the dementia elderly? What is the price for treatment and care giving? Are there sufficient care facilities and manpower? Many of these residents do not and could not explain their medical conditions themselves.&nbsp;Is the Ministry of Health able to share some of this health information with the community care centres to be&nbsp;eventually set up in the heartlands so that proper intervention can be done?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like the Ministry to consider a hotline for the public to call for help when it is obvious that a mentally-ill person needs help.&nbsp; The first sign is when they become a nuisance and do not cause harm yet to themselves. We need&nbsp; a special group to handle these mentally ill or mentally challenged. Many do not open the doors of their flat upon visits and HDB, Town Councils and Police officers are helpless and&nbsp;unable to have access to them as they are not dangerous.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last of all, the other area that we need to address is the caregiver stress, especially for the mentally ill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;on the first day of Chinese New Year, I received news that Dr Chee Pui Hung had passed away that morning&nbsp;peacefully at home.&nbsp; He was 87.&nbsp; As I wrote in my blog, \"I lost a friend, a supporter and a critic\" whom I&nbsp;respect.&nbsp; Dr Chee was a legend and was larger than life.&nbsp; Within the medical community, he was widely and affectionately referred to as the \"A-gong\" of the Medical Alumni, who held together the large community of doctors, dentists and pharmacists.&nbsp; He lived life to the fullest, had a successful medical career, brought up&nbsp;three children well and even dabbled in politics in his early days.&nbsp; I am told that he had even chided a couple of Ministers in public when he disagreed with some of their <p align=left>Column: 3493</p>policies.&nbsp; In his unique way, he contributed to Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years ago, my father, too, passed away during the Chinese New Year period.&nbsp; He lived a full life, without any bad habit, kept slim, remained active and socially engaged in retirement.&nbsp; Several days after all the children who lived overseas had returned to their respective homes following several days of New Year reunion with him, he had internal bleeding in his brain one night while watching&nbsp;&ndash; and I suppose&nbsp;fallen asleep&nbsp;&ndash; in front of the TV.&nbsp; My mother rushed him to the hospital in an ambulance.&nbsp; I took the first flight out&nbsp;to Penang but missed him by an hour.&nbsp; The suddenness was traumatic for the family, but after the emotions had settled, we knew it was a good death and we all quietly wished that when it is our time to go, we could&nbsp;do so&nbsp;just as swiftly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese call this &ldquo;<I>pin pin korori</I>&rdquo;.&nbsp; \"<I>Pin pin</I>\" means&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;healthy, bouncy and dynamic; \"<I>korori</I>\" means&nbsp;just roll over and die.&nbsp; The expression is so common among&nbsp;Japanese, they even&nbsp;abbreviate it to just&nbsp;PPK.&nbsp;&nbsp;To PPK means to live a long and healthy life without illness and when the time to go, just go swiftly: \"<I>Pin pin korori</I> \".&nbsp; And there are <I>pokkuri</I> temples all over the place in Japan, promising the worshippers PPK.&nbsp; Although Japan has been in recession for two decades, <I>pokkuri</I> temples are doing quite well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;studied the Japanese approach carefully because they have the most experience dealing with ageing.&nbsp; Just how advanced is ageing in the Japanese society?&nbsp; Let me share some observations. In 1963, Japan started giving silver cups to&nbsp;Japanese who turned 100.&nbsp; That year, they gave away 153 cups.&nbsp; There are now 40,000 centenarians and they have just reduced the cup size by 15% to save on silver.&nbsp; Their ageing problem is magnified <p align=left>Column: 3494</p>by&nbsp;their very low birth rate.&nbsp; There are now more adult diapers being sold than&nbsp;children&rsquo;s diapers.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;23 million children but 44 million pets!&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet care is&nbsp;big business in Japan.&nbsp; Yesterday, if&nbsp;Members read the <I>Straits Times</I>,&nbsp;they would see a&nbsp;picture of a Japanese man: how he pampered his poodle by carrying it piggy-back on his back, just as he would piggy-back his kid, which he probably does not have.&nbsp; Even pets are ageing, so in the supermarkets they have pet food&nbsp;calibrated by age bands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by Dr Lam Pin Min&nbsp;and Dr Lily Neo, we have a good healthcare system.&nbsp; As the current and the former Head of GPC for Health, they know what they are talking about.&nbsp; Our system has brought us much success&nbsp;&ndash; low mortality, increased longevity, high clinical standards and among the most cost-effective in the world.&nbsp; But ageing of the population will bring new problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope for PPK, but what if we do not simply \"roll over and die\"? The Chinese have a saying,&nbsp;<I>jiu bing wu xiao</I> <I>zi</I>: \"When you have a prolonged illness, very hard to find&nbsp;filial children\".&nbsp; Outsourcing the care of patients is not the solution.&nbsp; The scene in \"<I>Money, No Enough 2</I> \" of children dumping their&nbsp;mother outside the gate&nbsp;of a nursing home touched a&nbsp;chord,&nbsp;because that is exactly what we all fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know death is a morbid subject and we have just celebrated Chinese New Year.&nbsp; But let me assure Members that this speech is not about gloom and sadness; it is about living well and celebrating life.&nbsp; Yes, we are ageing, but there is much cause for optimism.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s seniors are very different from the seniors of the past.&nbsp; I am 58 and my residents often tell me that \"You look younger\".&nbsp; So, to Ms Indranee who talked about ageing earlier&nbsp;on,&nbsp;ageing can be fun, ageing may not be so bad. When our children become seniors, they will, in turn, be even better than the seniors of today.&nbsp; Where is&nbsp;the <p align=left>Column: 3495</p>evidence? More Singaporeans are exercising, jogging, swimming, brisk walking and engaging in all sorts of sports.&nbsp; Here, I must thank Minister Mah Bow Tan, the HDB, the NParks and the PUB for creating an increasingly health promoting environment.&nbsp; In Sembawang, for example, we see our residents regularly jogging away, using the bicycle tracks, the park connectors and the various parks.&nbsp; My GRC MPs, including Dr Lim Wee Kiak, are now working with the NParks to refresh the Sembawang Park so that it keeps up with the needs of modern Singaporeans.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we will ensure that it retains its natural, old world charms.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng&rsquo;s observation yesterday that some parks have become too \"artificial, plastic\",&nbsp;was timely.&nbsp; We would not make that kind of mistake.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we discuss this year's Budget and reflect upon our achievements, I agree with Dr Fatimah Lateef&nbsp;that we focus on how we can shape the future to meet our aspirations.&nbsp; I have heard Members' many thoughtful comments.&nbsp; Let me just pick up their key points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the past decade has seen our resident population grow from four million to five million.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next decade, will we add another million? The Economic Strategies Committee has noted our physical constraints and Singaporeans have also been voicing their concerns.&nbsp; So, I doubt it will be a \"6-million people decade\".&nbsp; But even a \"5.5-million people decade\" will mean a substantial increase in demand on healthcare services, as Singaporeans are getting older.&nbsp; In 2000, life expectancy at age 65 was 82 years.&nbsp; Now, it is 84, an increase of two years.&nbsp; With medical advances,&nbsp;this should increase further to 86, I think,&nbsp;in the next decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is success.&nbsp; It means that many more Singaporeans can live to their 80s and 90s.&nbsp; With better nutrition and <p align=left>Column: 3496</p>lifestyle, many remain well.&nbsp; But, yes, some will get sick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are gearing up for this demographic change. We are adding more beds, more clinics, more staff, more nursing homes, more day care centres.&nbsp; I have shared my expansion plan before but given time constraints, I&nbsp;will not repeat it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just highlight the next big event:&nbsp;the opening of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH)&nbsp;in Yishun.&nbsp; Over the next few months, we will open it in stages.&nbsp; Indeed, it will start treating outpatients and conduct day surgeries in three weeks' time. The ambition of the hospital team is to make KTPH a hassle-free hospital, and&nbsp;I look forward to that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change in patient profile from younger to older patients will have significant impact on healthcare delivery.&nbsp; The Prime Minister spoke about this during his National Day Rally last year. Young patients recover quickly. They return to <I>status quo</I> soon after discharge. Elderly patients take longer to recover and sometimes full recovery may not even be achievable. They merely change their status from an acute patient to a chronic patient.&nbsp; Many need some transitional care in a community hospital or a nursing home and occasional re-admissions to the acute hospital.&nbsp; That is why it is so important for close collaboration and effective coordination between the acute hospitals and their clinical partners in the community. Done right, this will free up acute beds for patients with more serious conditions and reduce cost for those requiring less intensive care in the community.&nbsp; Dr Lam referred to this as \"seamless, integrated care\".&nbsp;&nbsp;I code-name it as \"hassle-free healthcare system\".&nbsp; And one key enabler is the National Electronic Healthcare Records (NEHR), to allow all providers common access to an individual's critical medical information, so that they can develop and coordinate shared care plans. This will reduce unnecessary repeat tests and medication errors, and bring us one step closer to the <p align=left>Column: 3497</p>vision of \"One Patient&nbsp;&ndash; One Medical Record\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the team planning the new Jurong General Hospital (JGH)&nbsp;the project brief to build a hassle-free healthcare system to serve the residents in the West.&nbsp; They accepted the challenge.&nbsp; Being ambitious, they self-imposed an additional target: &nbsp;to make JGH a paperless hospital when it opens.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the hospital team in KTPH, CGH and TTSH are also trying to do the same for their respective regions.&nbsp; They will compete to deliver the best ideas. And&nbsp;I told my Ministry of Health colleagues that&nbsp;this is our priority in the next decade.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;it will take us a decade to complete this assignment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, with more elderly patients requiring care in the community, including those with dementia, we are expanding our long term care sector.&nbsp;This is a point emphasised by several Members&nbsp;&ndash; Ms Indranee Rajah, Mdm Cynthia Phua.&nbsp; Many chronic patients can be cared for at home by their family members and their maids.&nbsp; But as Dr Lily Neo and Mdm Cynthia Phua observed, distress among caregivers might arise.&nbsp; I agree that carers need training and support, and we will help them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All elderly patients want to age at home and many children want to take care of their elderly parents at home. We will build up the home nursing capabilities and we are working with several partners to do so.&nbsp; We must avoid seniors becoming permanent residents in nursing homes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working with the Home Nursing Foundation (HNF) to scale up their operations. They will also extend their services beyond the low-income group to also help the higher-income group access appropriate home nursing care.&nbsp; Many patients do not need subsidies but may <p align=left>Column: 3498</p>not have the knowledge and the contact of how to meet their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;HNF is working with the TTSH team to ensure a smooth handover&nbsp;for patients newly&nbsp;discharged from the hospital.&nbsp; Once a patient is home,&nbsp;HNF will coordinate with other providers to meet the patient's care needs in the community.&nbsp; We will launch this new initiative within the next couple of months, targeting patients in the Central region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Terry Lee suggested the use of mobile medical services. Some VWOs do run mobile clinics to bring medical care and treatment to the patients at home. SATA is one example. St Andrew's Community Hospital is another.&nbsp; Recently, it launched a new service, what they call&nbsp;\"hospital-on-wheels\",&nbsp;to \"bus\" its team of doctors and nurses around Singapore.&nbsp; We are open to all practical ideas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, a minority of elderly&nbsp;patients will unfortunately require long-term care in a nursing home.&nbsp; In Europe, up to 7% of the&nbsp;elderly&nbsp;live in nursing homes. We now have 62 nursing homes,&nbsp;serving 2% of our elderly population.&nbsp;This is not excessive, neither is it grossly inadequate as we are a young society and family bonding is still strong.&nbsp; There is, however, variance in the performance standards of our nursing homes.&nbsp; While some well-run nursing homes are full with a long waiting list, a few others have significant vacancies. We will push the weaker nursing homes to upgrade so that resources are put to optimal use.&nbsp; Still, there is scope for some&nbsp;expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are currently planning&nbsp;three new nursing homes and rebuilding three old ones in larger facilities in better locations&nbsp;within HDB towns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must not&nbsp;make it too easy for irresponsible children to abandon their parents. Abandonment is not a&nbsp;major issue here but we do encounter some from time to time.&nbsp; Last week, Ms Indranee Rajah quoted one case involving <p align=left>Column: 3499</p>her resident.&nbsp; When it happens, it is a very sad situation.&nbsp; I will talk more about&nbsp;this later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Straughan asked about the impact of the increased foreign worker levy on nursing homes.&nbsp;We have assessed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the direct cost impact actually is small.&nbsp; But, separately, we have just increased our subvention to them by about 7% to&nbsp;help them cope with&nbsp;the higher cost of treating patients with more severe disabilities, what we call category&nbsp;III and category&nbsp;IV patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;increase will be quite substantial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we will back up the physical expansion with the necessary manpower.&nbsp; In the public sector, we have been&nbsp;adding more doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, to improve the staff-to-patient ratio. We launched&nbsp;this in 2007, when we set aside $1.5 billion to recruit 7,700 more healthcare professionals. We are now halfway through this five-year plan. And I am pleased to report to Dr Lily&nbsp;Neo and Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Straughan that we&nbsp;are on track to achieving the target.&nbsp; Our headcounts have increased by 44%. Our doctor staffing level has gone up from six doctors to eight doctors per 10 beds.&nbsp; Our nurse staffing level has gone up from 20 nurses to 26 nurses per 10 beds.&nbsp;Recently, I met a group of hospital Medical Social Workers where we have been adding numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were \"complaining\" to me that many of their new recruits do not even have offices&nbsp;and&nbsp;the hospital is rapidly adding workstations to hold them.&nbsp; Equally important is staff retention as Dr Fatimah Lateef emphasised. Although our staff attrition rates have come down from 8% to 6% for doctors and from 10% to 7% for nurses, it is an ongoing challenge. With two new private hospitals coming on-stream, we must expect significant attrition. The only practical way forward is to ramp up training and foreign recruitment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3500</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, in my Sembawang branch, I bade farewell to a&nbsp;young Party activist who left us&nbsp;to&nbsp;start her medical education in a medical school in New South Wales.&nbsp;I asked her about the student intake numbers. She said that she was not sure but&nbsp;more than 300 per year for her batch.&nbsp; But she knew that in her batch, there would be 60 international students.&nbsp; But out of the 60, 40 are Singaporeans.&nbsp; And this is just in one medical school in Australia.&nbsp; I remember blogging about it after hearing this and I made a point that I will figure out a way to \"get our kids back\" to Singapore.&nbsp; And I will. The restructured hospitals are studying an idea of offering a pre-employment grant to these medical students, to help them with their costs overseas,&nbsp;in return for a bond&nbsp;to serve them when they graduate.&nbsp; It was an idea that Dr Lily Neo planted in my head some years ago and I think it is doable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also been embracing the value proposition of a career in the&nbsp;public sector. We are investing in biomedical research and supporting those with research interest.&nbsp; For the&nbsp;young doctors, we are ramping up training opportunities. This will allow every young doctor to reach his maximum potential in his chosen specialty, including as a family physician. We are setting aside $120 million to strengthen our specialist training programmes over the next five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also building up geriatric care capabilities. We will encourage GPs to undertake further post-graduate training in geriatric care so that they can better manage their patients in the community. In addition, we will also need more specialist geriatricians. We have 48 now. Over the next three years, we expect to increase it by 30% to 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have incorporated geriatric medicine as a core module of our medical student undergraduate training, and have introduced incentive allowances for geriatric trainees over the more popular specialities.&nbsp; Next to <p align=left>Column: 3501</p>the&nbsp;new KTPH,&nbsp;we are right now planning a community hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;My project brief to the team is, let us raise the level, ie,&nbsp;create the next generation of community hospital. They are actively thinking about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the fresh ideas being considered is to base an institute of geriatrics and gerontology there.&nbsp; It can be a think tank of practical people to help conceptualise and facilitate successful ageing, working closely with Government agencies, NGOs and the community leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also upgrading our nurses so that more can take on greater responsibilities and deliver more complex care as Advanced Practice Nurse (APNs).&nbsp; We are targeting 200 new APNs over the next five years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important group of healthcare professionals are the Allied Health Professionals (AHPs). We have started regulating optometrists and opticians.&nbsp; Later this year, I will come back to Parliament with a Bill to regulate the other professions. For this year, we will target the registration of the physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists. Some 1,300 therapists will be involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, we are enhancing our mental health programme, a topic raised by several Members. We made this commitment in 2007 when we rolled out a National Mental Health Blueprint and we backed it up with $123 million budget. The strategy includes offering a range of treatment options from acute care at IMH to follow-up care in the community. We are making some headway.&nbsp; We now have many more Community Mental Health Teams to facilitate the early detection and treatment of mental health cases within the community.&nbsp; We have developed <p align=left>Column: 3502</p>programmes for at-risk groups such as caregivers and out-of-school youths.&nbsp; We also have an employers-led alliance that promotes the importance of mental well-being at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as noted by Dr Lam and Mdm Halimah, the biggest obstacle to an enhanced mental health programme is stigma and unfounded prejudice.&nbsp; Mental illness makes people fearful.&nbsp; High profile crisis incidents lead people to think that the mentally ill are all dangerous and should all be locked away.&nbsp; The lack of public empathy for the mentally ill arises from misinformation and ignorance.&nbsp;With treatment and support, most mentally-ill patients can recover and can function in the community.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Ong Ah Heng, Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Amy Khor&nbsp;have asked about the follow-up care for discharged IMH patients and crisis support.&nbsp; I heard with concern Dr Amy Khor's account of&nbsp;a resident who committed suicide last month after discharge from IMH.&nbsp; I do not know the details of this case and whether there are systemic gaps which could have prevented this tragedy.&nbsp; We should try to minimise the suicide rate but, unfortunately, not all suicides are preventable.&nbsp; IMH carefully selects the patients to be discharged.&nbsp; They must have responded positively to treatment, have adequate family or social support and pose minimum danger to themselves or to others.&nbsp; IMH would then teach such patients and their families on the need to comply with medication and regular follow-up to avoid future relapse.&nbsp; Those with higher risk of relapse are followed up closely by their community mental health teams.&nbsp; IMH now runs a 24-hour hotline and provides advice and support to families and patients during periods of crisis.&nbsp; Our follow-up care is getting better but we know there are still gaps.&nbsp; MPs' comments earlier confirm this.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3503</p> I am, therefore, adding a further $57 million for mental health initiatives on top of the $123 million already committed.&nbsp; This is a significant $180 million commitment to enhancing our mental health programme.&nbsp; Part of the new budget will be used to increase psychiatric nursing manpower, another will go towards setting up a long-term monitoring and risk assessment system.&nbsp; It will help identify and provide support for patients who default follow-up appointments or treatments, thereby reducing the number who relapse because they do not take their medication.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for this strategy to work we need the support of the community, accommodation and job opportunities so that they can lead normal lives again.&nbsp; Hence, I fully agree with Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mdm Cynthia Phua that working with employers, community partners and the grassroots is a must.&nbsp; IMH's \"job club\" has successfully placed more than 380 patients over the last two years with the help of enlightened employers.&nbsp; And I share Mdm Halimah's hope that more such enlightened employers would come forward to offer such job opportunities.&nbsp; IMH will certainly work with VWOs and the community to tap on their resources to help expand IMH's outreach to the discharged patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Fatimah asked about the use of Medisave for schizophrenia and severe depression.&nbsp; Five months after implementation, it has benefited 500 patients who withdrew a total of $160,000 for their outpatient treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, healthcare is a complicated subject.&nbsp; It is also highly emotional and that is why it gets politicised very quickly.&nbsp; Just&nbsp;see what is happening now in Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on the Obama health reforms &ndash; it is largely politicking.&nbsp; Health systems are, therefore, distorted in all countries, becoming dysfunctional <p align=left>Column: 3504</p>when distortions become extreme.&nbsp; To reduce distortions, we have consciously tried to stick to the basics.&nbsp; And what are they?&nbsp; First, as stressed by Dr Lam, health outcome is largely a personal matter.&nbsp; Doctors and nurses can only point the way forward, the patient must play his part.&nbsp; This is especially so in the case of chronic illnesses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there is no free healthcare.&nbsp; Every healthcare service is eventually paid for by the patient, either through taxes or reduced wages.&nbsp; Ultimately, patients and their families pay for the bills.&nbsp; Our job is to make sure that the cost of delivery is as low as possible, and this means cutting out abuses and other moral hazards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, specialisation and sub-specialisation have brought about much medical advances and benefiting many acute patients.&nbsp; But as noted by Dr Fatimah Lateef, there is also such a thing as over sub-specialisation.&nbsp; For the elderly with several chronic illnesses, treatment by multiple sub-specialists is often not the best approach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, despite medical advances, we are still mortals and we will die one day.&nbsp; Three weeks before Dr Chee Pui Hang passed away, I visited him in his house.&nbsp; We had a good chat for the last time.&nbsp; He had been frail but rejected all attempts by his attending doctors to get him hospitalised.&nbsp; He had the money and the medical network to get the most up-to-date sophisticated medical interventions, but he knew that they would be futile.&nbsp; The interventions might extend his biological life by a few days, or a few weeks, but he knew that the hospitalisation would, in fact, reduce his social interactions and quality time with his loved ones.&nbsp; He wanted every hour of his remaining life to be with his family and friends in the comfort of his home.&nbsp; This is a wise man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, when cure is no longer available, care becomes the the most valued by <p align=left>Column: 3505</p>patients, and the highest form of care is underpinned by love and compassion.&nbsp; Last month, I visited the St Joseph's Home in Jurong and watched the saintly Sister Geraldine in action.&nbsp; And she has many wonderful stories to tell, all were inspiring.&nbsp; In her gentle, soft-spoken way, she leads a team of nurses, carers and volunteers, caring the patients with selfless dedication and love.&nbsp; I asked her, \"do you have difficult patients or family members?\"&nbsp; She said, \"yes\".&nbsp; She went on to relate one incident where the son of&nbsp;a patient demanded that the nurses should brush his mother's teeth within 15 minutes after every meal.&nbsp; He said that he loved his mother, and such a service level would be in line with the patient-centric mission of the Home and also a demonstration of love and compassion.&nbsp; Sister Geraldine gently but firmly reminded the man that a place in a nursing home is a gift, it is not a right.&nbsp; If every patient imposed such a demand, they will not be able to cope.&nbsp; She went on to add that the nursing staff &ndash; whether it is an employee or a volunteer or a Catholic nun and no matter how kind and compassionate &ndash;&nbsp;is not the son of the patient.&nbsp; The man got the message.&nbsp; The love of family members cannot be delegated away.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was why it was so sad to hear Ms Indranee Rajah speaking about a case of abandonment of parents by one resident.&nbsp; Our hospital nurses have also begun to come across cases of children refusing to take back their parents after discharge.&nbsp; They demand that the parents be sent to a nursing home instead.&nbsp; The numbers are still small but we must not allow this to become a trend.&nbsp; I have told our hospitals to be firm with such irresponsible children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three years ago, I spent several days in Kenya's Masai Mara Game Reserve&nbsp;watching wild animals in their natural <p align=left>Column: 3506</p>habitat.&nbsp; It was the season for their annual long march as some two million wildebeests&nbsp;&ndash; a kind of antelope &ndash; migrate&nbsp;northwards from Serengeti&nbsp;National Park in Tanzania, in search of water and food.&nbsp; Along the way, many would perish as they got eaten up by crocodiles as they crossed rivers or hunted down by lions and cheetahs&nbsp;in the savannah plain.&nbsp; One late afternoon, we were positioned near the edge of Mara River as a group of wildebeests, numbering tens of thousands attempted a river crossing.&nbsp; There was much hesitation as they could see crocodiles waiting in the river.&nbsp; Almost ritualistically, a leader would eventually emerge, go into the river alone, test the water, and suddenly make a dash across the river.&nbsp; The rest would then rapidly follow in a mass stampede.&nbsp; I prayed for their safety but, inevitably, the weakest could not make it.&nbsp; Most made it and continued their journey northwards.&nbsp; Some, visibly old and frail, dared not even cross and were left behind on the south side of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we gathered our cameras and videos to return to camp, we suddenly saw a small group of wildebeests,&nbsp;numbering about 30, which had already made a successful crossing, yet, surprisingly, backtracked.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had already crossed the river but backtracked to presumably rejoin their family members which had failed to make the crossing.&nbsp; Instead of moving on with the rest of the pack, they risked their lives in order to be with their loved ones.&nbsp; It was very moving and very touching.&nbsp; It was an instinctive expression of family bonds, love and sacrifice.&nbsp; I prayed for them even more deeply because the night will bring even more dangers as they were now in a smaller group.&nbsp; These were wild beasts but their behaviour that afternoon was not beastly at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, our population is ageing and living longer.&nbsp; We have a good health care system but past solutions will not work as well for the future.&nbsp; That is why we have been quietly restructuring our <p align=left>Column: 3507</p>healthcare delivery system and gearing it up for our future with many more elderly patients.&nbsp; It is a quiet revolution, no fanfare, no sensational headline news.&nbsp; But if we do it well, our efforts will show positive results in 10 years' time. This I promise. I do not know if I will&nbsp;stay so long in the Ministry of Health, though.&nbsp; We have a lot to do.&nbsp; We need to work harder at keeping patients well in the community, avoiding unnecessary hospitalisation, achieving greater integration between hospitals and the community partners and helping patients achieve successful ageing at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not alone.&nbsp; Every country is trying to figure out the best solutions.&nbsp; The efforts are not just happening in the public sector nor are they restricted to the healthcare sector.&nbsp; The industries are seeing an important role for themselves in tackling the ageing problem.&nbsp; In Japan, Toto &ndash; the largest toilet producer &ndash; makes a toilet that has arms supports to help the old get off the toilet more easily.&nbsp; They were the first to come up with the toilet seat with an integrated bidet.&nbsp; When I first saw it in Japan many years ago, I thought it was because of infection control reasons.&nbsp; They said no.&nbsp;They explained that using water to cleanse rather than paper reduces efforts for the seniors.&nbsp; Zojirushi, an appliance maker, has a kettle that sends a wireless message if granny does not use it by a certain time each morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a clever, non-intrusive way&nbsp;for families to check that things are all right with their elderly.&nbsp; There are many such pockets of excellence and innovations all over the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In healthcare, I regularly remind my colleagues that we must challenge ourselves to match the best performer in each class. But the job is not mine alone.&nbsp; My Ministry can only provide a supportive environment.&nbsp; Successful living and successful ageing are personal choices.&nbsp; Dr Chee Pui Hang provided an example,<p align=left>Column: 3508</p> but there are many others.&nbsp; Prof. Chan Heng Leong, a former Head of Medicine in NUS, is another,&nbsp;a brilliant doctor, a dedicated academic and a good family man.&nbsp; He could have earned more in private sector but chose a public career to teach and to treat the poor.&nbsp; In retirement, he continued to contribute in the university and at the hospital.&nbsp; When his time was up, he refused further medical interventions and passed away peacefully at home&nbsp;surrounded by his loved ones.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few days of these wise people are not mournful partings but quiet celebrations of having lived a fulfilling life.&nbsp; Friends and family members drop by to talk about the past and the good times together.&nbsp; Some, I suppose,&nbsp;even <I>karaoke</I> and probably sing <I>Jin Daban -&nbsp;zuihou yi ye: hong deng jiang mie, jiu ye xing, ci ke gai kai xiang ta gao bie&nbsp;</I>( &#37329;&#22823;&#29677; - &#26368;&#21518;&#19968;&#22812;: &ldquo;&#32418;&#28783;&#23558;&#28781;,&#37202;&#20063;&#37266;, &#27492;&#21051;&#35813;&#21521;&#23427;&#21578;&#21035;&rdquo;).&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not think I need to translate because&nbsp;I am told that this&nbsp;is a very popular&nbsp; <I>karaoke</I> song amongst Members of Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Mr Chairman, everyone, rich or poor, will say goodbye one day.&nbsp; And we all want to end well.&nbsp; But to end well, we need to stay well and live a healthy and fulfilling life.&nbsp; We have different starting points but all can live well.&nbsp; Over the weekend, I was so happy to read about Jeremy Lim's achievements at his GCE 'A' level examinations.&nbsp; He was an NKF Ambassador when I first met him several years ago.&nbsp; He was born with a brittle bone disease and told me that even a severe cough could fracture his ribs.&nbsp; He is wheelchair bound but has never allowed the disability to hold him back.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he put it to <I>Zaobao</I> &nbsp;over the weekend,&nbsp;\"We cannot determine what life will bring us, but we can determine our life journey\".&nbsp; He added,&nbsp;\"I cannot walk like other kids, but I can still do many things that other kids can\".&nbsp; He told <I>Straits Times</I> this:&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I <p align=left>Column: 3509</p>focus on the things that I have, rather than the things that I don't.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is really a series of successive moments.&nbsp; We cannot change the past moments and we do not know what the next moment will bring.&nbsp; But we can all seize the current moment and live it to the fullest helping others and touching their lives.&nbsp; How?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lao-tzu's prescription is 2,500 years old but I think it remains relevant today: &ldquo;&#19978;&#21892;&#33509;&#27700;, &#27700;&#21892;&#21033;&#19975;&#29289;&#32780;&#19981;&#20105;&rdquo;.

I would thus like the Minister to consider the following issues.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to provide integrated care so that patients can move easily from acute hospitals to community hospitals to nursing homes or their own homes depending on their needs. So co-location of facilities like the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, promoting greater synergies amongst the different levels of care and greater sharing of information and records <p align=left>Column: 3511</p>amongst them would certainly provide better integration of care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also&nbsp;necessary to ensure that the different subsidy level between acute hospitals and community hospitals does not derail right siting as people would certainly prefer to stay where the subsidy is&nbsp;highest and the cost lowest.&nbsp; MOH should also make it easier for people to take care of their sick family members at home by strengthening home visits by doctors and other healthcare professionals and making these services cheaper as there are limited subsidies now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area is financing of healthcare. The 3M system, together with the 3E system (Eldersave, ElderShield and Elderfund), provides a strong foundation for healthcare financing.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to constantly review these schemes to ensure their adequacy.&nbsp; At the same time, there is a need to review other policies which have an impact on affordability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I asked for more subsidies for some procedures carried out in the C or B2 wards such as the knee replacement surgery. I hope to get an update from the Ministry on the progress of this review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other area is the cost of medicine which can be very expensive for treatments such as cancer.&nbsp; The Minister had mentioned that instead of subsidising all expensive medicines, he would consider extending Medifund to middle-income Singaporeans who cannot afford the high cost of medicine. Can the Ministry give an update on this?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, in order to help families take care of those who are ill, there has to be stronger community-based care for the elderly or those suffering from severe illnesses such as mental illness.&nbsp; Our community-based care is weak which is the reason why most opt for institutional <p align=left>Column: 3512</p>care, thus crowding out our hospitals.&nbsp; I would like to urge for stronger community-based care and, in particular, more subsidies for home-based care.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Affordability of community hospitals</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, as the Minister and other Members of this House have noted, the healthcare system is being restructured to meet the challenges of a rapidly ageing population. A key focus would be to build up step-down care facilities to complement the public hospitals.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute care hospitals, like TTSH, are seeing a changing profile of patients.&nbsp; They are currently not equipped to handle older patients who are being admitted more frequently, have multiple problems and require longer hospitalisation.&nbsp; This has added to the pressure on hospital beds leading to the recent incident at TTSH where patients were put&nbsp;on movable trolley beds and placed temporarily at the hospital's corridors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrating the whole spectrum of services from acute hospitals to home care would help to optimise scarce resources and remove strains on certain facilities, chief of which are the public hospitals. For this to be successful, we need a mindset change of both the healthcare providers as well as patients and their families.&nbsp; All things being equal, it is generally more expensive to stay in an acute care hospital than a community hospital.&nbsp; Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence on the ground suggests that there tends to be resistance to admission into community hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some public perception that community hospitals are poor cousins of acute hospitals, lacking the full range of medical equipment and specialists. It does not help that many community hospitals are run by charities or religious groups <p align=left>Column: 3513</p>which do not have the financial muscle to match salaries at the public and private hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REACH's Policies Study Work Group on Ageing and Health conducted a study of 800 Singaporeans aged 25 to 64 years and found that 44% of respondents held the misunderstanding that stroke patients can only be discharged from acute hospitals when the patient is completely well and not&nbsp;when the patient is stable and ready for rehabilitation services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey also found that the decision to transfer the stroke patient to step-down care facilities such as community hospitals or day rehabilitation centres is strongly influenced by the out-of-pocket expenses required for these services.&nbsp; All things being equal, even though the total bill size for a stay at an acute hospital is more, the out-of-pocket expenses for the community hospital are generally higher than that for an acute hospital. This is due to the different means-testing systems employed as well as the lower allowable Medisave claims for community hospitals or no claims allowed for day rehabilitation centres and home care services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would thus like to ask the Minister to intensify its efforts to educate the public on the value and benefits of rehabilitation and correct the misperception that community hospitals are the poor cousins of acute hospitals. The Ministry should also review the quantum of Medisave that can be claimed for community hospitals and allow the use of Medisave for day rehabilitation centres. This will lead to greater optimisation of different healthcare facilities.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>: Mr Sin Boon Ann is not here.

According to the Ministry's reply to my Parliamentary Question last month, only 15% of chronic disease outpatients paid bills with Medisave in FY2008.&nbsp; Of those who did utilise Medisave for payment, only 30% of claims reached the annual limits on withdrawal of $300.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently met an elderly gentleman with hypertension who has Medisave balances but is unable to use them to pay outpatient bills.&nbsp; This is because of the current policy that the outpatient must pay the first $30 of any bill.&nbsp; He showed me that many of his polyclinic bills were below $30.&nbsp; According to MOH's data, the median size of polyclinic bills for chronic diseases is $36 with three months' medication.&nbsp; With the $30 deductible plus an additional 15% of the balance to be paid in cash, Medisave would not be usable or useful for many of such bills.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are elderly sick who have little cash and savings.&nbsp; Yet, they are not allowed to draw their own Medisave money for medical treatment but are asked to get family support. This increases the elderly person's dependence on family members.&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly gentleman I mentioned told me that he would sometimes default on his follow-ups due to finances. This could precipitate a worse inpatient condition which will deplete his Medisave even more rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government may be concerned about Medisave accounts being depleted but safeguards already exist via the annual $300 cap, the requirement to co-pay 15% and the administrative fee of $3.50.&nbsp; Sir, the Government should consider removing the deductible. There is <p align=left>Column: 3515</p>anger amongst some elderly sick that even in their poor health condition, they have been denied the use of their own savings for healthcare.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Adequacy of Medisave</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, Medisave is one of the biggest pillars of our healthcare system.&nbsp; However, with increasing medical cost, there will be tremendous strains on our Medisave.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister the following questions on adequacy.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, has the Ministry done any projections to assess how much Singaporeans would need to save in their Medisave in order to meet their long-term care needs, say, over a 10- or 20-year timeframe?

They read about us and its Health Minister led a team here to probe.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the new financial year, our budget to subsidise patients will increase by 10% to $2.2 billion.&nbsp; I am grateful to the Finance Minister for his support.&nbsp; In fact, the increase is more as the Finance Ministry has also topped up Medisave accounts, Medifund and Eldercare Fund by $710 million.&nbsp; These top-ups are, in fact, subsidies as they help Singaporeans pay for their future healthcare needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Government subsidy for healthcare is the first layer of protection for Singaporeans, which ensures universal access to basic healthcare by all.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3517</p> Because the 3Ms label does not include this item, Government subsidy is often taken for granted.&nbsp; I have been trying&nbsp;to see how we can slip in the \"S\" (for subsidy) into the 3Ms.&nbsp; But in the end, I still end up with just 3Ms.&nbsp; I suppose the small \"s\" in the&nbsp;3Ms&nbsp;could be \"subsidy\", but in real life our subsidy actually is a big \"S\" and&nbsp;not a small \"s\" at all.&nbsp; It is our huge Government subsidy which differentiates our healthcare funding model from that in the US, Japan and many European countries, where hospitals and clinics would charge all their patients at full cost without subsidy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, 80% of the patients in our hospitals choose Class B2 or C wards.&nbsp; In these wards, the bulk of the cost is picked up by the Government.&nbsp; For example, a Class C patient going for a hip replacement surgery, which is a major surgery, would cost the hospital, on average, $17,500.&nbsp; Eighty per cent of the cost, or $14,000, is paid by my Ministry through our annual subvention to the hospital.&nbsp; The patient co-pays the remaining 20% or $3,500, which are largely covered by MediShield and his Medisave savings.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah spoke about knee replacement surgery, which she raised&nbsp;last year.&nbsp;We have fixed the problem&nbsp;by revising the claim limits.&nbsp; On average, the cost of treating such a patient in Class C now is about $16,000.&nbsp; My Ministry subsidises about $11,500 with the patient co-paying the remaining $4,500.&nbsp; With Medisave and MediShield, many do not have to pay anything out of pocket, unless they insist on some&nbsp;costly fanciful implants.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our approach to subsidising care.&nbsp; As medical advances and hospital operating costs go up, we increase our subvention to the hospitals so that patients remain subsidised in accordance <p align=left>Column: 3518</p>with the prescribed subsidy policy.&nbsp; We actually miss the target sometimes.&nbsp; For example, Class B2 subsidy is 65%, with patients co-paying 35% of cost.&nbsp; But, in reality, B2 patients today co-pay 30%, which is five percentage points below target.&nbsp; We will have to close the gap eventually, but let me assure Members that it will be gradual and will not inflict unnecessary hardship on our patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Government subsidies, Medisave forms the second layer of protection.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah put it, it is a key pillar of our healthcare system.&nbsp; Medisave turns 26 this year.&nbsp; Collectively, we now have more than $45 billion in Medisave.&nbsp; At the individual account level, all salaried employees have healthy Medisave balances for themselves and their dependents.&nbsp; There are many statistics to prove this point, but let me just highlight one.&nbsp; By age 50, the average Medisave balance of all salaried employees would have exceeded $27,000.&nbsp; This is good for 18 hospital admissions if he chooses Class C.&nbsp; And even if he chooses Class A, it can cover six hospital admissions.&nbsp; This assumes he has no insurance coverage.&nbsp; But 90% of all Singaporeans have MediShield coverage, which would reduce the patient's share of the bill substantially.&nbsp; For these Singaporeans, their Medisave balances can cover even more hospital admissions.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a remarkable achievement.&nbsp; Medisave is one main reason why sophisticated but costly healthcare services are within the reach of all Singaporeans, including the lower-income group.&nbsp; In the current health reforms debate in Washington, serious economists are all advocating what they call \"HSA\" (health savings account) as a necessary solution for the American healthcare system.&nbsp; Medisave is a HSA&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a health savings account; we pioneered it long before economists developed this insight and coined this term.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3519</p>The idea came from Minister Mentor Lee.&nbsp; Dr Goh Keng Swee sketched out a rough outline.&nbsp; Senior Minister Goh fleshed out the details, persuaded Singaporeans to accept this idea and got it successfully implemented.&nbsp; We have all three to thank for this innovation, which has now become an integral part of Singaporean life.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about the existing Medisave contribution rates.&nbsp; This is tied in with the overall CPF contribution rate and is a factor in employment cost and overall competitiveness.&nbsp; I have no grave concern on the adequacy of the existing Medisave contribution rate.&nbsp; But I must add one caveat on the self-employed who form 12% of CPF members.&nbsp; Many are careful and contribute regularly to their Medisave. They too have an average Medisave balance close to the salaried employees of similar income band.&nbsp; My worry is the 140,000 self-employed members who have an average Medisave balance below $10,000, some just a mere few thousand dollars.&nbsp; Out of this group, only 40% had made some contribution to their Medisave last year.&nbsp; Even then, it is usually&nbsp;just nominally.&nbsp; They would get into problems if they or their dependants fall sick.&nbsp; And it would be worse if they also do not subscribe to MediShield and ElderShield.&nbsp; We must all help to get them into Medisave, MediShield and ElderShield, so that they can enjoy the same protection as the salaried employees.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about the adequacy of the Medisave Minimum Sum.&nbsp; She asked if it is adequate to meet the needs of an ageing population.&nbsp; The current Medisave Minimum Sum&nbsp;is at $32,000 and is not bad for those opting for Class B2 or Class C wards and have MediShield and ElderShield coverage.&nbsp; We will continue to adjust it annually to take into account medical inflation, so as to preserve the purchasing power of the account holders.&nbsp; My concern is that currently, most are not able to achieve the <p align=left>Column: 3520</p>Medisave Minimum Sum by the time they reach 55.&nbsp; The top 40% of income earners are all right, but not those in the lower-income group.&nbsp; That is why we have to be careful in not over-liberalising the use of Medisave for other purposes, which it was not originally designed for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the unpleasant task of being the gatekeeper to Medisave.&nbsp; I heard Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; Yes, Medisave is your own money, but if it runs out prematurely, the member will be in trouble.&nbsp; And I am trying to prevent such an outcome.&nbsp; That is why we have stringent Medisave withdrawal rules and limits.&nbsp; This will help to balance current consumption against future needs and ensure that Singaporeans have enough Medisave to look after their medical needs during retirement.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) and the deductible of $30 that we put in.&nbsp; She made a couple of observations:&nbsp;one, that the utilisation rate of this scheme seems below expectation, less than 15% of chronically ill have made use of this scheme.&nbsp; It is not a surprise to me because when we estimate&nbsp;the total number of chronically ill, it is&nbsp;based on the disease incidence.&nbsp; Like in all population, probably&nbsp;half of those with chronic illness do not even know they have the disease.&nbsp; And that is why we must&nbsp;step up mass screening.&nbsp; And even among those half who knew they have a chronic disease, not all come forward.&nbsp; Many studies have shown, and again also observed in Singapore, that only half of those who knew they have chronic disease&nbsp;will come forward to see a doctor.&nbsp; And among those who come forward to see a doctor, not all comply; they may decide that changing lifestyle is too troublesome; taking medication is too troublesome, or for whatever reasons.&nbsp; So, when&nbsp;15% of potential users of this scheme come forward, I thought it was not bad.&nbsp; At first, I thought we cannot even cross&nbsp;10%.&nbsp; But, yes, we should now aim higher and <p align=left>Column: 3521</p>try to get&nbsp;more people to make use of&nbsp;this scheme.&nbsp; I have spoken to some who are on regular chronic disease management&nbsp;but not using the Medisave.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked them, they said&nbsp;\"why should I\", and they gave a couple of reasons.&nbsp; One, some of them are paid for by their employers, so&nbsp;there is no need for them to use their own Medisave.&nbsp; Secondly, some are quite smart, they said that Medisave pays interest rate&nbsp;&ndash; I do not know what it is now&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;4%-5%.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have enough cash, and&nbsp;they say they will pay cash, which in the bank you cannot even collect 0.5% interest rate today.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;there are all sorts of reasons why we ended up with only 15% utilisation.&nbsp; I do not think we should be discouraged by this&nbsp;figure.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deductible is a problem that can be easily overcome, and I have spoken to GPs and our own polyclinics.&nbsp; And one way they do it&nbsp;&ndash; which is quite legitimate&nbsp;and in fact advisable&nbsp;&ndash; is they package it up.&nbsp; So, yes, each visit may be only about $30 or $40, as noted by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; But these are chronic disease management programme, we expect the patients to come forward three or four times a year depending on the risk profile.&nbsp; And, in fact, we want the patients to come forward.&nbsp; We would be very worried if they only come once and disappear.&nbsp; Then compliance would be a problem and their diabetes or&nbsp;high blood pressure will not be managed well.&nbsp; So, many clinics have now offered what is called package deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;They charge per year or even per two years and the whole sum, let us say, $250, will attract the same deductible of $30.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest can be&nbsp;deducted from their Medisave.&nbsp; So, this&nbsp;is one way to overcome this deductible issue but, more importantly, it secures compliance by the patients.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently there was some public discussion on the use of Medisave for health screening.&nbsp; I think Dr Lam Pin Min and Dr Fatimah Lateef have suggested <p align=left>Column: 3522</p>that we consider expanding Medisave for health screening, subject to certain limits and guidelines.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sympathetic to the call as I believe in prevention.&nbsp; Regular screening and early detection followed by medical intervention and lifestyle changes can avoid future complications and costly medical treatment down the road.&nbsp; There is a case for allowing some Medisave withdrawals for health screening.&nbsp; The question is what kind of health screening?&nbsp; There is a wide range of health screening tests; not all are fully justified or necessary.&nbsp; More screening is not necessarily better.&nbsp; Some accrue benefits more to the provider than the consumer.&nbsp; We must be mindful of such pitfalls.&nbsp; As Dr Fatimah put it, we may be opening a Pandora's Box.&nbsp; A mindless liberalisation of Medisave for health screening may not improve health outcomes, but instead prematurely deplete Medisave balances.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example of health screening which is being promoted in the West: genetic screening to predict the risk of a person getting a particular disease later in life.&nbsp; These are sophisticated tests and, of course, very expensive.&nbsp; The clinics love it because it improves&nbsp;their topline and bottomline.&nbsp; Last month, the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> published a timely research finding on the effectiveness of the current gene markers to help doctors predict which women would develop heart disease.&nbsp; The study found that we still do not yet know enough about genetics for health risk prediction.&nbsp; The article concluded that \"instead cholesterol levels, blood pressure and family history remain the better indicators for determining who is at risk for having a heart attack, stroke or dying from heart disease\".&nbsp; At the moment, the traditional screening methods are still more reliable and very much cheaper.&nbsp; But they are less <p align=left>Column: 3523</p>glamorous and bring in less revenue for the clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure genetic forecasting will become more useful in future, as their scientific promises are fascinating.&nbsp; But meanwhile, the results are still disappointing.&nbsp; As one <I>International Herald Tribune</I> (IHT) article&nbsp;put it: \"If you want to learn your odds of getting different diseases, consult your family history.&nbsp; Or visit a fortune teller.&nbsp; For most traits, genetic testing is little better than consulting the tea leaves.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic testing is one example.&nbsp; But there are many other sophisticated screening tests which are also being promoted.&nbsp; All are expensive.&nbsp; The benefits or cost-effectiveness of such tests are often dubious.&nbsp; I call this unethical screening.&nbsp; Health screening is therefore a complex issue and the risks associated with unethical screening are real.&nbsp; We must not fall into the trap of such commercial practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, my Ministry will set up an expert group to review the range of healthcare screening available here and recommend a framework to determine what constitutes appropriate health screening.&nbsp; We will then be in a better position to advise Singaporeans, as suggested by Dr Fatimah, so that they do not get fleeced.&nbsp;She did not use those words, I do.&nbsp; Prof. Lee Hin Peng will chair this expert group.&nbsp; He is a senior public health specialist and has a special interest in cancer screening and prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose to put this group under the auspices of the Academy of Medicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, we will study the financial implications of health screening so that should we decide to open up Medisave for it, we will know how to prescribe the necessary withdrawal limits.&nbsp; This was the approach we took when we opened up Medisave for outpatient chronic disease management.&nbsp; It is a prudent approach to exploit the benefits of Medisave liberalisation, while minimising the downside risks <p align=left>Column: 3524</p>of over-servicing and over-consumption.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I have noted the various suggestions&nbsp;by Members and I will try to incorporate them in due course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of Medisave usage is in the intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) sector. Several Members have commented on the need for rational Medisave withdrawal rules to encourage right-siting of patients in the community.&nbsp; And I agree.&nbsp; Today, Medisave can be withdrawn for community hospitals, subject to a daily withdrawal limit of $150, up to an annual cap of $3,500. This is largely adequate for patients undergoing rehabilitation.&nbsp; However, we are stepping up the capabilities of the community hospital so that they can also serve sub-acute patients, for example, those with hip fractures, and elderly with kidney and urinary tract infections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, such patients are kept in acute hospitals where their Medisave withdrawal limits are higher, at $450 per day.&nbsp; But it makes sense for the patients to be transferred to a community hospital where the total cost is lower.&nbsp; However, current withdrawal limits may deter such patients from moving to community hospitals because of higher out-of-pocket payments, as Dr Amy Khor pointed out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fix this anomaly, we will do two things.&nbsp; First, we will subvent the community hospitals which partner the acute hospitals to provide sub-acute care, more. The daily norm cost for such cases will increase from $271 to $400 per day.&nbsp; So this is quite substantial.&nbsp; Second, we will (a) raise the daily Medisave withdrawal limit for community hospitals from $150 to $250, and (b) raise the annual Medisave withdrawal limit from $3,500 to $5,000.&nbsp; Together with the enhanced nine-tier subsidy framework for community hospitals implemented last year, these adjustments should make it cheaper for sub-acute patients to move from an acute hospital to a community <p align=left>Column: 3525</p>hospital.&nbsp; I thank Dr Amy Khor for this suggestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave can also be used to pay for day rehabilitation services, subject to a daily limit of $20.&nbsp; We will also be raising this limit&nbsp;from $20&nbsp;to $25.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with the providers to raise the clinical standard of community-based rehabilitation care. We will involve more skilled therapists in the delivery of care and establish individual care plans and improved outcome monitoring to help ensure patients receive the care they need.&nbsp; With better treatment, costs will, however, go up and that is why&nbsp;the increase in Medisave withdrawal limit should benefit the patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes to Medisave withdrawal limits will be implemented in June, in a couple of months' time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Government subsidies and Medisave, health insurance in the form of MediShield, ElderShield and their private supplements, form the third layer of protection.&nbsp; The value of health insurance and the benefits of risk-pooling are well established.&nbsp; Practically all countries have incorporated insurance into their healthcare systems.&nbsp; The Germans under Chancellor Bismarck introduced this innovation a century ago.&nbsp; But we are again unique by insisting on \"deductibles and co-payment\" in our health insurance framework.&nbsp; We reject comprehensive health insurance based on \"first dollar coverage\". Many other countries adopt comprehensive health insurance and are now bogged down by abuses, over-consumption, over-servicing and wastages.&nbsp; They are all trying to reform their insurance policies, eg, in the US, by introducing \"deductibles and co-payment\" but find it politically challenging.&nbsp; Former Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong incorporated this important feature into <p align=left>Column: 3526</p>our health insurance policies and we were wise to have avoided these pitfalls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Germans who pioneered health insurance are now trying to reform their national health insurance system as abuses are causing massive deficits.&nbsp; Employers have been shouldering the rising premiums but this has affected their business competitiveness.&nbsp; They are saying \"enough is enough\" and are demanding that employees should shoulder future premium increases.&nbsp; Last week, an article in a German business weekly, <I>Focus Magazine</I>, discussed this issue.&nbsp; The article was titled \"Saving Money With Singapore\" and this is an English translation of their German title. I am sure it is more elegant in German.&nbsp; Its sub-headline read: \"The Government is looking at an Asian health regime as a model for the reform of the statutory health insurance system\".&nbsp; The article said that they \"are looking into one health system in particular &ndash; that of Singapore\".&nbsp; I do not know if our 3Ms is implementable in Germany as our politics are different, but clearly we must be doing something right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MediShield and ElderShield are not compulsory but, through an opt-out approach, we have achieved good coverage.&nbsp; MediShield coverage has exceeded 93% for all working adults, and the ElderShield per-cohort coverage is about 90%.&nbsp; As noted by Dr Lily Neo, there is room for further expansion, but the current picture is not bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have done several enhancements to MediShield and there is scope to do more, for example, to extend it to cover mental illness and congenital illnesses, when the economic condition is conducive.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Ms Denise Phua raised these two ideas several times. I have not forgotten them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also enhanced ElderShield, but I think further enhancement is necessary.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3527</p>ElderShield now pays out $400 per month for up to&nbsp;six years.&nbsp; This is just about sufficient for the lower-income group who can qualify for heavy subsidy in nursing homes, but it will not be enough for the higher-income group.&nbsp; They should top up their basic ElderShield with ElderShield supplements.&nbsp; Some do.&nbsp; About 14% of ElderShield policyholders subscribe to ElderShield supplements.&nbsp; It will be a better picture, if another 30% or 40% also join in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Dr Lily Neo, we are looking to further enhance the basic ElderShield by raising its payout to, say, $800 per month.&nbsp; But this will require some premium adjustment.&nbsp; I am trying to see how we can avoid this and I am studying the alternative of maybe bringing forward the entry age from 40 to, say, 35 or 30, which should mean lower premium adjustments.&nbsp; Effectively, this will allow Singaporeans to spread out their larger premium payments over a longer period of their working life, instead of the current 25 years, in return for higher payouts should they become severely disabled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final layer of protection is Medifund.&nbsp; This is the ultimate safety net to catch anyone who falls through the top three layers.&nbsp; We have been building it up since its launch in 1993.&nbsp; With the proposed top up of $200 million, it will reach $2 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medifund is again unique in Singapore.&nbsp; We consciously set aside budget surpluses during good time, so that our ability to help the vulnerable during bad times is not diminished by the adverse economic climate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when we anticipated more patients asking for financial help, we increased the Medifund disbursement to $75 million.&nbsp; It was helpful.&nbsp; While the economy this year should be better, I will nevertheless further raise this year's Medifund budget allocation to institutions <p align=left>Column: 3528</p>to $80 million.&nbsp; This will be funded, as usual, using the interest earned by the endowment fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, I have been thinking about how to help lower-income Singaporeans cope with expensive drugs, over and above our current subsidy policy.&nbsp; Last month, I disbursed an additional $8.5 million to Medifund Committees to enable them to help more patients, especially those requiring HIV medications.&nbsp; This year, I will inject a further $10 million from Ministry of Health&rsquo;s operating budget to help deserving patients cope with&nbsp;seven high cost medications used for diseases such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, COPD and asthma.&nbsp; This should be helpful to many patients suffering from these diseases.&nbsp; We will leverage on the Medifund mechanism to help disburse this additional financial assistance to deserving patients.&nbsp; This includes means-testing and some co-payment by patients as the hospitals deem fit.&nbsp; If the idea proves useful, we can increase the budget allocation to this new Medication Assistance Fund (MAF).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, our multi-layered protection framework, code-named 3Ms, builds upon and enriches our Government subsidy framework which we inherited from the British. It allows us to combine the best of the British taxation model with the best of the market-based American insurance model.&nbsp; It is not perfect but it has served us quite well.&nbsp; I fully agree with Dr Lily Neo that \"we need to continually tweak it so as to cater to the growing needs and expectations of our people\".&nbsp;&nbsp; With the support of Members, I will continue to do my best to ensure that all Singaporeans can afford basic healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my pledge.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Special needs medical screening</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman, children with special needs have an array of different diagnoses&nbsp;&ndash; from learning disabilities like dyslexia to profound <p align=left>Column: 3529</p>mental developmental delay; behavioural issues like autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to psychiatric problems.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early detection of children with special needs will allow early intervention, leading to better outcome for these children.&nbsp; Currently, there is a lack of awareness amongst parents about these conditions and also a severe shortage of medical screening services for these children.&nbsp; This is aggravated by a shortage of professionals to provide such services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Ministry have plans to raise awareness of these conditions amongst the public and also to grow this sector to cater to the increasing demand in Singapore?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Health promotion and a healthy nation</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef:</B> Health promotion, as defined by the World Health Organization 2005 Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion in a Globalised World, refers to the process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, thereby improving their health.&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board has been spearheading health promotion in Singapore.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at our statistics of chronic and lifestyle diseases, we need a more concerted effort.&nbsp; Thus, increase awareness and education, more proactive health screening, reinforcement at workplaces; where most of our working adults are, and even in institutions of higher learning and schools.&nbsp; Besides the physical, psychological wellness must also be given a greater thrust.&nbsp; Will there be more funds allocated towards this?

Trans fat has been linked to heart disease in humans and diabetes in experimental animals. In Singapore,&nbsp;three in 10 Singaporeans have exceeded WHO's recommended daily limit.

The HPB is hesitant to pass legislation on trans fat as this would result in trade barriers, especially since many food products found here are imported from various countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 70% of packaged food products currently do not carry trans fat labelling and will be affected.&nbsp; This would limit the choice of food Singaporeans have.&nbsp; Legislation limiting trans fat to 5% of a product's total fat content would affect 30% of packaged food here.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then,&nbsp;HPB in 2007 announced it would allow food products with little or no trans fat to be labelled accordingly, but it had said \"no\" to Mdm Halimah Yacob's <p align=left>Column: 3533</p>suggestion to move towards compulsory labelling and&nbsp;in the same year, NTUC FairPrice then took up the call to voluntarily declare trans fat content on its household products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 2009, in response to Ms Ellen Lee's query on educating the population on the effects of trans fat, the Ministry said that HPB will step up public education on the harms of excessive consumption of trans fat, and work closely&nbsp;with AVA to review&nbsp;trans fat&nbsp;in&nbsp;food supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was in view of the local studies conducted, which showed that 30% of adults here, particularly those aged 18 to 39, exceeded WHO's recommended daily limit.&nbsp; After three years of deliberation, is it time for us to introduce mandatory or compulsory labelling of trans fat content in food?&nbsp; At the same time, we should keep in mind the possibility of banning such food in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I agree that diet is a matter of personal choice and that we need to take into account practical considerations such as trade barriers, product labelling, and so on, we need also to weigh in such issues as general public health issues and its expenditures and informing the public.&nbsp; Therefore, prevent is better than cure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can the Government at least for the moment support initiatives such as labelling efforts by giving local food companies and supermarkets a grant to do so and to increase funding in public education in this area?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Myopia</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> Chairman, Sir, I understand that myopia is the leading eye disease in Singapore.&nbsp; We have among the highest cases of myopia in the world.&nbsp; There is a growing concern that blindness from myopia would become a substantial public health problem in the <p align=left>Column: 3534</p>near future.

The Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act was passed on 14th November 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides registering TCM practitioners, the TCM practitioners Board also accredits TCM schools and courses, and regulates the professional conduct and ethics of registered TCM practitioners.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3537</p>The registration of TCM practitioners started in 2001 with the registration of acupuncturists.

However, TCM relies upon inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry and pulse-taking to directly observe the dynamic human life function. It is also based on syndrome differentiation to guide the disease treatment. This method can save a lot of examination cost for patients.&nbsp; Western medicine has absolute advantages in medical fields such as surgery, diagnosis of organic diseases, first aid, prevention of spreading of epidemic conditions, and life-sustaining devices where modern science and technology is used. However, Chinese medicine excels in treating chronic inflammation, functional disorders, endocrine disorders, degenerative diseases, senile diseases, general clinical syndromes, sub-health state of the human body, and complex health problem.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the increasing use and recognition of TCM as an alternative medicine, I urge the Government to provide assistance in monetary/non-monetary terms to raise the quality and standard of TCM practitioners and TCM administration so that TCM can indeed be more acceptable and \"recognisable\" as another source of help for patients.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3691-3692.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> <p align=left>Column: 3538</p>Sir, I will try to cover all grounds before the stipulated guillotine time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Members for speaking on, among other issues, special needs and health promotion.&nbsp; Speaking of health promotion last month, two UK researchers revealed preliminary findings suggesting that it was possible to be bored to death.&nbsp; Before Members get worried about their own health since all of us get bored from time to time, let me qualify that statement.&nbsp; What the study found was that people who regularly feel bored are more prone to becoming unhappy and unmotivated.&nbsp; This, in turn, can lead them to adopt unhealthy habits, such as smoking, taking drugs or drinking, which increase their chances of dying from conditions such as stroke and heart diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Singaporeans I know have the opposite problem&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they are so busy they hardly have time to feel bored!&nbsp; We are a time-starved people.&nbsp; We work deadlines, manage family commitments, and run countless errands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Small wonder that we often hear people grumble, \"I wish I had more time for the things that matter in life.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good health is one such thing that matters to all age groups, as Dr Fatimah Lateef has rightly pointed out.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health (MOH) invests heavily in health promotion precisely because it is the crucial first step to good health. &nbsp;It is much better to keep healthy rather than seek treatment when conditions develop.&nbsp; This is why our preventive healthcare budget has increased by 67% over the past decade to $112&nbsp;million in FY2010.&nbsp; Our aim is to help Singaporeans of all ages &ndash; children, adolescents, adults and the elderly &ndash; to have the means and ability to lead healthier lifestyles.&nbsp; We want to nip chronic health problems in the bud and reduce the disease burden on our ageing population.&nbsp; I think many Members have alluded to the silver tsunami that is <p align=left>Column: 3539</p>coming and asked how we are going to manage it. &nbsp;It is a tall order which requires hard work from all of us, but it is worth doing.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, when we need to prioritise our time, a healthy lifestyle is often the first to go.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans, stressed from work, often do not eat healthily or exercise regularly.&nbsp; Worse still, they succumb to high-risk habits, such as smoking&nbsp;or heavy drinking, mistakenly viewing all these as a pressure-reliever or a lifestyle choice.&nbsp; They do not realise or may even ignore the fact that it could cause them greater pressure, both financially and emotionally, when health conditions develop down the road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why there is a strong case for healthy lifestyles to be advocated at the workplace.&nbsp; The outreach strategy is sound as&nbsp;two out of&nbsp;three Singaporeans aged 15 years and above are working.&nbsp; I spoke briefly about workplace health in last year&rsquo;s Budget, and I will spend more time outlining our plans for workplace health promotion this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business case for improving workplace health is simple. Healthier workers mean less absenteeism and lower medical costs for the company.&nbsp; This is the first step to boosting productivity and the bottomlines.&nbsp; Healthy, active employees are also good \"walking advertisements\" for a company&rsquo;s work ethos and culture, which helps them in talent recruitment and retention. Healthy and alert employees also contribute to a safer work environment.&nbsp; Indeed, more local companies are recognising the value of good workplace health programmes and have taken steps to implement these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NatSteel is a good example.&nbsp; I visited&nbsp;NatSteel last month and was impressed by the fruits of their employees' wellness programme.&nbsp; They have wisely banned the sale of cigarettes within their premises <p align=left>Column: 3540</p>and extended the lunch-time break to encourage participation in on-site health programmes. &nbsp;I was told by some workers there that they actively take part in the lunch-time programmes to promote&nbsp;good health of their workers.&nbsp; Employees are also given subsidies and other incentives to participate in healthy lifestyle activities.&nbsp; There have been tangible results&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the average days of medical leave taken has fallen from 3.4 days in 2005 to 2.3 days in 2009.&nbsp; With more motivated and healthier staff, the monthly average resignation rate has also fallen from 0.9% in 2005 to 0.7% last year. &nbsp;For comparison, the monthly average for the manufacturing industry is double that, at about 1.6%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One employee&rsquo;s effort in keeping himself healthy left a lasting impression on me.&nbsp; Mr Arumugam Kerisnasamy, a security guard, has a family history of chronic diseases.&nbsp; Determined to keep these diseases at bay, he put himself through the Health Promotion Board's \"Lose to Win Challenge\" and NatSteel&rsquo;s own \"Weight Optimisation Challenge\" late last year, losing&nbsp;about eight kilogrammes over a four-month period.&nbsp; Mr Arumugam continues to exercise and watch his diet. He now weighs 96 kilogrammes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;about 11&nbsp;kilogrammes less than when he first started the programme.&nbsp; His fitness level has also improved considerably.&nbsp; During my visit, he shared how grateful he was to NatSteel for their support and encouragement in his weight loss journey.&nbsp; He also told me that he was driven by the strong desire to take charge of his own health so that he can better his work performance and also provide for his loved ones.&nbsp; I think we all have much to learn from Mr Arumugam.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me talk about support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), something which some Members have spoken on.&nbsp; Some SMEs may want to roll out similar measures like NatSteel, but <p align=left>Column: 3541</p>they lack the scale, resources and infrastructural support to do so.&nbsp; MOH and HPB recognise the constraints faced by our SMEs and will do more in the coming year to help them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, several industrial and commercial landlords,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Ascendas Services, CapitaLand Commercial, JTC Corporation, HDB and Mapletree Investments, participate in HPB&rsquo;s WHP@SMEs&rsquo; Doorstep programme.&nbsp; A simple but popular programme, it conducts health screening and health programmes for SME employees at the doorstep of industrial parks and commercial buildings where the SMEs are located.&nbsp; This is how HPB brings the programme to the doorstep of the companies.&nbsp; It has been well received and we intend to roll this out to more locations over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that more can be done.&nbsp; The National Tripartite Committee on Workplace Health, co-chaired by Mr Lucas Chow and Mr Yeo himself, has recommended to MOH a slew of measures to better support our SMEs in workplace health promotion.&nbsp; Let me mention a few that we have implemented or are considering in the coming year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help SMEs who face budgetary constraints in starting workplace health programmes, the TriComm and HPB have introduced an enhanced SME Grant since May 2009.&nbsp; The grant now funds up to 90% of the cost of such programmes, capped at $10,000 per application.&nbsp; HPB also recently relaxed the grant guidelines to allow funding for off-site health programmes, such as basic health screening at CDMP-GP clinics and chronic disease intervention programmes.&nbsp; HPB has committed up to $180,000 to 22 SMEs under this enhanced scheme.&nbsp; I encourage more SMEs to sign up for the scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3542</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money alone cannot fully address the situation.&nbsp; SMEs often lack dedicated manpower and protected time to implement workplace health programmes well.&nbsp; To help them, HPB will introduce a workplace health package this month where pre-selected vendors will deliver the packaged health screening and interventions, covering four key areas of healthy lifestyle&nbsp;&ndash; physical activity, healthy eating, mental well-being and smoking control.&nbsp; Companies simply have to choose their preferred activities from among the health interventions in these four areas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have raised the concern over mental well-being programmes that can be introduced for employees&nbsp;at company level.&nbsp; This is one&nbsp;example in which&nbsp;HPB is trying to reach out to employees, to help the workers manage their health issues&nbsp;through activities, including for mental well-being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know that the work demands of each sector are different.&nbsp; Some sectors, like hospitality, wholesale&nbsp;and retail, and transport&nbsp;and logistics, face greater challenges in implementing workplace health initiatives.&nbsp; For example, in the hospitality sector, it is hard to get service staff who work different shifts to get together to exercise, especially those who work the night shift. To address this, HPB and its partners will be adopting a more customised approach, by tailoring outreach activities and capacity building sessions tailored for specific industries. &nbsp;Industry workgroups, comprising representatives from trade associations, unions and private companies, will be set up to provide feedback on the needs and challenges of their respective industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within Government, HPB has already started working with other agencies to align and streamline our promotional efforts.&nbsp; For example, HPB and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) have been working closely to integrate workplace <p align=left>Column: 3543</p>health promotion into the Workplace Safety and Health legislative framework, as well as the Guidelines for Re-employment of Older Workers.&nbsp; They will also be engaging employers, employees, healthcare providers and insurers to pilot a health management framework linking corporate and individual health to appropriate incentive systems. This will be an exciting area for development as we push for greater productivity in our workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know I can count on our unions and trade associations, like NTUC and the Singapore Manufacturers&rsquo;&nbsp;Federation (SMa), to step forward and lend us their support.&nbsp; NTUC has already partnered HPB to launch a weight management programme next month to promote healthy living at the workplace.&nbsp; SMa will also hold a kick-off event in May 2010 where some of their SME members will pledge their commitment to implement workplace health programmes.&nbsp; So we have the unions and employers' association to help us in promoting weight management with their members and employees.&nbsp; As we intensify our engagement efforts with SME leaders and associations, I hope more will do the same and motivate their members to improve workplace health.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quickly update Members on smoking control legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a pioneer in this area on several counts. We were the first Asian country to ban tobacco advertisements in 1971. &nbsp;In 2004, we again led Asia by using graphic warnings on cigarette packs to discourage smokers from lighting up.&nbsp; To date, we are one of the only nine countries in the world recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for our nation-wide network of smoking cessation services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, smoking is an issue that will take years to address and we will persist in it. &nbsp;We already have some successes.&nbsp; Less contraband is being <p align=left>Column: 3544</p>hawked on the streets, in no small part due to Customs&rsquo; vigorous enforcement efforts.&nbsp; Many public places are also going smoke-free, thanks to the National Environment Agency's smoking ban.&nbsp; Over the years, smoking rates dropped from 20% in 1980 to 12.6% in 2004, but the latest figure of 13.6% in 2007 shows a slight rebound.&nbsp; So we still have a lot of work to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is mainly due to an increase in smoking amongst certain population segments, in particular young adults.&nbsp; The smoking rate for young males, aged 18 to 29 years, has increased from 18% in 2004 to 25% in 2007.&nbsp; For young females, the increase was from 7% in 2004 to 9% in 2007.&nbsp; I am concerned about this trend as young adults might not fully appreciate the negative consequences of being hooked on smoking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides stepping up HPB&rsquo;s public education efforts, we intend to augment the Health Sciences Authority's regulatory arsenal by updating the Smoking (Control of Advertisement and Sale of Tobacco) Act to current operating realities.&nbsp; The Act was last amended in 2003 and the latest proposed amendments are to incorporate more stringent tobacco control measures in response to an increasing trend of smoking among young adults, and the emergence of new tobacco products.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After extensive public and industry consultation, we are planning to ban misleading labelling, and lower the&nbsp;maximum tar and nicotine limits, among other changes.&nbsp; I look forward to Members' support for the&nbsp;amendment Bill when we table it in this House later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move to detection and prevention of diseases. Mr Khaw earlier spoke about our considerations in making screening more affordable through the use <p align=left>Column: 3545</p>of Medisave.&nbsp; I shall now update the House on clinical developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Integrated Screening Programme was introduced in June 2008 to facilitate&nbsp;appropriate health screening for Singaporeans aged 40 years and older at CDMP-registered&nbsp;GP clinics.&nbsp; Five conditions are currently covered&nbsp;&ndash; diabetes, high blood pressure, lipid disorders and obesity&nbsp;&ndash; all these are&nbsp;risk factors for&nbsp;heart attacks and stroke as well as cervical cancer.&nbsp; The programme has served Singaporeans well by lowering the cost of screening through bulk purchases and subsidies for lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking&nbsp;at including colorectal cancer screening under the Integrated Screening Programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer here&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;1,500 Singaporeans become afflicted with this disease annually.&nbsp; Over the course of a lifetime, one in every 20 men and one in every 30 women will get colorectal cancer. Last November, we started a pilot in Queenstown,&nbsp;Tiong Bahru, Bishan and Ang Mo Kio where Singaporeans aged 50 years and older were invited to go for colorectal cancer screening at CDMP-GP clinics. To-date,&nbsp;416 participants have completed the screening, and 39 participants, or 9% of them, were referred for further assessment.&nbsp; We also intend to step up efforts to increase awareness and uptake of colorectal cancer screening among Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cervical cancer is another noteworthy disease that we are tackling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pap smear screening is key to detecting&nbsp;this cancer at its early and even pre-cancerous&nbsp;stages, where treatment is most effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV) is an interesting new approach, though not without limitations.&nbsp; For example, it is only effective against 70% of cancer-causing HPV virus, and <p align=left>Column: 3546</p>there is limited data on the long-term effectiveness. The Expert Committee on Immunisation is reviewing the evidence on HPV vaccination and will report its finding to MOH subsequently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on children's health, I would say that good health boils down to eating enough and eating right. A balanced diet is crucial to improving physical well-being and our resistance against diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must guard against too much of a good thing. Chinese New Year is just over and like during the other festivities like Hari Raya or Deepavali, some of you would have suffered from the side effects of over-eating.&nbsp; Imagine the ill effects on our&nbsp;our children&nbsp;of over-eating on a daily basis!&nbsp;&nbsp;Childhood obesity is fast becoming a problem in developed countries.&nbsp; Left unchecked, it would lead to our children developing all sorts of chronic diseases that they would have to live with the rest of their lives. The problem is becoming so severe in America that it has caught the attention of President Barack&nbsp;Obama.&nbsp; He recently set up a taskforce under the First Lady to tackle this growing problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we have made obesity the focal point of our National Healthy Lifestyle campaign last year, and this will continue this year. As a lead up to the campaign proper,&nbsp;HPB will launch a weight loss reality TV challenge, similar to the highly popular Lose to Win Challenge in 2009. Community and workplace stakeholders will also be engaged to champion health programmes to provide supportive health promoting environments for optimum weight management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that food advertising to children is a problem, and are working with industry stakeholders to address this. To complement these efforts, HPB is developing guidelines on food marketing to children in schools and will continue health education efforts in the school setting.&nbsp; HPB will also work with MOE to<p align=left>Column: 3547</p> instil a culture of physical activity amongst our young, so as to build lifelong habits for a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Mildred Tan asked specifically if MOH will consider banning trans fat in food sold here&nbsp;due to the increased risk of coming down with cardiovascular diseases from consuming it.&nbsp; I share her concern.&nbsp; Today, three in 10 adult Singaporeans exceed WHO's recommended daily limit of less than two grammes of trans fat a day.&nbsp; Two-thirds of these people are younger adults aged 18 to 39.&nbsp; Our children, especially those who snack frequently, are affected as well. We clearly need to limit the intake of trans fat in Singapore before it gains a foothold in our daily life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulating trans fat, however, is a complex issue.&nbsp; We have adopted a more cautious voluntary approach so as not to create trade barriers, reduce consumer choice and bring about unintended increases in food prices. The concerns that we raised in 2006, as mentioned by Mrs Tan, are still valid, but we are looking at some ways to ensure that people are better informed about healthy choices.&nbsp; After carefully studying the experiences of other countries and taking into account our local situation, we are now prepared to take targeted steps to control the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experts told me that a total ban is not practical.&nbsp; Many of the catchy headlines we read about trans fat bans in New York&nbsp;and California actually refer to limiting trans fat to a very low level.&nbsp; We will do likewise.&nbsp; We are considering limiting the trans fat content in fats and oils to not more than two grammes of trans fat per 100 grammes of product. This is in line with the practice of developed countries which have implemented trans fat reduction measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For other food products besides fats and oils, HPB will continue its approach of <p align=left>Column: 3548</p>engaging the food industry and encouraging all of them to voluntarily reduce the trans fat content in their products. Response has been encouraging, especially from larger players in the market. Some companies&nbsp;have voluntarily reduced trans fat in their products, eg, Gardenia, Sunshine, FairPrice, Lam Soon and Nestle.&nbsp; SMEs, like Al Dente Food Pte Ltd, have also come forward to partner us in this effort. I look forward to the support of other industry players on this and other healthy eating initiatives like HPB's Healthier Choice certification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the state of myopia in Singapore. Myopia develops mainly in childhood, but stabilises as we get older.&nbsp; Many of us will recall that one generation ago, fewer children wore spectacles. The proportion of school children in Singapore with myopia is indeed high but has also stabilised over the past five years. Today, about 30% of Primary One school children and two-thirds, or 66%, of Primary Six children have myopia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The causes of myopia are not well-defined, although studies have identified risk factors like near work mentioned by Mr Low, and protective factors like regular outdoor activity.&nbsp; Local research is ongoing to gain more insights into risk factors and causes of myopia.&nbsp; Our schools have taken the necessary measures to manage the problem but a large part of the solution depends on habits at home. Through the National Myopia Prevention Programme, MOH and HPB help tackle both sides of the equation by educating parents, educators and children themselves on good eye care.&nbsp; Vision screening for pre-school to secondary school students is also provided through the Programme. We must collectively press on our efforts to delay the onset and reduce the progression of myopia in children on these fronts.&nbsp; But we acknowledge that it is challenging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3549</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these recent cohorts of children age, myopia will inevitably become more prevalent among adults. The concern is that myopia may predispose older adults to other eye problems.&nbsp; HPB will encourage seniors to go for vision screening&nbsp;as part of a broader suite of elderly functional assessments which it will roll out soon.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;also augmenting optometry and optician services nationwide to deal with problems as they emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, myopia is a problem easily correctable by spectacles or contact lenses.&nbsp; With affluence, many adults have also gone for the more costly option of laser surgery or LASIK.&nbsp; The technology is evolving. Surgeons are now able to make more precise, three-dimensional measurements of the eye that better guide the reshaping of the cornea. However, as with any surgical procedure, patients have to be carefully assessed for suitability, and&nbsp;LASIK itself carries risk that patients should be aware of.&nbsp;At our public hospitals, the success rate of improving vision in adults via&nbsp;LASIK is more than 98%, though not all will achieve perfect vision.&nbsp; This is comparable to results overseas.&nbsp; Rates of serious complications are low, but side effects such as dry eyes are common, occurring in up to half of all patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about special needs children.&nbsp; Besides mainstream school children, I want to highlight another group that we are devoting more resources to&nbsp;&ndash; the special needs children. Dr Lam Pin Min and Dr Amy Khor have raised some good questions about our plans to support this group of children.&nbsp;Since 1991, the Child Development Programme&nbsp;has helped identify and treat children with developmental problems in their early childhood. Under this programme, child development experts from KKH, NUH and three community-based clinics work together to provide diagnostic and early <p align=left>Column: 3550</p>intervention services for special needs children aged 0 to 6, complementing MCYS and MOE's efforts under the wider Enabling Masterplan on Disability. Through these efforts, and the determination of patients and their families, many have risen above their developmental difficulties.&nbsp; Some ex-patients have since secured places&nbsp;in our tertiary institutions and even participated actively in National Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen our healthcare professionals in action. They are doing good work and coping relatively well despite the huge caseload of some 5,200 patients, including 2,000 new cases annually.&nbsp; However, certain support services, like psychological counselling and speech therapy, are stretched as we have only catered&nbsp;for a projected total caseload of 3,200, with 1,200 or so new cases per year.&nbsp; This was the global norm as recently as three years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rising trend in workload, which experts attribute to increased awareness and better diagnostics, is not unique to Singapore. The situation is exacerbated by a global shortage of trained manpower, which had led to a resultant increase in waiting times worldwide.&nbsp;We acknowledge that parents have to wait before sending their children for screening, but we are managing this by trying to increase the manpower.&nbsp; But I would like to inform Members that this is not just a problem in Singapore but it is also faced by many countries in other parts of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we are injecting $46 million into the Child Development Programme, to help us expand capacity and bring down waiting times for these early childhood developmental services.&nbsp; It will cover our needs over the next four years and it is on top of the $16 million already committed from 2007 to 2009.&nbsp; Most of these monies will go towards the training and recruitment of child development manpower, especially psychologists and speech language and physiotherapists.&nbsp; At steady&nbsp;state, we hope to <p align=left>Column: 3551</p>serve more than 6,000 cases yearly and further bring down waiting time for key services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me add that the holistic management of children with special needs is a very complex issue.&nbsp; Multi-agency efforts across the social, educational&nbsp; and healthcare sectors are required for the child to reach his or her full potential, as I am sure Mr Ong Ah Heng is aware.&nbsp; In the majority of children with special needs, such as those with severe mental retardation, autism and cerebral palsy, medical intervention plays only a limited and supportive role compared to the provision of social and educational support measures.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These children require early placement in special schools where they can receive appropriate training and education.&nbsp; The child development programme which I have just outlined caters to those with mild to moderate problems.&nbsp; The most appropriate developmental setting for this group is in the mainstream &ndash; integrated and inclusive schools where they can receive educational, social and community support as well as therapeutic intervention from healthcare professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, let me address Ms Ellen Lee's and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan's questions on raising the quality and standard of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Singapore.&nbsp; Today, MOH does this through raising the standards of TCM training courses and continuing professional education of TCM practitioners.&nbsp; Since 2006, MOH has worked with two main local TCM colleges to replace certificates and diploma courses with higher requirement Bachelor courses, jointly conducted with top TCM universities in China.&nbsp; NTU's School of Biological Sciences has also started a double degree biomedical science and Chinese medicine course with the Beijing University of Chinese medicine.&nbsp; Its first<p align=left>Column: 3552</p> batch of 59 students will graduate this year.&nbsp; Taken together, these measures have augmented the pool of TCM practitioners with degree level training from 101 in 2006 to 164 last year.&nbsp; In addition, TCM Practitioners' Board has set up a new sub-committee to look into continued professional education for TCM practitioners.&nbsp; We will continue to encourage all registered TCM practitioners to take part in such courses. In 2006, the TCM Practitioners' Board also published an ethical code to guide TCM practitioners in maintaining the quality and standard of their practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude by saying&nbsp;that there is this saying that \"health is wealth\".&nbsp; It becomes a mantra to many of us, but this is more true in more ways than one.&nbsp; By staying healthy, one need not spend so much on medical bills,&nbsp;so that he can spend on his other pursuits.&nbsp; But besides that, keeping healthy will enable an individual to have a higher quality of life.&nbsp; Most of us want to achieve that but there is always a big question of whether we take that first big step to make sure that our health is well maintained and improved regularly.&nbsp; This is something that no amount of money can buy.&nbsp; I urge all Singaporeans to take the simple first step of taking control of their diets and start exercising so that by 2020 we will be a healthier and wealthier nation.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman,&nbsp;I have three clarifications for the Minister.&nbsp; First and foremost, I would like to ask the Minister while waiting for the new Jurong General Hospital to be ready, what is the plan for the old Alexandra Hospital and whether it&nbsp;can be made fully operational to help relieve the current shortage of beds.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I am happy to note that&nbsp;MOH is investing another $57 million for mental health programme.&nbsp; I would like to <p align=left>Column: 3553</p>ask the Minister what are the deliverables and KPIs to help determine if this money will be well spent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but, most importantly, the Minister mentioned in his speech just now that although he is 58 years old this year, his residents commented that he looks much younger.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to clarify with the Minister whether he has found an elixir for youthfulness and whether he can share with us his secret recipe for staying young.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Chairman, there is no elixir, no secret recipe.&nbsp; Technology does help &ndash; I colour my hair.&nbsp; But, no Botox.&nbsp; I think the mind is important, the attitude to life. As I quoted&nbsp;Lao-tzu earlier&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what is life all about?&nbsp;It is never about ourselves, it is about others.&nbsp; And if we lead a life in that direction, whatever the physical form, I do not think it matters.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for Jurong General Hospital, we will retain Alexandra Hospital.&nbsp; The original plan was to close it down immediately when Khoo Teck Puat Hospital is up.&nbsp; But when I reviewed the situation about three years ago, I decided not to close it.&nbsp; I think we cannot afford to close down&nbsp;Alexandra Hospital while waiting for Jurong General Hospital.&nbsp; So, we will keep Alexandra Hospital running as it is; in that way the addition to our bed capacity is really&nbsp;555 beds, which will come on stream over the next few months.&nbsp; Like IRs, we will open Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in stages&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no gambling tables but there will be operating tables.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the additional $57 million, the emphasis will be on community mental health.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some KPIs.&nbsp; One will be in terms of additional psychiatric resources&nbsp;(nurses, doctors) that we will be pumping in.&nbsp; I cannot recall the numbers but those are the commitments <p align=left>Column: 3554</p>that we have made to the&nbsp;Ministry of Finance when we secured the additional money.&nbsp; The second one will be making sure that the community home visit teams will be truly effective.&nbsp; I accompanied those teams on some of their home visits.&nbsp; I visited some of these patients and I can see for myself that, truly, the service is well appreciated.&nbsp; I remember there was this dementia patient&nbsp;who happened to be in Mr Low's constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient has&nbsp;dementia for several years now.&nbsp; The original SOP would be that each time there is a crisis&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and often there will be a crisis &ndash; it is a big operation. &nbsp;They have to call the ambulance and that level has no lifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifts are coming but at that moment, there were no lifts.&nbsp;&nbsp;And carrying the patient down was a major operation.&nbsp; So, they were so appreciative when I visited them&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the whole extended family was there.&nbsp; Not all the extended family stay there, but those who stay nearby&nbsp;all came to wait for me and&nbsp;expressed how appreciative they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we know now what to do.&nbsp; Our job is to scale it up so that more can benefit.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Chairman, I would like to seek a few clarifications from the Minister.&nbsp; First, the Minister said that he would not consider extending MediShield to cover mental illnesses, but he would when economic times are better.&nbsp; Could the Minister indicate some timeframe,&nbsp;because I had&nbsp;raised it&nbsp;during better economic times and&nbsp;he said that timing was important.&nbsp; So, I think giving us a timeframe would be useful.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Minister talked about the Medical Assistance Fund (MAF)&nbsp;to be set up to help Singaporeans pay for expensive medicine under Medifund, but he talked about helping the low-income Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think very expensive medicines, like cancer medicines,&nbsp;also affect the middle-income Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will&nbsp;there be flexibility, when this Fund is located under Medifund, to extend assistance&nbsp;also to <p align=left>Column: 3555</p>middle-income Singaporeans for them to&nbsp;be able to afford expensive medicines?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, I did ask the Minister whether he could consider providing more support for home-based care subsidies.&nbsp; The Minister did not respond to that point.&nbsp; I think more subsidies for home-based care is important if we want to promote right siting.&nbsp; Otherwise, people will crowd the hospitals because they do not have support at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to ask the Minister out of that over $40 million that is now allocated further for mental treatment, whether there would be more of that component be given to the VWOs who are doing a fantastic job to provide support for mental patients, like shelters or other forms of day care services.&nbsp; Would he also extend a portion of that amount to provide support for caregivers, because caregivers of mentally ill patients are also suffering tremendously?&nbsp; Could he extend a portion of that amount to support them in training or other kinds of support for them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Sir, when I said that the MediShield changes to include, for example, the mentally ill will&nbsp;have to await better times, what I meant was that if we want to extend payouts, premiums have to be adjusted.&nbsp; So, it depends on how much the premiums will be.&nbsp; If I am taking so long on this subject, it&nbsp;is because, obviously, the premium increases are not small.&nbsp; If they were small, I would have done it yesterday.&nbsp; But because the impact of the payouts on the premiums&nbsp;is not insignificant, that is why I have been sitting on this for so long.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to commit to a timeframe because there are still adjustments to be assessed, on how to better bring it about.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the same for the ElderShield reform that Dr Lily Neo raised.&nbsp; We are trying to make some trade-offs, how to extend the benefits so that it is <p align=left>Column: 3556</p>truly meaningful, without incurring too much burden on everybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of day, it is about risk-pooling.&nbsp; It is really the rest of the population supporting the small number with mental illness or with severe disabilities.&nbsp; So, these are some of the things that we are looking at,&nbsp;with the help of actuary consultants.&nbsp; Let me assure Mdm Halimah that it is very much at the top of my head because, as she rightly said, she has raised it several times before, and I have not forgotten.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On MAF, I used the word \"lower-income\".&nbsp; I did not mean low-income.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower-income is relative.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand that even for lower middle-income group, costly medications can be a problem.&nbsp; And that is why I like the Medifund mechanism because that allows us flexibility.&nbsp; This is a group of wise people who will then help us to determine,&nbsp;case by case, who deserves it, who does not.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;we cannot really translate it into an algorithm which&nbsp;we can just plug into the computer and decide, yes, somebody&nbsp;deserves it, or somebody does not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home-care, yes,&nbsp;the intention of scaling up, for example, Home Nursing Foundation (HNF) is to make sure that it is a service that will be useful and meaningful to the patients and their families.&nbsp; And we do subvent HNF and I intend to increase&nbsp;the subvention to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accompanied the HNF teams&nbsp;on some of their visits to their patients at home.&nbsp; I observed them.&nbsp; Truly, they are doing very good work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I visited&nbsp;two of their patients who happened to be in Mr Shanmugam's constituency in Chong Pang.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are diabetic patients, one leg already amputated and&nbsp;the second leg will soon be amputated, wheelchair-bound, and&nbsp;with diabetic kidney failure requiring dialysis.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is a NKF Dialysis Centre nearby.&nbsp; But nearby for an able-bodied person is truly nearby, but for a disabled person, even 200 metres is like a mile.&nbsp; And the spouse is the one who has to push the wheelchair <p align=left>Column: 3557</p>all the way to NKF.&nbsp; So, these are the problems that we can see.&nbsp; But we cannot bring dialysis to the home.&nbsp; Of course, we can go with ambulatory dialysis,&nbsp;but in her case it was not suitable, as she has other problems.&nbsp; So the home nurses visiting her have been very useful.&nbsp; They come, check her blood sugar everyday or every other day, and then remind her to comply.&nbsp; I was a bit sad&nbsp;that day when I visited her.&nbsp;&nbsp;They checked her blood sugar,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;high.&nbsp; So, the nurse asked: \"Why? You know your diet discipline, you can eat&nbsp;this, but you cannot eat that.\"&nbsp; And she said, \"Yah, I know.\"&nbsp; That morning she had some unhealthy breakfast, she thought it was just one meal.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;I said, we can only point the way forward, but the patients must cooperate with us.&nbsp; Unless they are engaged, it is very hard for us to really bring about true change in health outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the additional mental health programme,&nbsp;we have funds set aside to work with VWOs, because we know we cannot do this alone, and on the ground, there are many willing VWOs.&nbsp; I have visited some of them in Mdm Cynthia Phua's constituency,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;passionate people.&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked about the Many Helping Hands approach.&nbsp; We&nbsp;could easily say,&nbsp;\"All right, we take over, we nationalise it and do everything ourselves as&nbsp;civil servants.\"&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But remember&nbsp;the story of Sister Geraldine&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no paid employees can deliver that kind of service.&nbsp; So, it is not a matter&nbsp;of we do it without them or they do it without us.&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, let us do it together.&nbsp; Our objectives are the same, which is to help Singaporeans stay well, live well and, hopefully, end well.&nbsp; But the patients &nbsp;have to play their part too.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Whether you are rich or poor, there are barriers.&nbsp; But if a person is&nbsp;in the middle-income or higher-income group, in fact,&nbsp;he has more personal resources compared to the lower-income group.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do, as I said, home visits to patients and, most of the time, I visit the lower-<p align=left>Column: 3559</p>income group.&nbsp; These are people much less endowed than&nbsp;the sandwiched groups. But what always struck me was how they still manage because the love is there.&nbsp; They have limited resources, yes, but that did not prevent them from going the extra mile.&nbsp; On the other hand, I have come across people who are clearly pretty well endowed, but they just assume that they can delegate and outsource their love and&nbsp;compassion for their parents away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My question to the Minister is whether each of the hospital has put up its best problem-solving practices.&nbsp; For example, should there not be better temporary holding areas rather than hospital corridors while waiting for admissions and whether there should be better customer service in allaying patients' fears and placating patients' family members in such situations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the Minister has not replied&nbsp;me on my earlier question on national healthcare expenditure (NHE) &ndash; basically,&nbsp;Singaporeans' concern on healthcare costs.&nbsp; How quickly will the NHE rise in such current servicing, how sustainable it is and how would that impact the population since&nbsp;NHE is borne two-third by the people&nbsp;and one-third&nbsp;by the Government, especially on the low-income and middle-income families?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I thank Dr Neo for her comments and compliments.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;national health&nbsp;expenditure in our&nbsp;case is less than 4% of GDP.&nbsp; I have discussed this in this House&nbsp;before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four per cent is not sustainable, because there is a correlation between GDP growth and health expenditures.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;we become richer,&nbsp;we are prepared to spend more on&nbsp;healthcare, and that is why the national&nbsp;health spending will grow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much will this 4% grow up to?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to say.&nbsp; A lot depends on how well we manage the cost escalation and<p align=left>Column: 3561</p> medical inflation.&nbsp; My own personal target is this.&nbsp; As long as we&nbsp;can keep it to a single digit percentage of GDP,&nbsp;that should be quite an achievement.&nbsp; Many European countries are now&nbsp;at double digits.&nbsp; The US&nbsp;is&nbsp;the worst&nbsp;&ndash; 17%, and&nbsp;projecting&nbsp;20% in a matter of time.&nbsp; And&nbsp;once&nbsp;we go over a&nbsp;tipping&nbsp;point, it is almost uncontrollable. So&nbsp;we must try to keep it single digit&nbsp;&ndash; 4%&nbsp;eventually will become 5% and then 6%.&nbsp; Even at the most advanced of ageing, if we can keep it to 8%, I think that would be a huge achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;How to do it?&nbsp;&nbsp;The key, as I said just now, was to control expenditure. So long as we can keep costs low overall, then who is the one who is responsible for payment is a secondary question.&nbsp; And the way to control healthcare spending is&nbsp;to cut out abuses.&nbsp; The problem in the US and&nbsp;the European system is abuses&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what we call \"buffet syndrome\".&nbsp; The more&nbsp;we can control moral hazards, the more&nbsp;we are able to keep the cost inflation down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;bed shortage, we had a short discussion last month at a&nbsp;parliamentary sitting.&nbsp; I quoted figures to show that,&nbsp;overall, we are not short of beds, but there are mismatches.&nbsp; Of course, when the media played it&nbsp;up, they will play on those days when it is very high in a particular hospital. Even when a particular hospital is short of beds, I have empty beds in other hospitals. So it is not as if there is a complete shortage of beds&nbsp;nationwide, but there are mismatches.&nbsp; Mondays and&nbsp;Tuesdays are bad in certain hospitals and we are trying to cope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We anticipated this problem three-four years ago. I&nbsp;remember Mr Low Thia Khiang raised this issue on potential bed shortage coming up&nbsp;in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow he is familiar with Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He had seen some problem there and alerted me to it, which <p align=left>Column: 3562</p>I acknowledged.&nbsp; And that is why in the last few years, we have been increasing beds in every hospital.&nbsp; Over the last four years, we have actually added many beds wherever we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we&nbsp;are now coming to the tail end of the construction of the new hospital that is coming up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital construction is lumpy. There is&nbsp;no increase in beds for years, and then suddenly&nbsp;we have a 500-bed hospital.&nbsp; So, what I have done over the last few years is to progressively add in temporary beds in other hospitals while waiting for this Khoo Teck Puat Hospital&nbsp;to open.&nbsp; When it opens,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can then close&nbsp;all&nbsp;those temporary beds. But as&nbsp;we get close to&nbsp;D-Day, that is when the pressure is at the maximum, and that is why&nbsp;we have these temporary shortages of beds on certain days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as I said in this House, clinical care is never compromised and&nbsp;we will never compromise it, but I accept that service level is unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Yes, our staff could be better at communication, but I have some sympathy for our staff. They are really working their guts out when there are so many patients in the last two-three months.&nbsp; The problem is this, and we know this seasonal factor.&nbsp; With the&nbsp;school holidays in December,&nbsp;many surgeries&nbsp;were cancelled,&nbsp;as people went on holiday.&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, we have the return of Singaporeans and hence the return of&nbsp;the elective surgery cases.&nbsp; Then in February,&nbsp;we had two weeks of Chinese New Year, and everybody shied away.&nbsp; And in the last two weeks and now, we see&nbsp;the return of&nbsp;all elective surgeries.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have all this sudden big increase. It should ease once Khoo Teck Puat Hospital is fully opened in a few months' time. But, meanwhile, I plead for some patience.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mdm&nbsp;Cynthia Phua, keep your intervention brief.&nbsp; We do not have much time.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><p align=left>Column: 3563</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Yes, Mr Chairman.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank&nbsp;the Minister for&nbsp;his care and love for the people of Singapore on healthcare issues.

So I do not know whether the&nbsp;Minister is actually aware of this feedback that the deductible is causing hardship to some elderly sick.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is, does the&nbsp;Minister agree that with the caps already in place of $300 withdrawal every year plus the co-payment requirement, is there really a need for the deductible to check on over-consumption and to protect the Medisave savings?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left>Column: 3564</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the Minister earlier mentioned that&nbsp;to get over the deductible some clinics&nbsp;are offering package deals. Could the Minister clarify whether this package deal means that the patient is paying for consultations in advance? Not just the medication, but consultation as well, because patients need to go back every few months. Secondly, whether this option is something that the patient can insist on at the polyclinic.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> The beauty of our system is diversity, so I have heard of different packages from different general practitioners (GPs). They package it up &ndash;&nbsp;some patients pay in advance or at the end of the year or by instalments or other ways. There are all sorts of packages in town. I will advise the Member to advise whoever who gave her the feedback, to shop around in the neighbourhood. I am sure there are different GPs and they should be able to respond to that.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to stress that this packaging is not to get around the deductible. The packaging serves a purpose. A package for chronic disease is no different than our motorcar maintenance package. Many motorcar workshops have maintenance packages&nbsp;for their customers&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5,000 kilometres do this; 10,000 kilometres do&nbsp;that; 20,000 kilometres please come back&nbsp;to check engine. The maintenance of motorcar and of the&nbsp;human body is similar. The package deal serves that purpose and the problem that the Member mentioned can be easily overcome with this package scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the person who hand wrote the note on his problem with&nbsp;$30 deductible,&nbsp;I vaguely recall the incident. But as I said, the right solution is to get a suitable package. Chronic disease is not a one-off acute attack.&nbsp;Payment is not just one visit for $30. The patient&nbsp;has to&nbsp;do it for the rest of his life.&nbsp;Very importantly, the <p align=left>Column: 3565</p>programme has to be packaged, to ensure compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the capping of $300, the Member asked why there is an additional need for deductible.&nbsp;I have explained that just now. The deductible is a very important part of controlling this morale hazard we talked about. I would advise or suggest that the Member&nbsp;read up on&nbsp;some of the commentaries which&nbsp;are floating around on the Internet in US over their healthcare reforms. Serious economists are all coming to the same&nbsp;conclusion that the only way to tame this beast &ndash; ie, runaway healthcare cost &ndash;&nbsp;is health savings account coupled with a high deductible insurance scheme. Drop the comprehensive first-dollar coverage and&nbsp;all other means which have been incentivising wrong behaviour.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, on behalf of the GPC and Members of the House who have spoken so passionately on various health issues, I would like to thank the Minister and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their comprehensive, yet emotional, and at times moving responses.

It provides accountability to MPs and members of the public in the usage of Government funds. However, the information provided in the Budget Book seems to be getting lesser with each financial year. For example, there were 728 pages in tbe Budget Book for FY1994/1995 and only 593 pages for FY2000/2001.&nbsp; For this year, the Budget Book has 417 pages.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that the more pages in the <p align=left>Column: 3568</p>Budget Book, the better it is, but I find the current Budget Book not useful enough for one to understand the individual programme function and major changes in expenditure, if any, or major items of our Ministries.&nbsp; For instance, in the old Budget Book, under the Ministry of Health, I can see specific subventions given to each restructured hospital.&nbsp; Under hospital Services Programme, I can see some detailed expenditure such as rental, utility, official celebration and mass media expenses, etc, and also under new OOE.&nbsp; But in the current year's Budget Book, under Services Programme of MOH, I see one consolidated amount list like subventions and the breakdown under OOE is rather brief. Some of the expenditure listed are simply classified as running costs without details provided.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been innovative over the years to allow each Ministry the flexibility to spend public money efficiently.&nbsp; One of the initiatives is to allow each Ministry to have budgetary discretion by block budgeting. While this flexibility may be good for the Ministry, more transparency on expenditure is needed to assure accountability. There should be a balance between flexibility and accountability for the financial resources entrusted to the Ministry. I would like to know how MOF ensure accountability and transparency of Government expenditure to the public.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Sovereign Wealth Fund management</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, I would like to raise some points regarding our Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF).&nbsp; Firstly, both the Government of Singapore&nbsp;Investment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek are operated as private funds, with&nbsp;larger risk appetites&nbsp;today compared to the past.&nbsp; Both have made losses in recent time and it is timely that the Government gives them a more conservative mandate since their&nbsp; investment outcomes invariably impact the reserves <p align=left>Column: 3569</p>of Singapore and our future. &nbsp;We may want to perhaps learn from China where in today's papers it was reported that their SWF China Investment Corp (CIC) booked&nbsp;US$10 billion unaudited profit for 2009 compared to the losses our SWFs made last year.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, I also brought up the need for Temasek to refocus on Singapore and was told that in doing so, we will validate some of the concerns overseas over our SWFs having political objectives.&nbsp; However, if the Government is already setting overall returns objectives,&nbsp;risk thresholds and tolerance limits for our SWFs, then I see little problem in Temasek investing actively in promising locally-based companies.&nbsp; I think we should move away from the mindset that helping local companies would compromise the objectives of Temasek&nbsp;as&nbsp;long as we have a clear mandate, objective and investment philosophy for Temasek, and, in fact, for other funds that we may set up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also would like to clarify the rationale for setting up Seatown as a new investment vehicle under Temasek.&nbsp; First, what is the need for this fund and how does its investment philosophy and&nbsp;risk appetite differ from that of Temasek as a whole?&nbsp; I think we need to be clear about the mandate of Seatown and if it is different from Temasek, then how can two investment philosophies come under one company and under one management?&nbsp; Would there be a conflict of interest as such and should we, in fact, set up a third SWF called Seatown rather than putting all of it under Temasek?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, on&nbsp;EXIM bank, I would like to comment on the idea. This was mooted by the ESC. I would also like to remind the House that a similar recommendation was made a few years ago when I was heading the Finance Advisory Committee <p align=left>Column: 3570</p>of SPRING's Board.&nbsp; But the Government's response at that time was not positive.&nbsp; I think it found that there was no need for it.&nbsp; But many developed countries, in fact, have had similar schemes to help their companies, so why not Singapore?&nbsp; I am glad that this has finally become a reality through the ESC's recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some very good examples of EXIM banks that have worked in Canada and Japan and we should look into how we can emulate some of their successful strategies and they have done really well. However, I feel strongly that unless we have a focused agency working with companies managing the EXIM bank, we may not succeed. So I hope that we do not farm this out to a private bank because they may not be able to focus on the task at hand.&nbsp; I also think that it is necessary to study our Internationalisation Finance Scheme which was supposed to help our companies internationalise and help them finance their international operations.&nbsp; This has been in place for many years but I understand that it&nbsp;has not been successful in achieving the objectives and too few companies have benefited from the scheme.&nbsp; This is despite the fact that many of us at it, proposed refinements of the scheme and still it did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be wise for us to learn about the failure there so that when we implement the EXIM bank, we will be successful in achieving our objective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister will try to understand why the Internationalisation Finance Scheme was not successful so that the EXIM bank can learn and do it right when implemented.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>GIC's investment and financial health</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, in the last 10 years, compared with other Sovereign Wealth Funds, like Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Norwegian SWF&nbsp;&ndash; GPF, GIC's portfolio has certainly performed better.&nbsp; With a big portfolio, it <p align=left>Column: 3571</p>is understandable that GIC may not be as nimble as the smaller fund managers.&nbsp;What is important is that GIC has been able to preserve and guard our national reserves well.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fund management is risky business.

That is the average cost for the built-up area that is including the upper levels of the shopping centres.&nbsp; If it is solely on the ground, the average cost is about twice the pricing and that is $3,800 per square foot. If proper costing is not imputed by the Ministry of Finance for the use of public service such as bus parking, the highest and best use of the land will not happen and the bus interchange will get bigger and bigger. And this is already happening&nbsp;as I understand that the LTA has specified bigger area for bus parking for the Bedok North site, ie, more bus bays than the Clementi site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And with such a&nbsp;requirement, it will occupy the whole ground floor of the future retail complex and all shoppers know ground floor is the best place for any retailer.

Since 1976, it has done 3.6&nbsp;million eye surgeries and laser procedures, treated 29&nbsp;million patients either for free or a low fee, and yet made $7.9&nbsp;million on revenues of $20&nbsp;million in 2009, and all these in US dollars. Through disruptive supply chain innovation, Aurolab manufactures&nbsp;two&nbsp;million lenses in a year sold at between US$2 to US$10, exports to 120 countries, and has a global market share of&nbsp;7%.&nbsp; Today, it continues to challenge conventional pricing models and supply chain with more products.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Aravind could have set itself up as a profit maximising \"hungry hippo\", but the founders decided on the higher value of compassionate capitalism, and turned Aravind into a social enterprise that brought sight to the underpriviledged millions, who would otherwise remain blind. However, in the profit maximising world, the idea of compassionate <p align=left>Column: 3576</p>capitalism was considered berserk, so Aravind's founders have to mortgage their homes to raise $55,000 as their seed funding. Fortunately, their persistency paid off and foreign funds in the form of Acumen Fund, Gates Award for Global Health and others came to their rescue as they expanded.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Singapore, passionate and able social entrepreneurs (SEs)&nbsp;meet with the same challengers as Aravind's founders. We lack the ecosystem and access to financial fuel that can help SEs blossom. There is no incentive for the setting up of social venture fund, SE banks or loans for social good.&nbsp; The 250% tax advantage given to charities with IPC status is attractive, but its mandatory charity status runs contrary to the handup&nbsp;approach taken by SEs. To argue that therefore SEs should be subject to the same rules as private sector is to say that perhaps R&amp;Ds too which&nbsp;are good for the long-term socio-economic growth&nbsp;should also not enjoy any financial incentives or tax advantage.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In UK,&nbsp;social enterprises are supported with Community Interest Companies (CIC) which carries an asset lock and a community interest test.&nbsp; These funds are empowered with a 5% Community Investment Tax Relief (CITR) given to companies who invest in the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which in turn invest in community development organisations and projects. CICs are limited by shares, but have the option of issuing shares that pay dividend to investors.&nbsp; In so doing, investors can look forward to financial returns as well as motivate the staff to do well. &nbsp;To protect the asset lock, the dividend to private investors is subject to a cap. &nbsp;In US, low profitability limited liability company (L3C) was introduced in 2008,&nbsp;as a profit generating entity with a social mission as its primary objective.&nbsp; It builds on the Programme Related Investment (PRI) scheme to tap on the <p align=left>Column: 3577</p>potential US$6&nbsp;trillion going to charities.&nbsp; Both schemes direct good money to high impact, sustainable organisations to solve social concerns and encourage sector growth.&nbsp; Match funding is another concept that is worth exploring as catalyst to fuel philanthropic dollars.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what do Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jack Ma and Andrew Carnegie have in common? They are all believers in social entrepreneurship and strategic philanthropy.&nbsp; If Singapore&nbsp;is to benefit from the rise of Asian wealth and philanthropy and to develop ourselves as a philanthropy hub, the Government would need to play a more proactive role in developing funds for social concerns.&nbsp; Only then, can we build a more inclusive society and have more inclusive&nbsp;growth.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As mentioned in the Budget speech, the window of opportunity for Singapore is short and given that other cities, including those in Asia, are developing rapidly and catching up with Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the various dialogues that we had with business leaders to get their reactions from the Budget, many highlighted that it is complex to understand the criteria even of existing schemes available as well as time consuming to apply for them.&nbsp; Their feedback was that there are various schemes for Budget 2010 are welcomed, but they would wait and see how easy it is to access these schemes to innovate and to upgrade their businesses.&nbsp; So what measures can the Government take to <p align=left>Column: 3578</p>simplify the processes to enable organisations to access and leverage available initiatives and schemes in a timely manner to enable them to build capability and to compete and grow their businesses?&nbsp; The focus needs to be on simplification and timely access for companies that have potential to leverage the appropriate schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will reiterate that it is not about hand-holding businesses.&nbsp; Being pro-business is critical in attracting businesses with potential to use Singapore as the base for their business as well as to retain Singapore enterprises to locate and operate their businesses from Singapore.&nbsp; The point is about how we will make it easy enough for businesses to begin, run and maintain their operations in Singapore.&nbsp; This will have the right impact on the jobs that will be created or lost and the growth or loss of the cluster of small businesses and those on the supply chain that support and are dependent on these businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not&nbsp;referring to just having schemes to incentivise companies to operate in Singapore.&nbsp; We should also assure that Singapore remains pro-business so that enterprises will continue to build the capabilities in Singapore.&nbsp; Government regulations should not be seen as prohibitive, of course inconveniences for business operating in Singapore such that administrative cost of doing business in Singapore is impacted.&nbsp; Singapore must ensure that we remain attractive for enterprises, big or small, local or foreign, to operate and grow their businesses.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to share&nbsp;what measures are being taken to ensure that Singapore stays pro-business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the past few years, local enterprises, both big and small, have been encouraged to expand overseas.&nbsp; However, SMEs face many hurdles in doing so.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give one example.&nbsp; A local construction and engineering company, WEC Engineers and Constructors Private Limited, set up in 1972, is currently bidding for a multi-million dollar construction project in the Middle East.&nbsp; Part of the bidding process requires WEC Engineers to provide a performance bond and insurance.&nbsp; The company also encounters great difficulty in getting a bank in Singapore to provide project financing required.&nbsp; Despite the fact that WEC Engineers has a history of 28 years, the financial institutions here still require the company to provide high collateral before approving the loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expand overseas or to take part in overseas projects, SMEs need the necessary financial resources.&nbsp; However, financing through traditional banking channels is not forthcoming as SMEs are constrained by their size and lack of collateral.&nbsp; This means that they cannot build up their track records and with no track records and credibility, these SMEs would not be able to expand or secure projects.&nbsp; It is a vicious circle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) has identified the need to develop a broader and&nbsp;a deeper base of Singapore enterprises of which some can be globally competitive.&nbsp; We fully support this call. Our SMEs must be given the chance to plug into the world markets.&nbsp; If we succeed, we would then be able to truly build an external wing for our economy.&nbsp; Therefore, the proposal of developing a specialised financial institution like the Export-import (EXIM) Bank is a big step in <p align=left>Column: 3580</p>the right direction.&nbsp; It will bridge the much needed gap in cross border financing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countries and regions like China, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan have set up such financial institutions.&nbsp; A good example is the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund (SMEG) set up in Taiwan in 1974.&nbsp; Taiwan's SMEG has assisted in fostering the growth of SMEs with good potential.&nbsp; This may be a useful model for us to study.&nbsp; For the EXIM Bank in Singapore to achieve the intended purpose, it must be easy and convenient for SMEs to obtain quick financing for operations and expansion overseas.&nbsp; Only then can&nbsp;SMEs seize business opportunities in an increasingly competitive and open world market.&nbsp; This EXIM Bank should not just operate purely on commercial returns, but should also assume some risk-taking positions.&nbsp; Otherwise, it would not be different from any other financial institutions.&nbsp; Moreover, such financing facilities should not be limited to just \"Made in Singapore\" products.&nbsp; We should also take into consideration the key pillars of Singapore's economy that we want to grow.&nbsp; For example, Singapore is an international trading hub with many local companies dealing with import and re-export of goods.&nbsp; We should continue to nurture this sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to propose that the EXIM Bank's facilities be extended to shipping.&nbsp; Shipping is an important contributor to our economy.&nbsp; The direct value added contribution of the maritime sector to Singapore's GDP has grown to about 7%.&nbsp; Today, there are more than 5,000 maritime establishments in Singapore, employing over 100,000 people.&nbsp; A number of foreign shipping companies have chosen Singapore as their headquarters or regional&nbsp;bases.&nbsp; The capital-intensive nature of the industry means that the shipping sector will require financing.&nbsp; An EXIM Bank would be a useful instrument to extend the range of financing solutions available to ship <p align=left>Column: 3581</p>owners and operators with a good track record, and will assist the growth of Singapore as an international maritime centre and a hub for shipping investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By extending the EXIM Bank services to these sectors which are traditionally our strengths, we can expect positive multiplier effects which would benefit the economy at large.&nbsp; The business community is keenly awaiting the details of the proposed EXIM Bank!</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, there are many aspects to productivity growth and I quote Deputy Prime Minister Teo who said, \"The factors which contribute to productivity include the quality of the systems, the processes, technology, organisation and workforce within enterprises, the attractiveness of their product and services to markets and leadership and management to bring all these factors together.\"&nbsp; Hence, we know that productivity growth requires everyone to play his part, not just the individual but also the enterprise.&nbsp; The public service, too, has to play its part.&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Teo has mentioned that the Head of Civil Service will be overseeing the public service's productivity drive and that the public sector will continue to emphasise training and improvements to processes and to the delivery of quality service to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recognises that the public service can itself be more productive and, as a regulator and a facilitator, the Government can continue to play a role to help businesses enhance their productivity.&nbsp; In the context of this afternoon's debate, however, let me explain how MOF is ensuring effective allocation and use of resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3586</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Ministry of Finance has instituted mechanisms to drive productivity growth through the optimal allocation of resources.&nbsp; Firstly, through the re-investment fund.&nbsp; Every year, a budget is set aside for investment in new areas that support whole-of-Government strategic outcomes, cross-agency collaboration and innovation.&nbsp; This is a mechanism which prioritises and redistributes resources to Ministries with proposals for new and worthwhile projects on a competitive basis.&nbsp; Through the re-investment fund, the Government has provided $1 billion a year over the last three years to fund new Government initiatives.&nbsp; These include, for example, the ABC Waters Programme that is helping to transform our water bodies and parks into aesthetically pleasing and vibrant places that everyone can enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, value management.&nbsp; Value management is a process that seeks to achieve better value by scrutinising the specifications of large infrastructure projects upfront at the conceptual design stage.&nbsp; One such example is the Downtown Line 1 where the value management process yielded savings of about $200 million through the use of the most optimal method of constructing tunnels between the Chinatown and Cross Street stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the block budget manpower management framework and economy drive mechanisms, which are examples of measures designed to instil discipline over the use of resources by public agencies while according them maximum flexibility and autonomy to derive the best value from these resources.&nbsp; I would elaborate on the block budgeting system later on in my speech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, MOF works closely with the public agencies to achieve higher productivity by pooling resources at the whole-of-Government level.&nbsp; For example, as a consumer, the Government aggregates demand for economies of <p align=left>Column: 3587</p>scale through joint procurements.&nbsp; To illustrate, service-wide demand aggregation of contracts for the supply of fuel and office furniture led to cost savings of 12% and 20% respectively.&nbsp; Likewise, agencies can learn from each other's best practices and enjoy cost savings by coming together to develop shared IT systems and applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is important for me to highlight that productivity improvements, in the context of the Government, also includes innovation and this is really at the heart of our productivity drive.&nbsp; MOF introduced a Public Sector Innovation Framework in 2008 to encourage&nbsp; experimentation, test-bedding and capability building within Ministries and statutory boards.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also seeking to enable productivity growth in the economy at large via partnerships with the private sector through the Co-Innovation Platform, and e-Government. I will again elaborate on these areas further in my speech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to Member&nbsp;Low Thia Khiang's question on the amount of information in the Annual Budget Books and how we strike a balance between budgetary autonomy and accountability.&nbsp; The primary purpose of the Budget Book is to provide the annual estimates of revenue and expenditure of the Government as required by the Constitution. &nbsp;In fact, the Constitution does not require the Government to publish programme descriptions in the Budget Book but MOF has chosen to include these, along with key performance indicators (KPIs).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explanations for material changes in the Ministry's expenditure from the previous year can be found under Section III of the Budget Book entitled \"Expenditure Estimates By Heads of Expenditure\". The information provided in this section is intended to help readers <p align=left>Column: 3588</p>understand how the sums voted to each Head of Expenditure have been appropriated.&nbsp; In addition, should Member Low Thia Khiang&nbsp;and Members wish to know further line item details of spending by Ministries, they can obtain the detailed information from the \"Expenditure Control Document\", copies of which are found in the Parliament Library. I wish to add that the&nbsp;three volumes totalled more than 1,500 pages. Over time, we have been providing more information, not less, contrary to the MP's assertion.&nbsp; Let me just show Members very quickly the Budget Books [<I>holds up books</I>].&nbsp;&nbsp;These are&nbsp;two of the volumes, so it is quite a tome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Budget Book also includes KPIs which provide information on the agencies' achievement of objectives through their programmes. Over time, these indicators have evolved from being just input-based indicators to outcome measurements, wherever possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising that the issues facing the public sector are becoming increasingly complex and intertwined, MOF has been working with Ministries to identify key strategic outcomes at the whole-of-Government level. And these will be published in the Singapore Public Sector Performance Report, which will be released some time this year. The report will provide an overview of how well the public service is collectively achieving whole-of-Government (WOG) strategic outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, MOF has a Budget website to reach out to a wider audience. And in this website, you can find a write-up, summarising the spending trends of the year based on the four sectors of Security, Social, Economic and Government Administration. In addition, each Ministry publishes a summary of their spending highlights on this website.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to elaborate how MOF's block budget system ensures <p align=left>Column: 3589</p>an optimal balance between budgetary flexibility and accountability.&nbsp; At its core, block budgets, which have been the basic foundation of Singapore's budgetary framework for the last ten years, seeks to establish limits to Ministries' expenditure by capping their spending as a pre-determined percentage of GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;These limits are tied directly to Singapore's economic performance, which is also the key determinant of Government's revenues. By pegging Ministry budgets to the GDP, MOF ensures that the Government, as a whole, spends only as much as it expects to collect in revenues on a sustained basis.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the line-item method of budgeting we practised in the past, block budgets accord Ministries greater certainty on the funding that they can expect to receive over a three to five year period. Furthermore, Ministries will take responsibility for optimising and re-prioritising their programmes within the allocated block budgets.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these budgeting flexibilities, sufficient frameworks and checks have been put in place to ensure proper accountability of expenditures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MOF reviews and evaluates the strategic expenditure plans for each agency on an annual basis against the desired outcomes set out.&nbsp; Secondly, major development projects require the approval of the Ministerial Development Planning Committee.&nbsp; Thirdly, Ministries are subject to the Manpower Management Framework, which limits the growth of their headcounts by the smoothened Resident Labour Force growth rate and this ensures that growth in public sector manpower does not outstrip that of the economy at large.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Accountant-General's Department undertakes regular Value-for-Money audits to assess programmes and <p align=left>Column: 3590</p>projects of Ministries; and&nbsp;finally, the Auditor-General is constitutionally empowered to audit and report on the accounts of the Government and this includes reviews of key financial systems and controls.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this House itself plays a role too. Parliament has its own Estimates Committee which scrutinises the Government&rsquo;s Budget, questions the Government on its Budget estimates and processes for managing expenditure, and suggests improvements. Moreover, the Parliament also has a Public Accounts Committee which examines various accounts of the Government, including the Auditor-General&rsquo;s Report.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to optimising land assets. Member Cynthia Phua spoke about the need for Government agencies to be aware of the opportunity cost of using prime land for bus interchanges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to share some history behind bus interchanges. In the past, bus interchanges were built by HDB as part of its town planning and infrastructure provisions. Many are, therefore, located within the town centres so as to facilitate the transfer of passengers between trunk and feeder bus services.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, as part of its efforts to optimise land use, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) works closely with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Housing Development Board (HDB) to redevelop the bus interchange sites from stand-alone developments into integrated developments,&nbsp;for example, commercial development with a bus interchange on the ground floor. Such integration achieves the twin objectives of setting aside prime space within our estates for key infrastructure, while enhancing their value by capitalising on the steady stream of public transport <p align=left>Column: 3591</p>commuters. The redevelopment also allows LTA the opportunity to right-size the space required for the bus interchanges.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine the appropriate size for a bus interchange, LTA applies a set of space norms for the various components such as driveway and bus park lots. These space norms are reviewed regularly to optimise land take, while ensuring that operational requirements would continue to be met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of how the Government&nbsp;continuously reviews its land use to unlock the productive yield of our land assets.&nbsp; Every 10 years, URA also conducts the Concept Plan Review to plan ahead for the future so as to optimise land use, taking into consideration inputs from the various stakeholders. The Minister for National Development elaborated on this during the Ministry of National Development&rsquo;s COS debate.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On MOF&rsquo;s part, we have put in place measures that encourage the optimisation of land use and the realisation of maximum value. Land cost, at market rate, has been made explicit to Ministries through the application of the Resource Management Framework. Under this framework, public agencies are charged an imputed rent on the land so that they are mindful of the cost of the space of property they use. Should there be development potential beyond the current use &ndash;&nbsp;as a bus interchange in this case &ndash;&nbsp;Ministry of Finance would certainly review, with the public agency concerned, the possibility from an optimisation perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on the management of Government investment companies. Member Inderjit Singh has suggested more conservative mandates for GIC and Temasek as their investment outcomes directly impact the reserves of Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in May 2009, in response to a Parliamentary Question, the Minister for <p align=left>Column: 3592</p>Finance had explained to Members&nbsp;that there is a distinction between the investment approaches of Temasek, GIC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).&nbsp;Let me just recap. The MAS is at one end of the risk spectrum. As a central bank, it is the most conservative, with significant holdings in liquid, mainly fixed income instruments.&nbsp;GIC is fairly conservative, with a globally diversified portfolio spread across asset classes, mainly in the public markets.&nbsp;Temasek is at the other end of the spectrum. It is largely an equity investor, a value-investor aiming at long-term returns. Temasek is exposed to significantly higher risk than GIC and MAS, but has also delivered higher returns over time as expected. In contrast, MAS will have more stable but lower returns over time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respective boards of MAS, GIC and Temasek make their own decisions on asset allocation, but the Government regards the whole-of-Government assets from a holistic perspective.&nbsp;The Government regularly monitors and reviews the overall long-term performance and risk profile for the whole-of-Government assets, at various points in a market cycle.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, moving to a more conservative mandate as a knee-jerk reaction to the recent downturn would not be prudent, as this could risk compromising the ability of GIC and Temasek to deliver long-term sustainable returns. And both GIC and Temasek have thus far delivered creditable returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for GIC and Temasek as long-term investors to be able to maintain their long-term orientation and ride out market cycles. Nonetheless, the execution of their mandates, through specific investment strategies and approaches will evolve and adapt to structural changes in the investment environment. For example, while Temasek reiterated its focus on long-term value in the updated Temasek <p align=left>Column: 3593</p>Charter released in 2009, it has increased its exposure&nbsp;in Asia, excluding Singapore, due to its belief in the deep potential of these markets.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is also assured that the boards of GIC and Temasek have in place risk management frameworks and the proper processes to take risks prudently, while maintaining their long-term orientation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Member Ho Geok Choo has requested for an update on GIC and its investments. Let me begin by noting that the recent financial market crisis brought about the sharpest stock market fall since the Great Depression. Investments of GIC as well as other investors worldwide were inevitably affected.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, as noted in the last GIC annual report released in September 2009, the GIC portfolio has recovered more than half of the losses sustained in FY 2008/2009, in line with the broad recovery of global stock markets since the market trough in March 2009. The performance of the portfolio will be updated after the audited full year results are ready. GIC typically releases its annual report in September/October each year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to assess GIC&rsquo;s investment performance over the long term, in line with our objective to grow our reserves in a sustainable manner.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted previously in this House, the Government does not judge the performance of GIC by individual deals but on its overall portfolio performance. In this regard, it is not the Government&rsquo;s practice to discuss the performance of GIC&rsquo;s individual investment deals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add here that GIC takes very seriously every decline in the value of its<p align=left>Column: 3594</p> portfolio and in the value of individual investments. However, it is not realistic to avoid losses on every investment as that would require GIC to be completely risk averse.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While GIC has made losses on some investments, in this case its investment in Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village, it has made gains on others. The only reasonable way of evaluating GIC&rsquo;s performance is to look at how the losses and gains stack up and how its overall portfolio performs across market cycles.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, both Temasek and GIC have so far delivered creditable returns on their portfolios over the long term as well as during the six-year cycle between March 2003 and March 2009, which marked the points of the dot-com bust and credit crisis &ndash; in other words from trough to trough.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh has asked how the setting up of Seatown fits into Temasek&rsquo;s overall investment framework. Seatown is a global investment company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek with its own board and management. It is no different from Temasek&rsquo;s other investment-related subsidiaries, for example, Fullerton Fund Management Company, which was set up in 2003 as an Asia specialist offering investment products and solutions to its clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shareholder, the Government assesses Temasek on the performance of its overall portfolio over the long term. I wish to reiterate again that the Government neither influences nor interferes in Temasek&rsquo;s investment decisions, which are guided by its own board and management. In this case, the board and management of Temasek have considered and approved the setting up of Seatown as part of its overall investment strategy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3595</p> Next on Temasek II, Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested setting up a Temasek II to invest actively in locally-based companies. For GIC and Temasek, the Government&rsquo;s position remains that they should continue to operate on a purely commercial basis in order to provide good long-term gains. Requiring Temasek or GIC to invest so as to fulfil other objectives would distract them from their respective mandates. In any case, Temasek is not precluded from making its own decision to invest in local enterprises where there are attractive opportunities and, indeed, it has done so, for example in its investments in Hyflux, Fraser and Neave (F&amp;N) and Olam International.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the proposal is for a company to be set up independently of GIC and Temasek, such an approach may not be the best way to nurture local companies. Rather, the Government should identify and bridge market gaps, where they exist, so as to support a thriving ecosystem of locally-based enterprises and leave the private sector to take the lead in identifying worthy investment opportunities. It would be neither sustainable nor appropriate for the Government to step in to finance local enterprises that cannot themselves locate private funding, since our ultimate goal is to nurture globally competitive companies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) considered the matter carefully and sought to identify financing gaps in the market to nurture globally competitive companies. It recommended that the Government create conditions to catalyse, rather than supplant, private financing for SMEs in doing so.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has accepted the recommendation and announced the co-investment programme as part of Budget 2010. Under this programme, the Government will mobilise up to $1.5 billion worth of growth capital by seeding a range of funds over 10 years, for which <p align=left>Column: 3596</p>the Government will contribute up to half the capital or $750 million. A key feature of this programme is that it will leverage private equity expertise in evaluation, making and managing investments so as to ensure market discipline.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would now turn to the taxation issues raised by the various Members.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to provide some clarifications to Mr Chiam See Tong&rsquo;s comments on property taxes for HDB flats. Sir, property tax is imposed on the ownership of properties in Singapore, including HDB flats and is based on the Annual Value (AV) of each property. Annual Values are determined yearly according to the prevailing market rents that each property can fetch. The property tax for HDB flats in a given year is based on market rentals data from the previous year.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous AV revision for HDB flats was carried out on 1st January 2008, based on rentals values in 2007. In 2009, the AVs for HDB flats should have been adjusted upwards because rentals had by then jumped by more than 30% through 2008 over 2007. However, the Government decided to defer the increase in AVs for HDB flats in 2009 in recognition of the weak economic outlook and uncertainties in rental trends at that time. The annual review of AVs for HDB flats resumed in January 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB rentals have stabilised after a moderate decline from late 2008 to the middle of 2009, and have since begun to rise. As the current values of HDB rentals are significantly higher than levels observed in 2007, IRAS proceeded to raise the AV this year.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Government has provided a one-off rebate to help HDB owner-occupiers adjust to the January 2010 AV revision. This was in the form of a 50% property tax rebate, with absolute amounts of between $50 <p align=left>Column: 3597</p>and $120 per flat. This rebate cost the Government $88 million.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the new 2010 property tax rebate and the ongoing 1994 rebate, all one- and two-roomers will continue to pay no property tax in 2010.&nbsp; In addition, under the new progressive property tax regime just announced in 2010 which will take effect from January 2011, each HDB owner will enjoy tax savings of up to $240, arising from the exemption of the first $6,000 of AV. All HDB owner-occupiers will thus pay less in taxes. To recap, this new progressive system of property taxes for all owner-occupied homes will cost the Government about $230 million a year.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is not advisable, as Mr Chiam has suggested, to disrupt the regular revision of AVs as it would lead to a larger than manageable increase when accumulated. Instead, the Government will continue to explore possible forms of transfers, when necessary, to help the needy in a targeted manner.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to assure Members, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr&nbsp;Hri Kumar, that our current vehicle tax structure already serves to encourage the use of more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, road taxes, which are levied according to engine capacities, already favour smaller cars which tend to consume less fuel than&nbsp;larger cars.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also provide the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) to encourage the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles. This rebate is calibrated so that a typical hybrid car, which is greener and more fuel efficient, does not attract higher upfront ownership taxes than the equivalent conventional car&nbsp;&ndash; despite the higher Open Market Value (OMVs). The objective of the GVR is to <p align=left>Column: 3598</p>level the playing field for green vehicles in our system for upfront vehicles taxes, and leave motorists to weigh the additional cost of green cars against their fuel savings in their buying decisions. Clean diesel cars are not much cleaner than petrol cars; although more fuel-efficient, they emit more particulate matter (PM). Moreover, the OMVs are not materially different from petrol cars.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we impose a volumetric tax on petrol to discourage the excessive use of vehicles. Ideally, diesel should be taxed on the volume consumed as well.&nbsp; However, we have not introduced a volumetric tax rate on diesel used for vehicles, as diesel is also used for non-transportation purposes such as powering portable electricity generators. Instead, a special tax was introduced for private diesel cars as a proxy. This special tax also took into account the higher particulate matter emissions of diesel cars.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Budget 2008, in recognition of the improved emission standards of Euro IV diesel cars, the special tax rate for Euro IV diesel cars was revised from four times the road tax to $1.25 per cc with effect from July 2008. And this in effect ensured minimal differences in fuel consumption costs between Euro IV diesel and petrol cars. For a typical 1,600cc Euro IV diesel car, this change translates to a reduction in the annual special tax of about $1,000.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining the special tax to be imposed on Euro V diesel cars, the emphasis should be on the desired outcome or performance of the car concerned rather than the technology. Thus, the Government will consider the fuel-efficiency and emissions standards for Euro V diesel cars relative to both Euro IV diesel and petrol cars. Furthermore, as Member Cedric Foo has rightly pointed out, the move should be towards a volumetric basis for charging rather than <p align=left>Column: 3599</p>the existing fixed special diesel tax. As&nbsp;the&nbsp;Member&nbsp;has also noted, any such move would, however, require careful consideration of the transitional issues, which include not just taxis but also other public transport and commercial vehicles, and other off-road users.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, let me address Member Penny Low&rsquo;s suggestion of&nbsp;&nbsp; incentives for social enterprises, which are businesses set up to achieve social objectives, in order to let them flourish and in a bid for Singapore to be a hub for the rising Asia social investment dollar.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, we also recognise and note the important role that the social economy can play. The question is what is the best way for the Government to support social enterprises. Ultimately we want to nurture social enterprises that have sustainable business models because these enterprises would then have the largest impact and the highest chance of succeeding in their social mission.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving social enterprises special tax privileges over conventional businesses will not help them to develop as sustainable and competitive businesses. Moreover, our social enterprise sector is still in&nbsp;its nascent stages. Most of our social enterprises are very small outfits and do not have significant amounts of taxable profits. Hence, further tax incentives beyond the generous ones that we already provide to our start-ups and SMEs are unnecessary.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our focus has been on building up the competencies of our social enterprises to position them for sustainability, while not compromising their businesses&rsquo; competitiveness and resilience. Social enterprises can tap on seed funding from the Ministry of Community, Youth and Sports through the ComCare Enterprise Fund to cover start-up costs, including their training needs.</p><p><br></p><p align=left>Column: 3600</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, we recognise that there is scope to see how we can do more to help grow this sector. We will study the overseas examples which Miss Penny Low has described to see if there are models of Government support for social enterprises that are suitable for our local context.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me also address Miss Penny Low&rsquo;s suggestion to promote greater philanthropy. We agree wholeheartedly with this. That is why, in Budget 2010, we extended the 250% tax deductions for charitable contributions, which means that Government is literally contributing up to 50 cents of every dollar donated to charitable causes. In fact, for the universities, the Government also provides one-for-one direct matching for donations, so that for every dollar received, the Government actually contributes up to 75 cents.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the pro-business&nbsp;Government initiatives. This year, the Government introduced a number of incentive schemes to spur productivity in businesses. Many Members have expressed similar sentiments to Member Jessica Tan's comment on the importance of keeping the application processes simple so that more businesses can truly benefit from the schemes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MOF agrees that the incentive schemes must indeed be simple so that all businesses can benefit from them in an easy and timely manner, while ensuring that the schemes remain relevant to achieving the intended policy outcomes. I would like to assure Ms Tan that we will administer our tax incentives with this objective in mind.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for example, the recently announced Productivity and Innovation Credit, which is an economy-wide initiative to spur all businesses to upgrade themselves and to invest in activities along the innovation value chain. This scheme is kept simple so that all <p align=left>Column: 3601</p>businesses, even the smaller ones, can understand and benefit from it.&nbsp;Under the scheme, businesses simply claim the enhanced deductions as part of their normal tax filing process. In general, no application is required. Businesses automatically qualify for these tax deductions so long as they spend on any of the six pre-stated categories of innovation-based activities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOF has also taken the effort to ensure that the qualifying criteria for these deductions are clear, specific and&nbsp;not overly restrictive. This gives businesses more certainty upfront on whether a potential investment can qualify for the scheme.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme also allows some businesses to convert their tax deductions or allowances into a non-taxable cash grant. To apply for this, a business only needs to fill in a declaration form at the point of claim at the end of the financial year. And again, this is done together with its annual tax filing. Upon receiving the form, IRAS will process the claim and credit the cash grant into the business&rsquo; account within three months.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that the Productivity and Innovation Credit is meant to be a broad-based scheme, the process will be much simpler than the targeted grant schemes, where businesses have to submit an application along with the supporting documents, pass through selection criteria and meet required commitments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to reassure Member Jessica Tan that the Government has streamlined and will continue to streamline regulations, simplify processes and keep administrative costs low. Even though Singapore has been ranked first in the World Bank&rsquo;s \"Doing Business\" Report for four consecutive years from 2007 to 2010, we do not take our ranking lightly <p align=left>Column: 3602</p>and will strive to ensure that we continue to be a favourite place to do business.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the cuts on EXIM bank. The Government reviews our policies to support enterprises regularly in response to market trends, new opportunities and gaps. As more of our companies go abroad and the scale of their overseas operations grows rapidly, it becomes imperative to address gaps in cross-border financing. And these are points which both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Teo Siong Seng have made pertaining to the Export-Import&nbsp;(EXIM) Bank.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, IE Singapore has a suite of financing schemes that support the internationalisation of our companies including the one that Mr Inderjit Singh has highlighted &mdash; the Internationalisation Finance Scheme (IFS), which provides support for asset and project financing overseas.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally, our schemes today are market-enabled, leveraging on commercial banks to facilitate financing to companies through risk-sharing with the Government. There are, however, structural constraints to this approach, as support from our schemes is limited to the sectors and markets that the commercial banks have appetite for. Therefore, the development of a market-based institution for cross-border financing is one issue that the Government is studying very carefully to facilitate the next wave of growth. The study is expected to be completed in a few months&rsquo; time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is the right time to consider this as Mr Teo Siong Seng has noted:&nbsp;The number of Singapore companies internationalising has increased; and&nbsp;besides large companies, SMEs are internationalising more actively than before.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we evaluate EXIM banks and Export Credit Agencies&nbsp;(ECAs) around the <p align=left>Column: 3603</p>world, we must, however, avoid replicating the experience of EXIM banks abroad where under-performance or political interference has resulted in long-term subsidies out of the Government&rsquo;s budget as this is an approach we cannot afford.&nbsp; Instead, we should consider examples in countries like Hong Kong, Sweden and Canada, where EXIM banks or ECAs have clearly-defined mandates to operate commercially and to generate positive returns on capital. These institutions have independent, professional management and use specialist market expertise to assess risks and viability of projects. As a result of their ability to generate commercial returns, they can sustain their operations without Government subsidies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adopting a commercial orientation has other benefits besides sustainability. First, a commercially-run institution would be more responsive to the needs of its customers, including SMEs. For example, it would have the commercial incentive to ensure that its products and services meet the needs of its customers, or that the process to obtain financing is not too burdensome.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, as the institution develops expertise ranging from trade financing to internationalisation and project financing, it would also naturally want to expand its business to finance both exports and overseas operations and projects, as Mr Teo has suggested.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we would expect a commercial institution to be constantly looking out to roll out new products and services to serve its customers better and to generate more revenues. And in doing so, it will catalyse innovation in the private sector market for cross-border financing. By drawing cross-border financing opportunities to Singapore, the institution will encourage existing players to strengthen their teams here while attracting new market participants.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 3604</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, with such an institution in place, companies that go abroad&nbsp;&ndash; both SMEs and large&nbsp;companies&nbsp;&ndash; will have better access to financing support than today. While Mr Teo highlights shipping, any sector in which viable Singapore companies have competitive advantages would stand to benefit from this initiative.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next on the accounting sector, I agree with Member Ho Geok Choo that it is important to develop the accountancy sector to solidify Singapore&rsquo;s position as a leading financial and business services hub in Asia. Having a deep competency in accountancy will enable the growth of our enterprises in and beyond Singapore.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2000, the accountancy sector has generated contribution of about 0.4% of our GDP&nbsp;&ndash; similar to the legal sector&rsquo;s contribution of annual value-add of about $900 million to Singapore.&nbsp;This is poised to increase in tandem with the surge in demand for accountancy services in Singapore and the region. The Asia-Pacific market alone is expected to be worth US$38.3 billion by 2013.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2008, my Ministry established the Committee to Develop the Accountancy Sector&nbsp;(CDAS) to review the accountancy sector. CDAS, which comprised public and private sector representatives and accountancy professionals, plans to transform our accountancy sector into a modern, trusted and high value-adding Global Accountancy Hub over the next 10 years.&nbsp; The Committee&rsquo;s strategy overlaps with Mdm Ho&rsquo;s views that Singapore needs to enhance sector-wide professional capabilities and&nbsp;to develop a stronger international outlook.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, many international professional bodies have established, or are establishing, their presence in Singapore.&nbsp;Within this context, the Committee is <p align=left>Column: 3605</p>recommending to strengthen the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS) into a global professional accountancy body; and to develop a post-graduate structured professional accountancy qualification to strengthen and broaden the talent pool of accountants.&nbsp; In addition, to add to the richness of services that Singapore can offer, the Committee intends to develop and build distinctive niches and specialisations such as Chief Financial Officers, internal audit services and valuation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities should strictly be market-driven, and the recent announcements in the Budget are designed to help facilitate but not direct such corporate activity.&nbsp; Nonetheless, our accountancy sector can play an enabling role in M&amp;A activities, as transaction advisory, financial due diligence and valuation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in turn, could further deepen the expertise here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee also hopes to develop Singapore into a leading global centre in Asia for accountancy professional development and education and to attract regional talents into Singapore.&nbsp; &nbsp;To help promote Singapore's sector internationally, the Committee is also proposing to anchor practice leaders and Centres of Excellence in Singapore. It would encourage regional and international work to be done from Singapore and to eventually build up a critical demand. &nbsp;CDAS will submit its recommendations to MOF in April 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government will commit $450 million over the next five years to start a Public-Private Co-Innovation Partnership. This initiative is to spur private sector R&amp;D by bringing together Government agencies and companies&nbsp;and co-develop innovation solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3606</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad has sought further details on the scope and measures of success. Sir, the Co-Innovation Partnership will focus on innovations that can meet public sector needs, and which can eventually be exported to the region. For a start, we will look at areas such as urban mobility, energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would seek to increase the number of public-private collaborations, and innovative products and services. However, we will not just focus on numbers. The Government recognises that risks are inherent in the innovative process and accepts that not all collaborations may succeed. However, the emphasis should be on creating opportunities for public and private sectors to innovate together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Last but not least but still on the theme of innovation, Members Zaqy Mohamad and&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim have asked how MOF is responding to the rapidly changing ICT landscape to meet the needs of increasing sophisticated Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the iGov2010 masterplan, many of the integrated Government projects are still in progress and will only be completed over the next one to two years.&nbsp; I would just like to highlight that the operative word is not consolidation but integration, where agencies with similar needs&nbsp;come together to jointly leverage on technology to achieve better outcomes.&nbsp; There is a whole range of integrated Government projects and some are smaller scale ones which SMEs can be involved in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOF notes that our citizens are becoming increasingly Internet-savvy. They are used to accessing information and securing services over the Internet.&nbsp; They are comfortable with downloading music and applications using iPhones and other mobile devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are also socialising and sharing resources on <p align=left>Column: 3607</p>Facebook.&nbsp; Our citizens now expect the same convenience and easy access in their dealings with the Government.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, with emails replacing snail mails as a main mode of communication, some customers expect Government replies and actions to be instantaneous and, moreover, favourable, failing which they will become demanding or even unreasonable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As much&nbsp; as we would like to, it is not always possible for Government agencies to satisfy all their customers. Also, big statutory boards like LTA and IRAS each receives tens of thousands of correspondences in a month. It would be impossible for their CEOs to reply to each one personally.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to give you one such example of someone who emailed the LTA repeatedly, to insist that the stretch of road in front of his house be re-surfaced instead of being patched locally.&nbsp; Now, road re-surfacing is expensive and should be undertaken judiciously. LTA explained this to the writer, but he did not accept LTA's explanation. He then replied with phrases like, I quote,</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Mr Yam, I would like you to personally reply to this email of mine and explain to me and the residents why LTA would not want to re-surface such and such a&nbsp;road completely.&nbsp; And please do not hide behind your staff to get them to respond on your behalf.\"</p><p><br>LTA acknowledged his second last letter and promised to reply soon, but this only met with further unhappiness. Again I quote:</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I would like my resolution letter from LTA&nbsp;to be responded personally by Mr Yam Ah Mee. For your information, I am a CEO of a large financial services company, and I will always take it upon myself to respond and sign off any letters/emails if they require my personal attention.\"</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 3608</p>And for good measure, he copied his latest email to the Prime Minister.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the CEO of LTA to personally respond to thousands of mails would be impractical as well as highly inefficient for the organisation. What matters, or should matter, is for the CEO to ensure that there are proper internal processes to give timely, considered responses to citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, please do not get the wrong impression that we have a lot of demanding customers. We have many customers who appreciate the services of our public agencies. Many have in fact written in to express their heartfelt appreciation for our agencies' attention and service standards. Our public officers are encouraged by these letters of commendation and will try even harder to serve their customers better. I have provided this example to illustrate the ever-rising expectations of the public, which has been fuelled by technology.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will always endeavour to improve on its service standards. However, whether it is the public or private sector, we know that good customer behaviour begets good service. Let us work together to develop a culture of good customer behaviour and good service delivery.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your permission, Sir, I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute the handout. [<I>Handout distributed to Members</I>.]</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have just mentioned, the Government is committed to improving our public services to delight our customers and&nbsp;to keep up with new technological trends.&nbsp; To support this role,&nbsp;the Government will also evolve from being just a public services provider to a platform provider.&nbsp;It will set and referee the rules in the ecosystem to allow the enterprises or individuals to freely <p align=left>Column: 3609</p>innovate and create value-added services.&nbsp;In other words, the delivery model will change from \"Government-to-You\" to \"Government-with-You\".</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the Government can facilitate the discovery and use of publicly-available Government data by putting them on a central portal for downloading in machine-readable formats. A common map platform can also be provided to share Government geospatial data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are mindful that this move towards a \"Government-with-You\" model does not rely on technology alone. On our part, public officers need to embrace a new mindset that some services can be developed and delivered more effectively through collaboration with the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to sum up, MOF has taken a comprehensive approach in addressing the multiple challenges and opportunities ahead of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the expenditure side, we have devised programmes and initiatives to make sure that our resources are&nbsp;carefully allocated to worthwhile projects and, second, efficiently used to achieve the intended objectives.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also use our tax regime to help promote social and economic objectives. We strive to keep our tax regime competitive to give businesses and individuals incentive for enterprise and effort, and support economic imperatives at different phases of our development. We also keep our overall system of taxes fair, so that everyone pays some tax but the better off pays more.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By adopting a \"Government-with-You\" approach, MOF seeks to work closely with businesses and citizens to further create new value. We recognise that some of the best ideas are out there in enterprises and the wider community, and <p align=left>Column: 3610</p>thus would be adopting a collaborative approach to create new services for our people.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>: I can only take a few interventions because there are a few Members&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mrs Mildred Tan and Miss Penny Low &ndash;&nbsp;in that order, if we have time.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, the Minister referred to the two books that she had.

However, the challenge is in defining what exactly would be classified as process of organisational design for tax deduction purposes.&nbsp; I would go on to add that to implement most of these organisation redesign initiatives, businesses often have to acquire new equipment to automate the new processes, train their employees, to reskill them, and both these activities would qualify anyway.&nbsp; So they should adequately cover what the Member has suggested.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the exemption for mega events of the withholding tax, to attract more international rated acts, performances and so on, the Government has reduced the withholding tax of non-resident public entertainers from 15% to 10% for five years from Budget Day.&nbsp; Our withholding tax rate for royalties is already low by international standards at 10%. And Singapore has a wide network of tax treaties that can actually reduce the rate even further, such as to 5%.&nbsp; In addition, organisers of approved events <p align=left>Column: 3612</p>can also apply for direct grants from STB under the Tourism Development Assistance Scheme, particularly under the Business Events in Singapore Scheme.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Sir, I want to thank the Minister for distributing this which I think it is a very good example of how the private sector and the public sector can work together.&nbsp; In conjunction with that, I would like to also get her comments on my suggestion during the main Budget speech on the \"Wiki Me\" idea which is really&nbsp;a seamless collaboration between the public sector and the people sector.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would also like to seek clarifications from the Minister, first, by thanking her for her support for the SE sector.&nbsp; And I agree with her that many of the SEs are relatively small at this moment.&nbsp; But I wonder if it is a chicken-and-egg question, given that there are a lot of very good, potentially&nbsp;big SEs, that are actually chopped off by the lack of access to finance at the moment.&nbsp; In the past few years, more than 200 SEs have been established in Singapore and more are coming on-stream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, on the IPC's tax incentives that are available for charities, the point here really is that most SEs seek double bottomline which means financial sustainability as well as social returns.&nbsp; And because of that, many of them do not want to establish themselves as charities because charities are inherently a handout approach.

We typically define a literate as a person who can read and write.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the increasingly connected world where information availability is growing at exponential rates, reading and writing are grossly insufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;Literacy should be expanded to include the skill of understanding complexity and related to the skill of understanding complexity are multi-cultural sensitivity, context-setting and decision-making skills.&nbsp; Without these new skills, a person may well be handicapped in the new world.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take for example, multi-cultural sensitivity.&nbsp; Today, how confident are we that&nbsp;young Singaporeans have a pan-Asian outlook?&nbsp; Can they name the capitals of 10 Asian countries?&nbsp; Can they say something meaningful and interesting about the different Asian cultures?&nbsp; Have they visited some of our closest neighbours in ASEAN and made friends there?&nbsp; And yet if they do not, how do they help the businesses based in Singapore, whether MNCs or GLCs, navigate these complex environments and achieve their pan-Asian ambitions?&nbsp; How possible is it for us to become a Global-Asia hub, a strategy proposed by the ESC, if we do not cultivate multi-cultural literacy in our young?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore should take the lead to expand educators' understanding of literacy and build new skills in our students.&nbsp; We are well placed to do so and, in the process, can create new advantages for our young in a globalised world, much like the way we have created an advantage through bilingualism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not get me wrong.&nbsp; The traditional 3Rs&nbsp;&ndash; Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, are still needed.&nbsp; But new competencies for our young are needed for the 21st century.&nbsp; This is because education in the 21st century will not just involve finding the right answers, but asking the right questions.&nbsp; An educated person will no longer be content with knowing the <p align=left>Column: 3617</p>\"what\" and \"how\", but instead, wants to be convicted about the \"why\".&nbsp; Education, properly carried out, will not only enable a person to fulfil his potential, but to discover his passion and purpose, and to live his life with everyday greatness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;have previously written about the new 3Rs &ndash; Roundedness, Rootedness and Resilience.&nbsp; New 21st century competencies such as critical inquiry and inventive thinking can and should be developed for a more rounded education.&nbsp; How should the curriculum be updated to reflect these new needs and to benefit all students?&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides academic achievement, we also need to put more emphasis on whole-person development, in other words, holistic education.&nbsp; The teaching of PE and Art, for example, has much room for improvement.&nbsp; To be sure, whenever we visit schools, there are always showcases of sporting or artistic talents.&nbsp; But, \"one swallow does not a summer make\", so I often wonder if we are just being shown the isolated achievements of&nbsp;a few.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, curriculum time for PE and Art is very limited.&nbsp; PE time for Primary&nbsp;1 and &nbsp;Primary&nbsp;2 is only one hour a&nbsp;week whereas from Primary&nbsp;3 onwards, it is one and a half&nbsp;hours.&nbsp; In secondary school, it is back to one hour a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it has become common place for sport-CCA groups to take in only pupils who have the potential to compete and win medals for the school.&nbsp; This elite mindset is a great pity because sports should be for everyone.&nbsp; Through sports, we learn how to collaborate with one another, to have a winner's spirit and to take failure in our stride.&nbsp; We have no one else to blame for our \"strawberry\" generation if we do not develop resilience in our young through the rough and tumble of sports.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what steps MOE&nbsp;will take to <p align=left>Column: 3618</p>promote more inclusive enrolment in sports-CCAs?<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides curriculum time, we also need to strengthen the teaching staff and recognise their professionalism.&nbsp; There is a shortage of teachers trained to teach Art.&nbsp; Often, Art teachers have to double-up and teach other subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be better to have subject specialists for Art, just as we do for Mathematics, Science and English, to encourage professionalism.&nbsp; MOE should also set targets for each school to have minimum staffing of Art specialists.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I believe increased curriculum time and teacher development are still insufficient.&nbsp; I would like to encourage MOE to send a strong signal to parents and students by introducing three new categories in the Edusave Merit Bursary Awards for achievements in Sports, Art and Music.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that&nbsp;MOE studies the feasibility in the next few months, establish the criteria and target to recognise&nbsp;1,000 of such non-academic achievers each year beginning in school year 2011.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Madam, it is said that there are only two lasting bequests we can give to our children.&nbsp; One is roots and the other is wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are busy fitting our children out with new and better wings through 21st century competencies and a more rounded education, we must not forget to help them develop their moral compass and their national identity.&nbsp; In times of uncertainty and crises, rootedness and resilience are what will carry us through.&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuing holistic education in the 21st century, the roles of teachers will shift.&nbsp; From their primary role as a dispenser of information, teachers are more likely to become conductors of learning symphonies, helping students turn information into knowledge, knowledge into wisdom, and wisdom into contributions for a better world.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3619</p>Schools too will be changed, from \"buildings\" to \"nerve centres\", connecting teachers, students and the community to the wealth of knowledge that exists in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these will have an impact on the way we spend each dollar set aside for education.&nbsp; What new investments are needed?&nbsp; Should we continue to think in terms of funding for the primary, secondary, tertiary levels?&nbsp; Or is it more meaningful for us to think in terms of budgets for outcomes like Basic Literacy, 21st Century Competencies, Character Development?&nbsp; How should the Ministry's KPIs be adjusted?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, education is a constant work in progress but because we already have a well-functioning system, the possibilities for greater heights of achievements are endless.&nbsp; However, as Albert Einstein cautioned, \"We cannot solve problems using the same kind of thinking we had when we first created them.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; We need new thinking and courage to make bold changes.&nbsp; It is a transformation that should engage all the stakeholders in Singapore.&nbsp; These include our parents and employers, our educators, our lawmakers, community leaders, and most of all our students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the MOE will engage all of these stakeholders actively in the Debate about the future of education in Singapore.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Surely, the ability to speak publicly and present clearly, confidently and coherently counts as an important social skill in the productivity-driven culture of the new decade.&nbsp; In any organisation, the ability to speak and present is a vital and much-valued skill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us are impressed, from time to time, with the powerful presentation skills of Americans who are able to speak comfortably to an audience.&nbsp; There are those who will say that it is all air, that the ability to talk, speak or chat constitutes more form than substance.&nbsp; However, I would say that since we, Singaporeans,&nbsp;already have a fair amount of substance, and if we work on improving and honing our form, we would be able to take on the world.&nbsp; Let us do away with the \"we are doers, not talkers\" mentality and adopt the \"can do, can talk\" mentality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge MOE to develop a comprehensive programme to uplift the speaking and presentation skills of our students so that they are able to verbalise and communicate ideas effectively.&nbsp; I observe that our present system tends to favour and nurture those who are already gifted speakers.&nbsp; In schools, we have the high achievers with their oratory talents who <p align=left>Column: 3621</p>do Singapore proud by winning debating awards in the international arena.&nbsp; Then there are also those who are already competent speakers who will either readily volunteer or be chosen by their teachers as safe bets or deserving for activities which require good speaking skills, such as acting as master of ceremonies at school functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about the remaining students who form the vast majority?&nbsp; At school functions and debates, they just sit back and watch their eloquent schoolmates on stage, aware that their own development in public speaking and presentation is limited to a random chance to make presentations in the odd school project or only during special one-off public speaking courses at school.&nbsp; We should aim at raising the frequency and standards of formal oral communication at every level and there is no better place to do so than the school environment.&nbsp; We should develop our students early from primary school, starting with show and tell sessions and speech and drama lessons, so that they gradually build the confidence to speak and present persuasively as they move up the learning ladder. &nbsp;Programmes with the long-term objective of enabling all students to achieve their full potential in speech and presentation should be carried out consistently and progressively throughout the primary, secondary and post-secondary school years.&nbsp; Such programmes can weave opportunities to develop public speaking and presentation skills into the curriculum across subjects and levels.&nbsp; By the time the student leaves school, he or she should be able to speak confidently in any situation, convey ideas articulately and deliver polished presentations to any group of people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would&nbsp;like now to touch&nbsp;on&nbsp;the subjects of PE, music and art.&nbsp; When asked what their favourite subject is, <p align=left>Column: 3622</p>many a young school-goer will gleefully reply \"recess!\"&nbsp; Not surprisingly, PE, music and art rank as the favourite subjects for many of our little&nbsp;ones once they are told that recess, fun as it is, is not a subject.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the key performance indicators of&nbsp;PE, music and art programmes respectively?&nbsp; For example, will every child be physically fit, be motivated to keep fit and have been introduced to a variety of sports and physical activities by the time he leaves school?&nbsp; Will every child be able to play a musical instrument or appreciate a classical music performance by the time he or she leaves school?&nbsp; Will every child be able to appreciate different media and techniques, the relationship between the visual arts and other disciplines and appreciate visual art in relation to history and different cultures long after he folds away his last school uniform?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PE, art and music, being non-core and non-academic subjects, tend to get sidelined by other subjects, like mathematics and science.&nbsp; In schools, the temptation to use art, music and PE periods for other subjects, especially around examination time, is strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are serious about providing our children with quality PE, music and art education, we should have teachers who have in-depth knowledge and are specially trained to teach in these areas. Precious time is wasted and interest lost if children do not receive instructions from specialists in these areas who can give a better insight into their area of specialty and are more likely to infect and inspire the children with their enthusiasm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, in one art lesson, primary school students can be instructed simply to paint a scene in a park and be allowed to proceed as they please or, alternatively, they can be shown a few different techniques and styles that have been used by artists over the ages before being asked to paint a scene in the park in a <p align=left>Column: 3623</p>style they prefer.&nbsp; In the former scenario, they are allowed to express themselves creatively while in the latter scenario, they are not only able to express themselves but they also learn appreciation of the work of other artists and take with them some understanding of art in a historical context.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, may I request that the Ministry elaborate on the progress that has been made on the learning of the Chinese language in primary schools since key changes were made to the curriculum and implemented at Primary 1 and 2 in 2007, Primary 3 and 4 in 2008, followed by Primary 5 in 2009?&nbsp; It would also be helpful to know how the students are tested at both primary and secondary levels and to have an update on our plan to maintain a core group of Chinese language experts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still on the matter of languages, I am of the view that schools should promote more actively the learning of Malay or Bahasa Indonesia by non-Malays, the reason being that Indonesia and Malaysia are our immediate neighbours.&nbsp; Non-Malay students are able to study Malay as a third language under the Malay Special Programme&nbsp;and Bahasa Indonesia as a third language. In addition, conversational Malay enrichment programmes are available.&nbsp; I wonder how these programmes are faring and&nbsp;whether the take-up rate should be pushed higher.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Moral and political education</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Madam, our young today are bombarded with all sorts of ideas through the Internet.&nbsp; Actions that once scarcely entered the realm of fantasy are now presented on the Internet not only as entertainment, but as reality.&nbsp; The blog post claiming that Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had suffered a serious heart attack is a case in point.&nbsp; It said Singapore would face \"total destruction\" due to a<p align=left>Column: 3624</p> \"power vacuum\".&nbsp;&nbsp;The post was a hoax but spread like wildfire through the Internet.&nbsp; One can sit back and say&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;well, freedom of speech.&nbsp; But does this entail the freedom to spread such lies and bring harm to the country?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is such questions that our young should learn to grapple with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given this new reality, our students need to be equipped with the reasoning skills and moral values to face the challenges of living in the 21st century.&nbsp; They need to learn how to think through the arguments and evidence, come to their own rational conclusions and to work out right from wrong.&nbsp; To do this, we should review the education curriculum and build in the teaching of moral values and political awareness with an emphasis on the exercise of reason.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good way to approach this is through the subjects of history and literature.&nbsp; Where we can, we should draw from local sources and examples, so that the students can see the direct relevance to their lives.&nbsp; The goal is not to indoctrinate, but to encourage individuals to face the contradictions and dilemmas faced in any course of action and to provide them the opportunity to arrive at fair solutions.&nbsp; At the same time, we should imbue in our students a strong sense of national identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More should be done to insert key narratives&nbsp;about our founding leaders and pioneers into our history books.&nbsp; Kishore Mahbubani, the Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, rightly noted in the <I>Straits Times</I> last week that strong nations are built on&nbsp;inspiring narratives about their past.&nbsp; He called it a great tragedy that few students knew of their founding fathers. &nbsp;This ignorance extends to our early pioneers.&nbsp; A student wrote in my Facebook that it is strange how our students could reel off the names of figures from China&rsquo;s imperial history, but <p align=left>Column: 3625</p>\"they are not able to tell who is Aljunied, Eunos or Nee Soon!\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we should teach our students that history emerges from the examination of evidence and the exercise of reason.&nbsp; For example, there has been some discussion recently about what would Singapore be like if the Barisan Sosialis&nbsp;had won in 1963, and not the PAP.&nbsp; Will it lead to a peaceful socialist paradise, as some today seem to think? &nbsp;Or to a troubled pro-China Communist state, as others do.&nbsp; Or is this only so much navel-gazing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that such discussions are not without merit. &nbsp;But to do this intelligently, one needs to understand the regional and global events at the time, and the political forces at play.&nbsp; One also must also learn to appraise claims and counterclaims, separate supportable assertions from fabrications, scrutinise the evidence, detect flaws in arguments and reject unjustified inferences and generalisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Australia&rsquo;s then Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Robert Menzies, stated in a Cabinet note&nbsp;in 1961, that if Singapore were to win independence on its own without merger,&nbsp;Singapore would be easily subverted by Communist China.&nbsp; \"It would in time almost certainly be governed by radical Chinese aiming at close association with Communist China.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas, today, some former Barisan leaders who in the 1960s opposed merger,&nbsp;now say that had the Barisan come into power, there would have been more welfare for the people, and so on. No mention about the Communist danger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, to analyse the lessons of history, we must know our history and learn how to evaluate the evidence.&nbsp; To ask students to be educated on our <p align=left>Column: 3626</p>political history is not the same thing as politicising&nbsp;our education system.&nbsp; As Aristotle said, \"politics is the 'master science' among men.\"<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>The future and relevance of education</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Madam, when our children have a question, who do they call?&nbsp; Parents&nbsp;&ndash; maybe;&nbsp;teachers&nbsp;&ndash; maybe; peers&nbsp;&ndash; maybe.&nbsp; Wikipedia and Google&nbsp;- probably!<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infinite information access at real time means that the highest utility children get out of education today is no longer just pure knowledge, nor skills that revolve around recall and process.

These are children born into multi-channel, globally connected vatar world, where they are bombarded with a kaleidoscope of multi-channel media from birth.&nbsp; As a result, their brains are wired differently from the <I>homo sapiens</I> to help them learn in a non-linear and visual manner, such that they can genuinely multi-task like an octopus.&nbsp; If this is true, it has huge implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, the connected cyber and real world would truly become the&nbsp;homo zappiens&rsquo; oyster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the simple act of multi-player computer games, combined with simultaneous multi-party online chats and&nbsp;calls, can very quickly become platforms for collaborative and creative problem solving.&nbsp; Cyber tracks will blossom in this global <p align=left>Column: 3627</p>playground giving new meanings to relationships, transform the human web as well as reorganise the way we work, live and play.&nbsp; Harnessed properly, such platforms can also promote mutual understanding and cultural melting pots, thereby averting potential&nbsp;conflicts and&nbsp;clashes.&nbsp; But, of course, the reverse is also true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our information environment is finally catching up to human capabilities, we are now beginning to see learning environments created to capitalise on our natural and intuitive inclinations&nbsp;&ndash; which are all around curiosity, interest-oriented skill acquisition, and project-based implementation.&nbsp; Music, art, sports and common interest that transcends language barriers and promotes creativity will become the new common language and academic driver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, experiments are being done using mobile technology to deliver education.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;a fifth grade mobile phone learning programme that&nbsp;incorporates the game theory was rolled out as an experiment that has got rather complex information gathering and decision making processes in the game.

I would like to propose that this same culture be instilled in our young as well.&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;Teo defined productivity as a measure of how much output we can get from our input.&nbsp; However, in relation to our young people, I view productivity as them learning a subject matter that will equip them to be effective and excellent at what they do in the future, lending value to our society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the amount of information that a youth must learn today has significantly increased in both quantity and complexity from the time that we, those sitting here, were in school.&nbsp; Yet,&nbsp;if this has not made any of us less capable, why should we attempt to cram <p align=left>Column: 3629</p>so much more information into them this day and age?&nbsp; I am aware that society&nbsp;and standards have changed with time but the reason our Government is as effective as it is today is not because we had a mountain of information poured into us but rather all of us here have learnt and grown&nbsp;better&nbsp;through time, opportunity and desire.&nbsp; It is this same desire that we must create in our youths today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also observed that many of the youths I have interacted with, for the most part the increase of information does not translate into greater productivity, as the youth&nbsp;are likely to forget the information they have just studied so hard to learn as soon as they walk out of the examination hall.&nbsp; Madam, I find this a disturbing trend in the different generations of youths that I have encountered, both in my workplace as a youth executive and previously as a national swimmer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge that there are many schools of thought on&nbsp;how to best educate our young people.&nbsp; Apart from just teaching our young people a greater amount of information, can I suggest that we help them and teach them to value learning by finding innovative ways to make the subjects and topics more engaging?&nbsp; When the subject matter is found to be engaging, young people have a higher desire to attain mastery of the subject. The value imparted during the process of learning is more valuable to them in the long run than piling on information and more work as&nbsp;the quest for greater knowledge and, therefore, increase productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they catch this love for learning, we will have a new generation that is hungry to grow and excel in whatever area of work they set their&nbsp;mind to.&nbsp; This translates into increased productivity in many sectors of our economy in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3630</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was excited to read in the <I>Straits Times</I> last week that Crescent Girls' School has developed interactive materials that incorporate multimedia features to pique their students' interest in learning.&nbsp; Quoting a Secondary&nbsp;1 student from the article, she said, \"When I read normal textbooks, my eyelids will just droop and I cannot continue reading but with the digital textbooks there are so much colour and action, especially in the videos. They make learning fun.&nbsp; I am encouraged to learn on my own.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would also like to suggest that another aspect of making the learning process more enjoyable is to place greater emphasis on the six-year IP programmes, allowing greater enjoyment and learning and breathing space for the holistic development of the youth as opposed to a four-year programme where they have to gear up for a major examination and then again two years later. Therefore, I would like to suggest&nbsp;to the Minister to have an incentive scheme to nudge schools to move in this direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in closing, I would like to draw this parallel from the concerns some raised last week with regard to the fear that the drive for increased productivity means driving people to work harder and longer.&nbsp; It is not about working harder but for companies to work smarter. To raise the productivity of our students, it is not to increase their workload but rather to get more innovative in the way we educate our young and they will, in turn, enjoy the work, achieve mastery over these subjects and, along the way, catch this culture of lifelong learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Letting teachers teach</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member):</B> The \"Goh Report\" of 1979, authored by a team led by the then Minister for Education, Dr Goh Keng Swee, heralded the introduction of the New Education System which has been the basis of our education till today.&nbsp; The expressed purpose was to \"eliminate wastage\" in education and increase employability.&nbsp; Indeed, the education system achieved both, and today has earned respect especially for its systematic approach and rigour in delivering results.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Education System has served us well thus far, but it is increasingly evident that it may not be enough&nbsp;in preparing us for the present and especially future challenges, where what is certain is uncertainty.&nbsp; We need a new breed of people, especially young people, with&nbsp;abilities to cope with adversity and to succeed, not just technical skills.&nbsp; Definitely, if we want to boost productivity and have greater <p align=left>Column: 3632</p>innovation &ndash; we need to produce more lateral thinkers, problem solvers and, very importantly, a lot more people who take pride in what they do and think beyond just themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key desired outcome of education today, therefore, would be&nbsp;to inspire a confident, self assured and driven young population, with skills to analyse, the propensity to come up with out-of-the-box solutions, and that is socially conscious.&nbsp; This spells character and attitude.&nbsp; Teachers are an intrinsic and vital factor in this equation.&nbsp; They need to have the time, indeed, the emotional bandwidth to imbibe this in our youth.&nbsp; Each one of us here can attest to one or two teachers who have made that impact in our lives.&nbsp; I remember my Primary 2 teacher, Mr Tang, who, through our many conversations made me realise that if there is&nbsp;something important enough to me I should just do it and not wait for someone else to do it.&nbsp; This has had a lasting impression on me.&nbsp; Yes, I was fortunate to have a teacher like Mr Tang.&nbsp; But today, I am not sure if the same Mr Tang would have the time,&nbsp;the energy to do the same thing &ndash; given the pace of life and the workload that teachers have.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the Ministry of Education has introduced measures to free-up time for teachers to interact with students.&nbsp; The \"Teach Less, Learn More\" initiatives, the adjunct teacher and teaching aid schemes&nbsp;and having retired senior officers from the SAF to become operational managers and VPs in schools are examples.&nbsp; Yet, I am still meeting&nbsp;teachers who seem frustrated by the amount of administrative and other non-core duties that leave them with too little time and energy, let alone to interact with students to teach them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The non-core activities cited by teachers include NE lessons and activities, planning and organising special activities and events such as school visits&nbsp;by VIPs,<p align=left>Column: 3633</p> Speech Day, career festivals, entrepreneurship workshops and formalised community engagement activities.&nbsp; In addition, some teachers tell me they are also roped in for marketing and PR initiatives&nbsp;in the school.&nbsp; While they acknowledge the need for these activities and the importance, they seem frustrated by the opportunity cost, which is less quality time with the students.&nbsp; In fact, even some school principals, I get the sense, would prefer more time to focus on improving the teaching and character building aspects instead of the administrative aspects of their jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give principals and teachers even more time to focus on teaching and character building, I have a few suggestions:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engage a professional CEO for each school &ndash; we now have a strong pool of retired corporate CEOs and others with credible management experience and network that would prove invaluable in the administrative, financial, business development, marketing, PR and fund raising aspects of running schools.&nbsp; There could be two leaders in each school &ndash; the CEO, who would be the administrative head, and the Head Master or Mistress who has the final say on all academic and pedagogical matters.&nbsp; This is a system that is similar to that practice in many hospitals where the CEO is a non-medical professional who, on medical issues, takes the cue from the Chairman, Medical Board &ndash; a seasoned medical practitioner.&nbsp; From what I understand, the system has worked well in hospitals.&nbsp; By engaging experienced, retired personnel to be CEOs and possibly hold other positions in schools &ndash; not only do you allow teachers more time to teach as non-core tasks are taken off their plate, you also give experienced retirees another meaningful way of contributing.&nbsp; Of course, there are principals today who have strong <p align=left>Column: 3634</p>management abilities and&nbsp;if they are interested in that career path, naturally they should be given the opportunity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater community involvement &ndash; this is a core practice in many western countries, where individuals, groups (possibly NGOs) and corporate entities in the locale contribute extensively to the school.&nbsp; Some schools in Singapore do this, but often on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis.&nbsp; Schools could have stronger outreach programmes to make the community feel more welcome and participate in formal programmes such as adoption of specific initiatives.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, involving the Alumni more meaningfully &ndash; alumni are a rich resource waiting to be invited back \"home\".&nbsp; It is a shame if we cannot see beyond fund raising when we think of alumni.&nbsp; I remember when I was in school in RI most of the sports teams were trained by highly committed, passionate old boys &ndash; and I think we did fairly well then in sports.&nbsp; We seem to have lost this tradition, unfortunately.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to conclude by acknowledging that&nbsp;this is not an easy challenge to tackle, and&nbsp;the Ministry of Education has been paying a lot of attention to it for sometime.&nbsp; Nevertheless we have to be unrelenting in our effort as, to a large extent, the quality of Singaporeans is dependent on how well we imbibe character and resilience in our young, not just knowledge and skills which, increasingly, in my view, are just hygiene factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to end by quoting Barry Schwartz, a renowned psychologist whose thoughts on the link between economics and psychology and education are gaining traction.&nbsp; He said, and I quote:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Teachers should strive to be the ordinary heroes, the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor. &nbsp;The single most important thing kids <p align=left>Column: 3635</p>need to learn is character.&nbsp; They need to learn to respect themselves.&nbsp; They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.&nbsp; They need to learn to respect their teachers.&nbsp; And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is&nbsp;the principal objective&nbsp;&ndash; &nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This has led to a trend of learning Chinese all over the world. More and more people, adult or young, are now learning Chinese. In Singapore, with a majority Chinese population, it is ironical that we are facing many challenges in improving or even maintaining our students' Chinese standard.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixty percent of Chinese Primary One students are now speaking English at home. In schools, all subjects are taught in English except Chinese. Even in SAP Schools, students converse in English mostly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people are pessimistic about Chinese language's position in Singapore. I am and, I believe, we can be positive. According to a Nielsen Media Study, Channel 8's viewership at 49%, is double <p align=left>Column: 3639</p>that of Channel 5, which is only 28%. If we look at the local Chinese TV programmes, be it for senior citizens like Golden Age, current affairs programmes like Focus, or those popular among the young such as Campus Superstar, their popularity and standard are generally higher than the English programmes. I know even many Malays and Indians follow Chinese drama series.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From <I>xinyao</I> songs to Stephanie Sun, who is well known in the global Chinese pop scene, our Chinese pop music is also much more developed than its English counterpart. I just checked Sistic website and noted that there would be eight concerts by overseas Chinese singers held here from now to end of this year, such as May Day, S.H.E , Sammi Cheng and Sam Hui. There are only four concerts by&nbsp; western singers in comparison.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see from these examples that although English is the working language in Singapore, Chinese language still holds a strong position. We can therefore conclude that it is not that Singaporeans are not interested in Chinese, it is just that our students find it difficult studying for it! How do we take advantage of these positive external forces to arouse their interest in Chinese?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed that MOE text books tend to inculcate social morals and traditional Chinese values.&nbsp; Classic literature is also taught sometimes. Although all these are very important, we can re-package them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest MOE incorporate modern Chinese culture, including pop culture into our curriculum. This will help enliven our Chinese classes and keep them relevant. Take Zhang Yimou's movie, \"Curse of the Golden Flower\", as an example. This is a big production combining the elements of Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear with Chinese culture and history. I believe the intriguing plot, the fighting scenes and pop idol Jay Chou will attract our students.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 3640</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If students want to recite Sung dynasty poet Su Dongpo's famous poem \"Dan Yuan Ren Chang Jiu\", we can ask the students to learn the song composed by Liang Hong Zhi and sung by Teresa Teng and Faye Wong. This gives new meaning to the old poem, and will help students to remember better the verses \"<I>ming yue ji shi you, ba jiu wen qing tian</I>\".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Farewell My Concubine\" is a famous movie directed by Chen Kaige, adapted from Li Bihua's (Lilian Lee) novel. Featuring a stellar cast, this movie boasts strong emotions, an interesting plot and clashes between life and death. It is both commercially successful and possesses strong cultural content. The two main characters became famous actors of Peking opera but, in the end, they had to betray each other during the Cultural Revolution with a tragic ending. Through this movie and novel, we can expose students to Peking Opera and help them understand this part of China&rsquo;s history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now come back to Singapore. We can teach our history through Liang Wenfu's song Singapore Pie (<I>Xin Jia Po Pai</I>): black and white Cantonese movies in the 1960s, development of Jurong Town and Junie Sng's gold medal in the 1970s, start of MRT in the 1980s. The last part of the lyrics reads \"We can create a Singapore Pie. People move to Singapore from all over the world.&nbsp; Everybody loves the Singapore Brand.\" The lines were written in the 1990s, but still relevant today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pop culture will of course not be 100% true to history, nor is it a record of history. Teachers can use the opportunity to explain to students the difference between reality and creativity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that, to connect Chinese from all over the world, we should not just rely on tradition, we can also use pop culture. When young people are together, they&nbsp;are <p align=left>Column: 3641</p>unlikely to talk about Confucius or Art of Sun Tzu, instead they will be talking about Wong Lee Hom (singer), Super Girls, <I>Bodyguards and Assassins</I> (movie) and Brother Sharp (famous Chinese vagabond from Ningbo). Through music, visuals and special effects, we can grab the attention of students studying Chinese. Through pop culture, we can teach them traditional Chinese values and ideas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know many teachers are already taking steps to innovate Chinese teaching, including the use of pop culture to cultivate students' interest in Chinese. However, one teacher's strength and resources are limited. I hope MOE can take on this approach to benefit all students and achieve much greater efficiency.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3693-3696.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Mother tongue languages review</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo:</B> Madam, several months ago, the debate on our bilingual policy sounded to me like an argument between the Chinese-cans and the Chinese-cannots.&nbsp; This is unfortunate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Singapore's environment today is overwhelmingly English-oriented.&nbsp; Outside of schools, Singaporeans no longer need to use their mother tongues, whether to get jobs, leisure and entertainment, or services.&nbsp; This has gravely affected the learning of all mother tongues, not just Chinese.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is thus right to initiate a review of teaching methods.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would not be accurate to base our review on the assumption that mother tongues&nbsp;have become more like foreign languages in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Chinese language, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are at least three Chinese language newspapers, two free-to-air television channels and five radio stations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether <p align=left>Column: 3642</p>at the bus interchange, retail outlets or&nbsp;restaurants, Mandarin and dialects can be heard on a daily basis.&nbsp; Every housing estate, which over 80% of Singaporeans live in, have shops and hawker stalls with Chinese signboards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a typical city in US, or European or Australian city, such a language environment can be found only in Chinatown.&nbsp;&nbsp; But not in Singapore, not now anyway.&nbsp; While we do not need to use our mother tongues, we can if we want to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I hope the MOE does not adopt a defeatist attitude when reviewing the teaching of our mother tongues and end up eroding our language environment to our own detriment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should frame the review more positively, not as a win-lose argument between the Chinese-cans and Chinese-cannots, but as a collective challenge&nbsp;to allow all our children to reach their highest potential in learning their mother-tongues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review should be informed by research relevant to our circumstances, and be not based on opinions and personal experiences only.&nbsp; We should adopt a differentiated approach so that children with varied language abilities can do well and be proficient at different levels.&nbsp; At the same time, I hope MOE can leverage on efforts already proven to be effective in promoting language excellence.&nbsp; For example, MOE&nbsp;could consider doubling the number of places for the bicultural studies programme and giving out more scholarships to encourage the students who are prepared to put in the effort to achieve excellence in Chinese language or in their mother tongue.&nbsp; A differentiated approach will help us to achieve both a high floor and a high ceiling in the teaching of mother tongues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Chinese \"B\"</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100309/20100309VS_122152.pdf\"\"><p align=left>Column: 3643</p>Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; The Chinese \"B\" curriculum was implemented in 2001.

Secondly, in line with the general trend, the standard of teaching of the Chinese Language must not go down.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past decade, the examination results of ethnic Chinese students in Singapore have been improving every year, with passing rate of 99% (including passes in the Chinese Language subject) in the PSLE and more than 85% in the O-level examinations.&nbsp; Passing the examination implies that they should have no difficulty with listening, speaking, writing and reading Chinese.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bilingual education has produced many excellent talents. Pillars of society like Prime Minister Lee, many Ministers, many Members, are effectively bilingual as they are the beneficiaries of our bilingual education system. Credit must be given to the Government and the Chinese language teachers.&nbsp; I visit China very frequently, and I am able to communicate with the local people there because I had the privilege of receiving bilingual education in Singapore.&nbsp; As a Singaporean, I am very proud of this achievement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3645</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good results are commendable, but there are still many intrinsic problems. With the rapid economic development of China, Chinese businessmen all over the world are getting more and more influential, and the demand for Chinese-speaking talents from all sectors of society is getting higher and higher.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, can our students cope with the demand and be truly competent in their job after graduation from the schools?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry for example. Nowadays, we have extreme difficulties getting people who are effectively bilingual and could work independently at the Secretariat. Our 133 trade&nbsp;association members and the few thousand corporate members are facing the same problem.&nbsp; Many young people scored good results in the Chinese Language paper, some even scored A1, but when it comes to actual application, they find that they are unable to cope&nbsp;with wrong words everywhere, and&nbsp;inability to express themselves in good, coherent Chinese. Truly effectively bilingual talents are very scarce indeed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, more and more people are coming to attend the Chinese courses conducted by the Chamber. This is a good sign, but it is also worrying. Is the standard of Chinese teaching in the schools too low that they need to take extra lessons to brush up their Chinese after graduation? As such, I sincerely urge the Ministry of Education to touch base with the business sector to find out how we could raise the standard of the teaching of Chinese Language in the schools so that our students can truly master the Chinese language, and meet the demand of the business sector.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, there were heated discussions on the use of English to teach <p align=left>Column: 3646</p>Chinese.&nbsp; I think this method is appropriate only to those with an English-speaking background and who are just beginning to learn Chinese. Using English to explain the meaning and usage of the Chinese terms often miss out the beauty and nuances in the language.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will not take this as a panacea, and implement it in all the schools.&nbsp; Over the years, Chinese teachers have put in a lot of efforts and accumulated a lot of experience in the teaching of the language. Asking them to use English in the teaching of&nbsp;Chinese&nbsp;is like sending a Chinese physician to the operating theatre of a western hospital. It will undermine the efficiency and lower the morale of the practitioners.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest worry of the Chinese community is that the Government, in order to cater for the minority who is afraid of learning Chinese, will lower the standard of the teaching of Chinese again and again.&nbsp; In this way, we are going to lose the competitive edge of bilingualism and will eventually regret this decision.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting the Chinese language, the Chinese community and Business China have made many efforts.&nbsp; I hope that more political leaders; successful people and celebrities will speak more Mandarin in public. The Government departments should take the lead in raising the standard of Chinese in their official documents and notices.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in this region, Hong Kong and Singapore are constantly competing with each other and, at the same, learning from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hong Kong officials I meet from time to time, speak fluent English, beautiful Cantonese, and are now stepping up their efforts to learn Mandarin.&nbsp; Look at the Hong Kong people, very few&nbsp;complain that Mandarin is difficult to learn and, hence, refuse to learn it.&nbsp; If we do not buck up, very soon, <p align=left>Column: 3647</p>their standard of Mandarin may well surpass ours.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many foreign talents migrate to Singapore because of the competitive edge of our bilingual system. The world-renowned investor, Jim Rogers is one of them.&nbsp; He has been to various countries in the world, but eventually chose to migrate to Singapore. He spared no effort in enrolling&nbsp; his daughter in Nanyang Primary School because he attached great importance to the school's educational standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;He openly indicated that many people had advised him that the homework in Nanyang Primary School was very tough, the standard of Chinese was very profound, and the discipline in the school was very strict. Yet, it was precisely because of these attributes that he chose Nanyang Primary School.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being&nbsp;a parent myself, I can understand the worries and anxieties of some parents.&nbsp; The local universities require a pass in the Mother Tongue language for admission. This has indeed exerted great pressure on students who are weak in Chinese. I would like to suggest that for these minority students who are not so good in Chinese, but have scored distinctions in other subjects, the Universities could exercise their discretion in admitting them.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the whole world is bustling to learn Chinese, the standard of our Chinese education must be comprehensively raised.&nbsp; We need to cultivate some truly effectively bilingual talents who excel in listening, speaking, reading and writing both Chinese and English, and not just \"half-baked\" ones who are good in neither. &nbsp;In order to attain this target, besides the able leadership of the Government, the whole society must be united in creating a climate and an environment to learn Chinese.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people in China are making every effort to learn English, and the westerners are picking up Chinese enthusiastically. <p align=left>Column: 3648</p>Singaporeans have no choice but to work harder if we want to maintain our competitive edge in bilingualism.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3699-3702.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Education vision and directions</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Madam, the education landscape in Singapore has for the last&nbsp;10 years undergone many positive changes.&nbsp; Please let me share my observations and recommendations in several focus areas.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on vision and outcomes of education.&nbsp; Howard Gardner, renowned and respected professor of cognition and education, is famous for his theory of Multiple Intelligences which has led to the sprouting of institutions such as the School of the Arts, Singapore Sports School and the likes in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his latest classic, <I>Five Minds for the Future</I>, Gardner identified five kinds of minds or ways of thinking and acting that he believes fetch the highest premium in a future-oriented education. Three of these are related to intellect: (1) the disciplined mind which deals with the content of specific disciplines; (2) the synthesising mind which draws knowledge from different disciplines to solve problems; and (3) the creative mind which is of even more strategic value now in the future of Singapore.&nbsp; Two others emphasise the respectful mind and the ethical mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the respectful and the ethical minds are the two minds that Gardner, in his speeches, often stressed are very important &ndash; quoting the unethical use of the intellect that led to the conception of irresponsible financial products causing the last financial crisis.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, both respect and being ethical should be inculcated in the daily course of life, both in schools and at home, and are best learned by example. Ignoring this will risk our education system producing super skilled and super creative financial wizards <p align=left>Column: 3649</p>developing seductive financial products that may lead to another financial crisis.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question to the Minister is: how would the Ministry's desired outcomes of education reflect these future-oriented minds and skills and&nbsp;a balance of both intellect and character; and how these might be reflected in some milestones and KPIs for the Ministry?</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next on tuition.&nbsp; Madam, I continue to be concerned over the tuition syndrome and the way our students are assessed&nbsp;primarily through academic results and the overbearing stress of the high-stake national examination years. Last Saturday alone, I counted 177 advertisements offering tuition services. This examination preparation stress, especially for&nbsp;those who missed out on the Integrated Programme train, is unlikely to create a love for learning, much less life-long learning.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there is an alternate vision that we can paint for a future education system in Singapore.&nbsp; We can incorporate the strengths of our Singapore system with that of&nbsp;other respected education systems.&nbsp; One such system is Finland.&nbsp; The skills of Finnish students are among the best in all the&nbsp;domains assessed in PISA surveys of years 2000, 2003 and 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;The uniformity of students' performance is a special forte in Finland. The differences between the strongest and the weakest results are amongst the smallest when all the OECD countries are compared. &nbsp;Differences in Finland and&nbsp;differences&nbsp;between schools and regions are remarkably small, unlike our elite and non-elite school landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although formal school age is seven, because most Finnish women work, there are good quality universal day care&nbsp;that prepare the children for a rigorous system when they start studying at seven. &nbsp;Education is compulsory and free in Finland. Children <p align=left>Column: 3650</p>with special needs, including those with intellectual disabilities, are integrated into regular education.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a constant but very supportive evaluation of learning outcomes of students and schools. The aim of assessment in the Finland education system&nbsp;is to produce information that will help schools and students to develop.&nbsp; In Finland, there are no national tests of learning outcomes and no national&nbsp;school league tables. &nbsp;Pupils and schools are not compared to each other.&nbsp; Learning takes place in a fear-free environment in which creativity and risk-taking are encouraged.&nbsp; Although teachers assess their students regularly, they do not need to teach to the test nor focus on annual tests or examinations.&nbsp; And lastly, the teaching profession is very popular and respected in Finland and&nbsp;the salaries of teachers are average. Only less than 10% of people&nbsp;who apply to be teachers are accepted.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest we start beating ourselves up and not giving credit for all the great work that MOE has done, let me add that the Finnish education system&nbsp;is more than 40 years old and shaped very much by their history.&nbsp; All I am asking the Minister&nbsp;is an open mind and more public engagement for a future education vision and how we might adapt some of the best practices of successful systems without losing what we have done well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, many of the current KPIs in MOE are still&nbsp;largely measured by not just how many but how well students pass national high-stake examinations, the scores being the passport to an elite school and upward social mobility.&nbsp; I submit that these KPIs are not sufficient to reflect our desired outcomes of education, current or future, and ask that they be reviewed. This is my second time appealing to the Ministry on this topic.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;on the topic of&nbsp;students with special needs,&nbsp;I am happy to note that significant progress has been made in the <p align=left>Column: 3651</p>last&nbsp;seven years in supporting special needs students, both in mainstream schools and special schools&nbsp;. Once never a feature in public schools, Allied Educators, or special needs officers, are now available in almost every primary school and some secondary schools in mainstream.&nbsp; Within this special school system, MOE has been very considerate in their financial sponsorships and&nbsp;the prototyping of&nbsp;vocational training in schools like Delta Senior School and Metta School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest successful prototype that was championed by&nbsp;both the special schools and MOE is&nbsp;in integrated education and takes the form of satellite schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am most pleased and most grateful and appreciative of especially the MOE officers and mainstream schools such as Chong Boon Secondary School, Townsville Primary School and Bishan Park Secondary School who allowed the setting up of satellite classes within their mainstream schools. &nbsp;By doing so, special needs students from Pathlight, for example, integrate physically, socially and, where appropriate, academically with the mainstream students in these schools.&nbsp; Kudos to MOE and all these schools&nbsp;for persevering in this significant development!</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in the support and inclusion of special-needs students in Singapore, I seek the Minister's consideration in the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;In the mainstream school sector, I ask that every secondary school and tertiary institutions such as the ITE, Polytechnics and Universities, be staffed with minimum&nbsp;one Allied Educator or Psychologist to support those students&nbsp;with special needs.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) In the special schools, I ask for more than financial help.&nbsp; Specifically, I&nbsp;ask the Minister to consider setting up an Institute&nbsp;for Special Education, if the Minister does not intend to slay&nbsp;the <p align=left>Column: 3652</p>sacred cow of the Many Helping Hands in running special schools.&nbsp; Repeat the success of ITE&nbsp;in an&nbsp;ISE&nbsp;&ndash; Institute for Special Education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charities can still provide the disability expertise and fund-raising for special items, especially&nbsp;in transition services.&nbsp; Provide equal access to core curriculum support to the special schools that are operated by VWOs, especially for vocational courses. Officially appoint schools like ITE and WDA as the vocational course consultants to all special schools so that all&nbsp;of these graduands can&nbsp;be more employable&nbsp;and have a better prognosis in life when they exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let every special-needs child remain in the special school system until age 21 but insist that a Robust Transition Plan be set up so that the family can take over responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And last, I ask the MOE be the sector administrator for special education to&nbsp;further take its place and&nbsp;streamline processes&nbsp;relating to the multiple reporting, programme evaluation systems, audits&nbsp;and funding agencies.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;fourth year I am asking for this.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Productivity and innovation. &nbsp;Madam, I&nbsp;would ask for&nbsp;three specific areas for inclusion as part&nbsp;of MOE's Innovation Portfolio:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;Develop a Learning Roadmap for family caregivers to include modules on both academics and values. Provide free training to families so that they can address part of the tuition problem and engage them in modelling desired values to their own children.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;Seriously consider uploading quality lectures and developing online interactive lessons&nbsp;for nation-wide access by teachers and students in all the schools.&nbsp; Scale it so that&nbsp;every school has access.&nbsp;Before the Minister says no to me again, why not take some time to go into website&nbsp;<I>www.academicearth.org</I> to sample the free online lectures from Ivy <p align=left>Column: 3653</p>League universities such as Harvard, Berkeley, Yale, NYU, and so forth. If we can get some excellent basic lectures online for the few hundred schools we have, there will be greater productivity and more consistent quality of teaching of the core concepts.&nbsp; Microsoft chief, Bill Gates, raved about the potential of this form of learning in his Annual Letter of 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;In the area of teacher recruitment where the main tool seems to be an attractive starting salary, I urge MOE to study the successful model of the non-profit \"Teach for America\" (TFA)&nbsp;programme. TFA successfully enlists talented young leaders to commit to address the problem of education by committing two years of their lives to teach in the United States' highest-need schools.&nbsp; If we adapt this programme to our local context, this can be a short-term response to&nbsp;our&nbsp;teacher shortage while serving as a force to engage and root our best young people in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I am &ndash;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chairman</B>: I am afraid I must stop you there, Ms Phua.&nbsp; Dr Ng.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> I thank Members for their passionate speeches.&nbsp; I sat there listening and I felt very gratified because all the speeches have one singular theme &ndash; we really want something better for the next generation, for our children.&nbsp; We want to make sure that they are more morally upright, more confident, more equipped, smarter, rooted, some said \"wings\".&nbsp; A number of descriptions that Members said.&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min said we wanted them to have social aptitude.&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miss&nbsp;Penny Low called them the \"Gen Z\" generation. Ms Joscelin Yeo said \"value learning\".&nbsp; Mr <p align=left>Column: 3654</p>Viswa Sadasivan wanted teachers to be moral exemplars and in the course&nbsp;mentioned his teacher Mr Tang. Dr Maliki Osman wanted more weightage on the arts, physical exercise, education shaping their character.&nbsp; And on languages, the theme was same&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;whether it came from Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mr Teo Siong Seng or Mr Low Thia Khiang&nbsp;&ndash; how can we help them in their linguistic skills, as well as Mrs Josephine Teo, how can we make learning of languages more exciting, and I think someone mentioned a high bar, a high floor and a high ceiling, typical Singaporean style&nbsp;&ndash; high floor and high ceiling&nbsp;&ndash; and it is a worthwhile&nbsp;aspiration. And, of course, before I reply to the passionate speech by Ms Denise Phua, I am glad that she keeps count of how many times and how many years she asked the Ministry. We keep count too, and when we can say \"yes\", we will.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure Members were shocked as I was when they heard Ms Mildred Tan speak of an example.&nbsp; Shocking&nbsp;&ndash; in Singapore!&nbsp; We will have to say that the facts are not verified.&nbsp; We are verifying the facts but it is believable that there are young children&nbsp;&ndash; I do not know whether there are&nbsp;adolescents&nbsp;&ndash; who become pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings to home how schools are fundamental learning ground and how we need to work with society to help our children navigate moral values, confidence, etc, in various aspects.&nbsp; For that particular case, we will look up the facts and work with MCYS and our schools and we will report back to Parliament because I think it is an important enough case for us to address adequately, but I do not have facts here and I will reply to Parliament when we do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me thank Members for their overwhelming support.&nbsp; I have not heard anyone say that we are spending too much. I thank them for their overwhelming support for our large investments in education and their support affirms that, by and large, we <p align=left>Column: 3655</p>spend our education dollars well.&nbsp; There are many suggestions about what our education system should be but I think generally most of us agree that our students across the spectrum of academic ability receivea first-class education and at all levels&nbsp;&ndash; whether it&nbsp;is primary, secondary and&nbsp;post-secondary institutions, ITE, Polytechnics and Universities. The system we have today is a far cry from what we have inherited when we became independent.&nbsp; In the first PSLE held in 1960,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;it in our&nbsp;records, guess what the passing rate was&nbsp;&ndash; 55% failed!&nbsp; If you were the Permanent Secretary and the Minister, well, you can only go up from there&nbsp;&ndash; 55% failed, try to do better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, we have persisted in our efforts to upgrade educational opportunities for all&nbsp;&ndash; steadily focusing on the fundamentals to build a cadre of good school teachers and leaders, to develop a rigorous curriculum and then to ensure that our assessment systems are of high quality and valued by educational institutions and employers worldwide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outsiders have noted our achievements too. Let me share one anecdote. Last year,<st1:place><st1:placename>Cambridge</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> &rsquo;s Vice-Chancellor Prof. Alison Richard, who was here to address&nbsp;the <st1:city><st1:place>Cambridge</st1:place></st1:city> alumni, said that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> was \"renowned for its long-term investment in science and technology, for its commitment to nurturing exceptional talent, and also for encouraging students to study abroad&nbsp;&ndash; well before it became fashionable\". And indeed she is&nbsp;right, we do not do things because it is&nbsp;fashionable. We continue to focus on the basics. She went on to relate that a hundred years ago, the Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate was in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> administering school examinations and setting educational standards. But, today, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is considered a leader&nbsp;in educational innovations and a key partner for its international division - it is now renamed Cambridge International <p align=left>Column: 3656</p>Examinations (CIE).&nbsp; So the Cambridge&nbsp;certificate that you have, the organisation has been renamed, it is called CIE.&nbsp; CIE staff conduct examinations for many countries outside the UK. When they talk to these countries about&nbsp;their school curriculum, they tell us that these countries say to them \"we want to be like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore\"</st1:place></st1:country-region>. We regularly receive many delegations from overseas, including Ministers of other top-performing systems, who visit our schools and institutions and they are impressed.&nbsp;They visit our schools. We do not suggest to them which school.&nbsp; We say, \"Well, this is a panel,&nbsp;you decide which one.\"&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo&nbsp;made&nbsp;a point that when she goes to school, she sees art being conducted and sometimes she is not sure whether that&nbsp;swallow makes the summer.&nbsp; I invite Members to choose any school&nbsp;they&nbsp;like because it is system-wide, we let them look at our schools and they feedback to us that they&nbsp; are impressed with the level of&nbsp;engaged learning in our classrooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are careful not to let these praises get to our head. In fact, often we say, \"Look at our system, we do not want to teach anyone, we do not think we are in a position to but if you can learn something from the system, you tell us what you need to know.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive comments encourage us to continually seek for ways to improve. We engage and listen to MPs in this House as well as to the broad segments of society for their views on education as an ongoing exercise, and we view education reform as a continuous journey because we have to equip each generation of Singaporeans adequately for their future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs Josephine Teo made that stark remark that Primary&nbsp;1 students today will still be in the workforce in 2070,&nbsp;for the future that we cannot know or challenges that we cannot predict.&nbsp; She is right.&nbsp; So the Government is committed to continue this major focus on education and we do <p align=left>Column: 3657</p>this not only because it is critical for our economic competitiveness but for Singaporeans, it enables them to move up.&nbsp; As Dr Lily Neo and Ms Indranee Rajah noted in the Budget debate, for low-income families, it provides the uplifting power to break the poverty cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why in last year&rsquo;s Budget&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not too distant away,&nbsp;let me remind Members&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis,&nbsp; we continued to increase our spending on MOE. The financial crisis was worse end of the year, Budget was brought&nbsp;forward because we wanted to have a response, and even then we increased&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;by the good grace of MOF&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;our spending and our budget was &nbsp;$8.7 billion in FY09, an increase of 5.5% from FY08. And this year&rsquo;s education budget is a further increase from last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ndash; an 11% increase, to $9.7 billion. While we appreciate the overwhelming support of Members for our spending on education, MOE will still ensure that spending is prudent, in order to maintain the strong support that we have from Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo&nbsp;asked a very critical question&nbsp;&ndash; how does MOE approach its funding, where do you put your priorities,&nbsp;where&nbsp;do you put your dollars, and what do you hope to achieve. &nbsp;I will provide sectoral and numerical details later.&nbsp; But let me first say that the broad approach over the last two decades&nbsp;&ndash; if you look at the various initiatives across different Ministries, across different top management&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;has been consistent and there are&nbsp;two key aspects. First, it is to expand opportunities in education for all through building a mountain range of educational programmes with more peaks of excellence; second, to rebalance our system towards building values and skills to achieve broader educational outcomes.&nbsp;Just&nbsp;focus&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;on these two broad aspects&nbsp;&ndash; a mountain range of peaks and rebalancing <p align=left>Column: 3658</p>towards values and skills, much of which many Members in their speeches before me focused upon. So it affirms to us that MOE is moving in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, within the last decade or so, we have gone a considerable distance to cater to the diverse spectrum of abilities in all our students. In particular, we want to create paths for those with different learning styles.&nbsp; Members talk about late bloomers and let me provide some details of our various initiatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across schools, <st1:place>Normal</st1:place> stream students have benefited from more flexibility in streaming. Last year, 4,750&nbsp;Normal stream students&nbsp;benefited from taking&nbsp;a higher level subject. In fact, last year about one in three Normal (Academic) students took an O-level subject, and&nbsp;majority did well. Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students can also take modules which are delivered in collaboration with&nbsp;Polytechnics and the ITE and these provide them with course credits which they can use when they subsequently study there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Direct School Admission (DSA) framework has also widened the scope for students to be selected into secondary schools and post-secondary institutions.&nbsp;Ms Denise Phua said she was shocked&nbsp;&ndash; 177 advertisements on tuition. It is a competitive system.&nbsp;But what we have done is to also recognise&nbsp;other talents. We cannot stop parents from wanting their children to do better than the others. But what we can do is to recognise their abilities. For instance, in some of our IP schools today, one in two, 50% of&nbsp;students, enters through the Direct School Admission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example to bring this&nbsp;point home.&nbsp; Like Elaine Ng, she missed the PSLE cut-off for Nanyang Girls' High but entered through DSA because she was a talented&nbsp;in Chinese dance;&nbsp;she is Chinese. So far, she has done her school proud in winning gold with honours at last year&rsquo;s Singapore <p align=left>Column: 3659</p>Youth Festival, and she is now part of the school&rsquo;s Mathematics and Science talent programme. So through the DSA, we are able to recognise wider domains of talent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But beyond these systemic measures, as Members have emphasised, schools are ultimately the nurturing ground for all our educational endeavours, and I take Ms Denise Phua&rsquo;s rich suggestions. We will study them because each one does require a lot of study, but I take the point that at the ground it is the schools that impact the students positively.&nbsp; And to maximise our reach, this is the reason why&nbsp;we&nbsp;provide extra resources for all principals to tap on, to fund deserving programmes. Let me give you a feel. For each school, we give Opportunity Funds, Edusave grants and Internationalisation Funds. So just these three big ticket items.&nbsp; Taken together, this means that a typical primary school has on average an additional $170,000 per annum that they can draw and tap on&nbsp;or apply for.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;secondary school has&nbsp;an additional $300,000, and they use this to provide enrichment opportunities for all students. On top of this, primary and secondary schools can also apply for funding of up to $50,000 per year if they want to develop niche programmes in various fields.&nbsp; We do not prescribe it, they just have to justify that there is an educational component and merit to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach, school-based, where it&nbsp;incentivises the principals to reach out to the mass of students, not only a select few, is responsive as well as productive. As a result, different niches of excellence are emerging across all sectors, with teachers and school leaders at the forefront, taking ownership of innovation school-based programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, across the board, our schools now offer a broad range of curriculum offerings and opportunities to develop a global mindset&nbsp;to be exposed to different cultures.&nbsp; This was the point that <p align=left>Column: 3660</p>Mrs Josephine Teo made. Our Economic Strategies Committee recommended that we be a Global Asian Hub.&nbsp; But if we do not&nbsp;expose our students to <st1:place>Asia, to ASEAN,&nbsp;let alone Asia or both</st1:place>, how do they have their mindset, that multi-cultural orientation? Well,&nbsp;Mrs Teo will be glad to know that our schools have around 200 twinning programmes with schools in <st1:place>South-East Asia</st1:place>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. And in 2008&nbsp;&ndash; I am using 2008 figures because H1N1 struck last year and we had to clamp down on overseas travel&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;9% of primary students, 29% of secondary and one-third of JC students had a chance to go overseas; across the board, we have 500,000 students in the system.&nbsp; That is no mean feat.&nbsp;It shows that this impact is there and it will accelerate.&nbsp; And they went for school exchanges,&nbsp;international competitions, overseas community involvement stints.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked about China.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found out that&nbsp;out of&nbsp;170 primary schools, 120 primary schools on their own have twinning programmes with schools in PRC.&nbsp; This is a ground-up initiative, which&nbsp;the Ministry&nbsp;helps to fund.&nbsp; And there are exchanges of students who come down for a week or so and that learning experience from being exposed to that is wonderful.&nbsp; Many of you would have children who have gone on camps.&nbsp; My own children went to an orphanage, came back, changed&nbsp;&ndash; different outlook, more serious sometimes, but understanding where Singapore sits, the neighbours and what learning means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stretch more academically able students, we started the Integrated Programme in 2004, only six years ago.&nbsp; As&nbsp;you have read the recent \"A\" levels results, we have&nbsp;the first batch who graduated.&nbsp; The reason was that we wanted to develop more critical, inquiring and independent learning.&nbsp; We continue to monitor&nbsp;outcomes carefully and refine <p align=left>Column: 3661</p>processes along the way.&nbsp; It is good but not all good.&nbsp; From preliminary findings,&nbsp;we found out, but not surprisingly, some students actually do better with the examination structure.&nbsp; Some do very well without it; some not as good as they should without it.&nbsp; And so we are refining the process to see how we can attain our goals.&nbsp; You will remember the specialised independent schools for students with talents in Mathematics and Science, which is NUS&nbsp;High School, School of the Arts under MICA, and Sports School under MCYS.&nbsp; They are doing well and making a mark for themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its opening in 2004, the Singapore Sports School has produced four World Champions and its students have broken 46 national open records in Track and Field and Swimming.&nbsp; Students&nbsp;from NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, which started in 2005, have garnered 13 awards at international Olympiads over the past two years, including a Gold award for Chemistry.&nbsp; For those of you who are in the know,&nbsp;it is very hard to get a gold at the Olympiad&nbsp;&ndash; you compete with the best.&nbsp; The School of Arts, which&nbsp;started in 2008, has a beautiful campus&nbsp;next to Cathay.&nbsp; One wonders the distractions the children have but that is another story.&nbsp; It started in 2008, yet to see its first cohort graduate, but some of its students are already clinching places at summer programmes.&nbsp; They gave me a list&nbsp;&ndash; in prestigious institutions like the English National Ballet School,&nbsp;the School of&nbsp;the Art Institute of Chicago&nbsp;&ndash; I visited there, it has very good programmes&nbsp;&ndash; as well as the Yong Siew Toh Young Artist Programme.&nbsp; They have not graduated&nbsp;their first cohort,&nbsp;and yet their students have already received placements.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the School of Science and Technology, with its niche in applied learning and&nbsp;ICT learning, took in its first <p align=left>Column: 3662</p>batch of 198 students, and is well positioned to be a new peak of excellence in the landscape, we hope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on the other extreme, for those students who benefit from a different but&nbsp;hands-on learning style &ndash; we have Northlight School and Assumption Pathway School, which gives them a practical education.&nbsp; Many of you have visited Northlight and, in future, I hope, Assumption Pathway.&nbsp; If you have not, you do not need to be invited, just tell me when you can and you want to, it is an open invitation.&nbsp; I think you will&nbsp; be visibly moved by the passion and dedication of the principals and teachers of this group of students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried to summarise what we have done over the last decade.&nbsp; But the message is: the changes over the last decade or so have helped us re-shape our education system, to cater to a wide palette of students' interests and abilities, and to help every child reach his or her potential.&nbsp; And the positive experiences in these selected programmes and niche schools add to the offerings of our mainstream schools and strengthen our system.&nbsp; They represent the other peaks&nbsp;of excellence in&nbsp;the system.&nbsp; They provide us with learning opportunities that we can start in a discrete programme because sometimes down the line it may not work so well; and at least it does not affect the general whole.&nbsp; So, we will consolidate where necessary or refine and sharpen existing programmes. And where appropriate, we will also expand offerings in these selected programmes and more of such schools to benefit more students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Viswa Sadasivan that principals are key to the success of schools and programmes.&nbsp; Indeed, we have succeeded because there is a healthy synergy between systemic policies and ground-up initiatives.&nbsp; Let me give you one example&nbsp;&ndash; Northlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;When this was discussed,&nbsp;I remember that our <p align=left>Column: 3663</p>approach was that&nbsp;the school would&nbsp;not start if we could not get any one to volunteer to&nbsp;teach in the school.&nbsp; We did not want to post the people there.&nbsp; Yen Ching is now the Principal.&nbsp; She has more applications than places to teach in that school. To be honest, these students are difficult in a sense that they have failed the mainstream schools and many of them come with social problems, but we have no shortage of teachers.&nbsp; So when I visited them, I talked to the teachers.&nbsp; I asked them, \"Are there social problems?\" They said, \"Of course, it is to be expected.\" &nbsp;But they have evolved mechanisms to respond to these problems and they are very realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a chart of an emergency response system any time of the day, but the chart is based on where the teacher lives&nbsp;and it does not matter if the particular teacher does not know the students.&nbsp; To shorten the response time, you are activated so that that teacher can go to that student.&nbsp; They evolved these organic responses, I call it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa Sadasivan suggested engaging a professional CEO for each school&nbsp;&ndash; thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp; But I think he meant that&nbsp;the teachers do&nbsp;complain that they are overworked and they have so many administrative responsibilities, so this will free up teachers' time from \"non-core\" work.&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect the principal to be the school's CEO as well as the \"Chief Academic Officer\" and they are trained that way.&nbsp; We have the leadership track which they go on when they are vice-principals before they become principals.&nbsp; But he mentioned a good idea&nbsp;&ndash; to get the ones with experience to help new principals.&nbsp; And indeed that is what we do.&nbsp; These are called the cluster superintendents.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are experienced.&nbsp;They manage a group of principals and they allow them to share best practices.&nbsp; So rest assured that we do recognise that the principals need leadership skills; and a principal is supported by a dedicated team of <p align=left>Column: 3664</p>executive and administrative staff.&nbsp; But let us also be clear that the principal is accountable for all aspects of school life and that includes National Education, recognising the achievements of students, setting the tone.&nbsp; He is accountable; he cannot outsource his responsibility but he can get a team to help him achieve these goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have built a good education system but for the next decade, Members have said that we need to do more, and I agree.&nbsp; I have announced that it is timely for MOE schools to put more resources to develop soft skills and values.&nbsp; And this is a goal supported by as many Members that stood up to speak&nbsp;&ndash; all of you, Mrs Josephine Teo, Miss Penny Low, Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Mohamad Maliki.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min calls it \"social aptitude\"&nbsp;&ndash; the ability to speak publicly and confidently, the ability to communicate ideas well - which is vital in the new economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last April, MOE accepted the recommendations of the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee headed by Senior Minister of State Grace&nbsp;Fu, which aim to nurture every child into a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen and an active contributor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked the Clerk of Parliament to distribute this to you&nbsp;[<I>brochure on</I> \"<I>Nurturing our Young for the Future&nbsp;&ndash; Competencies for the 21st Century</I> \" <I>handed out</I> ].&nbsp; MOE has been thinking about this for some time.&nbsp; I was struck by how much alignment and resonance between this document and what Members have said.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;Members open up the brochure,&nbsp;Members will see what we call \"Competencies for a Changing World\".&nbsp; It says, simply, that we&nbsp;want to nurture each child to become a confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong&nbsp;&ndash; I think Mrs Mildred Tan talked about this&nbsp;&ndash; \"adaptable and resilient\"&nbsp;&ndash; Member&nbsp;Joscelin Yeo mentioned this&nbsp;&ndash; <p align=left>Column: 3665</p>\"knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, communicates effectively, a self-directed learner who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning\"&nbsp;&ndash; Ms Irene Ng was very passionate about that&nbsp;&ndash; \"an active contributor who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence\"&nbsp;&ndash; I think&nbsp;this is a point&nbsp;made&nbsp;by Mr Viswa Sadasivan&nbsp;that you are able to work with others and not only think&nbsp;of yourself&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and \"a concerned citizen who is rooted in Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives around him\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I can assure&nbsp;Members that the team that worked on this was not in cahoots with the MPs but Members will be struck by how much alignment there is. This was developed, in fact, by our school leaders and teachers.&nbsp; We asked the professional side of the House to tell us what we want to achieve for the next lap in education.&nbsp; They evolved this.&nbsp; We gave very little inputs, maybe some language to make it sure that it is communicated.&nbsp; They wanted this to provide a common platform for all MOE schools to anchor various efforts in developing soft skills and character.&nbsp; As many&nbsp;Members had noted, knowledge and skills must be underpinned by values.&nbsp; So they went on to develop a wheel diagram.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In MOE, we have 500,000 students in many schools, so things must be communicated easily.&nbsp; I am very glad that we did not spend a lot of money employing consultants.&nbsp; This is done in-house.&nbsp; Let me just declare that I have nothing against consultants.&nbsp; But our spending will be prudent, and I think it is a very nice chart.&nbsp; At the centre are Core Values.&nbsp; What is it that we want to <p align=left>Column: 3666</p>develop?&nbsp; They&nbsp;define a person's character.&nbsp; They shape his beliefs, attitudes and actions, and form the core of our approach towards nurturing 21st century competencies, rooted and grounded on values.&nbsp; So, whether it is communicated in English, Mandarin, Malay or Indian, it is the same philosophy&nbsp;&ndash; values.&nbsp; The middle ring signifies the social and emotional competencies&nbsp;&ndash; self-awareness, self-management, social awareness,&nbsp; relationship management with others, different sexes,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;responsible decision-making.&nbsp; The outer ring represents key competencies for a globalised world&nbsp;&ndash; civic literacy, global awareness, cross-cultural skills, critical and inventive thinking, information and communication skills.&nbsp; And then the outer aspects:&nbsp;four key traits in&nbsp;which we want to develop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Members that to do this well, a whole-school approach is required because we need every teacher or support staff to&nbsp;be aligned to this effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they need to work with parents and other community partners&nbsp;&ndash; a point which Mrs Josephine Teo rightly alluded.&nbsp; As the proverb goes&nbsp;&ndash; it takes a whole village to raise a child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members&nbsp;&ndash; Mrs Josephine Teo, Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Mohamad&nbsp;Maliki&nbsp;&ndash; have suggested that sports, CCAs, PE and&nbsp;Programme for Active Learning (PAL), in particular, are actually excellent opportunities for students to develop a range of skills.&nbsp; They asked what the KPIs are, and I think what they&nbsp;are asking is: \"Look, you teach Art, you teach PE, you teach CCA, what do you really want to achieve?\"&nbsp; And this is what we are trying to achieve:&nbsp;it is a tool, it is a platform,&nbsp;and through these activities you help the students acquire an awareness of their&nbsp;physical well-being,&nbsp;develop a sense of self-esteem, to pick up important values such as teamwork, fair play and a \"can-do\" spirit.&nbsp; I think this was a point made by Ms Joscelin Yeo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3667</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE agrees wholeheartedly with all Members and will therefore provide more time, space and resources to schools for PAM (Physical education, Art and Music programmes). PE curriculum time will be increased across primary and secondary levels.&nbsp; For Primary One and Primary Two, the increase will be half an hour, from 1.5 to two hours as it is now.&nbsp; For Primary Three to Primary Six, it will be increased from the current 1.5&nbsp;to 2.5 hours.&nbsp; At the secondary level, it will be increased from one to two hours across the levels.&nbsp; This will be done in phases, in step with the building of sports halls,&nbsp;the implementation of single-session primary schools and the recruitment of specialised teachers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mrs Teo that sports should be for everyone, not just a select few.&nbsp; And, indeed, we are working towards the mass of the students to be involved in sports competitions.&nbsp; We think it is possible.&nbsp; In Australia, of course, they have clubs because they are geographically segregated.&nbsp; We do not really need that.&nbsp; I think it is very hard to start it, but we think it is actually possible for&nbsp;MOE to run competitions at various levels,&nbsp;whether it is at the novice level, intermediate or&nbsp;advance level, so that competitions are for the masses.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mdm Cynthia Phua brought this up before and we have been working on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I completely agree, too, about&nbsp;specialisation of teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think some Members brought up the point.&nbsp; To enhance the delivery of the Art and Music curriculum, MOE has decided that all new Art and Music teachers will be trained for single-subject specialisation, ie, just one subject.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, they will focus on teaching either Music or Art, and handle Art- or Music-related CCAs and programmes.&nbsp;Existing Art and Music teachers will also move towards single-subject specialisation.&nbsp; PE teachers are currently <p align=left>Column: 3668</p>trained to teach a second subject, but are deployed mainly to teach PE. That is because some PE teachers do like this ability to be cross-deployed in subjects beyond PE which provides them with the flexibility to switch to other subjects when they lose their flexibility.&nbsp; MOE proposes to allow more flexibility in the training and deployment of PE teachers.&nbsp; In other words, it means that teachers who prefer to teach only PE and sports-related work can already do so, if this suits the needs of the schools.&nbsp; We will step up the recruitment of PE teachers in tandem with the building of infrastructure in our schools as we allow more PE curriculum time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is going to have a large impact on our recruitment.&nbsp; In view of single-subject specialisation, more PE, Art and Music teachers will obviously be needed and will be recruited. We currently have 2,500 qualified PE, Art and Music (PAM)&nbsp;teachers. We have to build up the pipeline of PE, Art and Music teachers by 2020. And we have done our calculations. We will need 80% more, nearly doubled, four-fifths more, to be mathematically precise.&nbsp; Otherwise, my students would say that I do not know my Mathematics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move will provide an attractive career option for PAM teachers and enable them to elevate the standards of these programmes in schools to achieve our educational outcomes. We are serious about this. We want them to stay within the system.&nbsp; We are providing the same three career tracks that are given to academic teachers.&nbsp; In other words, if they&nbsp;teach PE, Art and Music, they can aspire to be principals or be in&nbsp;positions&nbsp;of school leadership while those who are interested in advancing by doing research and developments can go that track and be Senior Specialists in MOE HQ.&nbsp; Those who are interested to become \"teachers of teachers\", ie, Master Teachers, can also do that.&nbsp; I have already announced that we are starting two institutions to <p align=left>Column: 3669</p>support this&nbsp;&ndash; the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) and the Singapore Teachers' Academy for the aRts (STAR). This is a professional home to ground to help them develop professionally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min asked about the KPIs for PAM programmes and Mrs Teo suggested introducing new categories in Edusave Merit Bursary awards to recognise achievements in sports, art and music.&nbsp; And she gave me a discreet number&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;1,000. Our schools have clear expectations and learning outcomes for these domains. Last year, we gave close to 7,500 awards. In short, this&nbsp;award already exists.&nbsp; It is called the EAGLES award.&nbsp; It is an Edusave award for Achievement, Good Learning&nbsp;and Service. I understand that they want it more discreet and I will look into that.&nbsp; It may be a good idea.&nbsp; But we have given this and it amounted to about $1.3 million to recognise students for their achievements in sports, art and music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to communication skills and language ability.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Ong Kian Min that the ability to communicate with clarity, impact and emotional appeal is a valuable asset.&nbsp;English is paramount because it is the <I>lingua franca</I> of the globalised world and Internet.&nbsp; And we agree that teachers are role models for the use of good English.&nbsp; We have strengthened in-service training.&nbsp; I need to be honest, we have a long way to go in terms of raising English standards.&nbsp; We are starting, we are consolidating. We need to pool much needed expertise and training resources in teaching English to bilingual learners. And as I have announced, the English Language Institute of Singapore (ELIS) will be set up. Senior Minister of State Iswaran will give further details.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min suggested encouraging more students to learn Malay as a <p align=left>Column: 3670</p>third language. MOE agrees. So far, the response from students has been positive.&nbsp; Let me give you some figures. Around 500 Secondary 1 students offer Malay as a third language, while 80 offer Bahasa Indonesia. It is a small proportion of a large base, but at least it is a start.&nbsp; Of these, 130 students are enrolled in the regional studies programme, which MOE started in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mrs Josephine Teo, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Teo Siong Seng spoke about the teaching of Chinese language. With the rise of China, we absolutely agree that it will be a valuable cachet.&nbsp; Similarly for those who speak Malay or Tamil languages as markets in Indonesia, Malaysia and India expand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable debate over the last few months and I need not repeat the arguments today. As announced, the Director-General of Education is currently leading a review of three Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs), to respond to the language home environments and educational goals.&nbsp; Mrs Teo suggested that this should be grounded on solid educational grounds and not personal experience.&nbsp; She is right. That is the way to move forward.&nbsp; The review is expected to be completed by year end.&nbsp; It will design a mother tongue curriculum structure that basically recognises the wider range of starting points.&nbsp; It recognises the starting points of students' home environment, their prior backgrounds and devise customised approaches for different groups of learners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic goal is the same.&nbsp;There is alignment here.&nbsp; We want to evolve a framework that will facilitate the learning of Mother Tongue Languages in three broad groups&nbsp;&ndash; the majority who come from English language-speaking homes, those who are are very capable and the <p align=left>Column: 3671</p>other extreme, those who face exceptional difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For those with the ability and interest to do higher mother tongue, we agree to help them to develop fluency in all these programmes. There are good avenues to do this, such as SAP schools and the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese) (BSP(C)), and the Higher Malay and Higher Tamil programmes. As I have said, if there is demand for more SAP schools, MOE will build them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the vast majority, the middle ground, the goal is the same.&nbsp; We do want our students to cultivate an interest to be able to use the language because if they do not use it, they will lose it, and we want our teaching methods to encourage students to use the language. This is the point that Mr Baey Yam Keng made so strongly. We need to engage him because he is very hip and he is able to connect, whether it is the films that he suggested&nbsp;or the pop songs.&nbsp; I think that there is traction. Kids will be excited about this.&nbsp; So, Mr Baey, if you do receive a call, you will know why.&nbsp; For those who face difficulties in learning the language, we want them to acquire competency in oral communications for daily living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from teaching&nbsp;&ndash; Members are again right&nbsp;&ndash; how we test students will shape their attitudes towards the language. Mrs Teo said, \"Look, grounded on educational grounds.\"&nbsp; We are.&nbsp; We are open-minded and indeed, we are studying various systems, from China, Cambridge and advanced placements in the United States. This is work-in-progress but let me give you one example.&nbsp; China's Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) is a proficiency test geared towards learners, not as a foreign language, but who are not immersed in the Chinese language environment.&nbsp; They are not&nbsp;immersed.&nbsp;They can hear it sometimes but it is not the total immersion.&nbsp; They adopt the philosophy of encouraging and motivating <p align=left>Column: 3672</p>more students. They treat language proficiency as a marathon, not as a sprint, encouraging each student to finish but at his own pace without being discouraged between him and the other person who finished first before him is very wide.&nbsp; And I think that is an enlightened approach.&nbsp; Consistent with this approach, HSK has multiple proficiency levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you imagine someone coming at Primary 1 who comes from an English language background versus one who comes from and is immersed&nbsp;in&nbsp;a Chinese language-speaking background, they&nbsp;have different starting points. The catch-up speed, even by Primary 6, may be very different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HSK philosophy is that, \"You may not be able to catch up but even if that gap is still wide, I want to encourage you to go even higher at the next level&nbsp;&ndash; secondary school, pre-U and even university\".&nbsp; It is an entirely different approach.&nbsp;They&nbsp;make the language accessible with great emphasis on listening/speaking skills but less on writing for the beginning levels.&nbsp; Because they believe if we help them to listen and speak, for those when they gain their proficiency, they&nbsp;then move on to writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test questions that they start with at the beginning level are contextualised. They use exactly what Mr Baey Yam Keng said, \"What do you do in a social situation? How do you respond?&nbsp; How do you respond not in a stilted&nbsp;way but in a conversational way?\"&nbsp; They start with very reachable goals&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;vocabulary book with 581 characters which forms 90% of all daily conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred and eighty-one is achievable, right?&nbsp; It is quite different from 3,000 characters.&nbsp;If they study that, 90% of the time, you can communicate with&nbsp;somebody.&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes a long way towards motivating the learner with a&nbsp;sense of achievement to acquire enough proficiency to function in several scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mrs Teo that we do not have to swing to a position where&nbsp;mother <p align=left>Column: 3673</p>tongue is taught&nbsp;as a foreign language.&nbsp; It is a not a foreign language. We do have a Mandarin-speaking environment in different segments of society and in the media. We have newspapers, radio and TV stations, pop culture in Malay, Tamil and Chinese and we need to take advantage of this environment.&nbsp; But we want to encourage the functional use of language by emphasising effective oral communication in everyday contexts and functional writing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will develop a curriculum that effectively creates the ladders and not hurdles for students to progress based on their ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will be guided to select which level of attainment they can reasonably achieve with the appropriate effort.&nbsp;If you do not achieve it in that year, you can achieve it in the next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is quite radical and it will require sometime to conceptualise and develop. For the next few years, MOE will focus on intermediate changes that will bridge us from the current curriculum to this new structure.&nbsp; Let me highlight the broad approach for Chinese language but similar changes will occur for Malay and Tamil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the primary level, MOE's approach will be to build strong foundations for Chinese language learning. We will enhance the modular approach.&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min asked for details which will be provided later.&nbsp; But we will introduce more ICT because that is the way to engage students. Their learning becomes authentic and functional.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the secondary level, we will continue with a differentiated approach. For those who excel, we will provide more opportunities for them to deepen their knowledge of Chinese culture. We will also provide more opportunities for potential and current SAP school leaders <p align=left>Column: 3674</p>to have extended attachments in leading schools and institutions in the People's Republic of China and in Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to send would-be Vice Principals and Principals to these schools, attach them there for an extended period so that they come back&nbsp;more energised and with new ideas to see how they can deepen the SAP culture.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the board, we will see greater use of ICT in the curriculum. Oracy weightings will increase by 5% to 20% across the national examinations to reflect the greater focus on the functional use of Chinese language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who would benefit from taking the CL \"B\", we will increase the access to this option.&nbsp; We want to develop a pool of CL \"B\" teachers with the right aptitude and drive to teach this group well.&nbsp; The idea is not to lower their standard, as some Members are understandably worried about - Mr Low&nbsp;Thia Khiang and Mr Teo Siong Seng have talked about that, but to make sure that the student does not get so turned off that he just does not want to use the language. Allow him to use it because a language must be used if it is to be effective. Senior Minister of State Grace&nbsp;Fu will provide more details later on the measures to help us transit to a new and more customised system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the post-secondary education sector. We are building more opportunities and peaks of excellence.&nbsp; Beyond expanding opportunities for our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), we recognise that it is increasingly a strategic asset as we move towards a knowledge and innovative-driven economy because they are new engines that power Singapore's next phase of growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we expand, we want to be careful that we do not do it at the expense of quality.&nbsp; Our prevailing benchmark is that <p align=left>Column: 3675</p>all our IHLs must strive to be the best in their class globally&nbsp;&ndash; whether you are ITE, Polytechnic or Universities&nbsp;&ndash; you have to compete globally. Because that is the best way to serve Singaporeans, ie, the certificates that they get will have a value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Polytechnics and ITE are key pillars of a typical Primary 1 cohort.&nbsp; Members may not have kept track but 42% now goes to Polytechnic. We take it that it will increase further.&nbsp; 22% goes to ITE.&nbsp;We constantly upgrade ITE.&nbsp; Some of you may have visited ITE College East at Simei.&nbsp; It has received many international visitors who are impressed with what they have done. Last year, MOE announced that ITE would consolidate its smaller campuses into&nbsp;two remaining regional campuses by 2013, and we are on track.&nbsp; ITE College West will be completed in July this year and&nbsp;College Central by the end of 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, ITE graduates have also seized opportunities to upgrade themselves. Let me give you some figures.&nbsp; In 1995, only 12% of ITE graduates moved on to polytechnics. It is now 19%.&nbsp; In fact, among the Higher Nitec graduates, 37% subsequently did well enough to directly enter the Polytechnics.&nbsp; That is a very high percentage&nbsp;for students from a vocational institute to articulate to our Polytechnics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2015, we expect 45% of a Primary 1 cohort to access polytechnic education.&nbsp;We have to keep pace with this growing demand.&nbsp; MOE has decided to invest up to $1 billion to increase capacity in the five Polytechnics by 20% over the next four years.&nbsp; We are going to increase the capacity in our Polytechnics by 20%. We will need $1 billion and Senior Minister of&nbsp;State Iswaran will provide more details.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, MOE announced that the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) <p align=left>Column: 3676</p>and our polytechnics would work with selected overseas universities to start programmes in 2011&nbsp;&ndash; next year.&nbsp; It will offer to Polytechnic graduates a wide array of reputable universities to choose from right here in Singapore.&nbsp; Now, I mentioned that we will start next year, I am happy to report to the House that we have made good progress on this major effort, and as a result can start these degree programmes ahead of time.&nbsp; SIT and our polytechnics will launch&nbsp;eight new degree programmes with&nbsp;five&nbsp;overseas universities this year, so students can start this year, admissions will start tomorrow.&nbsp; These&nbsp;five overseas universities are leading institutions who are global leaders in their respective fields. &nbsp;Some of you may know it.&nbsp; The Technical University of Munich for electrical engineering and information technology, the Newcastle University for naval architecture, offshore and marine engineering, the Digipen Institute of Technology, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for Hotel Administration, and Culinary Institute of America.&nbsp; These are brand names. These leading partners will add value and recognition to our Polytechnic diplomas as they provide advanced standing for our Polytechnic graduates, because our Polytechnic graduates will be able to obtain degrees&nbsp;&ndash; they do not have spend three or four years, they will get their degrees in two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;These institutions will&nbsp;give them their advanced stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, these programmes will add some 500 additional university places for 2010. &nbsp;In steady state, SIT will offer places for 2,000 full-time students by 2015. &nbsp;MOE will provide subsidies for these students and Senior Minister of State&nbsp;Iswaran will&nbsp;give details on fees and subsidies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undergraduate intake will be 15,300 places this academic year, more than the number last year even though the size of <p align=left>Column: 3677</p>this year's cohort is smaller, it is about 26% of the cohort.&nbsp; With SIT and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), we are on track to achieve our target cohort participation rate of 30% by 2015.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) will add to the dynamism of the university sector. Members will know that this is done in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Zhejiang University &ndash; it brings together the best of&nbsp;East and West.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SUTD represents another response to meet high expectations of Singaporeans students and parents. We all celebrate when more students do&nbsp;well in their A-level examinations as they have done in this recent A-levels.&nbsp; But as more and more do well, we also have a problem&nbsp;&ndash; a good one, but nonetheless&nbsp;still a challenge. Our top performance students are targeted by leading foreign universities. &nbsp;Ms Denise Phua may have seen&nbsp;the advertisements too.&nbsp; Top universities from UK and US come to Singapore and even offer fully funded&nbsp;sponsorships to our top students. Countries have recognised that those who win this \"war for talent\" will have a strategic advantage over others. The US is a prime example who creams from the&nbsp;world's best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our universities must compete in the race to attract top talent if they are not to be relegated to \"second division\"&nbsp;&ndash; using the football parlance.&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS, NTU and SMU have done well.&nbsp; NUS ranks fourth within Asia, NTU ranks 13th&nbsp;&ndash; and 30th and 77th globally respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; SMU, a respectable business and management university, ranks third in Asia in the 2009.&nbsp; But to stay in the first division, strategic partnerships count, and this is why NUS tied up with Duke University for the <p align=left>Column: 3678</p>medical school, and Peabody Institute&nbsp;for the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;NTU has partnerships with Imperial College and Carnegie Mellon for a number of post-graduate programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the rationale for SUTD to team up with MIT and Zhejiang University, but such research-intensive Universities are expensive because, basically, there is a strong demand for top faculty to move your university up the ranking and Universities are willing to pay&nbsp;top dollar&nbsp;to get these faculties.&nbsp; The Government recognises that it must build leading institutions to provide our brightest Singaporeans an education here that can match that of other leading Universities elsewhere. &nbsp;However, it would only be fair for such benefiting students to bear a fair share of the costs. &nbsp;This is because they would have received much heavier subsidies than other students.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For SUTD, we want to move towards a funding model that is more equitable, that reflects the higher cost borne by public funds to educate its students. Normally, for universities, we seek to recover 25% of cost&nbsp;from fees.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;Government subsidises 75%.&nbsp; This applies to the SIT courses we have&nbsp;just announced and other courses in existing Universities. &nbsp;But similar to more specialised courses&nbsp;like Medicine, Dentistry and Music, the total cost of SUTD can be up to two&nbsp;to three times that of other traditional courses.&nbsp; Students&nbsp;in SUTD can expect to receive much higher subsidies of nearly $50,000 per annum, sometimes over this amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;For SUTD, it is appropriate that we aim for a higher cost recovery ratio than 25%.&nbsp; Now, I am announcing this to set the principle before we take our first intake, so that the public, the students and parents can understand the rationale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;fact, for SUTD, we want to move towards a funding model, based more on endowments, scholarships and grants <p align=left>Column: 3679</p>because this is a more equitable model for higher education, and is practised by leading private Universities in the US. &nbsp;In that model, students who will be the prime beneficiaries after graduating from the prestigious Universities, because they benefit from the higher pay and successful careers, are asked to pay much higher fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT charges roughly S$53,000 per year for its students.&nbsp; Philanthrophists who believe in education and successful alumni lend their support to maintain their university's standing by contributing to its endowment, and&nbsp;this creates a virtuous cycle.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are setting the principle and the&nbsp;model for funding to be higher than the 25% cost-recovery ratio (CRR). But for the first few batches of students at SUTD, who will be in the interim campus, we will not aim to achieve&nbsp;this more&nbsp;than 25% cost-recovery ration. The fees will be set around $11,000 per academic year&nbsp;and this is only about 17% of the cost-recovery.&nbsp; Once facilities are built up, students would be expected to bear their fair share and fees will go up to attain the higher target cost-recovery ratio.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we will still maintain our standing that no student who can benefit from an education will be denied that opportunity due to lack of means. And they will have access to the various grants that we now give to universities and a Singaporean student can obtain up to 100% funding for his tuition fees and living expenses through a combination of loans and bursaries.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for all and a range of peaks that match the abilities of our students&nbsp;&ndash; these are our guiding lights. I have&nbsp;given a panoramic view and Members have asked whether we should fund our outcomes instead of by levels.&nbsp; Let me say that when it comes to spending on education,&nbsp;spending more does not always guarantee better <p align=left>Column: 3680</p>outcomes.&nbsp; As a percentage of GDP, countries like the US spend more on education compared to the OECD average, but do not fare as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should look at outcomes as well as how we spend our dollars.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past decade, MOE has consistently been spending on average of 3.5% of GDP to raise the quality of education.&nbsp; During this 10-year period, our budget has increased by 45%, from $6 billion in FY2000 to $8.7 billion in the current fiscal year.&nbsp; Our share of total Government expenditure has remained fairly constant at around one-fifth, significantly higher than countries such as Korea which spends about 15%, Japan &ndash;10%, UK&nbsp;&ndash; 12% and the US&nbsp;&ndash; 15%. &nbsp;We have spent judiciously, to invest in providing more opportunities for students across all levels.&nbsp; Each year, about 50% of the budget is invested in the school sector, 41% in post-secondary education&nbsp;sector and the remainder in HQ and its statutory boards.&nbsp; This is roughly the mix in most other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are&nbsp;other sectors we would like to talk about &ndash; the pre-school education and special education needs.&nbsp; Senior Minister of State Fu and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Masagos&nbsp;will speak on these areas later.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the heart of the process are our people.&nbsp;&nbsp; And she talked about Finland teachers.&nbsp; I visited Finland three times just to learn from them.&nbsp; I sit down in their classrooms,&nbsp;spend time just seeing what they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have invested good teachers but we can always do better.&nbsp; We have since 2000 increased from 24,000 teachers to 30,000 teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving towards all-graduate recruitment by year 2015.&nbsp; A new career track was announced last year, the&nbsp;Allied Educators.&nbsp; We&nbsp;were able to recruit 1,217 Allied Educators and by 2015 we will double that number.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3681</p>Assoc. Prof. Paulin Straughan had asked that we reduce the class size.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio which is now 19.6 at the primary level and 16.9 at the secondary level.&nbsp;&nbsp;We leave it to the&nbsp;schools to see how they are deployed because&nbsp;that gives them the flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goals for the next decade will require new engines and we will build&nbsp;the Singapore Teachers Centre to anchor their professional development.&nbsp; We want to strengthen the quality of PE, Art and Music Education.&nbsp; I have mentioned Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) and the Singapore Teachers' Academy for the aRts (STAR).&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;Mother Tongue Languages, we have the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL), the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC)&nbsp;and the Malay Language Centre of Singapore, to cater to professional development needs of our Malay Language teachers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to put new infrastructure in place&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as Indoor Sports Halls&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and we have designed these facilities so that usage can be optimised for our primary schools&nbsp;because all of them will&nbsp;move to single session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect our budget to increase to $11 billion&nbsp;over the next few years, with a very important caveat &ndash; if our economy continues to grow as planned.&nbsp; For those who do not understand that relationship between an economy that needs to grow for us to be able to spend dollars on education and&nbsp;defence, let me say that this caveat is all important.&nbsp;If we continue to grow, we can continue to invest in our education.&nbsp; And if we can do that, we can invest these resources&nbsp;to build up more peaks of excellence in the school landscape and tertiary sector, then I think <p align=left>Column: 3682</p>that we would have achieved a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we judge what we have achieved?&nbsp; Members have talked about that.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
