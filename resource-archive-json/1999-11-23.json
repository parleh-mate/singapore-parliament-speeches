Question No. 1, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar)</b>\r\n\r\n<b>(for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am not\r\n\r\nmistaken,  the  Member  had filed  the  Question  before  the\r\n\r\nofficial visit of the Indonesian President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  since then the Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong  has  set\r\n\r\nout  Singapore's  views  on  the  subject  quite  fully  when\r\n\r\nPresident  Abdurrahman  Wahid  made  his  official  visit  to\r\n\r\nSingapore on 6thNovember 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is one of our closest neighbours and a major\r\n\r\ntrading  partner.   We  would like to see  a  prosperous  and\r\n\r\nstable  Indonesia.  We are ready to work  with  Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  its  economic recovery.   Singapore  is  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  and  our contribution can only be modest.   However,\r\n\r\nSingapore can play a catalytic role to help restore  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence through practical measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our existing cooperation platforms can be leveraged to\r\n\r\nhelp   Indonesia  achieve  early  results  in  bringing  back\r\n\r\ninvestor confidence. In particular, we can focus on the  Riau\r\n\r\ncooperation  projects,  which  are  symbols  of   the   close\r\n\r\nbilateral cooperation between Indonesia and Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nprojects  have  withstood  the  regional  crisis.  But  their\r\n\r\npotential  has not been fully realised.  We can  explore  how\r\n\r\nthe  Riau  cooperation projects can be  further  expanded  to\r\n\r\nbring  in  more foreign investments into the Riau  islands  - Batam,  Bintan  and Karimun. This would have a  demonstrative\r\n\r\neffect  on international investor confidence for the rest  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Abdurrahman Wahid disclosed in Singapore that\r\n\r\nIndonesia  was thinking of turning Batam into  a  Free  Trade\r\n\r\nZone (FTZ).   We believe this is a good idea. Batam will then\r\n\r\nbe  on  par with Singapore because Singapore is also  a  free\r\n\r\ntrade  zone.  This  will increase Batam's attractiveness  for\r\n\r\nforeign  investments and create more employment opportunities\r\n\r\nfor Indonesians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can also work with Indonesia to intensify\r\n\r\ntourism   cooperation.  Indonesia's  tourism   potential   is\r\n\r\nenormous  and we are prepared to work with Indonesia  to  re-launch the Indonesia-Singapore Tourism Cooperation programme.\r\n\r\nApart  from  bringing in foreign exchange and creating  jobs,\r\n\r\nthere  will also be positive spin-offs for the other  sectors\r\n\r\nand industries in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, we will have close consultations\r\n\r\nwith the Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment on these ideas.  Prime Minister Goh has  announced\r\n\r\nthat he will lead a business delegation to Indonesia sometime\r\n\r\nearly  next  year.   To  lay  the groundwork  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  visit, Mr Philip Yeo, Chairman EDB, will  lead  a\r\n\r\ndelegation of senior officials to Jakarta at the end of  this\r\n\r\nmonth to hold discussions with the Indonesian authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to find out whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  possibility of setting up a Singapore-Indonesia\r\n\r\nBusiness  Council,  as  we have done for  bilateral  business\r\n\r\nrelationships with other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I would not like at this stage to\r\n\r\nanticipate too much and try to predict the various  outcomes.\r\n\r\nLet us wait for the mission to be led by Mr Philip Yeo to  go\r\n\r\nand  assess the situation.  This was the first meeting at the\r\n\r\nHeads  of Government level with the new President.  The  key,\r\n\r\nas  we  have  said in many statements issued, is  really  the\r\n\r\nrestoration of investor confidence, stability and to  restore\r\n\r\nthe linkages between the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of what kind of mechanism, whether Business\r\n\r\nCouncil  or otherwise, of course can be explored if and  when\r\n\r\nthis  question arises later.  But at the moment I  think  the\r\n\r\narea  that we have pinpointed, such as restoring of stability\r\n\r\nand  investor  confidence, is the  key.   The  form  and  the\r\n\r\ninstrument may be looked at later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the\r\n\r\nMinister   update   the   House  on  the  Singapore-Indonesia\r\n\r\nBilateral  Trade Finance Guarantee (BTFG) scheme proposed  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1998 to help restore established trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I think the Member would have\r\n\r\nread  that  this  proposal has not  been  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  because the conditions and safeguards  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  proposed were, in their view, not agreeable.

But if his question is that this  is\r\n\r\na  good  window of opportunity during which to work with  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government  to  improve  bilateral  and  economic\r\n\r\nrelations,  the answer is, as we have said, yes  because  the\r\n\r\nnew government is, in our view, the best possible team in the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  They have both legitimacy and moral authority\r\n\r\nand during the discussions that took place here as well as in\r\n\r\nthe  press  conference, President Abdurrahman Wahid  made  it\r\n\r\nclear that he is intent on restoring investor confidence  and\r\n\r\nbringing about stability in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

In  particular, it asked for assurance  that  the\r\n\r\nstaggered  crediting of CLOB shares would not be  detrimental\r\n\r\nto  the Malaysian stock market.  KLSE wrote to SES twice,  on\r\n\r\n15th  July and 5th August.  SES responded with relevant  data\r\n\r\nand  calculations  demonstrating that  the  resulting  impact\r\n\r\nshould  be  minimal.  SES replied to KLSE's first  letter  on\r\n\r\n23rd July, and KLSE's latest queries by 3rd September.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been no further response from the KLSE since then.   SES\r\n\r\nsent a reminder to KLSE on 15th November 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that SES' proposal is reasonable and\r\n\r\naddresses  Malaysia's concern of volatility on  the  KLSE  if\r\n\r\nCLOB  shares were to be released all at once.

Under the new regulations,\r\n\r\nonly  operators registered with the Ministry are  allowed  to\r\n\r\noperate  mobile  cranes  and  tower  cranes.   The  Factories\r\n\r\n(Operation of Cranes) Regulations prescribe safety rules that\r\n\r\nthese  operators  must follow.  Their registration  would  be\r\n\r\nsuspended or cancelled if they are found not to have complied\r\n\r\nwith  these  rules.  The Regulations also  require  that  all\r\n\r\nlifting operations using mobile or tower cranes be supervised\r\n\r\nby  competent lifting supervisors who must have  completed  a\r\n\r\ncourse of training on lifting supervision.  Other than these,\r\n\r\nthe   Regulations   also   specify  that   installation   and\r\n\r\ndismantling  of  a  mobile or a tower crane,  or  any  repair\r\n\r\naffecting  the structural integrity of such crane be  carried\r\n\r\nout  only  by  approved  contractors.

My Ministry viewed\r\n\r\nthis case seriously as such an accident could take disastrous\r\n\r\nproportions.  Contractors involved in the construction of the\r\n\r\nNorth-East  MRT  lines  are reminded that  because  of  their\r\n\r\nproximity  to  public thoroughfare, they need to  take  extra\r\n\r\nprecautions when conducting lifting operations.

A standardised\r\n\r\npermit-to-lift  system  is currently being  studied  and,  if\r\n\r\nfound  feasible,  will  be introduced to  these  contractors.\r\n\r\nUnder  the system, all lifting operations can only be carried\r\n\r\nout after a written permit for the lift has been endorsed  by\r\n\r\nthe  lifting  supervisor.  Before endorsing such permit,  the\r\n\r\nsupervisor is expected to check thoroughly the suitability of\r\n\r\nthe crane for the lift, the ground\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   environmental  conditions,  the  qualification  of  the\r\n\r\noperator,  the rigging of the load and so on.

Only after  these  checks\r\n\r\nhave been made can the lifting operation commence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure compliance with the safety requirements\r\n\r\nin  lifting operations, the Ministry will continue to conduct\r\n\r\nspecial enforcement exercises targeted at premises which  use\r\n\r\ncranes.

The GPC had noted that the\r\n\r\nCOE quota for the small cars was becoming too small, and that\r\n\r\na  separate  COE  quota for small cars  did  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nresult in lower COE premiums for small cars compared to other\r\n\r\nCOE categories. In fact, Category 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremiums had at times been similar to or more than Category 2\r\n\r\npremiums.   It therefore recommended the merger of  the  COEs\r\n\r\nfor  small  and medium sized cars to form a larger  quota  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  more stable COE prices. At the same  time,  car\r\n\r\nbuyers  will  have greater flexibility in deciding  on  their\r\n\r\nchoice  of  car models if the COE category covers  a  broader\r\n\r\nrange of cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC is correct. Merging Category 1 and Category 2\r\n\r\ninto  Category  A  would  result in a more  efficient  market\r\n\r\nwithout necessarily raising the COE premiums for small  cars.\r\n\r\nA  car buyer with a Category A COE will have a greater choice\r\n\r\nof  car models to choose from. He may decide to buy a smaller\r\n\r\ncar  or  a  bigger one, according to his budget. To  cite  an\r\n\r\nexample,  in  1998  during the economic  downturn,  many  car\r\n\r\nbuyers,  having an Open Category COE, decided to buy a  small\r\n\r\nor  medium  sized  car - 41% used the Open  COE  to  register\r\n\r\nCategory  1 and Category 2 cars, instead of large and  luxury\r\n\r\ncars.  This is the advantage of collapsing COE categories, as\r\n\r\ncar buyers benefit from having a wider choice over how to use\r\n\r\ntheir COEs to purchase cars according to their affordability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, COE premiums are dependent on the demand\r\n\r\nfor  cars.  This in turn depends on the state of the  economy\r\n\r\nand  expectations of future growth. The economic recovery and\r\n\r\nlower  financing costs have helped to increase the purchasing\r\n\r\npower  of consumers, and this has led to a higher demand  for\r\n\r\ncars. This has resulted in a rise in COE prices, despite  the\r\n\r\n58%  increase  in the number of COEs from last year  to  this\r\n\r\nyear.  With the recent economic recovery, COE for this  month\r\n\r\nhas  bunched  around $43,000 and $44,000 for the Category  A,\r\n\r\nCategory  B  and the Open Category, despite the existence  of\r\n\r\nthe different categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> By the Minister's argument, there seems\r\n\r\nto  be a compelling case to collapse both categories of  cars\r\n\r\nfrom A and B to even one single category.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, there is no plan at the\r\n\r\nmoment to do that, but if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member  feels  that we should do it,  let  him  write  a\r\n\r\nproposal to the Ministry and we will consider it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I mentioned\r\n\r\nduring the Budget discussion that I support a single category\r\n\r\nfor all cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> All right, we will take that\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the next time when we review the  Vehicle\r\n\r\nQuota System.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

And  how does that  compare  with  the\r\n\r\nallocation under Category 1 previously?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The Member has asked for some\r\n\r\nfigures.   As  far  as  I  know, the  number  of  small  cars\r\n\r\nregistered  has dropped.  This was because of the competition\r\n\r\nbetween the small car dealers and the big car dealers.   That\r\n\r\nis  why the new policy is correct.  Under the old policy, the\r\n\r\nsmall  car dealers were in a way protected.  With this change\r\n\r\nin  policy,  I  have  received feedback from  the  small  car\r\n\r\ndealers  that  they now have to compete with  the  big  cars,\r\n\r\nbecause the big cars are not necessarily more expensive  than\r\n\r\nsmall  cars.  In fact, data have shown that some of  the  big\r\n\r\ncars  are  cheaper than the small cars.  Because  of  greater\r\n\r\ncompetition,  I think the motorists benefit.  To  answer  the\r\n\r\nMember's  question,  there is, in fact, a  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  small cars but that is due  to  the  keener\r\n\r\ncompetition between the dealers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

So if the small car suppliers and manufacturers\r\n\r\ncan  come  out with better and cheaper cars, I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nbuyer will take a close look.  As for energy conservation,  I\r\n\r\ndo not think that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  problem because nowadays cars are very efficient  and  the\r\n\r\ndifference is not much between the small cars and those above\r\n\r\n1,000 cc.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> If I understand the Minister correctly, he\r\n\r\nis  saying  that  the  number of small  cars  registered  has\r\n\r\ndeclined because of the inability of the small car dealers to\r\n\r\ncompete  but, on average, if competition is on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nprice, then one would argue that that should not be the case.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister elaborate what in practice,  other  than\r\n\r\nprice,  have  affected the ability of small  car  dealers  to\r\n\r\ncompete in the sale of cars in the market?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Of course, price is definitely a\r\n\r\nfactor, besides the value that they perceive that they  would\r\n\r\nget.   What I am saying is that the buyers now have a greater\r\n\r\nchoice.   In  the past, when he was eyeing for a  Category  2\r\n\r\ncar, and if he could not get the COE, either he brings up his\r\n\r\npremium  or if he does not want to bring up his premium,  but\r\n\r\nhe  still  wants to own a car, he would be forced  to  go  to\r\n\r\nCategory 1 to bid for the COE and buy a small car.  With  the\r\n\r\nmerger, this restriction is no longer there.  It is up to the\r\n\r\nindividual.  He can still buy a small car if he wants to.  Or\r\n\r\nif  he  feels that he can pay a few more dollars  and  buy  a\r\n\r\nbigger car, and he feels that gives him greater value, so  be\r\n\r\nit.   So  my point is that the merger removes this artificial\r\n\r\nrestriction  and allows the market to decide what  cars  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  buy.   From experience, as far as COE premiums  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, we do not think that because of the merger,  small\r\n\r\ncars  will  have  to  pay  a  significantly  higher  premium.\r\n\r\nBasically, if I want to buy a small car, I could bid for  the\r\n\r\nCOE  and buy a small car without much increase in price.

As I said, between the old and new system,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  there is much difference  between  the  COE\r\n\r\npremium for small cars if we had not merged.

Some banks and finance  companies  which\r\n\r\nhave related insurance companies package their mortgage loans\r\n\r\nwith  a  built-in fire insurance component provided by  these\r\n\r\nrelated  insurers.  As a marketing incentive, these  packages\r\n\r\noften  include free insurance coverage for the first  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  years of the loan period.  The banks find that using the\r\n\r\nsame  related insurance company is a convenient way for  them\r\n\r\nto  monitor  the  adequacy and continuity  of  the  insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for mortgage loans is a competitive one, with\r\n\r\nmany  participants.   Consumers  can  choose  which  bank  or\r\n\r\nfinance company to borrow from, based on the overall terms of\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage loans on offer, and the quality of the service.\r\n\r\nIf they are not satisfied with the insurance coverage bundled\r\n\r\nwith  the  loan, they can instead borrow from other  lenders,\r\n\r\nincluding those with no related insurance companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable for consumers to have the flexibility to\r\n\r\nchoose an alternative insurer when they contract a loan,  and\r\n\r\nforgo the benefits offered had they chosen a bank's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated insurer.

Most  banks\r\n\r\nrequire customers to seek their approval for this, to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  terms and standing of the alternative insurer  are\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   However,  approvals are  not  always  granted\r\n\r\nreadily,  and the terms and conditions under which  consumers\r\n\r\ncan switch insurers are often not clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will therefore ask the relevant industry bodies,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Association of Banks in Singapore, the  Finance\r\n\r\nHouses  Association of Singapore, and the  General  Insurance\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore, to review the present arrangements,\r\n\r\nand  if  necessary,  develop practice  guidelines.   The  aim\r\n\r\nshould  be to preserve consumers' freedom to choose insurers,\r\n\r\nand  set out fair and transparent terms under which consumers\r\n\r\ncan  switch to alternative insurers.  At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nguidelines  should  enable  banks  to  cross-sell   insurance\r\n\r\nproducts  efficiently, and ensure that their  mortgage  loans\r\n\r\nhave adequate insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STORED-VALUE CARDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Expiry date and refund of monies)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

These  cards\r\n\r\ncan  be  broadly categorised as single purpose  stored  value\r\n\r\ncards  or  multi-purpose stored value  cards.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nuniform practice with regard to the validity period of  these\r\n\r\ncards or the treatment of unused\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbalances.  The decision to impose an expiry life on cards  is\r\n\r\nbased  entirely  on commercial and practical  considerations,\r\n\r\nfor  example  the  physical wear and tear or obsolescence  of\r\n\r\nthese  cards.  For security reasons, stored value cards  such\r\n\r\nas  those  embedded  with smart chips are typically  designed\r\n\r\nwith  a  definite  life  span.  This  is  because  access  to\r\n\r\n\"electronic   purses\"  on  these  cards  is   controlled   by\r\n\r\ncryptographic  keys  which, through  time  and  technological\r\n\r\nadvancement, may be duplicated, compromising the security  of\r\n\r\nthe  smart  card.   Limiting the duration  of  a  card's  use\r\n\r\nreduces  the  possibility  of a security  breach.   In  these\r\n\r\nrespects, stored value cards are similar to prepaid  vouchers\r\n\r\nwith validity periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current legislative framework, MAS has\r\n\r\nresponsibility  over  the  issuance of  multi-purpose  stored\r\n\r\nvalue cards (for example, the popular CashCards), but not for\r\n\r\nsingle purpose stored value cards.  MAS views monetary values\r\n\r\nin  these  pre-paid stored value cards or any unused balances\r\n\r\non  these  cards  no  different from deposits.   MAS  expects\r\n\r\nissuers  to make every effort to identify and repay  deposits\r\n\r\nof  the  card  or account holder.  Although expiry  of  these\r\n\r\nCashCards  effectively  means that they  will  no  longer  be\r\n\r\naccepted  at  points-of-sale,  in  other  words,  cardholders\r\n\r\ncannot   effect  purchases  using  the  stored  value  cards,\r\n\r\ncardholders can nevertheless redeem unused balances on  their\r\n\r\nexpired CashCards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the treatment of single-purpose\r\n\r\nstored value cards such as TransitLink farecards is based  on\r\n\r\ncommercial considerations and differs among the various  card\r\n\r\nissuers.   The  Ministry  of Communications  and  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology is aware that consumers have raised various issues\r\n\r\nconcerning TransitLink farecards, and is looking into them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The  mood\r\n\r\nwas  heavy.  The region was in turmoil, and global  financial\r\n\r\nmarkets  were  nervous.  Retrenchments were  rising,  and  we\r\n\r\nbraced ourselves for severe turbulence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $10.5 billion package was a decisive move to reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness costs, build confidence, and help companies to  tide\r\n\r\nover the very difficult period.  It included significant wage\r\n\r\nand CPF cuts, and enjoyed the full support of the Government,\r\n\r\nworkers   and  employers.   Our  response  demonstrated   our\r\n\r\ndetermination to ride out the storm, and bolstered confidence\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a year later, the mood has totally changed. Things\r\n\r\nhave  turned  out  much better than we  feared.   Except  for\r\n\r\nIndonesia's problems with Aceh, the worst of the Asian crisis\r\n\r\nis  behind  us.   Throughout the region exchange  rates  have\r\n\r\nfirmed, interest rates have come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown,  confidence has returned, and growth is resuming.   Our\r\n\r\nown  economy  has  picked up sharply, boosted  by  our  cost-cutting measures and the regional recovery.  We expect  about\r\n\r\n5% growth this year, and between 4.5% and 6.5% next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge now is to manage the recovery, to restore\r\n\r\nthe economy to full health without mishap.  Growth has become\r\n\r\nbroader  based  and unemployment is down.   But  the  economy\r\n\r\nstill  has some weak patches.  We must be especially  careful\r\n\r\nwith the manufacturing sector, as several industries continue\r\n\r\nto  face  severe  cost pressure, including  disk  drives  and\r\n\r\npetroleum  refining.   At  the same  time,  restructuring  is\r\n\r\ncontinuing,  and is causing a steady stream of retrenchments.\r\n\r\nWe  must  redouble  efforts to help these retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nfind new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these developments, the Government has\r\n\r\nreviewed  its economic stance, and particularly the  measures\r\n\r\nin  last  year's  cost reduction package.  In  general,  last\r\n\r\nyear's  package  will  continue as committed.   However,  the\r\n\r\ntightening  labour  market has made  it  necessary  to  bring\r\n\r\nforward  the restoration of employer CPF contribution  rates.\r\n\r\nThe improved economic outlook also justifies a higher quantum\r\n\r\nof  year-end  bonus for civil servants, and a restoration  of\r\n\r\nthe  wage cuts imposed on civil servants.  We need to  adjust\r\n\r\nthe  Skills Development Levy, as skills upgrading is critical\r\n\r\nto  keeping  workers employable.  In key  areas  of  business\r\n\r\ncosts,  namely, industrial land rentals and port and  airport\r\n\r\ndues, we will extend the rebates for an additional year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the CPF. The Government has explained\r\n\r\nthe need to bring forward the restoration of CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrates  to  next year, instead of 2001 as originally  planned.\r\n\r\nThe  labour market is tightening.  And unless we do this, the\r\n\r\nCPF  reduction  will  simply  be  converted  to  higher  wage\r\n\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this will make it harder to restore the CPF contributions\r\n\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer's CPF contribution rate will therefore be\r\n\r\nincreased  by 2% points to 12%, with effect from April  2000.\r\n\r\nThis  2%  point restoration will be allocated  fully  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention is to restore employer's CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  fully to 20%, the rate which prevailed  before\r\n\r\nthe cut.  The reduction to 10% last year was a temporary move\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  an immediate crisis.  It did not  affect  the\r\n\r\ndesired  long-term contribution rate of 20% plus  20%,  which\r\n\r\nhad  been  calculated to provide enough savings for  workers'\r\n\r\nhealth care and old age needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the CPF rate will be done as soon as\r\n\r\npossible at a pace which the economy can bear.  If conditions\r\n\r\nare  favourable, we should be able to restore it fully within\r\n\r\nabout  five  years.  Our priority will be  to  build  up  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account first, as this is the absolute minimum  nest\r\n\r\negg which all Singaporeans should have when they retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civil Service NWC Award</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the civil service. With the recovery in the\r\n\r\neconomy,  the Government has decided to increase the  quantum\r\n\r\nof year-end bonus to civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, civil servants received a total of 3/4 month\r\n\r\nof AVC (Annual Variable Component): 1/2 month in July and 1/4\r\n\r\nmonth in December.  And this was 1 1/4 month less than the two-month worth of AVC which they had been paid in 1997, the year\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Government has already paid 1/2 month of\r\n\r\nAVC  in  July.   In December, the Government will  pay  civil\r\n\r\nservants another 1/2 month of AVC.  This makes a total of one\r\n\r\nmonth  of  AVC for the year as a whole, 1/4 month  more  than\r\n\r\nlast  year.  The Government will, as usual, also pay the  one\r\n\r\nmonth of Annual Wage Supplement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, because the economic outlook has improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly since the NWC recommendations were published\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  May,  the  Government will pay civil servants  a  one-off\r\n\r\nSpecial Bonus of 1/4 month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the AVC and Special Bonus together, civil\r\n\r\nservants will receive 11/4 months this year, still less  than\r\n\r\nthe  two  months of AVC which they were receiving before  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, the civil service is studying ways\r\n\r\nto  link  pay  more closely to performance.  If  the  economy\r\n\r\nremains strong next year, and there is an NWC award for civil\r\n\r\nservants, I stress \"if\", the Government will use part or  all\r\n\r\nof this to begin to build up a performance-based annual bonus\r\n\r\nfor  all  civil servants.  Concurrently, the Government  also\r\n\r\nintends  to  continue to build up the AVC  in  future  years,\r\n\r\nwhenever  economic performance justifies it.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  discuss  the implementation of these changes  with  the\r\n\r\nunions in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restoration of Cuts/Freeze in Civil Service Salaries</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of last year's package, the Government took the\r\n\r\nlead  in  implementing  wage  cuts  for  civil  servants  and\r\n\r\npolitical  appointments.  Monthly salaries  of  Staff  Grade,\r\n\r\nSuperscale, Division I and Division II officers were  cut  by\r\n\r\n5%, 3%, 2% and 1% points respectively on 1st January 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will fully restore these wage cuts with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st January 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the wage cuts, the salaries of Ministers and\r\n\r\nsenior  civil servants, which are normally pegged to  private\r\n\r\nsector earnings, were frozen in 1998 and 1999.  However,  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector benchmark increased by 13% in 1998 and 29%  in\r\n\r\n1999, based on private sector earnings two years earlier,  in\r\n\r\nother  words,  earnings in 1996 and 1997  respectively.   The\r\n\r\nfigures  for next year's benchmark are not yet complete,  but\r\n\r\nIRAS  estimates that it has increased further,  because  some\r\n\r\npartnerships  and  companies continued to do  well  in  1998,\r\n\r\ndespite the economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the economy is recovering, we must restore the\r\n\r\nproper relativity between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  and public sector salaries.  This is crucial  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to  retain  and  attract talent, and maintain  the  high\r\n\r\nquality of our public service and Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Service Division is currently reviewing the\r\n\r\nsalary  formula for Ministers and senior civil  servants  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  1994 White Paper on \"Competitive  Salaries  for\r\n\r\nCompetent and Honest Government\".  The White Paper had called\r\n\r\nfor such a review after five years.  PSD's conclusion is that\r\n\r\nthe  basic  framework  is sound, and  the  salary  benchmarks\r\n\r\nselected  are  appropriate.   However,  we  can  refine   the\r\n\r\nmethodology  for calculating the benchmarks and  shorten  the\r\n\r\ndelay  in  applying the benchmarks to the public sector.   We\r\n\r\nalso  need to review the structure of civil service  salaries\r\n\r\nto  create  more  flexibility, and  increase  the  weight  of\r\n\r\nperformance bonuses in the total salary package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD is still working out the details. The review should\r\n\r\nbe  completed  and the changes announced and  implemented  by\r\n\r\nearly next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Private Sector Salaries</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to civil service salaries and\r\n\r\nbonuses is consistent with the NWC recommendations.  In  May,\r\n\r\nthe  NWC  had  recommended continued  wage  restraint,  while\r\n\r\nproviding companies that perform well greater flexibility  to\r\n\r\nreward  their  workers.   The NWC set  guidelines  for  these\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  reward  workers  through  bonuses   or   wage\r\n\r\nincreases,  preferably  in the form  of  a  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.  Because of the economic recovery, more  companies\r\n\r\nwill  now  fall into this category (ie, companies  which  are\r\n\r\ndoing well) but the NWC guidelines for how they should reward\r\n\r\nworkers remain valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Skills Development Levy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and retraining is vital to keep our workers\r\n\r\nemployable,  and  to  enable us  to  compete  globally  as  a\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy.   Singaporeans must  continually  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills and embrace life-long learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund (SDF) has been effective in\r\n\r\nencouraging employers to invest in worker training and skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.    Set  up  in  1979,  the  SDF  is  funded   from\r\n\r\ncollections in the Skills Development Levy (SDL) on employers\r\n\r\nfor workers below a monthly salary of $1,000.  Today, the SDF\r\n\r\nsupports  over 560,000 training places per year, the majority\r\n\r\ntaken up by workers with 'A' levels or below.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While training commitments from the SDF have grown\r\n\r\nsubstantially over the years, collections from the  SDL  have\r\n\r\nfallen.  In FY98, the SDF committed more than $88 million  in\r\n\r\ntraining grants but the levy collection was only $20 million.\r\n\r\nThis  is because as wages rise, the number of workers earning\r\n\r\nless  than $1,000 shrinks.  The base of the SDL has thus been\r\n\r\ndeclining  -  from  about 800,000 workers in  1980  to  about\r\n\r\n350,000  workers currently.  This is even though the size  of\r\n\r\nthe  overall  workforce  has doubled  and  more  higher  paid\r\n\r\nworkers need training.  This is not sustainable or equitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the SDF to continue to play its role in worker\r\n\r\ntraining  and  skills  upgrading, the  SDF  levy  has  to  be\r\n\r\nadjusted.   This  can be done either by increasing  the  levy\r\n\r\nrate, or by raising the salary cut-off below which the SDL is\r\n\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to keep the levy rate\r\n\r\nunchanged  at  1%,  but  to progressively  raise  the  salary\r\n\r\nceiling  for  SDL  contributions from the current  $1,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,000  over the next five years to 2004.  The first increase\r\n\r\nfrom  $1,000  to  $1,500 will take effect on 1st  July  2000.\r\n\r\nThis  will  expand the base of the SDL collection  to  around\r\n\r\n670,000  workers,  in other words, almost double  the  number\r\n\r\npaying  today, and increase the SDL collection by $28 million\r\n\r\na year, to $48 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDL salary ceiling will subsequently be raised to\r\n\r\n$1,800  in  2002  and to $2,000 in 2004.   Beyond  2004,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will revise the ceiling regularly to keep  it  in\r\n\r\nline with wage levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies should not treat higher SDL contributions as\r\n\r\nan additional cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nburden,  as  they can redeem these contributions by  training\r\n\r\ntheir workers.  They should instead look upon them as part of\r\n\r\ntheir essential investment in human capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage and CPF reduction for local workers last year\r\n\r\nwas  complemented by a reduction in the foreign worker  levy.\r\n\r\nThis was to assist companies, especially manufacturers, which\r\n\r\ndepend  heavily  on foreign workers.  Hence,  the  Government\r\n\r\nreduced the monthly levy for skilled foreign workers  by  $70\r\n\r\nfor  all sectors in January this year. The levy for unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers in the manufacturing and services sector  was\r\n\r\nalso cut by $90.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign worker levy reduction has helped to lower\r\n\r\noverall  business  costs  in  Singapore.   Despite  the  levy\r\n\r\nreduction,  there has been no surge in the number of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  while the number of Singaporeans in  the  workforce\r\n\r\nhas  gone  up.  The Government will therefore  leave  foreign\r\n\r\nworker levy rates unchanged for another year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial land - JTC and HDB rentals</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, as part of the cost-cutting\r\n\r\npackage,  JTC reduced its posted rentals for industrial  land\r\n\r\nand  flatted and standard factories back to the levels of the\r\n\r\nearly 1990s. This translated to a 20-40% rental reduction for\r\n\r\nlessees  and  tenants who are paying above the posted  rates.\r\n\r\nThose  on  the 4% or 5.5% rental escalation scheme were  also\r\n\r\ngranted a 2-year freeze on their rental escalation to the end\r\n\r\nof  December  2000.  JTC lessees paying below  their  revised\r\n\r\nposted  rates were granted an extension of rental rebates  up\r\n\r\nto the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the need to continue to be careful over\r\n\r\ncosts  for  the  manufacturing sector, JTC  will  extend  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  industrial  rental  rebates  for  another  year   to\r\n\r\nDecember 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will similarly extend their rental rebates for\r\n\r\nlessees  of  industrial land and tenants  of  commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  properties for another year until December  2000.\r\n\r\nTenants  of HDB commercial and industrial properties who  are\r\n\r\npaying above posted rates will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to receive rent rebates, but subject to  a  cap  of\r\n\r\n10%, instead of the previous 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transport - MPA and CAAS fees</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea and air transportation are important complements to\r\n\r\nthe manufacturing sector and have a significant impact on our\r\n\r\nexport  competitiveness.  Hence, the Government  will  extend\r\n\r\ncost rebates and concessions in these two sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) will extend the\r\n\r\n20%  port  dues  concession for container ships  and  harbour\r\n\r\ncraft  for another year until December 2000.  PSA Corporation\r\n\r\nwill  extend  the 10% rebate on lift-on/lift-off charges  and\r\n\r\nwharf  handling, as well as the 10% rebate on  warehouse  and\r\n\r\noffice  rentals,  for  another  year  until  December   2000.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore  (CAAS)\r\n\r\nwill extend the 10% rebate on landing fees for aircraft until\r\n\r\nDecember 2000. CAAS will also extend the rebate on warehouse,\r\n\r\noffice and retail shop rentals until December 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial impact</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two percentage point restoration of the employer's\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution rate will cost employers $741  million  per\r\n\r\nyear,  while the increase in the SDL ceiling from  $1,000  to\r\n\r\n$1,500  will cost $28 million per year. These will be  offset\r\n\r\nby  industrial  land  and  transport rebates  totalling  $237\r\n\r\nmillion  per  year.   However,  employers  will  still  enjoy\r\n\r\nsubstantial  cost  savings,  compared  to  before  the   cost\r\n\r\nreduction package, because we are only restoring 2% points of\r\n\r\nthe  10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government remains mindful of the need to maintain\r\n\r\ncost  competitiveness even as the economy picks up.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot freeze all charges and fees indefinitely,  without\r\n\r\naccumulating distortions that will harm our economy.  Charges\r\n\r\nand  fees  have  to be revised from time to time  to  reflect\r\n\r\nrising costs.  But the Government will exercise moderation in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing so and it will ensure that the cumulative burden on the\r\n\r\neconomy and on households is not excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years have been a major challenge for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is still too early to declare victory, but  so\r\n\r\nfar  we  have come through without major mishap. We benefited\r\n\r\nfrom   the  strong  foundation  of  sound  policies   pursued\r\n\r\nconsistently over many years, as well as our prompt, rational\r\n\r\nand cohesive response to a very grave situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the CPF contribution rate, the civil\r\n\r\nservice  bonus award and salary restoration, the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  SDL,  and the continuation of the rebates on  industrial\r\n\r\nrentals  and  sea and air transport will help to position  us\r\n\r\nfor  this phase of recovery.  While we are confident  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture, we must never become complacent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-crisis, we do not expect to resume high growth\r\n\r\neffortlessly.   While  Asia  has  been  busy  with  immediate\r\n\r\nproblems,  globalisation  and technology  have  continued  to\r\n\r\nprogress  apace.   We  must keep up with  these  trends,  and\r\n\r\ncontinually   adjust   our   policies   to   meet    changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Only thus can we stay  ahead  of  the  game,\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  competitiveness  and  secure  our  long-term\r\n\r\ngrowth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a summary (Cols. 505-6) of the\r\n\r\nmeasures which I will ask the Clerk to distribute to Members.\r\n\r\n[Copy of document distributed to hon.

I would like to ask  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister whether we are now on track to achieving a long-term\r\n\r\neconomic growth of 4-6%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the labour movement\r\n\r\nhas  supported  the cost-cutting measures.  We  believe  that\r\n\r\nsuch  collective efforts help to save jobs for  our  workers.\r\n\r\nAs  DPM  has just mentioned, it is too early now  for  us  to\r\n\r\ndeclare victory and, in fact, we know that the recovery is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuneven.   Some of our sectors will still have a wage  freeze,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, the cement industry and so on. May I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister:  is  it the right time to have such  a  big  salary\r\n\r\nadjustment, that is, the 13% and 29% increase for  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants and political appointees?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year when the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced the economic stimulus measures, it  was\r\n\r\nfelt  that  some of them, particularly the lumpy pump-priming\r\n\r\ntype  of  measures, would take effect over a two-year period.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,  since  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  at this point appears to be driven more by external\r\n\r\ndemand,  whether  we envisage greater cost pressures  in  the\r\n\r\nyear   ahead   from  the  follow-through   effects   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's stimulus measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask whether it is true or not\r\n\r\nthat  the  unemployment  figures  have  gone  up  over  June.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I understand from the Deputy Prime Minister,  we\r\n\r\nare not completely out of the wood but we are well on the way\r\n\r\nperhaps.   Echoing  the question that was  asked  by  another\r\n\r\nMember, why is\r\n\r\nthe  Government in a hurry to reward the top civil  servants,\r\n\r\nand  I  take it that Ministers are also going to be rewarded,\r\n\r\nwhen the economy has not fully recovered?\r\n\r\nThirdly, does the Government appreciate the message that  all\r\n\r\nthese  increases may be sending to the workers in the private\r\n\r\nsector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nhas kept faith with workers by restoring the CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrate  and  an  increase  in bonus for  civil  servants.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers  supported  the cost-cutting  measures  to  help  the\r\n\r\neconomy  to turn around.  From the DPM's statement,  I  guess\r\n\r\nthat the Ministers and top civil servants will receive a  big\r\n\r\npay rise.  Could DPM enlighten us on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in the past\r\n\r\npackage,  many  of  the  costs that were  to  be  saved  were\r\n\r\npotential.

Secondly,  in  announcing  the  earlier  package   of\r\n\r\nmeasures,  there was a lot of consideration of  the  external\r\n\r\ncost  factors  and competitiveness. Do we have an  indication\r\n\r\nnow  whether other countries' costs have also risen and  that\r\n\r\nit  is  safe for us now to increase our costs?  Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister has mentioned  that  certain  sectors\r\n\r\nremain weak and there are restructuring and retrenchments  in\r\n\r\nsome.   However,  the  measures he proposes  are  across  the\r\n\r\nboard.   Will there be any undue effects on the sectors  that\r\n\r\nremain weak and are experiencing retrenchments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I am sure that the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  very happy that the Government has  decided  to\r\n\r\nrestore the CPF contribution of the employers one year  ahead\r\n\r\nof time. While the five-year timeframe for restoration of the\r\n\r\nCPF   contribution  is  an  achievable  target,   would   the\r\n\r\nGovernment plan to shorten the restoration period should  the\r\n\r\neconomy perform better than expected?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I just like to touch on the CPF\r\n\r\nrestoration.   Will the full restoration be done  within  the\r\n\r\nfive  years or is there a possibility of reducing  the  total\r\n\r\n40% to any lower level?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may take all\r\n\r\nthe questions together.  Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether we are\r\n\r\non  track to make 4-6% growth.  The answer is yes. The  storm\r\n\r\nis  not  over yet because we still have to see how the region\r\n\r\nrecovers,  particularly Indonesia, where there are  political\r\n\r\ncomplications which may take sometime to work out.  Also, our\r\n\r\nown  internal  restructuring is  continuing.   While  we  are\r\n\r\nmaking  the growth, there is restructuring, people are  being\r\n\r\nretrenched,   industries  are  being  phased  out   and   new\r\n\r\nindustries are coming in.  So we have to continue to make the\r\n\r\neffort,  to  be  able to manage this turnover  and  make  the\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do well and continue to make 4-6% growth year\r\n\r\nafter  year, then as I have said, we should be able to  fully\r\n\r\nrestore the CPF contribution rate in about five years to 40%.\r\n\r\nOf  course, once I have said that, MPs have asked whether  we\r\n\r\ncannot do it even faster.  Let us not count\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  chickens because the eggs have not hatched yet.  If  all\r\n\r\ngoes well and we can do about 2% restoration a year, then  in\r\n\r\nfive  years,  we will get back to 40%.  But  if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsetback, we may be unable to restore.  We may have to restore\r\n\r\n1%  or  1/2%.   On  the  other hand, if we  do  exceptionally\r\n\r\nstrongly,  we  might be able to get away with 3%  in  a  good\r\n\r\nyear.  Let us put that as something to prepare our minds  but\r\n\r\nnot  a  hard target that we definitely will hit.  You  cannot\r\n\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked about cost pressures from the stimuli.\r\n\r\nMost  of  the  stimuli  are  in  terms  of  spending  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in infrastructure, meaning schools, MRT,  airport,\r\n\r\nroads  and  so  on.   As  Members will know,  right  now  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector  is  still  in  recession.   Volume   is\r\n\r\nconsiderably smaller than last year. Building programmes have\r\n\r\ncome  down, and there is a slack capacity.  It is a good time\r\n\r\nfor us to invest in infrastructure, including reclamation.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe that it will cause prices to go up or  cause\r\n\r\nany tightness in the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked a series of questions. Firstly,\r\n\r\npotential  versus actual savings.  Most of our  package  were\r\n\r\nactual savings because it was statutory like the CPF cuts and\r\n\r\nGovernment  charges.  The only one which  was  potential  was\r\n\r\nadjustment  to  bonuses  in  the  private  sector  which   we\r\n\r\nprojected  would  have  accounted  for  about  half  of   the\r\n\r\nreduction of 15% in wage cost last year.  My guess is that it\r\n\r\nprobably accounted for somewhat less than that because as the\r\n\r\neconomy  recovered, the pressure on companies to cut back  on\r\n\r\nbonuses and for workers to settle for less diminished.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the number but my feeling is probably we might have\r\n\r\nmade  3% or 4%, rather than 7% or 8%, as we were hoping  for.\r\n\r\nBut the CPF cuts, the Government rebates, the rental rebates,\r\n\r\nall those are actual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for external comparison with other countries, if you\r\n\r\nlook   at  the  nominal  exchange  rates  of  Thailand,  even\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and Korea, they have strengthened.  In so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  nominal  exchange rates reflect the cost  to  exporters,\r\n\r\nbecause they are exporting in US$ but their costs are in  Won\r\n\r\nor in Baht,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  this means that their costs would not have gone up very\r\n\r\nsharply  but would have firmed.  Their internal costs  within\r\n\r\ntheir countries, I believe, have been stable. Their inflation\r\n\r\nhas   been   stable  because  they  are  in  the  throes   of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and unemployment is still quite  high.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould not say that their costs have gone up sharply, which is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have  to  watch our costs too.  In  a  tight  labour\r\n\r\nmarket,  wages will settle for higher than last year but,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  we  have to try and ensure  that  the  wage\r\n\r\nsettlements  are  justified by productivity improvements,  so\r\n\r\nthat  while we pay people more, they are also producing  more\r\n\r\nand,  overall,  the  companies are  able  to  maintain  their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards weak sectors versus across-the-board\r\n\r\nmeasures,  although the CPF adjustment is across  the  board,\r\n\r\nthe  focus  of  our  continuing rebates on  industrial  land,\r\n\r\nflatted  and  standard factories, as well as the  rebates  on\r\n\r\nport  and airport dues, is more on the manufacturing  sector.\r\n\r\nThe  reason is because many of the weak industries are in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector,  either weak  because  of  costs  like\r\n\r\npetrochemicals and petroleum, or weak because they are in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  restructuring,  like  disk  drives  or  computer\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  So we have tried to make an effort  to  focus\r\n\r\non the manufacturing sector.  Beyond that, it is not possible\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not think it is desirable for us specifically  to\r\n\r\ndirect   rebates  or  Government  assistance  to   particular\r\n\r\nindustries, because it is really for the market to  sort  out\r\n\r\nwhich  industries do well in Singapore and which do not.   We\r\n\r\nwill  make  sure  that  there is a  manufacturing  sector  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  which particular industry, that  depends  on\r\n\r\nsupply and demand and on our cost structure.  What we can  do\r\n\r\nis  to  help  the  industries which are  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  to make the transition and help  the  workers,\r\n\r\nwho  are  being phased out by one industry, find new jobs  in\r\n\r\nanother industry, and that we will continue to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the questions by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Ong Ah\r\n\r\nHeng  and Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam on wage freeze and salaries  for\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector.  I gave Members numbers just  now  which\r\n\r\nshowed that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate sector benchmark which the Government is supposed  to\r\n\r\nfollow  went  up 13% in 1998 and 29% in 1999.  And  this  was\r\n\r\nbased  on  private sector earnings two years before,  because\r\n\r\nthere are lags in the way we calculate.  Actually, this meant\r\n\r\nthat  private sector earnings went up 13% in 1996, calculated\r\n\r\nin  1997,  and  applied in 1998.  It went  up  29%  in  1997,\r\n\r\ncalculated in 1998 and to be applied in 1999.  And  1996  and\r\n\r\n1997  were not bad years for the economy.  If we had followed\r\n\r\nthe  formula, we should have just applied this to  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  as we applied the earlier reductions in 1997  when\r\n\r\nthe private sector went down 7% and we followed them down 7%.\r\n\r\nSo if you go down, you go up again.  But because we could see\r\n\r\ndifficulty coming up over the horizon, so in 1998  and  1999,\r\n\r\nwe froze the adjustment and let the private sector go its own\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the economy is recovering. For the year 2000, the\r\n\r\nadjustment  for next year  - we do not have the data  yet   - we  think that the figure has gone up compared to last  year.\r\n\r\nAnd  the reason is that even though the economy, as a  whole,\r\n\r\nwas  not  doing well, there were companies which  were  doing\r\n\r\nwell.   Many foreign banks were doing all right.  Many multi-nationals  had  chief  executives who had  stock  options   - these are stock options of MNCs on the American market  -  so\r\n\r\nthey  were  worth  something and benefited the  CEOs.   Other\r\n\r\nprofessions  like the lawyers or the accountants,  which  are\r\n\r\nnot  salary-based  but are fee-based  -  they  get  a  profit\r\n\r\nshare  from their business  -  their services were in  demand\r\n\r\nand  so  their  earnings went up.  And so  our  benchmark  is\r\n\r\nlikely to go up again next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what do we do? If we were to apply the\r\n\r\nformula rigidly, we would simply multiply and apply.  I think\r\n\r\nthat  would be the wrong thing to do, because it is  quite  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  adjustment, and we should take this  opportunity\r\n\r\nto free up our public sector salaries further.  Presently, we\r\n\r\nrely  too  much  on fixed salaries without  enough  room  for\r\n\r\nadjustment within a grade, and also without enough weight  on\r\n\r\nthe performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelement of the overall salary package.  We have built up  the\r\n\r\nperformance  element over the years.  It is  now  up  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths  out of the 20-month total package for the  year,  but\r\n\r\nthat  is  quite  small compared to what you can  get  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Because in the private sector,  in  a  good\r\n\r\nyear,  you  can go to 12 months, sometimes even 18 months  in\r\n\r\nsome  industries.  And then next year, if it is no good,  you\r\n\r\ncome  down  again.   Or  next year your responsibilities  are\r\n\r\nlighter,   you  come  down  again.   We  do  not  have   that\r\n\r\nflexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the private sector, you do not have a person at\r\n\r\na  single grade at a single point.  You have a person in  the\r\n\r\nrank and his pay can vary from X to Y, and he might get a pay\r\n\r\nadjustment without getting a rank upgrade promotion.  And  it\r\n\r\ngives  you some flexibility to reward individuals  in  a  way\r\n\r\nwhich  fits the organisation and which fits what he deserves.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the civil service, you cannot.  If I want  to  pay\r\n\r\nsomebody more, I have to promote him, and similarly with  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  or the Parliamentary Secretaries, and  this  is  a\r\n\r\nrigidity.  So we have got to find some way to make this  more\r\n\r\nflexible  and to build up the performance bonus for the  top,\r\n\r\njust  as  we  are intending to introduce a performance  bonus\r\n\r\nacross  the  board,  even  for all  civil  servants.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething which we are studying and which we hope to work out\r\n\r\nby the beginning of next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said that we will no longer be freezing the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  salaries.  How we make the  adjustment,  what\r\n\r\nform  we  will  evolve to and how quickly we  get  there  are\r\n\r\nthings  which we have to consider.  We may take  one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  to get there, but I think it would be the wrong  thing\r\n\r\nfor us to say we do not do anything and we freeze it, because\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to lose good officers.  It has happened before\r\n\r\nand  we  are  already beginning to notice  this  because  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  are  in  the private  sector.   You  can  say,\r\n\r\n\"Tighten  your belts.\"  He says, \"I will go the other  side.\"\r\n\r\nSo  we have to be realistic.  We have had a system which  has\r\n\r\nworked  and  which has got us through quite  a  major  crisis\r\n\r\nwithout  an accident.  I think we had better look to  improve\r\n\r\nand strengthen the system.

Second,  whether\r\n\r\nthe Government charges and fees would be revised in the light\r\n\r\nof  all  these changes that are being planned?   Third,  what\r\n\r\nconcrete plans would be undertaken by the Government to  help\r\n\r\nolder workers who are less skilled and untrained?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to answer the questions that I asked earlier?\r\n\r\nOne  of them was:  is it or is it not true that  unemployment\r\n\r\nhas  risen over the last two months?  Secondly  -  I made  it\r\n\r\nas  a  passing reference  -  are Ministers going to  be  paid\r\n\r\nthis  bonus  and  annual wage supplement, besides  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants and Members of this House?  And I asked why  are  we\r\n\r\nin  such a  hurry, and will it not send the wrong message  to\r\n\r\nthose in the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first respond\r\n\r\nto   Mr   J  B  Jeyaretnam's  question  which  I  overlooked.\r\n\r\nUnemployment is now 4%, slightly higher than what it  was  in\r\n\r\nJune, but lower than 4.4% in December 1998.  I do not believe\r\n\r\nthis  rise is significant, from all the accounts.  The labour\r\n\r\nmarket is tightening.  If you ask me what it could mean,  one\r\n\r\npossibility  is  that it is some indication of  a  structural\r\n\r\nproblem we have to address and which we are addressing, which\r\n\r\nDr   Vasoo  raised,  of  older  workers  who  may  be  having\r\n\r\ndifficulties  finding new jobs and for whom we must  make  an\r\n\r\nexceptional effort to help to find new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked what efforts are we making. We have the\r\n\r\nManpower  21 programme.  We are introducing training schemes.\r\n\r\nWe  are  linking  up  with the ITEs,  polytechnics  and   the\r\n\r\ntraining institutes to work out programmes which are tailored\r\n\r\nto the older workers, and to present them in a way which will\r\n\r\nfit  them.  And also to break them up into small modules,  so\r\n\r\nthat you can do it one piece at a time, master\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  collect a boys' scout badge, go on, get another badge,\r\n\r\nand  finally you become a President's scout, or you get a new\r\n\r\njob.  I think that is a practical approach.  There is no easy\r\n\r\nway to do this, because for somebody who is in his 40s or 50s\r\n\r\nwith    teenage    or    grown-up   children    and    family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, to go back to school, learn, sit down, take\r\n\r\nnotes, study, take examinations  -  you know you did it  many\r\n\r\nyears  ago  but now, when you sit down to try and do  it,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not come so quickly any more.  But it is an effort which\r\n\r\nhas to be made and we will help them to make it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked about the effect of this package on\r\n\r\ninflation, I do not think there will be, because inflation is\r\n\r\ngenerally  low.   We have been watching it.   This  year,  it\r\n\r\nshould be about 1%, I think.  Next year, maybe about 2%,  but\r\n\r\nwe  keep a very close eye on inflation in Singapore.  We  are\r\n\r\nhelped  because world-wide inflationary pressures  are  down.\r\n\r\nSo  imported inflation would not be significant, and domestic\r\n\r\ninflation, as long as we manage our economy carefully and  do\r\n\r\nnot allow it to overheat, will be controlled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On charges and fees, there were a series of charges and\r\n\r\nfees  which  had  rebates in the package last year  including\r\n\r\nmedical  charges, public transport, service and  conservancy,\r\n\r\nand  GST  rebates  which were extended for two  years.   Some\r\n\r\nexpire  at the end of this year and some will expire  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  next year.  We will let them run their course.   The\r\n\r\neconomy  is  recovering.   I  expect  to  see  wages   rising\r\n\r\ngradually  over  the  next  few months.   They  have  already\r\n\r\nstarted  to rise, and I do not see workers losing their  jobs\r\n\r\nin   very  large  numbers  and  being  unable  to  find   new\r\n\r\nemployment.   There will be retrenchments but at  this  time,\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched workers really have the best chance  possible\r\n\r\nto  find new jobs.  So I think that we should let the rebates\r\n\r\nand  fee  concessions to run their course.  And,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  beyond that, we have to make some adjustments, but  we\r\n\r\nwill  be careful and mindful to be moderate and to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the overall impact will be something which people  will\r\n\r\nbe able to bear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam asked what signal are we\r\n\r\nsending to the private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector.  The answer is we are sending them the signal that we\r\n\r\nare still lagging them.  We have a benchmark.  We should have\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  benchmark.  Because of the  circumstances,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not done so.  We will make a partial restoration.  How?\r\n\r\nWe  will settle later on.  But at the end of it all, it  will\r\n\r\nstill take us some time to catch up, and we have always  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  will lag the private sector, and we are not leading\r\n\r\nit.   But we have to keep in step and we  must not be too far\r\n\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, last year, when we announced the\r\n\r\ncost  cutting  measures, there was a  5%  rebate  for  public\r\n\r\ntransport  which will also expire at the end  of  this  year.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Deputy Prime Minister enlighten us  whether  this\r\n\r\nwill also be extended?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, despite the fact that the economy\r\n\r\nis growing, as a result of the restructuring, retrenchment is\r\n\r\nlikely  to continue.

I am\r\n\r\nnot  concerned  so much with those employees in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  against  whose salaries the benchmark for  Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  is fixed.  I am concerned with those in  the  lower\r\n\r\nranks  in the private sector.  What message is the Government\r\n\r\nsending to them when you are in a hurry to pay Ministers  and\r\n\r\neveryone increased bonuses, including top civil servants?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is not a\r\n\r\ndebate on Ministers'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsalaries.  We have had several debates on Ministers' salaries\r\n\r\nin  this House.  The Non-Constituency Member has participated\r\n\r\nin many of them.  The matter has been deliberated, discussed.\r\n\r\nWhite   Papers  have  been  tabled.   The  policy   is   well\r\n\r\nestablished.    The   message  which  we  have   consistently\r\n\r\npresented to Singaporeans is that we are looking for  quality\r\n\r\nleadership in the public sector, in the political leadership.\r\n\r\nIf  you want good people, you have to be realistic.  The more\r\n\r\nyou  are able to recognise what people are worth and pay them\r\n\r\nwhat they are worth, the better the quality of government  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  have.  So I do not think there has  been  any\r\n\r\nchange.   It  is a system which we will have to  continue  to\r\n\r\nargue, discuss and defend\r\n\r\nrepeatedly because Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam and others  will often\r\n\r\nask why this is so and it is quite understandable because  it\r\n\r\nis not an intuitive solution.  Many countries do not do this.\r\n\r\nBut many countries envy us that we are able to do this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in America recently and one person I met, who is\r\n\r\nhead of Brookings, said to me, \"We envy your system.  We  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  do  it.   We have to squeeze  our  public  sector\r\n\r\nsalaries.  So we have two or three different grades all  paid\r\n\r\nexactly the same pay because there is not enough room to make\r\n\r\na  differentiation between them.  And we will still get  some\r\n\r\npeople  coming in because in the public service, there  is  a\r\n\r\nstrong tradition in America, you come in for one term and you\r\n\r\ngo  out,  and  you  have  made your reputation.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nstarting  to tell, and we are beginning to see a shortage  of\r\n\r\nqualified,  high-calibre people in their public sector.\"   So\r\n\r\nthese  are  issues  which confront every  country.   We  have\r\n\r\nchosen  the approach of coming out, discussing it openly  and\r\n\r\ndefending what we do rather than making believe, and I  think\r\n\r\nthat is a right approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> May I ask DPM why a 5% rebate for\r\n\r\npublic transport is not considered?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to manage\r\n\r\nthe recovery and move on.  When we run into a crisis, we have\r\n\r\nto  introduce measures to buffer the crisis.

It is like the CPF.  When we\r\n\r\nrun  into a crisis, we make a 10% cut.  As soon as the crisis\r\n\r\nis  over, we have to begin to restore it. If we bring it down\r\n\r\nand  we hold it down, and say, no, it is too comfortable, let\r\n\r\nus  leave  it  there,  we  will never  come  back  up  again.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with rebates on transport, on health and on  other\r\n\r\nitems.   If we bring it in and leave it there, then the  next\r\n\r\ntime what do we do?  The next time we must have a 10% rebate,\r\n\r\nand  a 20% rebate.  Eventually, we will have to give free bus\r\n\r\nrides, or pay people to ride buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, these are adjustments which have to be made.\r\n\r\nThey are not going to disappear overnight because some of the\r\n\r\nrebates last till next year, some of them run out this  year.\r\n\r\nIt  is  something which is not pleasant to do  but  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot avoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Rather than looking forward to future\r\n\r\ndownturns in the economy, are we going to use CPF as  a  tool\r\n\r\nto  reduce cost or will there be other tools as far as  wages\r\n\r\nand salaries of workers are concerned?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> CPF should only be an absolute last\r\n\r\nresort.   If  you  are  in  a very  desperate  spot  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation  looks very grave, then it is a card which  we  can\r\n\r\nplay, which nobody else can play.  No other country has  this\r\n\r\npossibility.   We can do it but only if it is really  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  situation and only if we make an exceptional  effort\r\n\r\nto explain and justify and get people to understand why it is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But it is not something which you want to use  as\r\n\r\na  standard macro economic policy tool.  What we really  want\r\n\r\nto do is to build in flexibility into the wage system so that\r\n\r\nif  there  are ups and downs, it can be buffered by the  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   After the 1985 recession, we built in the  variable\r\n\r\nbonus and the flexible wages over the next 12 years.  So this\r\n\r\ntime  when we had the recession, we were able to use that  to\r\n\r\nabsorb part of the reduction in cost and could make a smaller\r\n\r\nreduction in the employer's CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion we have drawn from this experience\r\n\r\noperating  the flexi-wage system is that it is very  good  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  variable  component.  But  there  is  a  draw-back\r\n\r\nbecause  the variable component works on an annual basis  and\r\n\r\nmost of it are annual bonuses.  So by the time you adjust and\r\n\r\ncut,  it  may be eight or ten months later, and by that  time\r\n\r\neither  you may have hoped for the situation to have  changed\r\n\r\nor   the  company  may  already  have  run  into  cash   flow\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  gone under.  So we really  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a monthly variable component of the salary which will\r\n\r\nbe  adjustable more quickly and flexibly. This  is  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was able to do because we have this monthly  non-pensionable  variable component, which we could  bring  down,\r\n\r\nand now we can bring up again.  The NWC has endorsed it.  How\r\n\r\nto  do  it is something which we have to study.  There is  an\r\n\r\nissue because if you do not do it properly, then although you\r\n\r\ncall it a monthly variable component, it will be monthly  but\r\n\r\nit  may  not  be  variable.  So you  need  to  have  a  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding of how it will operate, what the  formula  will\r\n\r\nbe,  either based on the economy as a whole or based  on  the\r\n\r\ncompany and its performance, so that when it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nrevise it up or down, it is easy to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, on SDL, how would the Government\r\n\r\ntry   to  encourage  more  SMEs  to  retrain  their  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially the older ones, whom we really want to  help,  and\r\n\r\nespecially also for companies whose workers may not  be  able\r\n\r\nto   enjoy   the   training  facilities  under   the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is a difficulty, because the big\r\n\r\ncompanies are better organised to take advantage of the  SDF.\r\n\r\nSo  companies like SIA or DBS, which are very well  organised\r\n\r\nand pay a lot of attention to training their people, are able\r\n\r\nto  take  full advantage of SDF.  In fact, I believe many  of\r\n\r\nthem  collect more from SDF than they put in the  SDF.   They\r\n\r\nare  not wrong to do so, but I think it means other companies\r\n\r\nare  not  using  the SDL enough.   We have to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nsmall  companies  to do this.

At  the  same  time, maybe  we  should  consider\r\n\r\nwhether there should not be some cap on how much you can take\r\n\r\nout  of  the SDF in comparison to how much you put  into  the\r\n\r\nSDF.   There must be some relationship.  It need  not  be  at\r\n\r\nmost  one to one, but some reasonable relationship.  Then  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to free up some money and  use  it  for  the\r\n\r\nsmaller companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the Ministry of Manpower that in fact\r\n\r\nlast  year the withdrawals for small companies from  the  SDF\r\n\r\nactually went up by 6%.

Their   overall\r\n\r\nrecommendation was wage restraint but they also made specific\r\n\r\nprovisions  for  companies not doing  well,  companies  doing\r\n\r\nwell,  companies  doing  very well, and  depending  on  which\r\n\r\ncategory you fell into, there were different guidelines.   If\r\n\r\nyou  are  doing  well,  then you should reward  your  workers\r\n\r\nthrough  bonuses or wage increases, preferably in the monthly\r\n\r\nform,  and if you are doing very well, then you should do  it\r\n\r\nand  put  most of the money into the monthly variable  bonus.\r\n\r\nThat  was at the time when the economy was forecast  to  grow\r\n\r\nbetween  zero to 2% for the year.  Since then we have revised\r\n\r\nour forecast.  Now we think the economy will grow by about 5%\r\n\r\nfor the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that overall the recommendations are still valid\r\n\r\nbecause they have built into them flexibility to allow for  a\r\n\r\nrange of performances of companies and next year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  May  the NWC will meet and discuss again.

ICT-related industries  will\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  key  growth  sector  in  this  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  ICT will also be the enabling platform for building\r\n\r\ncompetitive  strengths  in  other  economic  and   industrial\r\n\r\nsectors of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger, the promotion, development and\r\n\r\nregulation  of  the  ICT  sector were undertaken  by  various\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  statutory boards. The NCB, which  was  under\r\n\r\nMTI,  was responsible for the development of the IT industry.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  Broadcasting Authority, or SBA,  under  MITA,\r\n\r\ntook charge of the broadcasting industry while TAS, under the\r\n\r\nthen MINCOM, handled the regulation of the telecommunications\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this arrangement has worked well in the past, the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and  imperatives  have  changed.    Technology\r\n\r\nchanges  and business trends are leading to a convergence  of\r\n\r\nthe   telecommunications,   IT  and   broadcasting   sectors.\r\n\r\nTransmission    technologies   have    become    increasingly\r\n\r\nsubstitutable.   Consequently, the traditional industry-based\r\n\r\nregulatory  boundaries are breaking down.  Just a  few  years\r\n\r\nago,  telecommunications were related to telephones, telexes,\r\n\r\nfax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachines,  radio  and  handphones,  while  IT  was  basically\r\n\r\ncomputers   used   for  scientific  calculations,   financial\r\n\r\noperations and word processing.  And broadcasting was related\r\n\r\nto radio and television.  Today, all three sectors are inter-related.   You can send a fax through the computer,  talk  to\r\n\r\nfriends  overseas  through  internet-telephony  or  watch   a\r\n\r\ntelevision  programme on the computer through  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nONE  broadband  multimedia network.  Equally importantly,  we\r\n\r\nare  finding  that  promotion and development  of  the  info-communications  sector  can take place  effectively  only  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  integrated perspective, one that includes  the\r\n\r\nissue of regulation.  It is therefore necessary to review the\r\n\r\nexisting  organisational structures  to  improve  policy  co-ordination   and  implementation  in  the   face   of   rapid\r\n\r\ntechnological developments.  This will enable  us  to  foster\r\n\r\nthe   integrated  development  and  application  of  ICT   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  Government   has\r\n\r\ntransformed  MINCOM  into the Ministry of Communications  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology, and decided to merge TAS and NCB into\r\n\r\nthe Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask why not go one step further, and merge\r\n\r\nthe  SBA with IDA.  After all, convergence also involves  the\r\n\r\nbroadcasting sector.  We have, in fact, considered this.   Up\r\n\r\ntill now, the SBA has been responsible for content regulation\r\n\r\nacross  the various mediums, including both broadcasting  and\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.  This responsibility remains separate from the\r\n\r\nother  aspects  of  ICT industry development,  promotion  and\r\n\r\nregulation.    Traditional  broadcasting  can  be   regulated\r\n\r\nindependently.   Therefore, the Government decided  that  the\r\n\r\nprincipal   responsibility  for  broadcasting   and   content\r\n\r\nregulation  will  remain  with the SBA.   However,  the  non-content aspects of broadcasting, which are convergent with IT\r\n\r\nand   telecommunications,   such  as   interconnection,   the\r\n\r\ntechnical  standards  for cable infrastructure  and  the  re-broadcast  infrastructure in tunnels  and  within  buildings,\r\n\r\nwill  be transferred to IDA.  Both the IDA and SBA will  work\r\n\r\nclosely on such issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will be taking a two-stage approach in\r\n\r\nestablishing   the  regulatory  framework   for   the   info-communications industry.  The merger of NCB and  TAS  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst phase.  Instead of two specific regulators, NCB and TAS\r\n\r\nwill   be  merged  into  an  integrated  agency,  the   Info-communications   Development  Authority,   to   oversee   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   regulation  of  the  ICT   industry   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  The IDA Bill constitutes the  new  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  and  lists  its  broad  functions  and  duties.    The\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  and  Postal Services  Bills  provide  the\r\n\r\ndetailed  regulatory powers of IDA in the  telecommunications\r\n\r\nand  postal  sectors respectively.  The regulatory provisions\r\n\r\nare  generally  taken from the existing TAS  Act,  with  some\r\n\r\nrevisions and enhancements.  These will be discussed  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond reading speeches for the respective Bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase will be the introduction of separate\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  deal  with the legal and  regulatory  issues\r\n\r\narising  from  the convergence of the telecommunications,  IT\r\n\r\nand   broadcasting  industries.   As  convergence  is  a  new\r\n\r\nphenomenon, we are studying the issues involved, as  well  as\r\n\r\nlearning  from  the  experience  and  legislation  of   other\r\n\r\ncountries.   I am targeting to finalise this new  legislation\r\n\r\nnext year after IDA has sorted out all the technical issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch briefly on the main\r\n\r\nprovisions in the IDA Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides for the formation of the IDA as\r\n\r\na  statutory  board, with the transfer of staff,  properties,\r\n\r\nrights and liabilities from NCB and TAS to the IDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7, together with the Second Schedule, of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  spell  out the functions and duties  of  the  IDA.\r\n\r\nBroadly, the IDA will perform three key functions.  First, it\r\n\r\nwill promote and facilitate the growth and development of  an\r\n\r\nefficient  and  internationally  competitive  ICT  sector  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Second,  it  will  carry  out   licensing   and\r\n\r\nregulatory functions, and help maintain effective competition\r\n\r\nin the ICT sector.  Third, it will promote an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation  Society in which ICT is readily  accessible  and\r\n\r\navailable to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 provides for the transfer of properties,\r\n\r\nassets and liabilities of TAS and NCB to the new IDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides for the transfer of employees of TAS\r\n\r\nand NCB to the service of IDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the technological advances and market developments\r\n\r\nin  the ICT industry are driving the digital revolution.

It will  allow\r\n\r\nus  to  have an integrated and focused Statutory Board  which\r\n\r\ncan  then work towards leveraging on the opportunities of the\r\n\r\ndigital  revolution.  It will help develop Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\nprogressive Information Society and position us as a  dynamic\r\n\r\nand vibrant knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak  in support of the Bill in the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Information Technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to merge the National Computer Board\r\n\r\nwith  the  TAS  to  form  this new  IDA  (Info-communications\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Authority of Singapore).

Or does the Bill actually seek to cover these\r\n\r\nareas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask is whether the notion of\r\n\r\nefficiency and international competitiveness mentioned in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclause  6(1)(a)  refers to our information and communications\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore  in providing efficient  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or for them to go overseas and compete in  the  big\r\n\r\nleague  internationally.  I am not  sure  whether  the  first\r\n\r\nmeaning   to   provide   efficient  services   in   Singapore\r\n\r\nnecessarily  implies the other.  So perhaps  a  clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister as to what extent the aim of  this  Info-communications Development Authority extends well beyond  the\r\n\r\nshores  of  Singapore overseas, and, if  such  is  the  case,\r\n\r\nwhether  such policies that we apply home will  also  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  kind  of  policies that will enable  some  of  our  own\r\n\r\ncompanies to go overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we would like our own service providers to give\r\n\r\nthe  best  services  and charge the lowest  price  for  these\r\n\r\nservices,  does the Info-communications Development Authority\r\n\r\nnecessarily see this issue of service providing as  the  sole\r\n\r\nissue  for  efficiency?  Size, for example,  is  a  very  big\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage in this sector.  So  to  develop  that\r\n\r\nkind  of  size  for  our  own local  enterprise,  Singaporean\r\n\r\nenterprise,  is it the same set of policies that is  required\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  develop if we are only interested  in  providing\r\n\r\nefficient  services  at home?  Strategic investment  that  is\r\n\r\nprovided  over  a  long  term,  for  example,  will  not   be\r\n\r\nundertaken by local service providers, because it may not  be\r\n\r\nprofitable over a given time frame.  And if we do not do that\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, then we may not have the experience, the know-how  and  the  knowledge base to proceed overseas.   So  such\r\n\r\ninvestments that have to be made locally may be of  strategic\r\n\r\nadvantage to our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it leads me to the question of whether IDA will be\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve its objective of promoting and  maintaining\r\n\r\nfair  and efficient market conduct and effective competition.\r\n\r\nWill  the  IDA  not  have  its own favourite  son?   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so  because  in  clause  6(1)(m),  the  IDA  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  \"to encourage, promote, facilitate, invest  in  and\r\n\r\notherwise  assist  in  the  establishment,  development   and\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the information and communications industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\".  I hope the Minister can clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said that IDA is an important step  to  better\r\n\r\nmanage  the convergence of IT and communications.   I  agree,\r\n\r\nSir.   Indeed, one of the concerns when I entered this  House\r\n\r\nin  1997 was how we should perhaps restructure our Government\r\n\r\nand Ministries to cater to this problem.  And it was reported\r\n\r\nin  Hansard,  19th November 1997, in columns 1893  and  1894,\r\n\r\nwhen  I asked the Prime Minister a question whether he  would\r\n\r\nform  a  Ministry of Information Technology.  Then the answer\r\n\r\nwas  simply  no,  that we had a National IT Committee  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.   I  followed up on 12th March 1998 with a question  in\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply which was reported in column 1054  of\r\n\r\nHansard dated 12th March 1998.  The then Second Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade  and  Industry replied in column 1096,  and  again  the\r\n\r\nanswer  was  no,  that  it was unrealistic  to  have  such  a\r\n\r\nMinistry.  I followed up again, 12th March 1999, reported  in\r\n\r\ncolumn  708, asking for this again.  And I am very heartened,\r\n\r\nSir,  that today we see the culmination of efforts like that.\r\n\r\nWe  have now not only an IDA (Info-communications Development\r\n\r\nAuthority   of  Singapore)  but  also  a  new   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Information Technology.    It  does  show\r\n\r\nthat if we do try, in small persistent pushes, it can indeed,\r\n\r\nperhaps with faith too, move mountains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy that we have this new Ministry and\r\n\r\nthis  new authority to better manage the convergence  of  IT.\r\n\r\nIt  is, you might say, the new \"darling\" of Singapore, and we\r\n\r\nhope   that  it  would  be  able  to  live  up  to  the  high\r\n\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence of broadcast technology, computer\r\n\r\ntechnology and telecommunications technology, in fact, should\r\n\r\nlead  us  to that further consideration of merging  even  the\r\n\r\nSBA,  as  the  Minister has mentioned  in  his  speech,  with\r\n\r\nperhaps   IDA.    The  Minister's  answer  is  that   content\r\n\r\nregulation should be separate and it is still all right  that\r\n\r\ntraditional broadcasting can be regulated that way, and  that\r\n\r\nthe technical side of broadcasting will be brought under IDA.\r\n\r\nHalf  a loaf is better than nothing, Sir.  But I would  still\r\n\r\nsay that we should actively consider merging even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSBA  with  IDA  because  out in the industry,  it  is  rather\r\n\r\nconfusing for a broadcaster to say where this goes to  -  SBA\r\n\r\nor  IDA.   If  we  are concerned about separately  regulating\r\n\r\ncontent,  we  can indeed have a separate agency  to  regulate\r\n\r\ncontent.   Then, again, in this case, it will be  across  the\r\n\r\nboard  dealing with content not only on radio, TV,  computers\r\n\r\nand  Internet, but print media too.  So I would  indeed  urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to continue considering that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, moving on to the technicalities, I look at clause 2\r\n\r\nwhich states the definition of \"TAS\".  I believe there  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  inelegance of drafting here.  We  are  told  that  in\r\n\r\nclause  2, TAS is defined as \"the Telecommunication Authority\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   reconstituted  under  the  Telecommunication\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore Act\".  This Act, we will know  today,\r\n\r\nwill  be  repealed.  It is strange to me to see words telling\r\n\r\nme  that  an  Authority would be reconstituted under  an  Act\r\n\r\nwhich  will be repealed.  I do believe that perhaps what  the\r\n\r\ndrafters  intended  to  do  was  to  mention  that  this  new\r\n\r\nAuthority, IDA, is an authority that will replace  TAS  which\r\n\r\nwas  formerly reconstituted under the TAS Act, which  is  now\r\n\r\nrepealed.   Perhaps  some additional words  would  make  that\r\n\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 6(1)(e), there are certain powers\r\n\r\nmentioned which are given to the new IDA, ie, new powers, new\r\n\r\nfunctions  and  new  roles.  I am very  supportive  of  those\r\n\r\nroles.  Perhaps clause 6(1)(e) could be further expanded, not\r\n\r\njust   to  deal  with  the  IDA  representing  Singapore   in\r\n\r\ninternational  fora,  but also to  be  given  the  powers  to\r\n\r\nseparately  and independently, if necessary,  to  forge  this\r\n\r\nconvergence  of  laws.  Because as IT and  telecommunications\r\n\r\nconverge,  the  laws of the world will need to  converge  and\r\n\r\nharmonise.  I hope that the power will be given to the IDA to\r\n\r\nwork  with international bodies, whether Government  or  non-government,  whether  public  or  private,  in   efforts   to\r\n\r\nharmonise ICT law and policy and to create transnational and,\r\n\r\nif necessary, supranational solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to clause 6(1)(j), Sir. I would say that,\r\n\r\nprior  to this, it is indeed heartening also to see that  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  would be given the power to encourage,  facilitate\r\n\r\nand  promote  the greatest practicable use of industry  self-regulation by the information and communications industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would like to know if the Minister would, in  a\r\n\r\npolicy  statement perhaps, soon announce how  this  would  be\r\n\r\ndone and whether there will be any budget to do this.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for  industry  to self-regulate  but  it  is  also\r\n\r\nimportant to give them the right incentives so that they will\r\n\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me thank the two MPs who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  in support of the Bill.  Let me deal  with  the\r\n\r\npoints  brought up by Mr Chay.  Sir, he has asked, since  the\r\n\r\nterm  \"communications\" can be interpreted to  cover  a  broad\r\n\r\narea  which  includes  sea, land and air  transport  sectors,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Info-communications Development Authority  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  charged  with  the  responsibility  for  the  three\r\n\r\ntransport sectors.  Sir, if you were to refer to clause 2  of\r\n\r\nthe  Interpretation  section,  it  defines  \"information  and\r\n\r\ncommunications technology\" or ICT as \"any technology employed\r\n\r\nin  collecting, storing, using or sending out information and\r\n\r\nincludes  that  involving  the  use  of  computers   or   any\r\n\r\ntelecommunication system\".  Sir, this is  in  fact  a  widely\r\n\r\nused    term    in    the    information    technology    and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  industry and is a  result  of  the  rapid\r\n\r\nconvergence  of these two technologies.  As such,  the  Info-communications Development Authority will only be responsible\r\n\r\nfor   the  IT  and  electronic  communications  industry   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and not the sea, land and air transport sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also asked, when we talk about promoting\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in Singapore, whether we mean to let the  ICT\r\n\r\nindustry to be competitive in Singapore only or do we  intend\r\n\r\nto  let them also compete abroad and, as he says, join in the\r\n\r\nbig  league overseas.  Sir, the ICT industry is an  extremely\r\n\r\nlarge sector.  It includes the development and management  of\r\n\r\ncomputer hardware and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsoftware, the telecommunications sector, the development  and\r\n\r\nhosting of Internet content, the provision of  data services,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   As  most of these services  and  products  are\r\n\r\nlargely sold on the global market, the industry players  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  competitive,  not  just  locally  but,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, internationally.  For example, HP's computer and\r\n\r\ncomputer peripheral business in Singapore sells the products,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  computers and printers, not just in the region  but\r\n\r\nall over the world.  Similarly, with Compaq, Seagate and many\r\n\r\nother  companies.  In the software sector, there are  already\r\n\r\ncompanies  in Singapore which are subsidiaries of MNCs,  even\r\n\r\nlocal  companies,  whose  software  are  products  which  are\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  Singapore  and are  now  being  used  or  sold\r\n\r\nworldwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, the cost of local\r\n\r\ntelecommunication services can be a significant  cost  factor\r\n\r\nfor   companies  and  it  can  adversely  impact   on   their\r\n\r\ninternational competitiveness.  Therefore, we  also  need  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   the  local  telecommunication  services   are\r\n\r\ncompetitive and competitively priced.  As a result  of  this,\r\n\r\nwe  are  now seeing good results.  For example, Singapore  is\r\n\r\none  of  Citibank's global data centre.  Citibank has located\r\n\r\nthis   very  important  multi-million  dollar  facility  here\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  the necessary IT expertise,  an  excellent\r\n\r\nsupporting  infrastructure and competitive telecommunications\r\n\r\nrates.   The  centre links up with the Citibank  branches  in\r\n\r\nover  55  countries worldwide.  So IDA must therefore  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  its policies lead to a more vibrant and internationally\r\n\r\ncompetitive local telecommunications sector to the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe whole economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked, since size is important, would the same\r\n\r\nset  of policies be valid across the whole range of companies\r\n\r\nand,  more  importantly, in cases where strategic investments\r\n\r\nare  required,  especially  such investments  are  marginally\r\n\r\nviable,  how  can we promote those investments.   How  do  we\r\n\r\nensure  that those investments are being made for  the  long-term good of the economy?  Sir, IDA's focus is to ensure that\r\n\r\nour  telecommunications industry can respond to the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe economy in the range and quality of innovative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  offered and also to ensure that these services  are\r\n\r\ncompetitively priced and give good value for money.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, competitive pricing may not necessarily imply  the\r\n\r\nlowest  price  levels.  I think this is what he is  concerned\r\n\r\nabout.   If this really implies the lowest pricing,  then  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  policy we apply across the board.  So the  aim  is\r\n\r\nreally to ensure that we give good value for money.  One  way\r\n\r\nto  do  that is to ensure that eventually when we move  to  a\r\n\r\nsituation where market forces force the service providers  to\r\n\r\ndo  so, ie, innovate, price their services competitively and,\r\n\r\neven  though they are not the cheapest in the region  because\r\n\r\nof  the overall quality of service, their services are  still\r\n\r\nvery attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to investments that have a strategic\r\n\r\nnational value but which are only marginally viable, we  have\r\n\r\nmechanism   to  address  this.   For  example,  TAS   has   a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  grant  scheme and NCB has a cluster  development\r\n\r\nfund  which  can  be  used to promote and  co-fund  strategic\r\n\r\ninvestment  projects.  I will give Members an  example.   TAS\r\n\r\nand  NCB, together with other Government agencies, had worked\r\n\r\nwith industry and co-funded SingaporeOne which is the world's\r\n\r\nfirst  nation-wide  broadband infrastructure  for  multimedia\r\n\r\napplications and services.  So in that way, IDA will continue\r\n\r\nto  work  with the industry to ensure that there is continued\r\n\r\nupgrading and enhancement of our infrastructure and  network.\r\n\r\nAnd we will also co-fund strategic investments when needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also talked about the danger of having a\r\n\r\nfavourite  son  because of the duty of  IDA  to  promote  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of this sector.  Sir, like TAS and NCB before it,\r\n\r\nIDA  will  be a fair and impartial regulator and promoter  of\r\n\r\nthe  industry.  Mr Chay need not fear that IDA  will  have  a\r\n\r\nfavourite son because we will continue to treat all  industry\r\n\r\nplayers as valued and favourite sons.  So it is not just one,\r\n\r\nwe  will  treat  all of them as our favourite  sons.   As  we\r\n\r\nfurther liberalise the telecommunications sector and  as  ICT\r\n\r\nsector  continues to develop, we expect to see  more  players\r\n\r\nlocating  in Singapore.  They will serve not just  our  local\r\n\r\nmarket but also the region and globally.  The only way for us\r\n\r\nto attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  in  is  to ensure that our playing field is  level  and\r\n\r\nequally  important  is  that the new  and  potential  players\r\n\r\nperceive  our playing field as being level.  So he  need  not\r\n\r\nfear about IDA developing a favourite son.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat has brought up a few points. First,\r\n\r\nI  want  to  commend him on his persistence in  raising  this\r\n\r\nissue  of  centralising the responsibility for IT.   Sir,  it\r\n\r\nshows  that the Government does listen to the suggestions  of\r\n\r\nMPs and we do take their suggestions into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked why not merge SBA and IDA eventually because\r\n\r\nthe  industry  players  may  have difficulty  differentiating\r\n\r\nbetween  what is under SBA and what is under IDA.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncontent  element is very straightforward.  The dividing  line\r\n\r\nis  very clear and the industry players know who to go to for\r\n\r\nwhich function.  The SBA content also spans a large area.  It\r\n\r\nis  not just content on Internet, radio and TV, but also,  as\r\n\r\nProf.  Toh  has  mentioned,  also  covers  the  print  media.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  best resides within SBA and  IDA  as  it  now\r\n\r\nstands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the definition of TAS. Sir, I had\r\n\r\nasked  about  this earlier and I am told that the formulation\r\n\r\nof  words  here is correct.  But since I am no legal  drafter\r\n\r\nand  in  view  of the point brought up by Prof. Toh,  I  will\r\n\r\nindeed seek another opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked whether IDA can, under clause\r\n\r\n6(1)(e),  in  fact  broaden  its function  to  include  being\r\n\r\ncharged with working with international bodies on harmonising\r\n\r\nICT  law and policy.  Sir, indeed, this is what we intend  to\r\n\r\ndo.   It  may  not  be under that particular section  but  we\r\n\r\nintend  that in view of the fact that this is such a  rapidly\r\n\r\nevolving  section,  and  in  fact many  countries  are  still\r\n\r\ngroping as to what to do, we need to share our experiences as\r\n\r\nwell  as  learn  from the experiences of other countries  and\r\n\r\nwhere international standards are needed to be formulated, we\r\n\r\nwant   to  be  there  right  upfront,  taking  part  in   the\r\n\r\nformulation of those standards because they would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact on us as well.  Sir, I can assure Prof. Toh that  this\r\n\r\nindeed is what we intend to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also talked about clause 6(1)(j) which deals\r\n\r\nwith  the intent of IDA to promote self-regulation.   I  will\r\n\r\ntouch  on that in my Second Reading speech for the next  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich deals with the telecommunications issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to whether a budget is needed, I would think\r\n\r\nthat  industry players would in fact be very happy to pay  us\r\n\r\nto  allow  them  to  self-regulate because  this  gives  them\r\n\r\ngreater  freedom.   Sir, I do not think  a  budget  would  be\r\n\r\nneeded for IDA to promote self-regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  The Minister has said the industry's  players\r\n\r\nwould  do  it.  Indeed, if the players feel that they  should\r\n\r\nself-regulate, they would come together.  But  because  there\r\n\r\nare  so many players out there, sometimes it is important  to\r\n\r\nhave  an organisation that gets them all together to do these\r\n\r\nthings  as a whole and I declare my interest here.  I am  the\r\n\r\nChairman of CommerceNet Singapore which is trying to do that,\r\n\r\nbut  being a non-profit organisation, it may not be easy  for\r\n\r\nus  to persuade people to donate money. They would want us to\r\n\r\ndo  the  work  for  them and we would  be  very  grateful  if\r\n\r\nGovernment  could consider some sort of assistance  where  we\r\n\r\ncan do this work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would encourage him to\r\n\r\ncontact my staff on his concerns.

It repeals and  re-enacts   substantively   the  provisions   of   the   present\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had pointed out in my Second Reading speech for the\r\n\r\nIDA  Bill, information and communications technology, or ICT,\r\n\r\nwill  be  of increasing relevance and importance to Singapore\r\n\r\nas  we move into a knowledge-based global economy. We need to\r\n\r\nnot  only  promote and nurture the growth of  ICT,  but  also\r\n\r\ntransform Singapore into a vibrant and global ICT hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature of the knowledge-based economy will be the\r\n\r\nwidespread   use  of  the  Internet  and  Internet   Protocol\r\n\r\napplications.   We  will therefore need to actively  work  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  regional  and  global  hub  for  Internet  content\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   hosting  and  delivery.   To   realise   this,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will need to become an even more competitive  node\r\n\r\nfor  global  telecommunications.  We  must  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  infrastructure is  well  developed,  well\r\n\r\nconnected  regionally and internationally, and  competitively\r\n\r\npriced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important to increase and broaden our\r\n\r\nconnectivity   to   key  regional  and   global   information\r\n\r\ninfrastructures.  From less than an aggregate of 10  megabits\r\n\r\nper  second in 1998, Singapore's Internet bandwidth into  the\r\n\r\nAsian region will grow ten-fold to more than 100 megabits per\r\n\r\nsecond by the year 2000. Singapore's Internet bandwidth  into\r\n\r\nthe  region  is expected to grow exponentially into  gigabits\r\n\r\nper second by the year 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe locations and bandwidth of such connections would be both\r\n\r\nmarket and demand-driven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the telecommunications sector has become extremely\r\n\r\ncomplex   and   competitive  internationally,  with   service\r\n\r\nproviders innovating furiously, and new value-added  services\r\n\r\nand   products   being   introduced  in   rapid   succession.\r\n\r\nDevelopment in such a dynamic environment cannot be regulator-driven, nor can the market place be restricted if it is to be\r\n\r\nvibrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises this. We have therefore\r\n\r\nprogressively liberalised the paging, Internet Access Service\r\n\r\nProvider  (IASP) and mobile telecommunications  sectors.   By\r\n\r\n1st  April 2000, the public basic telecommunications  service\r\n\r\nsector  will  also  see  the entry of  our  second  operator,\r\n\r\nStarHub.   The  entry of new players, as we liberalise,  will\r\n\r\noften  involve technical and contractual issues  between  the\r\n\r\nnew and existing players, particularly where interconnections\r\n\r\nand interconnectivity are involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA must therefore fairly, transparently and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  manage  the  implementation  issues,  such  as\r\n\r\ninterconnection arrangements, between the incumbent  and  the\r\n\r\nnew  telecommunications operators.   We  recognise  that  the\r\n\r\nregulatory  approach and framework must also  evolve  as  the\r\n\r\nindustry  develops and matures.  The entry  of  more  service\r\n\r\nproviders will enhance competition, thereby allowing  IDA  to\r\n\r\nexercise a lighter regulatory hand.  The Government can  then\r\n\r\nlet the market self-regulate more, intervening only when anti-competitive practices appear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain the main provisions\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory approach in the telecommunications sector\r\n\r\nis structured to allow the IDA to regulate its licensees in a\r\n\r\nfair  and  transparent manner.  The IDA will rely on  licence\r\n\r\nconditions,  directions, codes of practice and  standards  of\r\n\r\nperformance to safeguard national and consumer interests  and\r\n\r\nensure  the quality of telecommunications services.  This  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in clauses 5, 26 and 27 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable IDA to address issues that are\r\n\r\ncritical  to the development and liberalisation  of  the  ICT\r\n\r\nindustry, such as preventing anti-competitive practices.   To\r\n\r\nprotect  consumer  welfare and public  interest,  apart  from\r\n\r\nsuspending  or cancelling a licence, a financial penalty  may\r\n\r\nbe   imposed   on  licensees  that  breach  these  regulatory\r\n\r\nrequirements.   The  limit  for  the  financial  penalty   is\r\n\r\ngenerally based on the potential public consequences and  the\r\n\r\neconomic  benefits a licensee can deliberately reap from  the\r\n\r\nbreach,  or non-compliance.  A breakdown in telecommunication\r\n\r\nservice   arising  from  a  breach  can  cause  serious   and\r\n\r\nwidespread    disruption    to    business    and    personal\r\n\r\ncommunications.  In clause 8 of the Bill, we  have  thus  set\r\n\r\nthe   maximum  financial  penalty  for  a  telecommunications\r\n\r\nlicensee  at  $1 million.  This should be adequate  deterrent\r\n\r\nagainst errant and irresponsible actions by licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 69 contains explicit provisions allowing\r\n\r\naggrieved  licensees to appeal to the Minister.   The  appeal\r\n\r\ncan be against any decision of the IDA in the exercise of any\r\n\r\ndiscretion  vested in it, such as an order for suspension  or\r\n\r\ncancelling  of  a licence, or the issuance of directions,  or\r\n\r\nanything  contained  in  a code of practice  or  standard  of\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, as I mentioned earlier, we recognise the\r\n\r\nneed to regulate with a lighter touch as the industry matures\r\n\r\nand  moves  to  a more competitive market-driven environment.\r\n\r\nIn  such  an  environment, industry self-regulation  will  be\r\n\r\npromoted where possible.  Clause 28 of the Bill empowers  IDA\r\n\r\nto  issue  advisory guidelines.  This will allow the  IDA  to\r\n\r\nstep  back in appropriate circumstances and let the licensees\r\n\r\nwork out mutually agreeable solutions among themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the growing importance of the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications network, we must ensure that due care  and\r\n\r\ndiligence is taken by contractors doing work in the  vicinity\r\n\r\nof  telecommunication cables, to prevent cable  cuts  to  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  network.   This  will  be  addressed   by\r\n\r\nrequiring  detection works to be undertaken prior  to  actual\r\n\r\ncommencement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearthworks, and by properly trained and licensed workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 and 30 of the Bill provide for IDA to license\r\n\r\ntelecommunications cable detection workers.   The  provisions\r\n\r\nwill   make   it  mandatory  for  contractors  who  undertake\r\n\r\nearthworks  to  engage  qualified  telecommunications   cable\r\n\r\ndetection workers to locate the cables in the vicinity before\r\n\r\ncommencing with earthworks.  Contractors will be required  to\r\n\r\ntake  due  care and diligence to prevent cable  cuts  to  the\r\n\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 also stipulates that contractors who fail to\r\n\r\ndo  so  shall  be  liable, upon conviction,  to  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment of up to 3 years or  to\r\n\r\nboth.   In addition, clause 30 of the Bill states that  cable\r\n\r\ndetection  workers who are unlicensed shall be  liable,  upon\r\n\r\nconviction, to a fine of up to $10,000 or to imprisonment for\r\n\r\na term not exceeding 12 months or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Telecommunications Bill sets out the regulatory\r\n\r\nframework for the  efficient and effective operation  of  the\r\n\r\nIDA in a liberalising environment in the short term, and in a\r\n\r\nfully  liberalised environment in the long term.  It  is  the\r\n\r\naim  of  the  IDA  to  ensure  that  fair  and  market-driven\r\n\r\ncompetition can be introduced as early as possible,  so  that\r\n\r\nit will be able to regulate the industry with a lighter touch\r\n\r\nwhile protecting the interests of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill covers a\r\n\r\nwide  area,  as  has  been  mentioned  by  the  Minister,  in\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  services and setting  out  the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations for the provision of such services, the codes  of\r\n\r\npractice,  the offences and penalties, enforcement powers  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the international obligations and areas of strategic\r\n\r\ninterest.    It  vests  the  Authority  with  the   exclusive\r\n\r\nprivilege    of    operations   and    the    provision    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication   systems  and   services   in   Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  power  to grant licences  for  operations  in\r\n\r\nspecific areas of services.  This power to license also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincludes  the power to require licensees to share systems  or\r\n\r\ninter-connection access to systems with other licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of transparency and global competitiveness is\r\n\r\nquite  definitive  in  this field of  telecommunications.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  will  the licensees, who have certain  competing\r\n\r\nstrengths  built  up  over years of market  expertise,  human\r\n\r\nskills or strategic investments in anticipating the market or\r\n\r\nbuilding   synergies  in  their  own  businesses,  view   the\r\n\r\ndirections  from  the  Telecommunication  Authority,  or  IDA\r\n\r\nsubsequently,  to share their resources or competencies  with\r\n\r\nother  licensees  on  this sacred altar of  transparency  and\r\n\r\ninter-connection access.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there is a question of national strategic\r\n\r\ninterest,   either  in  having  some  critical  or  important\r\n\r\ntelecommunication systems or features reside in or belong  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  a typical free-rider  problem  that  one\r\n\r\nencounters  often  in  businesses  and  organisations.    The\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  is  built up by the pioneer.   The  newcomers\r\n\r\ncome  to  ride on the infrastructure support built  up.   How\r\n\r\ndoes  one  price  it?   By fixing benchmark  market  cost  in\r\n\r\nequivalent features globally, or in a market asset  price  of\r\n\r\nthe  stockholding  company?   The  danger  is  always  there.\r\n\r\nBecause of our local market limitations we may end up  giving\r\n\r\nup a lot for very little.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Telecommunication Authority, or IDA\r\n\r\nsubsequently,   make   out   fair   compensation   to    such\r\n\r\ninfrastructural cost and rewards for risk involved?  If  such\r\n\r\ncompensating  criteria  are not well defined  in  advance  or\r\n\r\ncertain  businesses  are  unduly  or  unfairly  penalised  by\r\n\r\nunwitting extraction of its business advantages to some other\r\n\r\nlicensees,  there  may  be  reduced incentive  for  strategic\r\n\r\ninvestments  and for long-term dynamic growth and development\r\n\r\nof the industry, which may therefore be affected.  I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister can clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement in clauses 53 and 54 stipulating\r\n\r\nGovernment's   overriding  international   rights   is   also\r\n\r\nimportant and very reassuring.  Singapore has made its  stand\r\n\r\nto   fulfil  its  role  as  a  responsible  member   of   the\r\n\r\ninternational  community,  its  intention  to  override   all\r\n\r\nlicensees' conduct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof    business    at   variance   with   such   international\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to which the Government is a signatory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention to stipulate better telecommunication\r\n\r\ncable  detection work by contractors is also most welcome  in\r\n\r\nclauses   29  to  32.   We  all  know  that  any  damage   to\r\n\r\ntelecommunication cabling network costs a lot  of  money  for\r\n\r\nthe  businesses affected.  And the latest regulatory role  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  allows for this detection work by contractors  and\r\n\r\npenalty  fines for them are the least we can do  to  continue\r\n\r\nprotecting our cable network.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  this Bill.  The first thing I would like to  say  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill is timely and we have debated  on  the  Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nwe realise why we have to do this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point that I raised earlier on in the debate\r\n\r\non the Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\nBill, and now under this Bill, is that in clause 2, there  is\r\n\r\na  definition  of \"TAS\".  Here, my argument is even  stronger\r\n\r\nthan  earlier.   It says,  \"\"TAS\" means the Telecommunication\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore reconstituted by the repealed  Act;\"\r\n\r\nMy  question earlier on and my question now is:  how  can  an\r\n\r\nAuthority  be reconstituted under a repealed Act?  I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  words  should have been better put as, \"\"TAS\" means  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication    Authority    of    Singapore    formerly\r\n\r\nreconstituted under the repealed Act.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other more substantial point relates to clause 4.\r\n\r\nUnder  clause  4,  the  monopoly given  to  the  licensee  is\r\n\r\nexcepted  in  that  if  \"a  person runs  a  telecommunication\r\n\r\nservice solely for his own use or solely for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nhis  business   .   on  a single set of  premises  in  single\r\n\r\noccupation;\"   Those are the words in the Bill.   This  would\r\n\r\nmean  that the exception to the monopoly privilege  will  not\r\n\r\ncover,  it  seems to me, a world-wide or even  a  nation-wide\r\n\r\ncorporate intranet.  It is within one company, but  it  seems\r\n\r\nto fall outside this and therefore there is an infringement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is that if we have a private\r\n\r\nnetwork in an intelligent building,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  could  be one premise, if you see it that way, but  there\r\n\r\nare  many occupiers and therefore even though they should not\r\n\r\nbe  regulated by the Act, it appears that they  will  be.   I\r\n\r\nwonder if this is intended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to clause 33 of the Bill, this is the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of the offences and penalties (Part  VI),  and   I\r\n\r\nbelieve clause 33 can be read too widely.  The clause, as  it\r\n\r\nstands,   would  seem  to  require  operators  of  e-commerce\r\n\r\nbusinesses  which  would happen to be riding  on  an  ISP,  a\r\n\r\nlicensed  ISP at that, to be licensed too.  And I  hope  this\r\n\r\nwould  not  happen because otherwise, as could  be  possible,\r\n\r\nportals like Yahoo and e-mails like Yahoo.com or hotmail.com,\r\n\r\nor  the  chat rooms that are set up under e-commerce shopping\r\n\r\nmalls, or perhaps on-line stock trading services - these  may\r\n\r\nall  come  within the licensing provisions of the  Bill.   If\r\n\r\nthere is no licence, then it would be illegal, and this would\r\n\r\nhamper a lot of e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I do believe that we need to clarify whether\r\n\r\ntechnologies used by companies like MediaRing and Net2  Phone\r\n\r\nwould be similarly telecommunication systems that need to  be\r\n\r\nlicensed, because they breach the monopoly privilege  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensee.  So we do hope that the Minister would clarify this\r\n\r\nand,  if  necessary,  this could be done in  the  regulations\r\n\r\nunder the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 35 again, I have a clarification.\r\n\r\nClause  35  is  an offence clause which penalises  those  who\r\n\r\noperate a radio communication system or service, and  if  you\r\n\r\ndo not have a licence, it could well give you penalties under\r\n\r\nthis  clause.   My  question  is:  would  an  Internet  radio\r\n\r\nservice, which could eventually also be wireless, be  covered\r\n\r\nunder this clause?  If so, then it should be excluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, my point is on clause 41 and perhaps the clauses\r\n\r\nafter that, clauses 42 to 48 which deal with the interception\r\n\r\nof  telecommunication  services and such  offences.   Looking\r\n\r\nspecifically at clause 41, I regret that this is perhaps  not\r\n\r\nwide  enough to cover and protect against electronic snooping\r\n\r\nwhich does not touch,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntamper, remove or damage any installation or plant under this\r\n\r\nclause.  Certainly, if you were to use current technology  to\r\n\r\nintercept  mobile  phone messages, it  would  really  not  be\r\n\r\ntouching, tampering, damaging or removing any installation or\r\n\r\nplant  under  the Telecommunications Bill.  Consequently,  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  read  as a lacuna in the law because  we  prohibit\r\n\r\npeople from intercepting messages only if it touches the line\r\n\r\nor  the  plant  or  the installation of the Telecommunication\r\n\r\nAuthority  but  not if they are clever enough  to  avoid  all\r\n\r\nthese.   Sir,  I would like the Minister to clarify  on  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not intended to speak\r\n\r\non  the  Bill  which  I  generally support.   I  would  like,\r\n\r\nhowever,   to   raise   three  points  for   the   Minister's\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two relate to the Minister's comments on the\r\n\r\nneed   for   transparency  to  ensure  that  anti-competitive\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  struck down and that the  new  authority  will\r\n\r\nregulate with a lighter touch.  In this regard, my first  two\r\n\r\npoints  relate to the right of appeal and to the question  of\r\n\r\ntransparency.  It seems to me that the rights of  appeal  are\r\n\r\nlimited  to  the Minister.  Then, obviously, the reasons  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's decision and the hearings will not be public,\r\n\r\nand  this  may  not be best practice as regards transparency.\r\n\r\nPublic hearings might be better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second relates to clause 28(3)(b). Clause 28(3)(b)\r\n\r\nallows in respect of advisory guideline wherein the authority\r\n\r\nsimply  must \"publish each advisory guideline in the  way  it\r\n\r\nthinks  fit\".   Again,  if  we  are  to  take  best  practice\r\n\r\ntransparency seriously, surely public publication  either  in\r\n\r\nthe Gazette, as with all other laws or regulations, should be\r\n\r\nthe bare minimum and not \"in the way it thinks fit\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to a different issue, and this of\r\n\r\ncourse  is the relation of international rights to the  right\r\n\r\nof  the  licensees.  Sir, this Bill is taking part in a  very\r\n\r\ndynamic  situation in which international negotiations  under\r\n\r\nthe  umbrella of WTO are opening up and other sectors.  There\r\n\r\nwill be an effect on licences.  It could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  a  question of vested rights, a licence already given  is\r\n\r\nthen  in  some way compromised.  I would like the  Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance  that  consultations will be  held  with  licensees\r\n\r\nprior  to these international negotiations that might  affect\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me thank\r\n\r\nthe three Members who have spoken up in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will take the points brought up by the speakers\r\n\r\none by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with Mr Chay's comments. The first\r\n\r\npoint he raised was about requiring the existing licensees to\r\n\r\nshare  their facilities and he asked how would the  licensees\r\n\r\nview  the  directions from the regulator for  them  to  share\r\n\r\ntheir  resources.   Sir,  as I pointed  out  earlier  in  the\r\n\r\nsession on Questions for Oral Answer, tough decisions have to\r\n\r\nbe  made  and it is very difficult to make all the  licensees\r\n\r\nhappy.   Of  course,  those who have been adversely  impacted\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  very happy.  But the key thing is  for  us  to\r\n\r\nensure that the regulatory framework is one which is fair and\r\n\r\ntransparent,  so  that  no  one feels  that  they  are  being\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  against or they are being taken advantage  of.\r\n\r\nWe  have to ensure that there is no free rider.  That is  one\r\n\r\nof  his main concerns - that new companies will come and free\r\n\r\nride  on what has been put in by the existing companies.   So\r\n\r\nthere will be no free riders.  All the services will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  negotiated.  All the interconnections will be  negotiated\r\n\r\nat a price agreed upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that the regulation and\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the telecommunications sector is not unique\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  Because the telecommunications sector  is  so\r\n\r\nvital to the efficient operation of the entire economy,  many\r\n\r\ncountries  have, in fact, actively proceeded even before  us,\r\n\r\nto  open up their telecommunications sector.  Therefore, many\r\n\r\nof  the  interconnect practices and requirements have already\r\n\r\nbeen fairly well established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need to have the interconnect facilities? In\r\n\r\na   multi-operator  environment,  we  need  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nconsumers are able to enjoy seamless and transparent services\r\n\r\nand that the service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproviders  are able to share scarce infrastructural resources\r\n\r\non commercially agreed upon terms.  For example, it would not\r\n\r\nmake  economic sense nor will it be in our national  interest\r\n\r\nif  SingTel subscribers are not able to phone subscribers  of\r\n\r\nM1 handphones and vice versa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interconnection and access therefore is vital in a\r\n\r\ncompetitive multi-operator environment, so that the customers\r\n\r\ncan   have  a  choice  of  service  providers  and  they  can\r\n\r\nseamlessly  and  transparently contact and  communicate  with\r\n\r\nanyone they want.  In the area of infrastructure sharing,  we\r\n\r\nwill  only  direct sharing where there is a  real  bottleneck\r\n\r\nsituation.   For  example, all the mobile phones  and  paging\r\n\r\noperators are required to share the infrastructure to provide\r\n\r\nradio  coverage  in the MRT and our city tunnels,  given  the\r\n\r\nsheer  lack of space and the operation constraints  in  these\r\n\r\ntunnels.   The  IDA will only issue directions after  careful\r\n\r\nassessment of the circumstances requiring sharing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On interconnection and access, IDA's requirements for\r\n\r\nthe  operators to have interconnection and access obligations\r\n\r\nare  very  similar  to what other countries  are  practising,\r\n\r\nbecause we have taken the opportunity to learn from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also raised his concern whether we will actually\r\n\r\nbe  giving up a lot for very little.  In actual fact, we  are\r\n\r\ngiving   out  very  little  to  gain  a  lot.   Because   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  infrastructure  is  a  very   fundamental\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for the entire economy.  By making  sure  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  able  to  liberalise and introduce competition,  our\r\n\r\nrates have been steadily declining.  And as a result, I think\r\n\r\nit  has been a boost to many parts of the economy, especially\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  are  engaged  in  international  trade   and\r\n\r\ncompanies  which have very heavy data flow between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand their offices in the region and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked whether by having the interconnection\r\n\r\nrequirements,   we  will  reduce  incentives  for   strategic\r\n\r\ninvestments.   As  I  pointed out  just  now,  if  there  are\r\n\r\nstrategic  investments that are required but which  are  only\r\n\r\nmarginally viable, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  very  happy  to  take  a  look  and  co-fund  those\r\n\r\ninvestments,  if they are in the national interest.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  by  making sure that we are able  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncompetition, I think this forces the companies to innovate to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  value-added services  and  therefore  increase\r\n\r\ntheir own viability.  I think as a result of that, we have in\r\n\r\nthe  last  18  months or so been seeing the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nnumerous new services, all of which add to the bottomline  of\r\n\r\nthe operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also agreed with our requirements for\r\n\r\ncontractors  to employ licensed cable detection  workers.   I\r\n\r\nthank him for his support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Prof. Toh's point on the definition of\r\n\r\n\"TAS\",  in  clause 2, I have asked and I was  told  that  the\r\n\r\nformulation  of  the words is correct.  But,  again,  as  was\r\n\r\npointed  out earlier on, I will also seek further  advice  on\r\n\r\nthis from the AG's Chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 only applies to equipment which is on a single\r\n\r\nset  of premises in single occupation.  He asks whether  this\r\n\r\nis deliberate, because it seems to rule out quite a few other\r\n\r\nsituations,  for  example,  companies  with  multi  locations\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore  which seek to set up  their  own  national\r\n\r\nIntranet as well as bigger buildings where there are multiple\r\n\r\noccupants.   Sir, the scope of the definition  is  indeed  an\r\n\r\nintended  one.  For the case of one user, many premises,  the\r\n\r\nnational Intranet situation that he talked about is that  the\r\n\r\ncompany should take telecommunication services from a  public\r\n\r\nbasic telecommunication service provider who then has certain\r\n\r\nrights  to  either  enter the land for  installation  and  to\r\n\r\nrepair  and also to be able to extend the network beyond  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  of  one  particular property  owner.   So  it  is\r\n\r\nintended not to apply to such situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of one premise, many users or occupiers, the\r\n\r\nsmart  building that Prof. Toh was talking about, this  would\r\n\r\nbe  the  provision  of telecommunication  services  to  third\r\n\r\nparties, as the users and occupiers are not related but  just\r\n\r\nhappened to be in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same  building.   And therefore such  potential  service\r\n\r\nproviders should actually obtain a licence from IDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he touched on clause 33 and asked whether this\r\n\r\nrequires e-commerce operators riding on licensed ISPs  to  be\r\n\r\nlicensed,  and he mentioned companies like Yahoo,  Chat  Room\r\n\r\nfacilities, Media Ring and Net2Phone.  In fact, clause 33  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  new  provision.  It is an existing provision  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent TAS Act.  TAS to-date, in fact, does not license  any\r\n\r\ncontent or Internet service provider.  So portals like Yahoo,\r\n\r\nfree  mails given by them, and Microsoft, and Media Ring  and\r\n\r\nNet2Phone  are, in fact, already not required to be licensed.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that Media Ring and Net2Phone actually  do\r\n\r\nprovide  a  service.  They provide software or  equipment  to\r\n\r\nInternet   subscribers,  and  being  not  service   providers\r\n\r\nthemselves, they do not require to be licensed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 35 - whether service providers\r\n\r\nwho are providing radio service through the Internet need  to\r\n\r\nbe licensed.  Sir, the answer is yes.  Any equipment intended\r\n\r\nfor  wireless transmission, regardless of the content  to  be\r\n\r\ntransmitted,  needs to be licensed by IDA.   The  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis is very simple.  This is to ensure that the operation of\r\n\r\nsuch  equipment  does  not cause interference  to  any  other\r\n\r\nwireless services or equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh commented that clause 41 is not wide enough to\r\n\r\ncover  against, for example, electronic snooping.  Clause  41\r\n\r\nhas  a  very  clear intention.  The intent is to protect  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication's  installation  of  plant  or  the  public\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  licensee from damage  if  someone  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of trying to intercept messages or to commit mischief\r\n\r\ndamages or tampers with the installation or plant.  It is not\r\n\r\nmeant  to cover or to protect against electronic snooping  or\r\n\r\nunlawful interception.  I believe that one of the reasons  is\r\n\r\nthat  now mobile telephony being encrypted is quite difficult\r\n\r\nto  snoop  into versus the old analogue system where actually\r\n\r\nit  is like a radio station where you can just tune in.   The\r\n\r\nnew GSM and CDMA systems are encrypted and each generation of\r\n\r\nnew phones involves even stronger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencryption  and  therefore it is  now  proving  to  be  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult for people to just snoop into such transmissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay commented that while we are talking about\r\n\r\ntransparency  and  the  need to act against  anti-competitive\r\n\r\npractices,  the  rights of appeal are quite limited  and  the\r\n\r\nrights of appeal have to be made to the Minister.  The reason\r\n\r\nfor this is that in many cases, the information contained  in\r\n\r\nthose appeals are highly sensitive commercially and therefore\r\n\r\nit  is  not appropriate for those appeals to be heard  openly\r\n\r\nbecause   it  will  mean  divulging  commercially   sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation.   In  any  case,  if  such  information  is  not\r\n\r\ncommercially sensitive, if need be, we will be very happy  to\r\n\r\nlet  the companies publicise the decisions.  In any case, the\r\n\r\nappellants  are  normally  heard by  the  Ministry  as  well.\r\n\r\nWhilst  the case may not be heard in the open, they have  the\r\n\r\nability to make their case heard very clearly by the Ministry\r\n\r\nand Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about clause 28(3)(b) where the Authority\r\n\r\nmust  publish  each advisory guideline in the way  it  thinks\r\n\r\nfit.  Mr Simon Tay feels that it should be gazetted.  Sir, to\r\n\r\nbe   published  \"in  the  way  it  thinks  fit\"  leaves   the\r\n\r\nflexibility   to  the  Authority  to  publish  the   advisory\r\n\r\nguidelines.   Today,  there  are many,  many  channels.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  TAS now posts many of the requirements and policies\r\n\r\non  the  Internet.  So rather than restrict it  to  only  one\r\n\r\nmedium, it is better that we leave the flexibility to the IDA\r\n\r\nto  publish  those guidelines.  The key thing is  that  those\r\n\r\nguidelines  would  be published.  But  let  us  give  it  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to choose the medium or better still the media in\r\n\r\nwhich to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In  talking about the issue of interconnection  access\r\n\r\nand the free rider problem, I said just now that we might end\r\n\r\nup giving up a lot but getting very little.  What I meant was\r\n\r\nactually  when people, particularly international  companies,\r\n\r\ncome into Singapore and operating as licensees, riding on the\r\n\r\ninterconnection  access which is built  up  internally  here,\r\n\r\nthere  is an issue here.  How does one price it?  Of  course,\r\n\r\nyou  can say that by opening up the market, naturally  prices\r\n\r\nare  becoming cheaper and cheaper.  But if you just  look  at\r\n\r\nthis kind of benchmark, international prices of operator,  it\r\n\r\nmight not mean a thing.  The value of the business is resided\r\n\r\nin  the asset value of the company.  So the value is actually\r\n\r\nthere  - in the control of the operations, in the headquarter\r\n\r\ncompany,  in the stockholding company which is overseas.   So\r\n\r\nthe  danger  is  really there.  If you just  use  the  normal\r\n\r\nstandard  day-to-day  routine measure and  say,  \"Bottomline.\r\n\r\nThat's it.  So many cents per call, or whatever.\"  I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister can dwell into what I mean when I said \"giving up  a\r\n\r\nlot for very little\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify.  Does he not see the anomaly that arises\r\n\r\nwhen  he  says  that  clause  41 is  not  intended  to  cover\r\n\r\nelectronic  snooping?  If you get a person who  taps  into  a\r\n\r\ntelephone line, that is illegal but if he taps into an  aired\r\n\r\nmessage  through  a  mobile phone  system,  then  it  is  not\r\n\r\nillegal.  I do agree that there are encryption systems.   But\r\n\r\nas  a  matter  of practice, most mobile phone  messages  will\r\n\r\nremain  unencrypted for a long term and also perhaps  because\r\n\r\nit  is  more expensive.  And it does indeed say much  of  our\r\n\r\nmove into the IT age that we do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  laws preventing private communications from unwittingly\r\n\r\nbecoming non-private.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis  clarifications.  I would seek further  clarification  on\r\n\r\nonly one point.  It is regarding the release of decisions  to\r\n\r\nthe  public.   I  agree with the Minister that  where  it  is\r\n\r\ncommercially  sensitive, it should be withheld.   But  can  I\r\n\r\ntake  it that the Minister is reassuring us that where it  is\r\n\r\nnot  commercially  sensitive and where there  are  principles\r\n\r\nthat  apply to other companies or the public, these  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased because there have been controversies before.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Chay sought to clarify what he is\r\n\r\ntalking  about.  Sir, I do take his point.  This is  why  TAS\r\n\r\nhas  put  in  place a charging framework for  interconnection\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be  applicable for  only  three  years.   This\r\n\r\ncharging  framework  establishes,  among  other  things,   an\r\n\r\neconomic cost model for calculating the interconnect  charges\r\n\r\nand  infrastructure sharing.  This cost model is based on the\r\n\r\ncurrent  replacement  cost  principles  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure    owner    is    fairly    compensated    for\r\n\r\ninterconnection and for the use of his infrastructure.   This\r\n\r\nframework is generally an attempt to redress the asymmetry in\r\n\r\nthe  bargaining  position of the new entrant,  vis-a-vis  the\r\n\r\nincumbent,  and it gives the right signals and incentives  to\r\n\r\nboth  the  new and old players.  The new operator can  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  to  buy  or  to build his own facilities  while  the\r\n\r\nincumbent operator has the incentive to continue to invest in\r\n\r\nthe  infrastructure  because it is getting  a  good  economic\r\n\r\nreturn  on whatever he is investing.  After three years,  the\r\n\r\noperators will then proceed to commercially re-negotiate  the\r\n\r\nprices.   And  it  is  only when they  cannot  agree  on  the\r\n\r\npricing,  will IDA then intervene again.  What we would  like\r\n\r\nto  do  is to leave it to them to establish their own pricing\r\n\r\nmechanism.   If  there are enough players, the  new  entrants\r\n\r\nwill have enough choices to negotiate with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned about clause 41 again. Sir, the\r\n\r\nintent, as I said, is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevent  damage  to the existing facilities,  including  line\r\n\r\ninstallation,  and all that.  If someone is snooping  and  is\r\n\r\nusing our line systems, then we can take action against  him.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said, the one which we are unable to cover against,\r\n\r\nat  the moment, is snooping into the wireless media, and  the\r\n\r\nmost  common  one will be the handphone conversation.   As  I\r\n\r\nsaid, at the present moment, encryption is already strong for\r\n\r\nthe  GSM  and  CDMA  and  I think the  future  generation  of\r\n\r\nhandphones  will have even stronger encryption  capabilities.\r\n\r\nIf  there  is  a  need for us to guard against  that  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,   we  will  be  very  happy  to  enact  the  required\r\n\r\nlegislation.  But at the present moment, there is no evidence\r\n\r\nthat this is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Simon Tay's question, yes, where the\r\n\r\ndecisions  and  the  facts of the case are  not  commercially\r\n\r\nsensitive, there is no reason why we should not divulge them.\r\n\r\nBut our experience so far has been that many of the cases  do\r\n\r\ninvolve sensitive information.

Like\r\n\r\nthe Telecommunications Bill 1999 that was debated earlier  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  the Postal Services Bill repeals and  re-enacts\r\n\r\nsubstantively   the   provisions  of  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore  (TAS)  Act  on  the  licensing  and\r\n\r\nregulatory powers in postal services.  Clause 3 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for the appointment by the Minister of any person to\r\n\r\nbe  a Postal Authority.  The intention is to appoint the  new\r\n\r\nInfo-communications Development Authority of Singapore  (IDA)\r\n\r\nas the Postal Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the postal services sector comprises two broad\r\n\r\ncategories  -  the  basic delivery of  ordinary  letters  and\r\n\r\npostcards,  and the delivery of express letters.  The  latter\r\n\r\nis  a  premium  service.  To meet the needs of  the  business\r\n\r\nconsumers  for secure and fast delivery service, the  express\r\n\r\nletter market has been liberalised since February 1995.  This\r\n\r\nprovides consumers with a wider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoice  of competitive carriers for their time-sensitive  and\r\n\r\nmore secured express mails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the delivery of ordinary letters and postcards,\r\n\r\nSingapore Post has the monopoly rights until 31st March 2007.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House may ask why not  bring  forward  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  this  market  so  that  the  benefits  of\r\n\r\ncompetition,  such as competitive pricing and higher  service\r\n\r\nlevels, can be enjoyed earlier.  After all, this was what  we\r\n\r\ndid for the telecommunications sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must weigh the possible benefits of\r\n\r\nliberalisation  against the cost of advancing  liberalisation\r\n\r\nwith its concomitant compensation and decide what is the best\r\n\r\napproach.   In the postal industry, the key growth areas  are\r\n\r\nthe  delivery  of  express  letters  and  direct  mails  from\r\n\r\nbusinesses   to   households,  such   as   printed   matters,\r\n\r\nadvertising  materials and publications. These  growth  areas\r\n\r\nhave all been liberalised.  SingPost's monopoly is restricted\r\n\r\nto  a low-growth market of ordinary mails and postcards.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  the  volume  of  ordinary letters  and  postcards  has\r\n\r\ndecreased  by 4.5% and is expected to decrease by  a  further\r\n\r\n2.2%  in  1999.   Looking  ahead,  this  declining  trend  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  continue  over the next  few  years,  with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing use of mail substitutes such as e-mails and faxes.\r\n\r\nThis    is    clearly    unlike   the    rapidly    expanding\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  sector, where the potential  benefits  of\r\n\r\nadvancing  liberalisation are obvious.  The  postal  industry\r\n\r\nrelies  on  the high volume of mails to achieve economies  of\r\n\r\nscale.   This  has  allowed the postage  for  ordinary  local\r\n\r\nletters  to  be  kept  at an affordable  rate  of  22  cents.\r\n\r\nWithout the benefits of the economies of scale, postage rates\r\n\r\nmay have to go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, TAS sets the minimum standards for the\r\n\r\nquality of service that SingPost should provide to the public\r\n\r\nfor  the  delivery of ordinary letters and  postcards.   This\r\n\r\nincludes targets for delivery speeds of local, registered and\r\n\r\ninternational mail, and queuing time at postal outlets.   For\r\n\r\nlocal ordinary mail posted before 7 pm within the CBD or 5 pm\r\n\r\noutside the CBD, TAS requires SingPost to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeliver by the next day at least 98% of all mails within  the\r\n\r\nCBD  and  95%  of  mails outside the  CBD.   There  are  both\r\n\r\ninternal and independent external audit checks to ensure that\r\n\r\nthese  standards  are  met.  It is also necessary  to  review\r\n\r\nthese standards regularly to continuously improve the overall\r\n\r\npostal  service  enjoyed by Singaporeans.   In  this  regard,\r\n\r\nIDA,  in its capacity as the Postal Authority, aims to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  standards for quality of service for  next  day\r\n\r\ndelivery  of local ordinary mails that are delivered  outside\r\n\r\nthe  CBD  from  95%  today to 98%, and  for  those  that  are\r\n\r\ndelivered  within  the CBD from 98% to  99%.   This  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented progressively over the next few years and will be\r\n\r\ncompleted by 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TAS has also put in place a price control\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework, which benchmarks the tariffs  for  our\r\n\r\nbasic  postal  services against countries with  similar  cost\r\n\r\nstructures.   For  the  delivery  of  ordinary  letters   and\r\n\r\npostcards,  TAS requires SingPost's charges to be  below  the\r\n\r\naverage of these countries.  SingPost also needs to seek TAS'\r\n\r\napproval  on any tariff changes for its basic services.   The\r\n\r\nprice  control  framework ensures that the  tariffs  for  our\r\n\r\nbasic postal services are internationally competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for SingPost's delivery of ordinary letters and\r\n\r\npostcards, there are sufficient safeguards on service  levels\r\n\r\nand prices to protect the interests of the general public. We\r\n\r\nwill therefore not advance the liberalisation of the ordinary\r\n\r\nletter market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we will do is to ensure that the regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  is  fair  and  transparent.   In  the  Bill,   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  outlining the regulatory approach mirror  closely\r\n\r\nthose  in the Telecommunications Bill 1999.  The IDA, in  its\r\n\r\nrole  as the Postal Authority, will similarly rely on licence\r\n\r\nconditions,  directions, codes of practice and  standards  of\r\n\r\nperformance.  This is provided for in clauses 6, 24 and 25 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   Likewise,  clause 26  provides  for  the  Postal\r\n\r\nAuthority to issue advisory guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the cancellation or suspension of a licence,\r\n\r\nclause 9 also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovides  for  a  financial penalty to be imposed  on  postal\r\n\r\nlicensees   that   do  not  comply  with   these   regulatory\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Compared to the telecommunications and  public\r\n\r\nutilities sectors, the potential public impact of a breach of\r\n\r\nregulatory requirements is less serious in the postal sector.\r\n\r\nThe  maximum amount of the financial penalty is thus  set  at\r\n\r\n$10,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 56 contains explicit provisions\r\n\r\nallowing  licensees the recourse to appeal  to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nagainst  any decision of the Postal Authority in the exercise\r\n\r\nof  any  discretion  vested in it  by  the  Act  or  anything\r\n\r\ncontained in a code of practice of standard of performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Postal Services Bill 1999 sets out the\r\n\r\nregulatory    framework    for    the    postal     industry.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  the  monopoly in the  delivery  of  ordinary\r\n\r\nletters and postcards, we do enjoy high quality of service at\r\n\r\ninternationally  competitive  prices.   To  ensure  that   we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do so, we will review the minimum standards  for\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  service  and the  price  control  framework\r\n\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me mention that under clause 2 of the\r\n\r\nPostal  Services Bill, there is a definition of \"letter\".   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  clarify if such a definition  would  include\r\n\r\nservices  that  the  Singapore Post is  currently  promoting,\r\n\r\nwhich is the V-post and perhaps even e-mail services, because\r\n\r\nif this is not within the definition of \"letter\" in clause 2,\r\n\r\nthere are certain other implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on clause 2, at the risk of sounding like a\r\n\r\nbroken  record, I would like to put on record for the Hansard\r\n\r\nbecause this would aid in future interpretation of this  Act,\r\n\r\nthis  question of the definition of \"TAS\".  I  just  need  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that after this Bill is passed today, there will  be\r\n\r\nno new TAS that will be \"reconstituted\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 4 deals with the monopoly, that is, the\r\n\r\nexclusive privilege\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  postal licensee would have.  On first  reading  of\r\n\r\nthis  clause, I initially was disappointed because  my  first\r\n\r\nreaction  was  -  what has happened to the liberalisation  of\r\n\r\npostal  services that we have been promoting and  advocating,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  postal services are liberalised, sometimes  this\r\n\r\nwould be more business-responsive.  And indeed, the growth of\r\n\r\nthe courier business has shown that to be so.  I am therefore\r\n\r\nglad that the Minister of State has actually clarified in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that there are certain residual areas of  the  postal\r\n\r\nservice which would be unattractive to the commercial  sector\r\n\r\nto  carry and yet they need to be carried because people need\r\n\r\nto  correspond, and economies of scale are needed so that  it\r\n\r\nwould be affordable enough at 22 cents.  I thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  that. At 22 cents, it is a bargain deal and, on  top  of\r\n\r\nthat,  there  is quality of service standard requirements  by\r\n\r\nthe  current  TAS  and, later on, IDA.    I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nsupport  this  and urge for constant review of this  need  to\r\n\r\nliberalise postal services even more. Ultimately,  if  postal\r\n\r\nservices are not relevant, we should look into making it more\r\n\r\nresponsive to the times and the technologies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 deals with letters or postcards which accompany\r\n\r\ngoods.   I  believe the intention really is  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  correspondences that do not  really  relate  to  the\r\n\r\nordinary  letter that we are talking about. This is something\r\n\r\nthat  goes along with the delivery of goods and the provision\r\n\r\nin   clause  5  says  that  if  this  is  accompanied  by   a\r\n\r\n\"Consignee's  letter\"  then  this  is  not  covered  by   the\r\n\r\nexclusive  privilege.  My question, Sir, is  that,  sometimes\r\n\r\nsome  of  these cards or covering letters might  accompany  a\r\n\r\ndelivery of goods, but it is not a trade practice or industry\r\n\r\npractice to call this letter a \"Consignee's letter\".  And  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  so,  then  the deliverer of these  goods  would  be\r\n\r\nbreaching  the Act if he were to deliver the goods with  that\r\n\r\nletter.   It  is particularly so when we talk  about  the  e-commerce  purchase. The transaction is entered  into  on  the\r\n\r\nNet.   Somebody  must physically deliver and perhaps  with  a\r\n\r\ncovering letter.  I hope these delivery services are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncovered  by  the exclusive privilege or the monopoly  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to clause 15. Clause 15 raises a concern.\r\n\r\nIt says that, \"The addressee of any postal article containing\r\n\r\nany  dutiable goods shall be presumed until the  contrary  is\r\n\r\nproved  to  have  imported  the  same\".   Sir,  this  is   an\r\n\r\nevidential  presumption  which  gives  the  State   ease   in\r\n\r\nprosecuting illegal imports and so on.  But I would  be  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  that this does not get seen as a kind of  indirect\r\n\r\nimport tax on e-commerce because an e-commerce transaction is\r\n\r\nentered  on the Net and something is delivered, and it  could\r\n\r\nbe  delivered from Amazon.com in America.  We do not want  to\r\n\r\nsee  any  indirect import taxes imposed on transactions  like\r\n\r\nthat because then e-commerce would be hampered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 19. Clause 19 describes essentially what a\r\n\r\npostage stamp is and what are the protections that are needed\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  that  postage stamps,  especially  philatelic\r\n\r\nstamps, are valuable and continue to be valuable.  The  words\r\n\r\n\"postage stamp\" are defined again in clause 2, but reading it\r\n\r\ntogether with clause 19, I get the impression that it may not\r\n\r\ncover  the  development of e-postage stamps on the  Internet.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many, many proposals for this now  and  the  idea\r\n\r\nessentially is that on the Internet, you could order a  stamp\r\n\r\nthat  you  can then fix onto your e-mail or to your  physical\r\n\r\nmail  and  deliver.   Such  stamps  would  not  have  artwork\r\n\r\nprobably.  There will definitely not be any printing  proofs,\r\n\r\nno  dyes  or artifacts will be created and they may not  even\r\n\r\nhave adhesive or be printed or stamped directly on the postal\r\n\r\narticle itself. This whole section seems to describe, if  you\r\n\r\nmight  say,  Sir,  obsolete  technology.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister could look into this and clarify that this does  not\r\n\r\nstop any development in the e-postage stamp category.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 28. Clause 28 of the Bill deals with\r\n\r\nthe  damage to the installation or plants used for posts  and\r\n\r\nit  covers essentially what the old section 77 of the TAS Act\r\n\r\ndeals   with,   and  that  is,  you  cannot   intercept   the\r\n\r\ntransmission or delivery of a postal article if you  were  to\r\n\r\ntouch, tamper, remove or damage the installation or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplant of the postal services and the postal licensee.  I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  this  during the debate on the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nBill  and I want to mention the same point here that  in  the\r\n\r\nera  of  e-commerce, we have to increasingly assure consumers\r\n\r\nand  businessmen that when they go to e-commerce, it does not\r\n\r\nmean  that  they  will  lose all  their  privacy  and  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that we look at making sure our laws do cover  this\r\n\r\nunauthorised  interception  of  messages  and   letters   and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this clause, I think that it is not wide enough to\r\n\r\ncover  a situation where if the postman has delivered into  a\r\n\r\nprivate mailbox.  It is no longer a plant of SingPost  -  and\r\n\r\nthat private mailbox is opened and somebody reads the letter,\r\n\r\nseals  it  and puts it back again.  And that is  not  illegal\r\n\r\nbecause   under  this  current  definition,   no   plant   or\r\n\r\ninstallation  of SingPost has been touched.  I  would  prefer\r\n\r\nthat  to be not so, because we must protect private mail  all\r\n\r\nthe  way  until  it  is received and read  by  the  addressee\r\n\r\nhimself.   If  you were to look at it harder, I am  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  it  may not cover a situation where currently SingPost,\r\n\r\nfor  example, uses part-timers.  Many of them are  housewives\r\n\r\nand  they  help to deliver the mail.  And sometimes they  may\r\n\r\nactually be using paper bags or shopping bags that may not be\r\n\r\nSingPost's  plant  or  equipment.  I am concerned  that  this\r\n\r\nwould  then escape the penalty provisions of clause 28 and  I\r\n\r\ndo  hope that the clause is not meant to be taken so absurdly\r\n\r\nand narrowly.  If the Minister could clarify that, I would be\r\n\r\nmost obliged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Prof. Toh\r\n\r\nSee Kiat for his constructive comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the point about V-post and e-mail services,\r\n\r\nI  would like to clarify that this Bill basically deals  with\r\n\r\nthe  physical delivery of letters and postcards.  For e-mails\r\n\r\nand  so on, it does not come under this Bill.  E-mails  would\r\n\r\nbe covered under the Telecommunications Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on Prof. Toh's point about the \"reconstituted\"\r\n\r\nTAS,  as  my  Minister has mentioned earlier, we would  check\r\n\r\nwith the Attorney-General again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also spoke on clause 4 regarding exclusive\r\n\r\nprivilege.   I  want to assure the Member that the  exclusive\r\n\r\nprivilege  here refers to the privilege given to  the  Postal\r\n\r\nAuthority,  in this particular case, the IDA.   The  IDA  can\r\n\r\nissue  licences  for  sectors that  are  deregulated.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier,  for  the  high-growth  sector,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  deregulated the market.  In fact,  at  this  moment,\r\n\r\nthere  are  110  companies competing  with  SingPost  in  the\r\n\r\nderegulated segment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Dr Toh asked what happens if the letter\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have  the \"Consignee's letter\" stamp  on  it.   My\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that, as long as the letters or postcards in\r\n\r\nquestion  concern  solely  any  goods  or  property   to   be\r\n\r\ndelivered,  and do not serve other purposes,  these  will  be\r\n\r\nexempted under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned the presumption on imposition of an\r\n\r\nindirect  import tax in clause 15.  I would like  to  clarify\r\n\r\nthat  what this Bill does is to make clear that the addressee\r\n\r\nis  presumed under the law to be the importer of  the  goods.\r\n\r\nWhether  he  has  to pay duties directly or indirectly,  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  covered under the Customs and Excise Act,  and  not\r\n\r\nunder this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned clause 19 regarding e-postage stamp.\r\n\r\nAgain,  this  Bill  covers  only  the  physical  delivery  of\r\n\r\nletters.  So e-mails and e-postage come under a separate Act,\r\n\r\nwhich is the Telecommunications Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 28 regarding the unlawful interception of\r\n\r\nletters,  basically,  this clause covers  the  protection  of\r\n\r\ninstallation  and  plant.  If a person  were  to  retain  any\r\n\r\nletters illegally and unlawfully, this would be covered under\r\n\r\nclause  36.   If an employee were to do something wrong  with\r\n\r\nthe  letters, whether he is a part-timer or full-timer,  this\r\n\r\nwill be covered under clause 34.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed the concerns\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  Prof. Toh.  Once again, I thank  him  for  his\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State a question on clauses 34 and  36.   These\r\n\r\nclauses relate to retention.   But my scenario is one where a\r\n\r\nperson  opens up a letter, reads whatever he needs  to  read,\r\n\r\nand  then  seals it and puts it back into the mailbox.   Then\r\n\r\nthere is no offence and I think this is an anomaly, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, clause 36 says, \"Any person who\r\n\r\n. wilfully retains or secretes or makes away with or keeps or\r\n\r\ndetains ..\".  My understanding is that even if a person  were\r\n\r\nto  retain the letter for a short time, that could, in a way,\r\n\r\nbe  covered  under this clause.  But I am not a legal  expert\r\n\r\nand I think we will leave it to the court of law to interpret\r\n\r\nthis particular sentence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, in other words, the\r\n\r\nMinister of State says that it is the intention of Parliament\r\n\r\nthat  even those few seconds of retention is sufficient under\r\n\r\nthe Bill to constitute an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned, the Bill\r\n\r\nstates  quite clearly that  \"any person who wilfully  retains\r\n\r\n.\".   So  for  a  few  seconds, I think it  would  constitute\r\n\r\nretention.   As I said, I am not a legal expert and  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  court of law would do the interpretation.  If  it  turns\r\n\r\nout  to  be different from the intention of the Act, then  we\r\n\r\nhave to clarify and amend the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Mr Lim Swee Say].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUSINESS REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Business Registration\r\n\r\nAct  to  update the Act, streamline registration  procedures,\r\n\r\nenhance  certain  penalties,  harmonize  the  Act  with   the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  and enhance the computerisation  of  services\r\n\r\noffered by the Registry of Companies and Businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Registration Act provides the basic\r\n\r\nframework   of  governance  for  unincorporated   businesses,\r\n\r\nfocusing  primarily on registration, restrictions,  offences,\r\n\r\nand   penalties.   Apart  from  two  previous   consequential\r\n\r\namendments, this Bill is the first proposed amendment to  the\r\n\r\nAct since its enactment in 1973.  The crux of the Bill is  to\r\n\r\nupdate   our   legislation   and   fine-tune   administrative\r\n\r\nhousekeeping matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go on to highlight the main amendments\r\n\r\nproposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension   of   the  validity  period  of  Certificates   of Registration</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill proposes the amendment of section 9\r\n\r\nto extend the validity period of certificates of registration\r\n\r\nfrom  1  year  to 3 years.  This means that a certificate  of\r\n\r\nregistration issued upon registration shall be  valid  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  3 years and shall thereafter be renewable  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 3 years in respect of each renewal.  Figures  from\r\n\r\nthe  Registry of Companies and Businesses show  that  92%  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are still in operation after 1 year  and  require\r\n\r\nrenewals,  whereas  only  59%  of  businesses  are  still  in\r\n\r\noperation  after 3 years.  Presently, much time and resources\r\n\r\nare  spent  following up on annual cases  of  non-renewal  of\r\n\r\ncertificates.  Adopting a 3-year renewal policy will  relieve\r\n\r\nthe  business  community  of  the unnecessary  administrative\r\n\r\nburden of yearly renewal, and reduce business costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Empowering the Registrar to accept cashless modes of payment or renewal of businesses</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 9 to allow the Registrar to make\r\n\r\ncashless  modes  of  payment (eg, GIRO and  other  electronic\r\n\r\nmeans) a condition for renewals, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeemed  necessary.  The same amendment grants  the  Registrar\r\n\r\nthe  discretion  to accept cash in exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment is in line with the national effort to promote\r\n\r\nelectronic  mode of payment, which will help  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nadministrative cost to both the public and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Granting  the  Registrar  the  power  to  refuse  or   cancel registration</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces new sections 31A and 31B that\r\n\r\nempower the Registrar to refuse or cancel the registration of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in instances where it is shown that  registration\r\n\r\nwould  be  for  unlawful  purposes, purposes  prejudicial  to\r\n\r\npublic peace, welfare or good order in Singapore or where  it\r\n\r\nis  contrary  to national security or the national  interest.\r\n\r\nThis  will bring the Act in line with amendments made to  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act in 1984.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Shifting  the  burden  of proof from  the  Registrar  to  the defendant in  cases  where the defendant is alleged to be  carrying  on business under the name displayed at his premises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate prosecution, clause 14 introduces new\r\n\r\nsection  23A  that  shifts  the  burden  of  proof  from  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  the defendant in cases where the defendant  is\r\n\r\nalleged  to be carrying on business under the name  displayed\r\n\r\nat  his  premises.  In such instances, the defendant will  be\r\n\r\nrequired to disprove that he is \"carrying on business\", based\r\n\r\non  evidence  such  as  having a sign  outside  the  business\r\n\r\npremises, rather than the Registrar having to prove that  the\r\n\r\ndefendant  is  doing  business.  Similar  provisions  on  the\r\n\r\nreversal  of the burden of proof are found in the  Misuse  of\r\n\r\nDrugs Act and the Immigration Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fixed time frame for appeals</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces new sections 31B(3) and 31C such\r\n\r\nthat  any person wishing to appeal to the Minister against  a\r\n\r\ndecision   of   the  Registrar  to  refuse  or   cancel   the\r\n\r\nregistration of a business must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeal within 30 days.  This will bring the Act in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  Companies Act relating to the time-frame for appeals  to\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the penalties in the Act have not been increased\r\n\r\nsince  1974, opportunity is being taken to revise  them  now.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes, other administrative amendments\r\n\r\nare  proposed to update the Act and provide for  the  filing,\r\n\r\nmaking  of  payment and other transactions through electronic\r\n\r\nmeans.  The rest of the amendments are of a drafting nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before tabling this Bill, we had sought the views of\r\n\r\nlawyers,  accountants  and interested  parties  such  as  the\r\n\r\nInstitute   of  Certified  Public  Accountants  of  Singapore\r\n\r\n(ICPAS),  the  Association of Small  and  Medium  Enterprises\r\n\r\n(ASME) and the Law Society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing these changes, we have taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  impact these changes would  have  on  the\r\n\r\npublic.   The  amendments  will help reduce  business  costs,\r\n\r\nstreamline the business registration procedures and allow for\r\n\r\nelectronic modes of payment.  We hope that these changes will\r\n\r\nprovide a more efficient way of registering businesses and  a\r\n\r\nmore conducive regulatory environment for businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  start  by  commending the Minister  for  this  effort  to\r\n\r\nconstantly review the business registration processes to keep\r\n\r\nup  with  the  times,  and I am pleased especially  with  the\r\n\r\neffort  to  make  it  friendly  for  electronic  filing   and\r\n\r\nelectronic  payment purposes.  Electronic filing, of  course,\r\n\r\neventually  we  hope, will be one of the  ways  that  we  can\r\n\r\nactually  file our company reports, annual accounts  and  all\r\n\r\nthat.  But that is another matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to just refer to three points very\r\n\r\nquickly.   First, on clause 2.  Clause 2 is an  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection 2 of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Business  Registration Act.   Here,  in  section  2,  we\r\n\r\nessentially have a section that deals with who is registrable\r\n\r\nand  who  is  not  registrable.  I would  like  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  clarification about certain types  of  businesses\r\n\r\nthat are now operating from home like tutors.  Under the T 21\r\n\r\nplan  that  we  have, we are allowing homes to  be  used  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  In the old days, under the First Schedule of the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Registration Act, there were a  lot  of  businesses\r\n\r\nthat were exempted from registration because they happened to\r\n\r\nbe  home-run  businesses.  And I do hope  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  clarify  whether  the home  operations  now  that  are\r\n\r\nallowed under the T 21 plan would be operations that need  to\r\n\r\nbe registered under this Business Registration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to clause 3. A clarification\r\n\r\nneeded  is  whether  this  amendment  would  cover  companies\r\n\r\nincorporated  under the Companies Act (Cap. 50)  and  whether\r\n\r\nthese companies can use acronyms and short form names without\r\n\r\nregistering   these   acronyms  and  names.    For   example,\r\n\r\n\"International  Business Machines Pte  Ltd\"  could  trade  as\r\n\r\n\"IBM\"  without  any  registration.  Or  whether  \"X  Malaysia\r\n\r\nRubber  Traders  Pte Ltd\" could trade as \"XX Rubber\"  without\r\n\r\nfurther  registration.  This assumes,  of  course,  that  the\r\n\r\nearlier  incorporation is all validly done.   And  how  about\r\n\r\nwords  that  are added on to a company's name?  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  registered company name is \"ABC International Tours  Pte\r\n\r\nLtd\" and they trade as \"ABC International Tourists Centre\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.44 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point would really relate to the whole\r\n\r\nprocess  of  business registration in Singapore, and  I  just\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Minister to continue reviewing this process.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of Finance has done well and the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies  and  Businesses  has done  well  to  shorten,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  some  of the processing time for registration,  the\r\n\r\nred  tape and all that goes along with registering a business\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Despite its responsiveness in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent  years,  I  do know and I am told  that  it  is  still\r\n\r\nnonetheless not competitive, in the sense that if I  register\r\n\r\na  company  or  a  business  right  now  in  Silicon  Valley,\r\n\r\nCalifornia   -  and indeed I am told that this is being  done\r\n\r\n-  at the same time that I register the company in Singapore,\r\n\r\nmy  Silicon Valley company would be formed first, and I think\r\n\r\nthis is something which we must correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, we also need to look at further rules that\r\n\r\nsometimes  are accretions to the Act, meaning that  they  are\r\n\r\nadded  on  to the Act without really much thought.  And  this\r\n\r\nwould  be  certain  requirement, for  example,  for  a  local\r\n\r\nresident manager in an Internet world where the people  could\r\n\r\nbe  operating a business from across the world.  It would  be\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  for them to find a local  resident  manager.\r\n\r\nInvariably, they may actually appoint a local who has nothing\r\n\r\nto  do with the business to represent them in Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nI think these rules have to be constantly reviewed to make us\r\n\r\nresponsive in a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thank Prof. Toh See Kiat for\r\n\r\nhis  general support of the amendments.  He has three  points\r\n\r\nwhich I will respond to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, he wants clarification as to whether people\r\n\r\noperating  from home offices or who are doing home tuitioning\r\n\r\nwould   be  exempted  like  those  operations  in  the  First\r\n\r\nSchedule.   I  have to tell him that they are  not  exempted.\r\n\r\nThose  who are exempted under the present First Schedule  are\r\n\r\npeople like taxi-drivers, craftsmen or farmers of low-skilled\r\n\r\nactivity.   And the home office is a provision  which  is  to\r\n\r\nallow people to operate from home where normally they operate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  office  and  generally of a  higher  skill  level.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  such people who operate from the home still  have\r\n\r\nto apply for registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it will apply for home tutors. They are also\r\n\r\nnot  exempted,  although we believe a number of  home  tutors\r\n\r\nhave not registered on the assumption that they are exempted.\r\n\r\nThey are indeed not exempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also wants to know, under clause 3, whether\r\n\r\ncompanies  can use acronyms or other short forms for  trading\r\n\r\nunder the Act.  I would like to clarify that the amendment in\r\n\r\nquestion  is  simply  a  drafting  change  to  get   rid   of\r\n\r\nsuperfluous  words such as \"without any addition\".   Removing\r\n\r\nthese  words will not change the intent of the Act.   So  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of the provision in section 4 remains unchanged.   If\r\n\r\ncompanies  want to operate under a different  name,  it  will\r\n\r\nstill  be required to register.  For example, IBM, a  foreign\r\n\r\ncompany,  which operates under its own corporate name  wishes\r\n\r\nto  use  an  acronym for some other purpose, then under  that\r\n\r\nname, they will have to apply for registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he compares the speed of business registration\r\n\r\nat  Silicon Valley to Singapore.  I would like to assure  him\r\n\r\nthat   we   will  do  everything  possible  to  shorten   the\r\n\r\nregistration period.  But even under the existing rules,  for\r\n\r\nbusiness  firms, the turnaround time is usually no more  than\r\n\r\n24  hours,  except for a few cases where the questions  arise\r\n\r\nwhether the directors involved have records which need to  be\r\n\r\ntracked.   For  corporations, it normally  takes  about  five\r\n\r\nworking  days for the company name to be approved and another\r\n\r\nfive days for the company to be incorporated.  This is longer\r\n\r\nthan  in the Silicon Valley where we understand that it could\r\n\r\ntake  three to five days to register a company, although some\r\n\r\nbusinesses have been turned around within 24 to 48 hours.   I\r\n\r\nthink our record is not bad.  Although the periods are longer\r\n\r\nthan  Silicon  Valley,  they are quite acceptable  in  normal\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  But we will try our best to improve it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE FORCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the  Bill  be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) was set up in\r\n\r\nOctober  1984 as a specialised agency within the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  to  investigate  and  enforce  serious  and  complex\r\n\r\ncommercial fraud cases.  In March 1989, Parliament  conferred\r\n\r\ncertain  police  powers on the Director  CAD  and  Commercial\r\n\r\nAffairs  Officers  (CAOs)  appointed  by  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, depending on the classification of the\r\n\r\noffences,  most  major  commercial  crimes  are  investigated\r\n\r\neither by the CAD or the Criminal Investigations Department's\r\n\r\nCommercial Crime Division (CCD).  The CAD is responsible  for\r\n\r\ninvestigating  and  prosecuting  complex  commercial  crimes,\r\n\r\nincluding  offences under the Securities  Industry  Act,  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act,  the Corruption, Drug Trafficking  and  Other\r\n\r\nSerious  Crimes  (Confiscation of  Benefits)  Acts,  and  the\r\n\r\nFutures   Trading  Act.   CID's  Commercial  Crime   Division\r\n\r\ninvestigates  fraud offences punishable, for  example,  under\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code, and the Multi-Level Marketing  and  Pyramid\r\n\r\nSelling (Prohibition) Act.  Over the years, CAD has built  up\r\n\r\nits  strength  in  combating complex fraud, syndicated  white\r\n\r\ncollar  crimes, securities offences, such as insider  trading\r\n\r\nand market rigging, and serious corporate offences, while CCD\r\n\r\nhas  had  considerable successes against cheats, credit  card\r\n\r\nfraudsters  and  syndicates behind scams that  promise  quick\r\n\r\nprofits.

As Singapore opens up its  finance\r\n\r\nsector and further develops as a regional financial hub,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our  capital market, banking  and  financial\r\n\r\nindustries  and  electronic commerce  is  likely  to  attract\r\n\r\nincreasingly    sophisticated   commercial   crime    frauds.\r\n\r\nCommercial  crimes in the coming years are likely  to  become\r\n\r\nmore complex and the perpetrators may be involved in a mix of\r\n\r\ncompany  and  penal code offences - expertise  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthese  should therefore be merged.  An effective  enforcement\r\n\r\nregime  is critical to protect the integrity of our financial\r\n\r\nmarkets and business environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increasing sophistication and complexity of\r\n\r\ncommercial   crimes  necessitates  the  pooling   of   scarce\r\n\r\nresources,  the enforcement and intelligence capabilities  in\r\n\r\nCAD and CCD, into a single unit.  So early next year, the CAD\r\n\r\nand  CCD  will  merge.  The CAD will be  reconstituted  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate  department in the Singapore Police Force  with  the\r\n\r\nsame standing as the CID.  The combined department will still\r\n\r\nbe known as CAD to retain its reputation as the premier anti-commercial crime agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CAD will investigate a wide spectrum of major\r\n\r\ncommercial   crimes.   Other  commercial  crimes,   such   as\r\n\r\ncheating, will still be handled by the Police land divisions.\r\n\r\nBy  merging the CCD with the CAD, investigative resources and\r\n\r\nintelligence  capabilities will be pooled, thereby  resulting\r\n\r\nin  synergies  and  even greater effectiveness  in  combating\r\n\r\ncommercial  crimes.  The CAD will be working in collaboration\r\n\r\nwith  the  Financial and Securities Offences sub-division  of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal  Justice  Division  in  the  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers,  a dedicated specialist unit formed in August  this\r\n\r\nyear.   A  mechanism will be put in place to ensure that  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of CAD to the Police Force will not result  in  CAD\r\n\r\nlosing  touch  with  MAS and the Finance Ministry  on  policy\r\n\r\ndevelopment issues relating to the financial sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Commercial Affairs Officers appointed by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance already  have  police  powers  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate offences under the Companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct,  the Securities Industry Act and other seizable offences\r\n\r\nunder   any   written  law  disclosed  in   the   course   of\r\n\r\ninvestigations  under the Companies Act  and  the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Act as provided under section 409B of the Companies\r\n\r\nAct.   In  order to ensure that the new CAD has the necessary\r\n\r\nlegal powers to carry out their functions effectively, clause\r\n\r\n2 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 58A to empower\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs to appoint Commercial  Affairs\r\n\r\nOfficers  to  investigate  any suspected  offence  under  any\r\n\r\nwritten  law.  The new section also confers on CAOs, for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of investigation, all the powers of investigation of\r\n\r\npolice  officers  under the Criminal Procedure  Code  or  any\r\n\r\nother  written  law  as  the Minister for  Home  Affairs  may\r\n\r\nprescribe  by  notification in the Gazette.   The  Commercial\r\n\r\nAffairs  Officers are also given the immunities  relating  to\r\n\r\nacts  done in obedience to a warrant under section 37 of  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to repeal section 409B of the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  as  CAD  will  now  be  reconstituted  as   a\r\n\r\ndepartment under the Singapore Police Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this combination of two elite departments marks a\r\n\r\nnew milestone in our efforts to gear up for the challenges of\r\n\r\nthe  new millennium.  The reconstituted CAD will go beyond  a\r\n\r\nmere  transfer of the current functions of CAD to the  Police\r\n\r\nForce  and the AGC.  We will expand the capabilities  of  the\r\n\r\nnew  CAD  to match the increasingly sophisticated  nature  of\r\n\r\ncommercial  crime.  The new CAD will strive  to  be  a  world\r\n\r\nclass   investigative/enforcement  agency,   in   line   with\r\n\r\nSingapore's growing status as a financial hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill and the reasons given by the Minister as  to\r\n\r\nwhy the CAD will be merged with the CCD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only two clarifications to ask of the Minister.\r\n\r\nClause  2  inserts a new section 58A which provides  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment of Commercial Affairs Officers.  By integrating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  officers into the Force, they are given the  power  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  any  suspected offence  under  written  law.   I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to  ask the Minister whether  this  means  that\r\n\r\nofficers  will  all be retrained to perform a wider  role  in\r\n\r\ninvestigation.    By  empowering  them  to  investigate   any\r\n\r\nsuspected offence, is it the intention that they be  regarded\r\n\r\nas regular Police Officers who may be expected to investigate\r\n\r\nall manner of crimes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these officers are to be invested with the\r\n\r\npowers of investigation with the rank of not below inspector.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Commissioner of Police may confer the powers of\r\n\r\nan ASP (Assistant Superintendent of Police) on such officers.\r\n\r\nYet  the  general provisions of the Police Force Act  do  not\r\n\r\napply  to  them  other  than  section  37  which  is  already\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Minister.  That section exempts  them  from\r\n\r\nliability  if they perform an act that was done in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  warrant.  Can the Minister clarify  whether  these\r\n\r\nofficers  are  to  be subject to the same discipline  as  the\r\n\r\nother members of the police force?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a query\r\n\r\nfor the Minister under subclause (2) of this new clause.   As\r\n\r\nit  now  stands, it reads \"A Commercial Affairs  Officer  may\r\n\r\ninvestigate  any suspected offence which appears  to  him  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  committed under any written law.\"  I  am  puzzled\r\n\r\nthat  the  legislation proposes to give powers  to  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer  to \"investigate any suspected offence which  appears\r\n\r\nto  him  .\".   Under the Criminal Procedure Code, police  can\r\n\r\nonly  investigate  where  there  is  a  report  or  complaint\r\n\r\nreceived  at  a police station and reduced into  writing,  or\r\n\r\nwhere an offence is committed by any member of the public  in\r\n\r\nthe  view  of a police officer.  What exactly is contemplated\r\n\r\nby the word \"appears\"?  Is this Commercial Affairs Officer to\r\n\r\nbe  given power to investigate where there is no complaint or\r\n\r\nno information received, but where he thinks there might have\r\n\r\nbeen an offence committed under a written law?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned by the Minister himself, this\r\n\r\nofficer is now not only confined to offences which previously\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial  Affairs Department was confined  to  investigate,\r\n\r\nbut  now a whole box of offences has been open to him because\r\n\r\nit  is  any offence under any written law.  Should  not  some\r\n\r\nrestraint  be  imposed  before a Commercial  Affairs  Officer\r\n\r\nbegins  to  investigate?  Or is he going  to  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  anything just because he suddenly gets  it  into\r\n\r\nhis  head  that somebody may have committed some  offence  or\r\n\r\nsome  companies have committed some offence?   It  opens  the\r\n\r\ndoor  to abuse.  I think there must be some restraint, as  is\r\n\r\nthe  case with police officers in the investigation of crimes\r\n\r\nand other offences.  Even the CPIB will have to have a report\r\n\r\nor   complaint   received   before   they   embark   on   any\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  So would the Minister explain what exactly is\r\n\r\nmeant by the phrase \"appears to him\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me deal with Prof. Chin's\r\n\r\nquestion first.  Would the officers be retrained to perform a\r\n\r\nwider  role?  These Commercial Affairs Officers have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  on  the job for a long time.  They have been  conferred\r\n\r\nwith   police  powers  since  1989  to  investigate  seizable\r\n\r\noffences  under the Companies Act and the Securities Industry\r\n\r\nAct,  or any other seizable offences disclosed in the  course\r\n\r\nof  such investigation.  So they already know how to exercise\r\n\r\nsuch  police powers.  In the reconstituted CAD, they will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  powers to investigate offences disclosed  under  other\r\n\r\nActs, for example, the Penal Code, Futures Trading Act and  a\r\n\r\nlist of other Acts.  So they are not fresh or totally new  to\r\n\r\nthe  way  the police conducts its investigation and therefore\r\n\r\nthey  are not unfamiliar with the procedures.  What they need\r\n\r\nto  do of course is to be familiar with the Acts as well.   I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member that proper training will be given  to\r\n\r\nthem.   They  are  not police officers.  They are  Commercial\r\n\r\nAffairs  Officers,  civilian  officers  who  have  powers  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate   certain  offences,  just  like  the   CPIB   or\r\n\r\nImmigration officers who are civilians and who have powers to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the offences committed under the Acts under their\r\n\r\ncharge.  So this is not something new that we are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force Act does not apply to them, but\r\n\r\ncertainly the civil service rules,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  disciplinary procedures and the IMs do  apply  to  them.\r\n\r\nThey  are  fully aware of what they have to do  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the reputation that they have acquired over the last\r\n\r\n15  years.   There  has not been any incident  that  I  could\r\n\r\nrecall  that  these  officers have  abused  the  powers  when\r\n\r\nexercising the powers which they have under those Acts  which\r\n\r\nhave been prescribed.  So I do not worry that, by giving them\r\n\r\nmore  powers to investigate offences under other  Acts,  they\r\n\r\nwill abuse their powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam raised this drafting point in clause 2.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the way the law has been drafted by the  AG  and  I\r\n\r\ndepend  on the AG for legal advice on the way the law  should\r\n\r\nbe  drafted.  I have no reason to doubt that that  will  open\r\n\r\nitself to abuse.  What we know in Singapore is that the  laws\r\n\r\nare  clear enough.  There are rules and guidelines and  there\r\n\r\nis  recourse for people who feel that their rights have  been\r\n\r\ntransgressed  to take the matter to the proper channels.   So\r\n\r\nif  an  officer abuses his powers for whatever  reason,  just\r\n\r\nbecause  he does not like a certain person and he  starts  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate that person, that would be an abuse of power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anyone here more concerned about\r\n\r\nabuse of police powers than I am for the reason that our  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies  have acquired a  reputation  which  is\r\n\r\nquite high.  Anybody who tries to abuse his powers and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult undermines public confidence in the organisation  will\r\n\r\nbe  disciplined and, if necessary, charged in the courts.  So\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  safeguards  and there  will  be  checks  and\r\n\r\nbalances.   For  the  CAO  who  investigates  and  eventually\r\n\r\nrecommends a prosecution, the decision does not lie with  the\r\n\r\nCAD, nor does it lie with the Commissioner of Police.  Unlike\r\n\r\nnow,  the  decision to prosecute in the great part  is  being\r\n\r\ndecided  by  the CAD Director in consultation  with  the  AG.\r\n\r\nUnder  the new arrangement, the CAD officers will investigate\r\n\r\nand send their investigation papers to the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  which has a specialist team to study and eventually\r\n\r\ndecide on prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that any investigation can be conducted\r\n\r\nwithout a complaint or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreport.   So  if  Mr  Jeyaretnam  thinks  that  just  because\r\n\r\nsomebody does not like another person's face an investigation\r\n\r\ncan  be launched, then let me assure him that that would  not\r\n\r\nbe the case.  If he does know of any case, please let me know\r\n\r\nand I will certainly look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister by way of\r\n\r\nclarification?   Instead of saying that if  the  officers  do\r\n\r\nabuse  their powers, there are methods of finding out, is  it\r\n\r\nnot  better to confine their investigating powers?  And would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, I am quite serious about this, refer this back\r\n\r\nto   the  Attorney-General  to  consider  whether  the   word\r\n\r\n\"appears\"  should  be  taken out and something  else  put  in\r\n\r\nplace?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if the Commercial Affairs\r\n\r\nOfficer  decides that that is a matter to be pursued  and  he\r\n\r\nconducts  an investigation but actually there is no basis  to\r\n\r\ndo  so  and  therefore abuses his power, the matter  will  be\r\n\r\nfound  out.   There will be internal checks.  There  will  be\r\n\r\nmeetings.   There will be proper follow-up.   There  will  be\r\n\r\noperating  procedures  to ensure that  whatever  the  officer\r\n\r\ninvestigates  is  proper, and there is a basis  for  such  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his question on clause 2, I do not think that this\r\n\r\nis  the  only piece of legislation that has the words  \"which\r\n\r\nappears  to him\".  I am sure there are also other  pieces  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  that have the word \"appears\" and I  am  sure  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam,  as a lawyer, should know.  And,  as  I  said,  I\r\n\r\ndepend  on the Attorney-General for his advice whom I  deeply\r\n\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment, read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thirteen minutes past</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Five o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1999/19991123/19991123-HA-0710505.htm\">Table - Summary of Adjustments to November 1998 Cost Cutting Package (Cols. 505-6)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
