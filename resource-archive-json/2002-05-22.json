MTERA provides for an opt-in  system for organ donations, whereas HOTA provides  for  a\r\n\r\npresumed consent system covering only kidneys from accidental\r\n\r\ndeaths.   Both  laws are narrowly defined and refer  only  to\r\n\r\ncadaveric  donations.   My Ministry  regulates  living  donor\r\n\r\norgan  transplantation through professional guidelines.   The\r\n\r\nexisting guidelines allow living donors who are related.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, MOH announced that it was prepared to\r\n\r\nconsider  living  unrelated  organ  transplants.    We   have\r\n\r\nexamined  the  regulations and practices of  other  countries\r\n\r\nthat  allow living unrelated organ donations and have  worked\r\n\r\nout a set of ethical guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are legitimate concerns about allowing living\r\n\r\nunrelated organ transplants.  Firstly, there are risks to the\r\n\r\ndonor from the procedure, particularly for organs such as the\r\n\r\nliver,  where  the risk of death or medical complications  is\r\n\r\nsignificant.   Secondly,  there  is  a  danger  that  healthy\r\n\r\nindividuals  may be offered financial inducements  to  donate\r\n\r\ntheir organs, thus creating the potential for organ trading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH is therefore very careful in allowing living\r\n\r\nunrelated organ transplants. They would only be allowed under\r\n\r\nexceptional   circumstances  if  they  meet   the   following\r\n\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the medical condition must be urgent;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) all options for organ donation by a living relative\r\n\r\nof  the  patient  have  been explored and  found  to  be  not\r\n\r\npossible;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the donor's motive must be purely altruistic,\r\n\r\nas   established   through  a  review   by   an   independent\r\n\r\npsychiatrist and a medical social worker, and stated  by  the\r\n\r\ndonor in a statutory declaration; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the risks and the possible outcomes of the\r\n\r\noperation  must be fully explained to, and accepted  by,  the\r\n\r\ndonor and the recipient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, and better, option to increase the availability\r\n\r\nof  organs  for  transplantation is to raise  the  number  of\r\n\r\ncadaveric  organs.   To  achieve this  aim,  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconsidering amending the Human Organ Transplant Act, such  as\r\n\r\nincluding non-accidental deaths under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rather\r\n\r\nthan  leave the matter to guidelines, which means a  decision\r\n\r\nwould  then  have  to  be  made by,  presumably,  a  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficial,  would it not be practical to have  legislation  to\r\n\r\npermit the transplant of the organs, so that the decision  is\r\n\r\nnot a discretionary matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, could we also not, when introducing such\r\n\r\nlegislation, take steps to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that it would be an offence to engage in the  trading\r\n\r\nof organs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained,\r\n\r\ntoday  our two Acts, MTERA and the HOTA, cover only cadaveric\r\n\r\norgan  transplants.  All other transplants, particularly  for\r\n\r\nrelated  organ  transplants, we have regulated these  through\r\n\r\nprofessional  guidelines  under  the  Private  Hospitals  and\r\n\r\nMedical  Clinics  Act.   Last year,  we  said  that  we  were\r\n\r\nprepared to look at unrelated living organ transplants.  As I\r\n\r\nalso  said  in  my reply, we are looking at the  Human  Organ\r\n\r\nTransplant  Act,  and  we  will be  conducting  consultations\r\n\r\nsometime towards the end of the year to gauge public reaction\r\n\r\nto  our  proposals to expand the Act.  Right  now,  the  main\r\n\r\nthing  we  want  to expand the Act is, first, to  cover  from\r\n\r\naccidental  death to non-accidental death.  The second  thing\r\n\r\nwe want to put forward to the public to consider is to expand\r\n\r\nthe scope of HOTA, to expand from just kidney to also include\r\n\r\nliver,  and  maybe even cornea.  This is something   that  we\r\n\r\nwant to propose and gauge public response.  And, third, to be\r\n\r\nable   to   move   from  cadaveric  transplants   to   living\r\n\r\ntransplants.   All these are being considered, and  the  best\r\n\r\nway forward, because the Ministry does not want to be too far\r\n\r\nahead  of  community reactions to such changes, we  will  put\r\n\r\nthese  proposals up for consultation.  We will then make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary legislative amendments after that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister how\r\n\r\nwould his Ministry ensure that donors are not under emotional\r\n\r\ncoercion, and that donors know the long implications of organ\r\n\r\ntransplants,  as  well  as the high medical  risks  of  organ\r\n\r\ntransplants, including death?  And whether we should make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  donors to have psychological assessments  or\r\n\r\nevaluation by psychiatrist, apart from being certified fit by\r\n\r\ndoctors for an organ transplant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree with the hon. Member that\r\n\r\nthere are many issues involved, and that is why we are taking\r\n\r\na  more cautious approach before expanding the scope of organ\r\n\r\ntransplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, before we allow a living\r\n\r\nunrelated transplant, we require that the donor's motive must\r\n\r\nbe  purely altruistic, and that the donor must be reviewed by\r\n\r\nan  independent  psychiatrist, and not just a medical  report\r\n\r\nthat he is medically fit.  So, we do have these safeguards in\r\n\r\nplace for living unrelated donor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also concerned about emotional coercion and that\r\n\r\nthere  could  be a risk of financial inducements  leading  to\r\n\r\norgan trading.  We could put in a clause - as we have in HOTA\r\n\r\n-  to say that organ trading is illegal, but then we have  to\r\n\r\nenforce  it.  There are many issues involved and, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we are putting up some proposals.

Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnot  uncommon  to  see refuse vehicles carrying  wastes  leak\r\n\r\nsullage  water  on  the roads.  They cause nuisance  to  road\r\n\r\nusers and residents.  It also pollutes the environment.  Some\r\n\r\npopular  spots  I  notice of the leak of sullage  water  from\r\n\r\ngarbage  trucks are the uphill road in Hillview  Estate,  the\r\n\r\njunction  where vehicles turn from Chua Chu Kang  Drive  into\r\n\r\nChua  Chu  Kang Avenue 3, and the junction, turning from  Toh\r\n\r\nTuck Road into Commonwealth Avenue West.  Under the sun,  the\r\n\r\nsullage  water  emits a strong and unbearable  pungent  smell\r\n\r\nthat  affects the people living near the contaminated  roads,\r\n\r\nand  also the roadusers.  Such dirty and smelly sullage water\r\n\r\nfrom  the garbage trucks is unhygienic and could be a  health\r\n\r\nhazard.  Sullage water must not leak from garbage trucks.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry has  any\r\n\r\nrules  to  prevent  leakage  of sullage  water  from  garbage\r\n\r\ntrucks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, large amounts of construction debris dropped\r\n\r\nfrom  an overloaded lorry, causing two out of three lanes  of\r\n\r\nthe  PIE  unusable.  Luckily, it happened during an  off-peak\r\n\r\nperiod; otherwise, it would have caused serious traffic jams.\r\n\r\nFor  trucks carrying sand, marine clay and incineration  ash,\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  nature of these materials, the  fine  and  soft\r\n\r\nmaterials leak continuously from the gap between the tailgate\r\n\r\nand  the  body of the trucks carrying them.  As a result,  it\r\n\r\ncontaminates the roads, dirties the cars, generates dust  and\r\n\r\npollutes the air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the above problems are partly due to the\r\n\r\ninadequate  design of the waste transportation vehicles,  and\r\n\r\npartly  due  to the negligence of the drivers. What  are  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  by  the Ministry to ensure  that  all  waste\r\n\r\ncarrying vehicles have adequate designs?  Is there any action\r\n\r\nto deter people from committing such irresponsible acts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for sharing their views relating to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement   of  solid  waste  and  water  resources.    This\r\n\r\nafternoon, I would like to respond to the solid waste  issues\r\n\r\nfirst, followed by water issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr Ang Mong Seng\r\n\r\nand Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the reasons for the recent\r\n\r\nincrease  in  incineration fees and refuse  collection  fees.\r\n\r\nSir,  there is no more landfill sites on the main  island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Today, 7,000 tonnes of solid waste are  generated\r\n\r\nand  burnt at our incineration plants every day.  These 7,000\r\n\r\ntonnes are burnt because we need to reduce the volume of  our\r\n\r\nsolid  waste to preserve our landfill capacity.  These  7,000\r\n\r\ntonnes  of solid waste are turned into 1,600 tonnes of bottom\r\n\r\nash.  We then landfill them at Pulau Semakau.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present approach poses two problems. Firstly, every\r\n\r\n5-7  years, we have to build a new incineration plant.  These\r\n\r\nplants are not cheap.  For example, the latest plant we built\r\n\r\nat  Tuas  South  costs $890 million.  It is not  cheap.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  problem is that every 25-30 years, we have to find  a\r\n\r\nnew  landfill  site,  the size of Sentosa  Island.   I  think\r\n\r\nMembers here will agree with me that the present approach  is\r\n\r\nnot  sustainable.  It is not possible for us to build  a  new\r\n\r\nincineration plant at a cost of $890 million once  every  5-7\r\n\r\nyears.   It  is  not possible for us to find a  new  landfill\r\n\r\nsite, the size of Sentosa Island, once every 25-30 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, therefore, have to adopt a new approach to the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of solid waste.  Basically, we have  embarked  on\r\n\r\nthree  strategies.   Firstly,  we  do  whatever  we  can   to\r\n\r\nencourage  the reduction of waste, so that we can reduce  the\r\n\r\namount of waste that goes into incineration.  Secondly,  even\r\n\r\nfor  those waste that has to be incinerated, we try  to  find\r\n\r\nways to re-use the bottom ash, so that they do not have to go\r\n\r\nto  the  landfill site.  And, lastly, for those solid  wastes\r\n\r\nwhich  go directly to the landfill site without going through\r\n\r\nan incineration process, we also find ways to re-use them, so\r\n\r\nthat we can move towards what we call zero landfill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully,  the  day  will come when there  is  no  need  for\r\n\r\nlandfill requirements at all.  In fact, zero landfill is  the\r\n\r\nonly sustainable way for Singapore in the management of solid\r\n\r\nwaste.   This  is  the reason why we have no choice,  but  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to increase the charges for the incineration  fees,\r\n\r\nnot  to  make profits, but only to recover costs.  Even  with\r\n\r\nthe  latest  round of increase to $77 per tonne,  the  amount\r\n\r\ncollected  is  still below the full cost  of  processing  the\r\n\r\nsolid waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incineration fee accounts for about 60-70% of the total\r\n\r\noperation  cost  of  the public waste collectors.   Companies\r\n\r\nthat  collect waste from the households have to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nincineration  cost.   The  fees  they  pay  for  incineration\r\n\r\naccounts  for about 60-70% of their business cost.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why when there is an increase in the incineration\r\n\r\nfees,  they  will have to recover this increase in  the  fees\r\n\r\nfrom the increase in refuse collection fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ENV is mindful that this adjustment will have some\r\n\r\nimpact on our households and, in particular, on the SMEs.  We\r\n\r\nhave  therefore spread out the increase over a period of  few\r\n\r\nyears.   The last increase from $67 to $77 came up  to  about\r\n\r\n15%  increase.   But, of course, incineration  fee  does  not\r\n\r\naccount  for 100% of the business cost - only 60% of business\r\n\r\ncost.   So,  60%  of 15% gives you 9%.  In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nrefuse collection fees for households and SMEs would have  to\r\n\r\ngo  up  by  about 9%, and not 15%, as mentioned by Prof.  Low\r\n\r\nSeow  Chay yesterday.  This works out to about less  than  $1\r\n\r\nper  month  per household.  For HDB flat, it is  about  88-95\r\n\r\ncents per month.  In the case of landed property, it is about\r\n\r\n$1.50  per  month.   In the case of the  hawker  centres  and\r\n\r\nmarket stalls, it is about $5 a month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that nobody likes any increase in the refuse\r\n\r\ncollection  fees.  But, as I have mentioned, the present  way\r\n\r\nof managing our solid waste is not sustainable.  So, the only\r\n\r\nway  for  us  is  to work together to enhance  the  level  of\r\n\r\nrecycling, as that is the only sustainable solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked at what point in time that the\r\n\r\nrefuse  fee  can  be  lowered if the  residents  continue  to\r\n\r\nsupport  waste recycling efforts.  Sir, this is a  very  good\r\n\r\nquestion.   The  refuse fee comprises  two  components.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  component is the service fee that we pay to the public\r\n\r\nwaste  collector for collecting the waste from our doorsteps.\r\n\r\nThe  second component is the disposal fee - for them to  send\r\n\r\nthe  waste  to the incineration plant for incineration.   For\r\n\r\nevery  tonne  of solid waste that the household  is  able  to\r\n\r\nrecycle,  the public waste company will be able to avoid  the\r\n\r\npayment of $77 for that tonne of waste, because he no  longer\r\n\r\nhas  to incinerate that tonne of waste.  But the problem  is,\r\n\r\non  the  whole,  the level of participation in recycling,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the amount of waste being taken out from our  waste\r\n\r\nstream, at this moment, has not reached a critical mass.   As\r\n\r\na  result, the public waste companies are still not  able  to\r\n\r\nderive  enough savings from recycling to compensate  for  the\r\n\r\ncost of recycling infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what it means is that, over time, if we can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  encourage  our  residents  and  households   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in recycling, then hopefully the day  will  come\r\n\r\nwhen  certain precincts could reach the critical mass to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that  the public waste collection companies  will  be\r\n\r\nable  either to contain the rise in the refuse fees, or maybe\r\n\r\neven to reduce the refuse fees, because they will be able  to\r\n\r\nderive  additional value from the avoidance of having to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  the incineration, as well as to be able to derive values\r\n\r\nfrom the recyclables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, the Members of the House here can\r\n\r\nactually do a lot to help us encourage the residents to  take\r\n\r\npart  in recycling.  Hopefully, their precinct will be  among\r\n\r\nthe  first to benefit from having achieved the critical  mass\r\n\r\nin recycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members may ask, is it possible for us to\r\n\r\nachieve a critical mass in recycling?  For me, the answer  is\r\n\r\n\"Yes\".   In April last year, 2001, we initiated the  National\r\n\r\nRecycling Programme.  At that point in time, only 15% of  the\r\n\r\nresidents took part in recycling, meaning 1 in 7.  By\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  end of last year, it has gone up to 22%, 1 in 5.  By the\r\n\r\nend of this year, our target is to achieve 1 in 3, and by the\r\n\r\nend of next year, 1 in 2.  In other words, if we continue our\r\n\r\nmomentum in recycling, we can indeed achieve a critical  mass\r\n\r\nin  recycling.  We have made a good start, but I would  admit\r\n\r\nthat there is still room for improvement.  Take, for example,\r\n\r\nsome  households, even today, are still not issued with green\r\n\r\nbags,  because  the recycling company, for whatever  reasons,\r\n\r\ndecided  that it is not worth their while to issue the  green\r\n\r\nbags to certain categories of households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the companies, even though they were\r\n\r\nsupposed to collect the green bags once every two weeks,  did\r\n\r\nnot  do so regularly.  It has not been consistent and thereby\r\n\r\ncreated a problem for the households.  At the same time, many\r\n\r\nof  the private apartments and condominiums in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nnot  part of the National Recycling Programme yet because the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  waste for private apartments  does  not  come\r\n\r\nunder the ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming months and years, we intend to take\r\n\r\nthree  actions  to  further improve  the  National  Recycling\r\n\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first action we are taking is to expand the coverage\r\n\r\nof  the  National Recycling Programme.  In the  case  of  the\r\n\r\ncondominiums, the participation rate today is only  4%.   Our\r\n\r\naim  is  to  increase it to at least 30% over  the  next  two\r\n\r\nyears.  ENV has started working with 14 major managing agents\r\n\r\nin   the  private  sector  to  introduce  recycling  to   the\r\n\r\ncondominiums managed by them.  Some of them have indicated to\r\n\r\nus that they do intend to introduce recycling within the next\r\n\r\n3-6 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second action that we are taking is to improve the\r\n\r\nquality  of  service of collection.  ENV is now looking  into\r\n\r\nthe introduction of what we call \"Minimum Quality of Service\"\r\n\r\n(QOS).  These QOS standards will be imposed on all the public\r\n\r\nwaste  collection companies, and all companies that  want  to\r\n\r\ntake part in the collection of recyclables.  For example, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare looking into the possibility of requiring them to provide\r\n\r\n100%  coverage  to  every  household  within  their  area  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  It means that they cannot pick  and  choose.\r\n\r\nSecondly, door-to-door collection must be done at least  once\r\n\r\nevery 2 weeks, and on a fixed day of the week, so as to  make\r\n\r\nit  easier and less confusing for the households.  Last,  but\r\n\r\nnot  least, they must be committed to collect a minimum  list\r\n\r\nof  recyclables,  so  that  the scope  of  recycling  can  be\r\n\r\nbroadened  over  time.   At  the  same  time,  we  will  also\r\n\r\nencourage them, for example, to place recycling bins in  void\r\n\r\ndecks, to supplement the door-to-door collection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we will continue to strengthen\r\n\r\npublic  education, and to improve community awareness.   Sir,\r\n\r\nin  this  regard,  we will be working very closely  with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  advisors, Town Councils and so on.  For  example,\r\n\r\nwe  will put up posters on notice boards, in the Town Council\r\n\r\nNewsletters,  and we intend to conduct roving exhibitions  at\r\n\r\nthe various community centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that these three actions, when taken,\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to ensure that the operation of the  National\r\n\r\nRecycling  Programme will become smoother and,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  lead  to  a  greater  level of  participation  by  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds.   Hopefully, this will lead  to  a  reduction  in\r\n\r\nincineration,  and  thereby help  to  contain  any  potential\r\n\r\nrising cost in refuse collection in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, to reduce incineration, household\r\n\r\nrecycling  alone is not enough.  We will continue to  promote\r\n\r\nrecycling in the industries.  In fact, we are very  happy  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  the  level  in  recycling in  the  industries  has\r\n\r\nimproved   last  year  in  the  areas  of  construction   and\r\n\r\ndemolition waste, used copper slab, paper, cardboard, and  so\r\n\r\non.  We are also beginning to see the recycling of food waste\r\n\r\nfrom  the  food  industry.  All these  are  very  encouraging\r\n\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming years, in order to reach a 60% target\r\n\r\nby 2012 under the SGP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2012,  we have set ourselves much higher targets for a  whole\r\n\r\nhost of waste stream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having addressed our strategy to reduce\r\n\r\nincineration, I would like to go on to talk about what we can\r\n\r\ndo  with the incineration bottom ash, when it comes out  from\r\n\r\nthe  incinerators.   As I mentioned earlier,  everyday  1,600\r\n\r\ntonnes of incineration bottom ash are being produced from the\r\n\r\nburning  of  the solid waste in Singapore.  At  this  moment,\r\n\r\nthey  account for two-thirds of the waste that end up in  the\r\n\r\nlandfill site in Pulau Semakau.  Sir, we believe that  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  find  ways to reuse this bottom ash, then over time,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to reduce the demand for landfill.  We started\r\n\r\ndoing  this  with the LTA.  A pilot project is now  on-going.\r\n\r\nWe  were  using  the Incineration Bottom Ash (IBA)  for  road\r\n\r\nconstruction.  If this project is successful, we do intend to\r\n\r\nbroaden the use of IBA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third strategy, which is to\r\n\r\nreduce  the solid wastes that are not being incinerated,  but\r\n\r\nend  up in the landfill site directly.  We call it the direct\r\n\r\nlandfill,  eg,  construction and demolition  waste  and  used\r\n\r\ncopper slab.  Today, these are the two top solid wastes  that\r\n\r\nend  up  in the landfill site directly, and they account  for\r\n\r\n50% of our direct landfill waste.  So, we have decided to set\r\n\r\na  higher target for recycling these two waste streams.  Sir,\r\n\r\ntake  for  example  the case of construction  and  demolition\r\n\r\nwaste.  We are now working with the construction industry  to\r\n\r\nsee how we can increase the recycling rate from 85% today  to\r\n\r\n90%  by the year 2012.  At the same time, in the case of  the\r\n\r\ncopper slab, from 90% to 95%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether something\r\n\r\ncan  be  done to recycle tree branches, trimmings and so  on,\r\n\r\nand turn them into useful products.  Horticultural waste,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by Mr Ang yesterday, is not small.  Every year,  we\r\n\r\nproduce  about 280,000 tonnes.  These are basically generated\r\n\r\nby  the landscape contractors of NParks and the various  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our intention, basically, is to create more\r\n\r\nfacilities in the private sector, through the private sector,\r\n\r\nso that some of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  horticultural  waste can be  turned  into  compost  and\r\n\r\ncharcoal.  Two new facilities will come into operation by the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  year.  Our target is to increase the  recycling\r\n\r\nrate  for the horticultural waste from 32% today to 70%  over\r\n\r\nthe next 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the overall outcome of these three strategies that\r\n\r\nI  have mentioned - reduce incineration, reuse bottom ash, as\r\n\r\nwell  as reuse and reduce the direct landfill, will hopefully\r\n\r\nhelp us to reduce, not just the amount of waste, but also the\r\n\r\namount of waste for landfill.  Today, we dispose about  2,400\r\n\r\ntonnes of solid waste in the landfill site, and this quantity\r\n\r\nis  expected to increase to 3,300 tonnes by the year 2012, an\r\n\r\nincrease of almost 50%.  We believe that the three strategies\r\n\r\noutlined  earlier will enable us to reduce the waste disposed\r\n\r\nat  the landfill site by 50%.  Sir, instead of going up  from\r\n\r\n2,400  tonnes  to  3,300 tonnes over the next  10  years,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to reduce it, from 2,400  tonnes  to  1,600\r\n\r\ntonnes.   And if we can succeed in doing so, we will be  able\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the need for new incineration plants  from  1  in\r\n\r\nevery  5-7  years  to  1  in every 10-15  years.   But,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, we will be able to extend the life-span of Pulau\r\n\r\nSemakau from 25-30 years today, to at least 50 years in  time\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to address some of the specific\r\n\r\ncuts  brought up by the Members.  Prof. Low Seow  Chay  asked\r\n\r\nwhy  do  we  allow some recycling companies to  collect  more\r\n\r\nwaste than they could, and as a result pose a fire risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV is aware that some of the recycling companies\r\n\r\ndo  accumulate  a  large amount of waste at  their  premises.\r\n\r\nWhat  they  really have to do is to upgrade  their  recycling\r\n\r\noperations, so that they can recycle these wastes faster  and\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently.   Under  our  Innovation  for  Environment\r\n\r\nSustainability  Fund,  we  are working  with  some  of  these\r\n\r\nrecycling companies to see how we can help them to  come  out\r\n\r\nwith  new  and better methods to recycle their  wastes.   For\r\n\r\nexample, we are now working with the industry to see  how  we\r\n\r\ncan process the horticultural wastes to produce compost in  a\r\n\r\nshorter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  so that the quality will be more consistent and better.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, we will continue to enforce strict actions\r\n\r\nagainst  those who deliberately flout the regulations.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  past  five years, we only had two cases of fire  in  the\r\n\r\nwaste  recycling  facilities.  One case was  the  wood  waste\r\n\r\nrecycling  company  at Lim Chu Kang.  The wood  waste  caught\r\n\r\nfire in March 1998.  The SCDF conducted an investigation  and\r\n\r\ncame   to   the  conclusion  that  the  fire  was   not   set\r\n\r\ndeliberately.   So  no  legal action was  taken  against  the\r\n\r\ncompany, but that company did clear the debris very promptly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case was the fire in November last year. I\r\n\r\nthink this was the case cited by Prof. Low Seow Chay.  As the\r\n\r\ncase is now in court, I will not comment further on the case.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether there are any rules on\r\n\r\nenforcement to prevent the refuse trucks from leaking sullage\r\n\r\nwater.   Yes,  indeed,  there are rules  and  regulations  on\r\n\r\nrefuse removal operations.  The waste collectors are required\r\n\r\nto  use  compaction vehicles for the collection  of  domestic\r\n\r\nwaste,  as  well  as various organic wastes.   They  have  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the smell and they have to prevent the spillage  of\r\n\r\nwaste.   Before they embark on the road, they have  to  drain\r\n\r\noff  the  sullage water from the compaction  of  refuse  into\r\n\r\nsewers  in the bin centre.  We are aware that there are  some\r\n\r\ntrucks  that  are  still  not conforming  to  the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations.   The  ENV  will continue  to  take  enforcement\r\n\r\naction,  and  will pay particular attention to the  locations\r\n\r\ncited by Prof. Low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether we have any rules to\r\n\r\nprevent vehicles  carrying construction debris and sand  from\r\n\r\npolluting the environment.  The lorries are required to cover\r\n\r\nup   the   construction  materials.   The  ENV  carries   out\r\n\r\nenforcement  rounds  regularly.  Last  year,  there  were  54\r\n\r\noffenders.  When they are caught, for the first offence, they\r\n\r\nare  fined  $150; second offence, $200; third offence,  $250.\r\n\r\nBeyond   that,  for  subsequent  offences,  these   are   not\r\n\r\ncompoundable.  They will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to go to court and the fines will be determined by  the\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed the issues relating to\r\n\r\nthe  management  of  solid wastes.  I will  now  move  on  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  issue  relating  to  the  management  of  water\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th April, the Prime Minister said in this House that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will move away from our reliance on  Malaysia  for\r\n\r\nwater.   Yesterday, several Members  -  Dr Teo Ho Pin,  Prof.\r\n\r\nLow  Seow  Chay  and  so  on  -  have  also  called  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase our self-sufficiency in water  supply.\r\n\r\nSir, in 10 years' time, on the demand side, we can expect our\r\n\r\ndemand  to go up by about one-third, meaning that we will  be\r\n\r\nconsuming  one-third more than what we are  consuming  today.\r\n\r\nThis  is on the demand side.  On the supply side, the  expiry\r\n\r\nof  the 1961 agreement in 2011 will reduce water supply  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Basically,  the  Members  are  asking,  when  that\r\n\r\nhappens in 2011, with higher demand and lower supply, will we\r\n\r\nbe faced with water shortage by then?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, Members of the House, as well as\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public, are concerned  with  three  issues.\r\n\r\nFirst,  will  we have enough water by the year 2011,  if  the\r\n\r\n1961 agreement is not renewed and extended?  Second, will  we\r\n\r\nhave  enough  water from 2011 to 2061?  Lastly, what  happens\r\n\r\nafter 2061?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to assure this House that even though the\r\n\r\n1961  agreement  will  only expire in  10  years'  time,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has already embarked on several key  projects  to\r\n\r\nincrease our own water supply.  I will now give the House  an\r\n\r\nupdate  on this.  First, we are going ahead with three  major\r\n\r\nprojects to increase the supply of the local catchment water.\r\n\r\nWe  are going to convert the Marina Basin into a fresh  water\r\n\r\nreservoir.   Second, we want to create a new reservoir,  down\r\n\r\nstream  of the Lower Seletar Reservoir.  Third, we are  going\r\n\r\nto  link up all the reservoirs in Singapore, so that we  will\r\n\r\nbe able to maximise the yield of the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncatchment areas in Singapore.  These three projects  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted by the year 2009.  They will significantly increase\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of our local catchment water from where  we  are\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are going to proceed with desalination as a\r\n\r\nnew  source  of  water supply.  The cost of desalination  has\r\n\r\ncome down steadily and rapidly by 50% over the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nPUB  has therefore called a tender for 30 mgd of desalination\r\n\r\nwater.   The  tender will close on 31st May.  The plant  will\r\n\r\ncome into production by 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides desalination, what are the other options?\r\n\r\nYesterday,  Prof. Low asked whether we can ferry  water  from\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Indonesia and so on.  Let me  explain\r\n\r\nto  the House that we are talking about securing water supply\r\n\r\nto  meet the long-term requirements of Singapore.  We are not\r\n\r\ntalking  about having additional supply to solve our  problem\r\n\r\nfor one day, one week, next five years or next 10 years.   We\r\n\r\nare  securing  water supply, hopefully, that will  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  supply  system  for the next 50  years,  100  years  and\r\n\r\nbeyond.  In this regard, I do not feel comfortable relying on\r\n\r\nthis idea of ferrying water, no matter what is the amount, no\r\n\r\nmatter  how  cost  effective it  may  be,  from  places  like\r\n\r\nAustralia,  New Zealand and so on.  As pointed out  by  Prof.\r\n\r\nLow,  in  times of emergency, maybe those options are viable.\r\n\r\nBut,  for today, I want to talk about long-term water supply,\r\n\r\nmeaning  sources which will be able to provide  good  quality\r\n\r\nand substantial quantity of water over a long duration  -  50\r\n\r\nyears,  100  years and beyond  - and at a competitive  price.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, over time, we will not be able to contain the cost\r\n\r\nof water if these water sources are not cost competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, I would say that the two strategies,\r\n\r\nwhich  I outlined earlier to expand the local catchment  area\r\n\r\nand  to increase water supply through desalination,  are what\r\n\r\nI  call the strategies of addition.  For example, let us  say\r\n\r\nthat  in our zoo today, we have only one lion.  If we  decide\r\n\r\nthat  one lion is not enough, and we would like to have  four\r\n\r\nlions, what do we do?  One way is very simple.  1 plus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 equals to 4.  So we go out to look for another three lions.\r\n\r\nWe  bring them to the zoo.  Then, 1 plus 3 equals to 4 lions.\r\n\r\nSo this is the strategy of addition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another approach. Assuming that we have a\r\n\r\nlion, and why do we not find a lioness?  With a male lion and\r\n\r\na  lioness, they can together produce baby lions.  1 plus  1,\r\n\r\nmultiply by 2 also equals to 4.  In other words, as  we  look\r\n\r\nfor  a  long-term supply solution, we should not confine  our\r\n\r\nmindset to just looking for new water sources to add  to  our\r\n\r\nsupply.  But, more importantly, we should think about how  we\r\n\r\ncan multiply the capacity of our water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leads me to our third strategy which is to\r\n\r\ndevelop  water reclamation into a major source of  supply  in\r\n\r\nthe  long-term supply system of Singapore.  Some may ask what\r\n\r\nis    the   difference   between   water   reclamation   from\r\n\r\ndesalination.  Why do we say that desalination  is  addition?\r\n\r\nWhy  do  we  say  that  water reclamation is  multiplication?\r\n\r\nThere is a big difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we consume 300 million gallons of water per day.\r\n\r\nEvery  single drop of the 300 million gallons of water, after\r\n\r\nbeing  used,  is  treated by PUB to internationally  accepted\r\n\r\nstandard before it is discharged into the open seas.  And  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that this water is treated to the standard required\r\n\r\nof the international community, we continuously invest in our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to ensure that sewage water will  be  treated\r\n\r\nproperly.   This  is precisely why we embarked  on  the  DTSS\r\n\r\n(Deep  Tunnel  Sewerage System), as mentioned  by  Mr  Zainul\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The DTSS is our long-term solution to ensure that\r\n\r\nevery single drop of used water will be treated properly  and\r\n\r\nin  the  most  cost-effective manner.  In  other  words,  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  DTSS is to help  us  save  money  in  the\r\n\r\ntreatment of used water.  It does not incur additional  cost.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it saves us cost.  Therefore, the concern that  the\r\n\r\nDTSS  may  lead  to  higher water prices  in  the  future  is\r\n\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Zainul also asked whether we can find ways\r\n\r\nto  use  the  DTSS for other utilities.  It is a  good  idea,\r\n\r\nexcept that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe DTSS is very deep.  That is why it is called deep tunnel.\r\n\r\nIt  is about 30-50 metres underground.  It is too deep for us\r\n\r\nto use it for electricity, cable and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me come back to the point about\r\n\r\nwater  reclamation.  As I said, every drop of  water  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing treated before we discharge it into the open seas.   At\r\n\r\nthis  moment,  only  5%  of  the  water  after  treatment  is\r\n\r\nreclaimed  as industrial water.  The other 95%, or more  than\r\n\r\n280  million  gallons per day, is being discharged  into  the\r\n\r\nopen seas, and is really wasted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the advancement in membrane technology, it\r\n\r\nis  now possible for us to recover a good percentage of  this\r\n\r\n95% of treated used water and turn it into clean water again.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, we can really give every drop of water a new\r\n\r\nlease of life.  Instead of releasing this water into the open\r\n\r\nsea, let this treated used water be mixed with sea water, and\r\n\r\nthen  take it back to go through desalination, which will  be\r\n\r\nvery  expensive.  Basically, we are saying,  why  do  we  not\r\n\r\ncapture  this  water before it is being discharged  into  the\r\n\r\nopen sea?  So, we turn the treated used water into new water,\r\n\r\nand  we give it a new lease of life, and that is why the  PUB\r\n\r\nhas called it the NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin yesterday asked whether this strategy is a\r\n\r\ncostly  option.  Will it be very expensive?  In  fact,  water\r\n\r\nreclamation has  two major advantages.  Firstly, it  is  much\r\n\r\ncheaper than desalination.  In terms of capital cost  of  the\r\n\r\nfacility  for  reclaimed water, it  is  about  half  that  of\r\n\r\ndesalination.   Secondly, in terms of energy  consumption   - energy  cost  -  water reclamation costs only one-quarter  to\r\n\r\none-fifth  that of desalination.  Putting the  two  together,\r\n\r\nthe  saving in capital cost and the reduction in energy cost,\r\n\r\nin  fact, NEWater will cost about half to one-third  that  of\r\n\r\nthe cost of desalination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second advantage of NEWater is that it is clean. It\r\n\r\nis  even  cleaner than PUB water.  If we are to look  at  the\r\n\r\ntotal organic carbon of NEWater, it is less than one-tenth of\r\n\r\nPUB water.  Precisely because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   that,  the  industry  users  find  NEWater  to  be  very\r\n\r\nattractive.  Take, for example, the wafer fabrication plants.\r\n\r\nToday,  they take our PUB water and process it to reduce  the\r\n\r\ntotal  organic carbon to a level that is acceptable for their\r\n\r\noperation.   This  will cost them money.  But  starting  from\r\n\r\nnext  year,  all  the wafer fab plants in Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nusing NEWater instead of PUB water.  Why?  Because NEWater is\r\n\r\ncleaner  than  PUB  water,  and is more  suitable  for  their\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prof. Low Seow Chay asked what are we going\r\n\r\nto  do  to  market  NEWater beyond wafer fabrication  plants.\r\n\r\nSir,  this is a very good question.  Our intention is to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  reticulation system to reach out to various industrial\r\n\r\nestates  and commercial hubs in Singapore, so that  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  10  years, we will be able to expand the use of NEWater\r\n\r\nbeyond  wafer  fabrication plants, to various  other  sectors\r\n\r\nsuch  as  semi-conductors, chemicals, electronics, utilities,\r\n\r\nengineering and so on.  Starting with 15 million gallons  per\r\n\r\nday next year for the wafer fabrication plants, our target is\r\n\r\nto  expand the use to more than 55 million gallons per day by\r\n\r\nthe   year  2012.   By  the  year  2012,  NEWater  or   water\r\n\r\nreclamation  will  account for at least 15%  of  total  water\r\n\r\ndemand in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this increase in our water supply, namely, local\r\n\r\ncatchment expansion by the year 2009, desalination  by  2005,\r\n\r\nand  NEWater by 2003 will be more than enough to make up  for\r\n\r\nthe drop in Johor water, by the time the 1961 water agreement\r\n\r\nexpires in 2011.  In other words, to the question whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  enough water by the year 2011, the answer is  yes.   We\r\n\r\nwill  have  more than enough to make up for the reduction  in\r\n\r\nJohor  water.   At the same time, this increase  in  our  own\r\n\r\nsupply will enhance our self-sufficiency in water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question is: during the period between\r\n\r\n2011  and  2061,  will  we have enough  water?   During  this\r\n\r\nperiod, beyond 2011, we expect our total demand for water  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to increase, as our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation  continues  to grow and the economy  continues  to\r\n\r\nexpand.   On the demand side, we need to conserve as much  as\r\n\r\nwe  can,  a very important point mentioned by Dr Teo  Ho  Pin\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The PUB has an on-going educational and publicity\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Over the years, the education programme  and  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of  our  water tariffs  have  been  effective.\r\n\r\nTake,  for example, in 1996 and 1997, the increase  in  water\r\n\r\nconsumption  was  about 4-5% a year.  By  1998  to  2000,  it\r\n\r\ndropped  to 1.2%.  Last year, the growth in water consumption\r\n\r\ncontinues  to decline to 0.5%.  Therefore, I share  Dr  Teo's\r\n\r\npoint that it is very important for all of us to continue  to\r\n\r\ndo  whatever  we can to create this awareness  towards  water\r\n\r\nconservation.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on the supply side, we will continue\r\n\r\nto increase our own supply.  With the three projects which  I\r\n\r\nhave outlined earlier, there is still further scope for us to\r\n\r\nfurther  expand the catchment areas.  At the same time,  with\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of desalinated water coming down, there  is  still\r\n\r\nscope   for  us  to  continue  to  increase  the  amount   of\r\n\r\ndesalinated  water.  But, more importantly,  there  is  still\r\n\r\ntremendous  scope for us to produce a lot more  NEWater  from\r\n\r\n2011 to 2061, and beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just share with the House here that the\r\n\r\nmultiplying effect of NEWater is tremendous.  For example, if\r\n\r\nwe  were to reclaim 50% of the used water, we will be able to\r\n\r\ndouble  the  water  supply  capacity  in  Singapore.   Today,\r\n\r\nmembrane  technology  for  water reclamation  can  achieve  a\r\n\r\nrecovery rate of up to 75%.  At 75%, it means that every drop\r\n\r\nof water can be turned into four drops of water.  This is the\r\n\r\npower   of  multiplication.   So,  the  adding  to  and   the\r\n\r\nmultiplying of our water supply system - expansion  in  local\r\n\r\ncatchment areas, desalination and water reclamation  -  is  a\r\n\r\nvery effective and very powerful combination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the challenge of water shortage is not a\r\n\r\nproblem faced by Singapore alone.  It is a global challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  can be sure that there is research going on today looking\r\n\r\nfor  cheaper  and  better ways of producing  water.   We  can\r\n\r\nexpect  a breakthrough in technology in the coming years  and\r\n\r\ndecades.    We   intend  to  take  full  advantage   of   any\r\n\r\ntechnological breakthrough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, this diversified platform of water\r\n\r\nsupply  will  enable us to increase our  water  supply  in  a\r\n\r\nsustainable  manner  for  the next 50-60  years  and  beyond.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer to the second question, whether we  are\r\n\r\nconfident of having enough water from 2011 to 2061, again, is\r\n\r\nyes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Othman and Mr Ahmad Magad asked whether\r\n\r\nNEWater is safe to drink and, if so, when do we plan  to  use\r\n\r\nit  for  potable use.  The use of reclaimed water for potable\r\n\r\nuse  is not new, as pointed out by Mr Othman.  This has  been\r\n\r\ndone  in several parts of USA for more than 20 years.   Take,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  just outside of Los Angeles,  a  place  called\r\n\r\nOrange  County, they have been using water reclamation  since\r\n\r\n1976  under a project known as Water Factory 21.  This  Water\r\n\r\nFactory  21  produces 13 mgd, and is supplied to a population\r\n\r\nof  about  2.5  million.   They have plans  to  increase  the\r\n\r\ncapacity of Water Factory 21 to 110 mgd over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is North Virginia, a place called\r\n\r\nFairfax  County,  just outside Washington D.C.   Since  1978,\r\n\r\nthey   have  been  implementing  water  reclamation   for   a\r\n\r\npopulation   of  about  1.2  million.   Today,   this   water\r\n\r\nreclamation  plant produces about 44 mgd.  Again,  they  have\r\n\r\nplans  to  expand it to 70 mgd.  At these various  locations,\r\n\r\nthey  discharge  the  reclaimed water  into  the  reservoirs,\r\n\r\neither  aboveground or underground reservoirs.  The reclaimed\r\n\r\nwater  is  then further processed together with the water  in\r\n\r\nthe  reservoirs, both underground and aboveground.  The whole\r\n\r\nprocess is what we call the indirect potable use of reclaimed\r\n\r\nwater.   This  means they do not consume the reclaimed  water\r\n\r\ndirectly,  but  go  through the process  of  mixing  it  with\r\n\r\nreservoir water and process it for the second time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask, if we say that the quality of reclaimed\r\n\r\nwater is so good, why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  is there a need to process the water one more time,  by\r\n\r\nmixing  it  with  reservoir water?   I  asked  the  technical\r\n\r\nexperts and the answer given to me is very interesting.   The\r\n\r\ntechnical  experts told us that the reason  they  do  this  - indirect potable use - is not because the reclaimed water  is\r\n\r\nnot  clean enough, but rather it is because the water is  too\r\n\r\nclean.   After going through dual membranes and ultra-violet,\r\n\r\nit  is so clean that the process takes away the minerals  and\r\n\r\nnutrients  in  the water.  As a result, in all these  places,\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have  to  do is to mix the reclaimed  water  with\r\n\r\nreservoir water because this is the easiest way to  put  back\r\n\r\nthe minerals and nutrients into the water.  After processing,\r\n\r\nit is consumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point to note is that while this process of\r\n\r\nwater reclamation started in the 1970s in USA, it is becoming\r\n\r\na  growing  trend  in  USA and other countries  today.   Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  the  technology  is improving  all  the  time.   The\r\n\r\nquality of the reclaimed water is improving and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, the cost of water reclamation is coming down.  We  were\r\n\r\ntold  that in Atlanta, Georgia, they are now building a water\r\n\r\nreclamation  plant.  Starting with 15 mgd,  which  will  come\r\n\r\ninto operation by 2005, it will eventually be expanded to  50\r\n\r\nmgd.  Again, North Virginia, having been very successful with\r\n\r\nthe project that I mentioned earlier, is now building another\r\n\r\nplant.  Starting with 10 mgd, it will come into operation  by\r\n\r\n2008.  Basically, what is happening overseas has given  us  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  confidence regarding the potential indirect  potable\r\n\r\nuse of reclaimed water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Singapore, the NUS laboratory has\r\n\r\nbeen  conducting very comprehensive analyses  of  NEWater  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the water quality is indeed as good as what  the\r\n\r\ntechnical literature has put it up to be.  These analyses are\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  a panel of experts, both internationally  and\r\n\r\nlocally, because we want to make sure that we tap on the best\r\n\r\nbrains in the world.  The process started more than two years\r\n\r\nago  and  tests are now on-going.  So far, the NUS laboratory\r\n\r\nhas  conducted 20,000 analyses over the last two  years,  and\r\n\r\nthey have established that NEWater is cleaner than PUB water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormally, we look at water quality from three angles;  first,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  chemical  quality such as  the  total  organic\r\n\r\ncarbon,  minerals,  nutrients.  They have established,  after\r\n\r\n20,000 analyses, that NEWater is even cleaner than PUB water.\r\n\r\nNext,  in  terms  of  physical quality such  as  clarity  and\r\n\r\ncolour, again NEWater outperforms PUB water.  In other words,\r\n\r\nNEWater  is  WHO+, because it is able to meet and exceed  the\r\n\r\nWorld Health Organisation's standards.  This explains why  it\r\n\r\nis attractive to the industry for use as high-grade water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is the bacteriological quality of the\r\n\r\nwater.   This is a very important factor because for  potable\r\n\r\nuse,  we are concerned about bacteria count, viruses, and  so\r\n\r\non.  Sir, here, I am happy to inform the House that based  on\r\n\r\nthe  20,000 analyses so far, they have established  that  the\r\n\r\nbacteriological quality of NEWater is as good as  PUB  water,\r\n\r\nbecause  the presence of bacteria and virus is not detectable\r\n\r\n- it is so low.  It is just not present in the water, thereby\r\n\r\nmeeting the World Health Organisation's standards again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if we look at NEWater, it is not only\r\n\r\nWHO+,  it is also PUB+.  It satisfies all the WHO's standards\r\n\r\nand it is even cleaner than PUB water.  Notwithstanding that,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need for us to rush the process.  We intend  to\r\n\r\ntake it one step at a time.  The next step is for us to await\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  from these international  experts.   We\r\n\r\ngive  them enough time to conclude their studies.  We  expect\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations to come to the PUB and the ENV  sometime\r\n\r\nin July.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad asked when will the Visitors' Centre\r\n\r\nfor  NEWater  be  ready.  I am aware  that  the  interest  in\r\n\r\nNEWater  is now getting higher and higher.  This  is  a  good\r\n\r\nsign.   The PUB is now building the Visitors' Centre  at  the\r\n\r\nBedok  NEWater Plant, which will be ready by early next year.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same time, to make it more convenient for our school\r\n\r\nstudents  to get to know more about NEWater, we are exploring\r\n\r\nthe setting up of a Visitors' Centre in the Singapore Science\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me sum up the issue of water supply. As\r\n\r\nMembers of the House have mentioned, it is very important for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to secure our water supply, and to be  more  self-sufficient.  With the increased supply of our local catchment\r\n\r\nareas,  together with desalination and NEWater,  we  are  now\r\n\r\ndiversifying and increasing our water sources from two  today\r\n\r\n- Johor water and local catchment water - to four by the year\r\n\r\n2005.   In other words, if we look at Singapore as a country,\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  four big national taps.  What  is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant to note is that the water coming out from each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one  of  these four taps is of equally  good  quality.\r\n\r\nShould the supply be disrupted in any of these four taps, the\r\n\r\nother three taps can provide the mutual back-up to the fourth\r\n\r\ntap.   We do not know what will happen to the supply of these\r\n\r\nfour  taps.   Maybe drought will reduce the supply  of  local\r\n\r\ncatchment  water.   Maybe pollution in  catchment  areas  may\r\n\r\nreduce  the supply of water from Johor.  We do not know  what\r\n\r\nwill  happen.  But what is important is that we now have four\r\n\r\ntaps.   Whenever  the  supply in one  tap  is  being  reduced\r\n\r\nbecause  of  whatever reasons, at least we have  three  other\r\n\r\ntaps  to  provide the mutual back-up.  Sir, in this way,  our\r\n\r\nsupply  system will not only become more cost-effective  but,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time, more resilient as we become  more  self-sufficient in our water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin yesterday asked:</b> can we be completely self-sufficient in the long term? Sir, the 1962 Water Agreement\r\n\r\nwill  continue to run until 2061.  Therefore,  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nwhether Singapore can be completely self-sufficient does  not\r\n\r\narise  until  2061.  After 2061, of course, we  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  there  will  be an extension of  water  supply  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  This is an on-going issue being negotiated  today.\r\n\r\nBut  what  is important is for us to recognise that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  an  island  surrounded by sea  water.   Today,  with  the\r\n\r\nadvancement  in  membrane  technology,  with  the   cost   of\r\n\r\ndesalination coming down, with the ability to multiply  water\r\n\r\nsources  through  water  reclamation,  the  answer  is:  Yes,\r\n\r\nSingapore  certainly  can become completely  self-sufficient,\r\n\r\nafter 2061, if need be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that I want to assure\r\n\r\nthis  House and our people out there that they can  count  on\r\n\r\nthis  Government to do whatever necessary to ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nwill have enough supply to meet the needs of our industry, of\r\n\r\nour people, today, in the future, for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the Singapore Green\r\n\r\nPlan,  the target for air quality is 85% of good days - \"good\r\n\r\ndays\" being defined as days when the PSI reading is below 50.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that the key pollutants that  matter  in  this\r\n\r\nregard are sulphur dioxide and also particulate matters.  One\r\n\r\nof  the main contributing factors, if we take away the  haze,\r\n\r\nis  diesel  vehicles.  And we know that public transportation\r\n\r\nin Singapore is the main user of diesel vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now in an era where there is a range of more\r\n\r\nenvironment-friendly  options.  The range  includes  electric\r\n\r\nvehicles, hybrid vehicles, right through to natural gas,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   So  the question is: how actively are  we  pursuing\r\n\r\nthese  options as part of our longer term effort  to  improve\r\n\r\nair  quality in Singapore?  I welcome the initiative  of  the\r\n\r\ncompressed natural gas pilot project that the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  has initiated with SBS and also  with  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies, ie, Comfort and City Cab.  I think 30 buses and 50\r\n\r\ntaxis are involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the questions I have are, first of all, what is the\r\n\r\ntime-frame for this pilot project, and what criteria will  be\r\n\r\nused to assess its success and viability for extension to the\r\n\r\nbroader  fleet within the public transportation system?   The\r\n\r\nsecond  question  is that the feedback, in general,  suggests\r\n\r\nthat the upfront cost of many of these green vehicles is  not\r\n\r\nadequately  compensated for by the vehicle rebates  that  are\r\n\r\ngiven  by LTA.  I believe that there has been some discussion\r\n\r\non  this  in  the  debate on the budget of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTransport.   My question for the Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\nis,  assuming  the  Ministry  of Transport's  policy  remains\r\n\r\nunchanged on the matter of green vehicle rebates, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  capital  or  operating cost rebates, what  more  can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Environment do to encourage public transport operators to\r\n\r\nadopt the use of more environment-friendly vehicles?\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, you can take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, my topic is\r\n\r\nheat island.  The Concept Plan 2001 has increased the density\r\n\r\nand  height  of future developments in Singapore.   High-rise\r\n\r\nand  high-density  development will have  an  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  our  living environment,  such  as  ventilation,\r\n\r\nwarming,  pollution and noise.  One area of  concern  is  the\r\n\r\nbuild-up of heat in our built environment due to the  compact\r\n\r\ndevelopment and lack of cross natural ventilation -  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat we call the wind tunnel effect.  This problem is further\r\n\r\ncompounded  by  the  extensive use of airconditioning,  which\r\n\r\nemits hot air to the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1)  What is the long-term plan to prevent the heating up  of\r\n\r\nour  living environment?  (2) What are the measures taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the air ambient temperature is within  tolerable\r\n\r\nlimit?   (3)  How  does  the Green  Plan  2012  integrate  or\r\n\r\ncoordinate with the Concept Plan 2001?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on green consumers. Human activity has\r\n\r\nleft  a  permanent mark, potentially increasing  the  earth's\r\n\r\ntemperature,  destroying massive areas  of  tree  cover,  and\r\n\r\nobliterating  thousands  of  living  species.   When  we   go\r\n\r\nshopping, we use public or private transport, and we choose a\r\n\r\nplace to live.  Our choices have an effect on the quality  of\r\n\r\nthe   air  we  breathe,  or  the  water  we  drink,  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  we  live in.  Everything we do will  affect  the\r\n\r\necological balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1)   What   is  the  long-term  plan  to  encourage   \"green\r\n\r\nconsumerism\"?   (2)  What  are  the  measures  or  incentives\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Ministry to support \"green products\"?

Nonetheless, I noted with  a  tinge  of\r\n\r\namusement  when  MOS  Vivian added that, eventually,  whether\r\n\r\nthese  home-based food operators would take off would  depend\r\n\r\non the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the common complaint we often\r\n\r\nhear  is  how  the public is referred from one department  to\r\n\r\nanother  is  also  making its manifestation  in  this  august\r\n\r\nChamber.  It seems that, although HDB has given its blessing,\r\n\r\nit  is  no  guarantee that such home-based food business  can\r\n\r\ntake  off.   Now,  I would have to refer the  matter  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for the Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to what is foremost in my mind and being an\r\n\r\noptimist,  I am hopeful that the Minister for the Environment\r\n\r\nand  his  MOS had followed through the arguments  I  had  put\r\n\r\nforward  to  the  Minister  for National  Development  in  my\r\n\r\npetition on Monday.  As such, I will not labour over the same\r\n\r\narguments  for advocating an informal sector in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nhelp   the   unemployed,  and  to  nurture   mum   and   papa\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs among the heartlanders by allowing them to  use\r\n\r\ntheir  flat dwellings for operating home-based food business.\r\n\r\nIf  this  group  of  people were to be  granted  licences  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  and  sell their home-based  cooked  food,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we ensure that the hygiene standards  of  the\r\n\r\nfood that they prepare are up to the standards prescribed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry for hawkers preparing and serving food  in  the\r\n\r\nhawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last six months, I have seen no less than\r\n\r\n10  residents who had been fined for selling food  without  a\r\n\r\nproper  licence.  I raise this matter to the  Minister  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  public concern, because of the need to  meet  two\r\n\r\nseemingly  opposing  imperatives.  On  the  one  hand,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned that we help these unemployed people find temporary\r\n\r\nsources of income, while they search and wait for job  offers\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  On the other hand, we need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that standards of public hygiene, with regard to  the\r\n\r\nhandling of food, need to be strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully empathise with the Ministry's concerns in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  granting licences to people who want to  operate\r\n\r\ntheir  food business from their homes and to sell  the  food.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not easy to ensure that hygiene standards are adhered\r\n\r\nto,  because of the diffusion of multiple food businesses  in\r\n\r\nthe  homes of these people.  Nonetheless, as advanced  in  my\r\n\r\narguments  on  Monday, administrative difficulties  in  doing\r\n\r\nsomething  should  not be used as reasons for  not  exploring\r\n\r\nsolutions to facilitate the outcomes that we are seeking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, we can stipulate a number of measures\r\n\r\nto  address these concerns of hygiene standards and  quality.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  we  could  do  the following:  organise  short\r\n\r\neducational,  food  preparation and hygiene  courses  by  the\r\n\r\nCDCs, and aspiring small scale home-based food operators  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to go through this programme before being issued  a\r\n\r\nlicence  to  sell food.  Limit the type of food that  can  be\r\n\r\nprepared from home, eg, cakes, biscuits, desserts, satay  and\r\n\r\nother  dried  food.   I urge the Minister to  consider  these\r\n\r\nmeasures in order that his Ministry can justify the issue  of\r\n\r\nsuch  licences.   In this way, we can ensure  conformance  to\r\n\r\nstandards and practices, and this is where the CDCs can  come\r\n\r\nin  to  ensure  this.   After all, CDCs were  established  to\r\n\r\nprovide  decentralised service to the constituents  to  serve\r\n\r\nthem better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe policies must be responsive to changing\r\n\r\nneeds  and times.  Where we have constraints in making change\r\n\r\nat the Ministry level, the CDCs, at their level, must provide\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility to address the needs of these people.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  do  not comply to specifications can have their licences\r\n\r\nrevoked.   Another way in which the Ministry,  or  CDCs,  can\r\n\r\nalso  maintain a better control of those who have been issued\r\n\r\nwith  a  licence  would be to maintain a  registry  of  these\r\n\r\noperators.  CDCs could consider setting up a central  kitchen\r\n\r\nfor  these small-scale operators to prepare food and organise\r\n\r\nfor distribution of such prepared food to hawker centres,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and other food outlets.

I also understand that  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan, ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho, you are taking too long again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> --- many of their successful\r\n\r\nbusinesses started from home.  Our leaders have been  hailing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to change their mindset.  On this premise, I  am\r\n\r\ncalling on the Ministry of the Environment to embrace  a  new\r\n\r\nmindset.   I  would  like to urge the  Ministry  to  consider\r\n\r\ngranting licences to enable these people to sell their food.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament - Mr Iswaran, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Ho -  for  the\r\n\r\nvery important issues they have brought up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first begin with the issue that Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nbrought  up  on air quality.  If we look at air  quality  and\r\n\r\nlook  at  domestic  factors  that  affect  the  air  quality,\r\n\r\ncertainly, vehicle emissions are the most important.  Of  the\r\n\r\nthree  fuels  that  can power vehicles - petrol,  diesel  and\r\n\r\ncompressed  natural  gas (CNG) - CNG  is  the  cleanest,  and\r\n\r\ndiesel the least clean.   If we compare CNG to diesel, if  we\r\n\r\nuse  CNG,  we  will reduce particulate material emissions  by\r\n\r\nmore than 95%, and it will also reduce emissions, things like\r\n\r\nnitrate oxide, hydrocarbons and sulphur dioxide.  So, ENV  is\r\n\r\ntaking  a  pro-active approach to encourage public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  to try out CNG buses and taxis.  This  is  because\r\n\r\nthe  vehicular  emissions from these  vehicles  are  a  major\r\n\r\nsource of air pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major initiative we have taken is to work with our\r\n\r\nindustry   partners  in  the  establishment   of   supporting\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for CNG vehicles.  The cost of the  first  CNG\r\n\r\nvehicle  refuelling  station in  Jurong  Island  was  jointly\r\n\r\nfunded by the gas company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand    ENV,    under   the   Innovation   for   Environmental\r\n\r\nSustainability  (IES)  Fund.  ENV  has  also  been  providing\r\n\r\nfunding  support to help defray the higher cost of CNG  buses\r\n\r\ncompared  to  diesel  buses, so that the  bus  companies  can\r\n\r\nexperiment with CNG buses and gain a better understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  cost  effectiveness of  operating  CNG  buses\r\n\r\nversus diesel buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is focusing on public buses and taxis as the first\r\n\r\nstep.   If  the  outcome  is  positive  from  operation   and\r\n\r\nenvironmental point of view, ENV intends to facilitate  other\r\n\r\nfleet  owners to try out various types of green  vehicles  to\r\n\r\nprotect our air quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these schemes have just started. We need to wait\r\n\r\nand  see  how they work out.  From this experience,  we  also\r\n\r\nneed  to  see what will be the long-term economic feasibility\r\n\r\nof going completely into CNG.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the issue of higher temperatures in\r\n\r\ncities,  that  Dr  Teo  brought up, this  urban  heat  island\r\n\r\nconcept  was  attributed  to  an American  meteorologist  who\r\n\r\npointed  out that the temperature of cities is a few  degrees\r\n\r\nhigher  than  that of the surrounding areas.  There  are  two\r\n\r\nfactors  that  give  rise to this.  This  urban  heat  island\r\n\r\neffect is, firstly, caused by the absorption and radiation of\r\n\r\nheat  by  man-made surfaces during the day, and the  lack  of\r\n\r\nvegetation to provide shade and absorb the heat in  an  urban\r\n\r\nenvironment.  The second factor is the heat released into the\r\n\r\nurban  atmosphere by combustion processes from  vehicles  and\r\n\r\nfrom  airconditioning and other sources of energy used within\r\n\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV, together with other Ministries, is working to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  heat  island  effect by  tackling  both  causes.\r\n\r\nFirst,  MND,  BCA,  URA and NParks have  already  implemented\r\n\r\nmeasures  that could help to counter, or mitigate, this  heat\r\n\r\nisland effect.  And these measures include, first, the use of\r\n\r\nlighter and cooler roofing and pavement materials that do not\r\n\r\nabsorb or radiate as much heat as dark surfaces or materials;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  by  setting up guidelines, standards and  building\r\n\r\ndesign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncodes  to  reduce  the heat trapped within buildings  and  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  green spaces as far as practicable; thirdly,  by\r\n\r\nplanting roadside trees and shrubs to increase the vegetation\r\n\r\nwithin  the city; fourthly, by provision of parks and gardens\r\n\r\naround buildings; finally, by promoting roof-top gardens  and\r\n\r\nhigh-rise greenery under the concept of Singapore as  a  City\r\n\r\nin a Garden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way of trying to reduce the temperature\r\n\r\nwithin  the city is to reduce the heat produced by the energy\r\n\r\nthat  we  use, and we do this by promoting energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis  is being done under the auspices of the National Energy\r\n\r\nEfficiency  Committee (NEEC).  The NEEC  recently  introduced\r\n\r\nthe  energy  label  scheme  for  home  appliances,  such   as\r\n\r\nrefrigerators and airconditioners, to promote the use of more\r\n\r\nenergy efficient home appliances.  The scheme will extend  to\r\n\r\nother appliances, such as washing machines and TVs.  The NEEC\r\n\r\nis  also  looking  at  other initiatives  to  improve  energy\r\n\r\nefficiency in the industry, building and transport sectors.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Concept Plan 2001 and the Singapore Green\r\n\r\nPlan  2012, the Concept Plan 2001 allows more land to be used\r\n\r\nas  green  spaces and for further greening of  our  urbanised\r\n\r\nlandscape.   With this increased vegetation, the heat  island\r\n\r\neffect  will  be  reduced.   The Singapore  Green  Plan  2012\r\n\r\ncomplements the Concept Plan by encouraging building  designs\r\n\r\nthat make use of better natural ventilation, and hence reduce\r\n\r\nthe  need for air-conditioning and, therefore, more efficient\r\n\r\nuse  of  energy and less use of energy within the city.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore   Green  Plan  2012  and  the  Concept  Plan   2001\r\n\r\ncomplement   each  other  in  our  efforts  to   reduce   the\r\n\r\ntemperature within the city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also brought up a very important point, that of\r\n\r\ngreen  consumerism,  that each and every  one  of  us,  as  a\r\n\r\nconsumer,  has an impact on the environment by our choice  of\r\n\r\nlifestyle and the consumer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts  we  use.  While some amount of official  incentives\r\n\r\nmay  be necessary to start off some green product programmes,\r\n\r\nthey  are not sustainable and cannot be a permanent solution.\r\n\r\nENV  has, therefore, been emphasising awareness-building  and\r\n\r\npublic  education to develop a more environmentally-conscious\r\n\r\npopulation.  Changing mindsets and behaviour, however,  takes\r\n\r\ntime, and requires a comprehensive outreach programme that is\r\n\r\nsustained over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV has embarked on an aggressive programme to build a\r\n\r\nmore  environmentally-conscious  population.   This  includes\r\n\r\nmaking   environmental   education   a   life-long   process,\r\n\r\norganising  public  campaigns such as the  annual  Clean  and\r\n\r\nGreen  Week in November, and sustaining the awareness through\r\n\r\ncommemorating  international events, such as  Earth  Day  and\r\n\r\nWorld  Environment  Day.   We are  also  promoting  community\r\n\r\ninvolvement   through  activities  organised  by   CDCs   and\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these on-going programmes on education,\r\n\r\npublic campaigns and community and grassroots activities, ENV\r\n\r\nhas also launched the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS)\r\n\r\nin  1992.   The  scheme  is  administered  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Council (SEC).  The initial  scheme,  however,\r\n\r\nmet  with  limited success.  There were several  reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis.  One reason is that many consumers were not aware why a\r\n\r\nproduct, as labelled, is considered green.  Another reason is\r\n\r\nthat not many consumers were interested in green products, as\r\n\r\nthey  were  not environmentally-conscious.  Consequently,  in\r\n\r\nthe  past, there was a low demand for green products.  Hence,\r\n\r\nmanufacturers were not keen to apply for the label.  But  ENV\r\n\r\nand  SEC  have since worked together to improve  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nOne  way  is to provide useful information on the label  that\r\n\r\nwould assist consumers in making a choice.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nenergy  label  for  airconditioners  and  refrigerators   was\r\n\r\nlaunched in April 2002.  The label provides energy-efficiency\r\n\r\ninformation to consumers.  This enhancement has met with more\r\n\r\ninterest   from  the  distributors  of  airconditioners   and\r\n\r\nrefrigerators than the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold SGL scheme.  ENV and the SEC will be extending the energy\r\n\r\nlabel  to  other  appliances, such as  washing  machines  and\r\n\r\ndishwashers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, whether the revamped Green Labelling Scheme\r\n\r\nwill  succeed  will  depend on each  and  every  one  of  us.\r\n\r\nManufacturers  will respond only if there  is  a  demand  for\r\n\r\ngreen  products.   If  all of us, as consumers,  can  make  a\r\n\r\ndeliberate  choice  to support green products,  manufacturers\r\n\r\nwill  take the cue.  This is a concrete way for all of us  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate our support and do our bit for the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the issue which Mdm Ho brought up,\r\n\r\nabout home-based small food businesses.  My Ministry does not\r\n\r\nallow  food  intended for sale to the general  public  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  and cooked at home for public health reasons.   The\r\n\r\nconcerns are that food prepared and cooked at home may not be\r\n\r\ndone  under strict hygiene conditions at all times, and  that\r\n\r\nthe persons handling food in the home may not meet our public\r\n\r\nhealth  requirements.  All persons who handle  food  intended\r\n\r\nfor sale to the general public have to be medically screened.\r\n\r\nThey  also have to pass a course on food handling before they\r\n\r\ncan be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike licensed food establishments where their premises\r\n\r\nare  readily  open  for inspection by our Environment  health\r\n\r\nofficers,  food  preparation and  cooking  in  a  residential\r\n\r\npremise  are done within closed doors.  This makes inspection\r\n\r\nand enforcement of public health requirements very difficult.\r\n\r\nIn  comparison, a licensed food shop can be inspected at  any\r\n\r\ntime  the  food  shop  is  open for  business.   No  licence,\r\n\r\nhowever, is required if a person cooks for his or her  friend\r\n\r\nor neighbours.  Such private arrangements are not prohibited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like Mdm Ho, I am sympathetic with those facing\r\n\r\ndifficulty in finding employment.  ENV will not be  intrusive\r\n\r\nand  regulate  private  cooking arrangements  among  friends,\r\n\r\nfamily  members  or  neighbours.   However,  everyday,   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, foreigners and tourists eat out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  public establishments with little fear of food poisoning.\r\n\r\nThis  is due to the vigilance of our public health inspectors\r\n\r\nand  the high standards of hygiene that they ensure.  From  a\r\n\r\npublic  health  point of view, ENV does not intend  to  allow\r\n\r\nfood  prepared for sale to the general public to be  done  in\r\n\r\nthe closed environment of the home.  This is to ensure public\r\n\r\nhealth safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me remind Members that if they make\r\n\r\nlong  rambling speeches, we will not be able to  finish  this\r\n\r\nHead  within  the stipulated time.  That goes for  all  other\r\n\r\nHeads too.  Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nwe  have altogether 124 hawker centres in Singapore, 32  come\r\n\r\nunder  the purview of ENV and the remainder under the control\r\n\r\nof  HDB.   However, the administration of each hawker  centre\r\n\r\ninvolves  three  authorities - the  Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard for rentals, ENV for licensing and the town council for\r\n\r\nthe  collection of maintenance fees and other  charges.   So,\r\n\r\neven  for  a  small  hawker stall, we have to  involve  three\r\n\r\ndepartments and the administrative costs become unnecessarily\r\n\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could lead to much confusion for the hawkers. When\r\n\r\nsomething  goes  wrong, they do not  know  where  to  go  for\r\n\r\nremedy.  A stallholder told me that when the hawker inspector\r\n\r\ncame to check on his stall, he found that there was something\r\n\r\nwrong with the water pipes. The inspector told him that  this\r\n\r\nmatter  was  under the HDB, and he was referred to  the  HDB.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  went  to  the HDB, he was told  that   this  was  a\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and repair matter and it should come  under  the\r\n\r\ncharge of the town council. He went to the town council  only\r\n\r\nto  be told that the piping problem was within the stall, and\r\n\r\nthat  it  was the stallholder's own responsibility to rectify\r\n\r\nit.   I  had to step in to get the town council to look  into\r\n\r\nit. The problem was resolved within four hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this kind of problem would not have happened\r\n\r\nif  the  hawker centres come under one centralised  Ministry,\r\n\r\nie, ENV.  ENV should be the main coordinator,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  handle all matters relating to the hawker centres,  such\r\n\r\nas  issuing of licence, collection of licence fees,  rentals,\r\n\r\nmaintenance charges and looking after other related problems.\r\n\r\nIn  this way, we can have a one-stop service centre under the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment to administer all hawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, on upgrading of hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.   The  hawker  centre is  one  of  the  places  that\r\n\r\nprovides affordable food for Singaporeans, in particular  for\r\n\r\nthe  low-income people.  Watching the trend of prices charged\r\n\r\nby  hawkers, prices are rising.  This is partly  due  to  the\r\n\r\nrelatively  high  prices charged by the stallholders  in  HDB\r\n\r\neating houses, and partly due to the increase in rentals  due\r\n\r\nto tendered hawker stalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading, no doubt, will improve the ambience and\r\n\r\ncomfort  level of hawker centres.  With millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nspent, it is also natural to expect the Government to recover\r\n\r\npart  of the costs through an increase in rental.  The amount\r\n\r\nof   rental  increase  depends  very  much  on  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nupgrading.  I have seen some of the upgraded hawker centres - expensive wall tiles with graphic pattern designs being used.\r\n\r\nI have also seen some of the conceptual designs.  I have seen\r\n\r\nfanciful  roofs and 3-dimensional roof structures  have  been\r\n\r\nadopted.  All these will lead to an increase in the  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction,  and  may  also lead to difficulty  maintaining\r\n\r\nthese   high  3-D  structures.   Ultimately,  these   factors\r\n\r\ncontribute to an increase in rentals and maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what action has been\r\n\r\ntaken  at  the  design stage to keep the cost of construction\r\n\r\nand   upgrading  of  hawker  centres  and  their   subsequent\r\n\r\nmaintenance  costs low.  Does the Ministry plan  to  increase\r\n\r\nrentals  after the upgrading and, if so, what plans does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry have to keep food prices as low as possible  in  the\r\n\r\nupgraded hawker centres?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Amy Khor is not here. Mr Ang Mong\r\n\r\nSeng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, during my overseas\r\n\r\ntrips, I had occasions to visit their public toilets. I found\r\n\r\nthat  the  public toilets in Korea and Japan were very  clean\r\n\r\nand the standard of hygiene there was exemplary.  I would say\r\n\r\nthey  are the best in the world. However, in China, it is  an\r\n\r\nentirely different story. I was told that the ladies  had  to\r\n\r\ncarry  an umbrella whenever they went to the toilet,  because\r\n\r\nthere  were no doors at the toilets.  However, in preparation\r\n\r\nfor  the  Olympic Games 2008, they are sprucing  up  all  the\r\n\r\namenities, public toilets included.  I suppose by 2008, their\r\n\r\npublic  toilets will be as exemplary as those  in  Korea  and\r\n\r\nJapan now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, much has to be done to our public toilets\r\n\r\ntoo.  Years  back,  when I was in charge of  the  Island-wide\r\n\r\nCleanest  Estates Contest, I found that some  public  toilets\r\n\r\nwere quite clean, but overall the standard of cleanliness and\r\n\r\nhygiene  left much to be desired. If we aspire  to  become  a\r\n\r\ngracious society, we should improve the overall image of  our\r\n\r\npublic toilets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what is the progress in the\r\n\r\nupgrading of our public toilets.  As for the toilets  in  the\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops,  some  may say that it is the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  coffeeshop owners to keep their toilets clean.  However,\r\n\r\nthe fact is that the use of these toilets is not confined  to\r\n\r\nthe  customers and staff of the coffeeshops. Members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  also  make use of these toilets, as  coffeeshops  are\r\n\r\npublic  areas  and are accessible to members of  the  public.\r\n\r\nThey are de facto, public toilets, and should be included  in\r\n\r\nthe upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that we have a Public Toilet Cleanliness\r\n\r\nContest,  so  as  to encourage the managers of  these  public\r\n\r\ntoilets  to  keep  the toilets under their charge  clean  and\r\n\r\nhygienic,  and  to  contribute to  our  strive  to  become  a\r\n\r\ngracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay touched on\r\n\r\nthe  issue of upgrading of hawker centres.  I want to  assure\r\n\r\nProf.  Low  that  we are fully aware that  upgrading  of  our\r\n\r\nhawker  centres is a very expensive exercise.  It  will  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  $420  million  over 10 years.  In  batch  one  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme, the total cost came up to about $120 million.  For\r\n\r\nthe  second  batch,  the budget is in the region  of  $50-$70\r\n\r\nmillion.  Therefore, we are equally mindful, as Prof. Low is,\r\n\r\non  the  need  to keep the cost of upgrading  to  as  low  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure Prof. Low and this House that the\r\n\r\nENV  places  emphasis of design basically  on  a  few  areas.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  it is to improve ventilation; secondly, to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  layout  for  better  circulation;  and,  thirdly,  where\r\n\r\npossible, to put in some handicap-friendly features.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we  try  to  make the  seating  arrangements  as\r\n\r\ninnovative as possible, so that groups of different sizes can\r\n\r\nsit together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we have been able to contain the costs of\r\n\r\nupgrading.  So far, based on all the tender returns  that  we\r\n\r\nare  getting,  I  would say that we are able to  derive  some\r\n\r\nsavings from our budgetted sum.  Notwithstanding what I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  I  can  assure Prof. Low that we will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nmindful of the need to contain the costs of upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also made the point that upgrading may lead to\r\n\r\nhigher  rentals, and that higher rentals may lead  to  higher\r\n\r\ncost  of hawker food.  I want to clarify that this is  indeed\r\n\r\nnot  the case.  Yes, we spend a lot of money on upgrading the\r\n\r\ncentres, but it is not our intention to recover the costs  of\r\n\r\nupgrading through rental adjustments.  Just a few weeks  ago,\r\n\r\nI  was  at  the  Adam Road Hawker Centre.  It costs  us  $1.7\r\n\r\nmillion  to upgrade the centre.  But at the end of  the  day,\r\n\r\nthe rental adjustment for the stallholders there was only  $1\r\n\r\nper  day.   In other words, if we were to try to recover  the\r\n\r\ncost  of upgrading through rental adjustment, I work out that\r\n\r\nwe will need something like more than 100 years before we can\r\n\r\nrecover  the  cost of upgrading.  This is not our  intention.\r\n\r\nThe whole purpose of upgrading is to ensure that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  continue to have a place where they can have good  food\r\n\r\nat affordable prices in a conducive setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low asked whether there is anything we are going\r\n\r\nto do to ensure that prices at the hawker centres will not go\r\n\r\nup.   Sir,  this  is an open market.  What I can  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  is  that, under the ENV and HDB hawker centres,  there\r\n\r\nare  altogether  20,000 hawker stalls.  In  other  words,  we\r\n\r\nshould  let market forces work to the fullest.  If  there  is\r\n\r\nany  stall that charges higher prices, I would encourage  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  to  stay away from such stalls.  On the  whole,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that the upgrading programme has progressed  quite\r\n\r\nsmoothly.   By the year 2004-2005, we aim to upgrade  one  in\r\n\r\nthree of the hawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether ENV would consider taking\r\n\r\nover  the function of HDB in managing all the hawker  centres\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   HDB  and ENV do work very closely  together.\r\n\r\nBut  I do see the point brought up by Mr Ang Mong Seng.  What\r\n\r\nI  intend  to  do  is  to discuss with my  colleague  at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development to see whether we can  work\r\n\r\ntogether,  as  suggested by Mr Ang,  to  provide  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nservice to the hawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on to the cut on public toilets. Mr Ang asked\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  progress on the upgrading of  public  toilets.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  National  Parks, SMRT, bus interchanges,  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  and HDB together manage about 1,100 public  toilets.\r\n\r\nOut  of these 1,100 public toilets, 800 of them are found  in\r\n\r\nthe  coffeeshops.  Over the years, these agencies I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  have implemented a systematic programme  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthese public toilets.  For example, for ENV and HDB, we  have\r\n\r\nupgraded  52 public toilets at hawker centres at  a  cost  of\r\n\r\n$5.5  million.  Over time, all the public toilets in all  the\r\n\r\nhawker  centres  will  be upgraded under  the  Hawker  Centre\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme.  Likewise, for the National  Parks  and\r\n\r\nSMRT,  they  also  have a formal programme to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\npublic toilets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one area where we do not have a formal\r\n\r\nprogramme.   These are the public toilets at the coffeeshops.\r\n\r\nAs   I  mentioned,  there  are  about  800  of  them.   These\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops, as pointed out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Ang, are used not just by the customers, but also  by\r\n\r\nthe  members of the public.  I therefore fully agree with him\r\n\r\nthat  it is useful for the Government to see how we can speed\r\n\r\nup  the upgrading of these public toilets at the coffeeshops.\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  to  say that we have decided to  launch  a  new\r\n\r\nupgrading scheme known as the Toilet Upgrading Scheme  (TUP).\r\n\r\nUnder  TUP,  the Government will co-pay 50% of  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  these coffeeshop toilets up to  a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$5,000 for each toilet.  This would be made available to  all\r\n\r\nthe  800  toilets in the coffeeshops, both rental as well  as\r\n\r\nthose   that  have  been  purchased.   This  will  cost   the\r\n\r\nGovernment a total budget of $4 million.  We think  it  is  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile investment.  This scheme will start in September.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by saying that it is insufficient to\r\n\r\njust  upgrade the toilets, because at the end of the day,  it\r\n\r\nis  very important that we take good care of these toilets as\r\n\r\nwell.  We intend to mount a 3P partnership programme.  We are\r\n\r\ngoing  to work with the Restaurants Association of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Coffeeshop Association, the Singapore Tourism Board, the\r\n\r\nNational Parks Board, grassroots organisations and so on,  to\r\n\r\nheighten  public  awareness  on the  need  for  clean  public\r\n\r\ntoilets.   At  the  same time, we are going  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard and quality of public toilet cleaning.  We  are  now\r\n\r\nworking  with the Centre for Cleaning Technology, as well  as\r\n\r\nSPRING Singapore.  We are going to train all the cleaners  of\r\n\r\npublic  toilets to make sure that they will have  the  proper\r\n\r\ntechnique and equipment when they clean these public toilets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Mr Ang suggested that we should have\r\n\r\nan  island-wide competition on the \"Cleanest Public  Toilet\".\r\n\r\nAgain,  I think it is a very good idea.  Since Mr Ang is  the\r\n\r\nman behind the island-wide \"Cleanest HDB Estate Competition\",\r\n\r\nI   encourage  him  to  organise  this  competition  for  the\r\n\r\n\"Cleanest  Public Toilet\".  I assure him that ENV  will  give\r\n\r\nhim our fullest support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by referring to what Mr Ang said about\r\n\r\nChina.  I was in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina briefly in December on a holiday in Beijing.  I asked a\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver,  \"Why is your public toilet so clean  now?\"   He\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  same  reason - they are gearing  up  for  the\r\n\r\nOlympic  2008.  He said, \"Look, our leaders told  us  that  a\r\n\r\ncountry  with  dirty  toilets has no future.\"   Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of Singapore, I would say that a country with  dirty\r\n\r\ntoilets  has  no pride.  I hope all Singaporeans  would  take\r\n\r\npride  in having clean public toilets in Singapore.  Our  aim\r\n\r\nis  to  turn these dirty public toilets a thing of the  past.\r\n\r\nTherefore, your aim will help!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I am often\r\n\r\nreminded that as an MP and Mayor, one must keep close to  the\r\n\r\nground.  I agree.  But that is not the only reason why I have\r\n\r\nthis cut on cemeteries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a serious matter of life and death. It is\r\n\r\nladen  with  emotions  and  thus  needs  sensitive  handling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to moderate emotions with realities,  allow  me\r\n\r\nto quote what Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said sometime back\r\n\r\nwhen asked about the reuse of the Kampong Java cemetery land.\r\n\r\nSM  Lee said, \"We have done enough for the dead.  Let's worry\r\n\r\nfor  the  living\".  Today, we have the KK Women and  Children\r\n\r\nHospital  on  the  same  site,  delivering  more  lives   and\r\n\r\nhealthcare for the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to explain ENV's\r\n\r\nthinking,  programmes  and  efforts  at  assuring  sufficient\r\n\r\nburial grounds, what plans ENV has to meet that need in land-scarce  Singapore.  I gather that ENV and MUIS officers  have\r\n\r\nmade  study trips to a few countries outside Singapore.  What\r\n\r\nare   the  findings?   Will  there  be  any  new  innovations\r\n\r\nintroduced  to make burial better, cleaner and more  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's need to recycle burial grounds?   I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether the Minister wants to call it Cemetery Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme (CUP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I hope the Environment Minister would also\r\n\r\ntake  a  look at the present cemetery ground in Pusara  Aman,\r\n\r\nmaybe on a rainy day, to see how messy it can be and see what\r\n\r\ncan be done to give it a decent look there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, right now, ENV is undertaking a major cemetery\r\n\r\nexhumation exercise at Bidadari.  I believe that the contract\r\n\r\nwas  offered  on  a  tender basis.  Has  the  Ministry  taken\r\n\r\nsufficient measures to ensure that the sensitivities involved\r\n\r\nare  factored?  What are they?  I would like to urge  ENV  to\r\n\r\ntake  all  measures  and steps necessary to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\nsensitivities  are  taken  care  of  during  the   exhumation\r\n\r\nexercise.   I  also learn that the contract for providing  of\r\n\r\ncolumbariums  is  also  done  on  a  tender  basis.   Is  ENV\r\n\r\nconfident  that  such a method would not lead  to  escalating\r\n\r\nprices  so much so people might then say, \"even to  die,  not\r\n\r\ncheap\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, it was reported in\r\n\r\nthe press that the latest attempt of ENV to solve the problem\r\n\r\nof  dengue  fever is to breed one new breed of mosquitoes  to\r\n\r\nkill or neutralise the dangerous breed that will cause dengue\r\n\r\nfever.  My concern is: how confident is ENV in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthis  initiative  is 100% error-free?  Is the  Minister  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the bio-science laboratory responsible for the  project\r\n\r\nwill not mistakenly unleash another type of mosquito that  is\r\n\r\nmore deadly than what we already have here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the new breed of\r\n\r\nmosquito   bites  and  sucks  blood  like  other   types   of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.   If  so,  when the new breed  of  mosquitoes  is\r\n\r\nreleased  and  residents  complain of  mosquito  bites,  what\r\n\r\nshould  we  tell  them? Are we to tell  them  that  they  are\r\n\r\nhealthy and friendly love bites, so never mind?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite my concern, it is a quite a bold idea. If\r\n\r\nthe  initiative is proven successful and safe here,  perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe  can export the new breed of mosquitoes to make some money\r\n\r\nand maybe develop ourselves into a regional mosquito hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I hate to be a pest. My\r\n\r\ncut  is still on mosquitoes.  I would like to compliment  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Environment for being very  proactive.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  even  before  I raise the cut, my  question  has  been\r\n\r\nanswered.   You can see from the Straits Times,  they  did  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  job,  about the $100 million  war  on  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases and bio-terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore  than that, they even have a very good expose about what\r\n\r\nhas been done to battle this problem about the mosquitoes and\r\n\r\nother pests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to just briefly talk about more bites with\r\n\r\na  hotter weather.  I think that is still a problem  with  El\r\n\r\nNino  and we can expect a lot more mosquitoes. In fact,  some\r\n\r\nresidents are exasperated with this problem to the point that\r\n\r\neach  time  when I go on house visits, I always get  feedback\r\n\r\nthat  the  children have been bitten by mosquitoes. In  fact,\r\n\r\none  resident  has  even sent me a collection  of  about  200\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  It looks like a piece of artwork.  But  this  is\r\n\r\njust  to  show  how desperate they were.  I have  given  this\r\n\r\nfeedback  to  my  colleague,  Mayor  Othman,  and   the   ENV\r\n\r\napparently has acted on it. They do act fast.  But  what  can\r\n\r\nENV  do  to help alleviate this problem, especially when  the\r\n\r\nweather gets hotter and the El Nino strikes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Zainul and Mr Low\r\n\r\nfor  their  questions.   I will begin first  with  the  issue\r\n\r\ndealing with the dead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land-scarce Singapore, both the living and the\r\n\r\ndead compete for available scarce land.  We estimate that the\r\n\r\ncemetery  at Chua Chu Kang can last up to 2064.  However,  as\r\n\r\nthis is the only cemetery that we have, we are concerned that\r\n\r\nwe  need to find ways to extend the lifespan of the cemetery.\r\n\r\nI  am  pleased to say that we have found a solution, that  we\r\n\r\ncall the Modular Burial System (MBS).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MBS is a system where pre-fabricated rectangular\r\n\r\nconcrete  crypts  are  constructed,  forming  a  grid.   Each\r\n\r\nrectangular  crypt is fitted with a concrete  lid.  When  the\r\n\r\ntime  comes  for burial, the lid for the crypt is  lifted  to\r\n\r\nreveal  the empty chamber below.  The coffin or body is  then\r\n\r\nlowered  into the crypt and the crypt is filled  with  earth.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the lid is put back in place before it is covered\r\n\r\nwith a final layer of earth and turf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have consulted MUIS and a few other religious\r\n\r\norganisations and they have found the MBS to be an acceptable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  MBS makes better use of the land  for  burial.\r\n\r\nWith  the  MBS,  the cemetery land can last up  to  2130,  an\r\n\r\nextension  of  more than 60 years.  We agree with  Mr  Zainul\r\n\r\nthat  exhumation must be done properly. We will consult  MUIS\r\n\r\nand other religious and ethnic groups to ensure that cultural\r\n\r\nand  religious sensitivities are taken into consideration  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  exhumation.  Exhumation would be  carried  out\r\n\r\nindividually, with dignity and respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, for the exhumation of Muslim graves, the\r\n\r\nagency  requiring  the  exhumation, for  example,  HDB,  will\r\n\r\nappoint MUIS to take charge of the exhumation.  ENV will also\r\n\r\ndo  the  same  when  exhumation at  Chua  Chu  Kang  cemetery\r\n\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the problem of mosquitoes, because we are\r\n\r\nsituated in the tropics where the weather is warm and  humid,\r\n\r\nwe  will always have mosquitoes around us. We cannot get  rid\r\n\r\nof  them, but we can keep their population size down so  that\r\n\r\nthe  impact,  both  as a nuisance and as a  vector,  will  be\r\n\r\nminimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with mosquitoes, we must realise that we are\r\n\r\ndealing  with  an ecological situation out  there.   When  we\r\n\r\nreduce the population of one type of mosquito, it is possible\r\n\r\nthat another species of mosquito, which previously would  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to thrive, would now increase in numbers.  There are\r\n\r\ntwo  species  of mosquitoes that bother us in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nAedes  and the Culex mosquitoes.  The Aedes breeds  in  clean\r\n\r\nwater  inside and outside homes, for example, in vases,  roof\r\n\r\ngutters,  pots,  plates and litter thrown into  bushes.   The\r\n\r\nCulex breeds in dirtier waters, like choked drains.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to keep mosquito population down is to make\r\n\r\nsure  they have little opportunity to breed.  Using chemicals\r\n\r\nto  kill  the  mosquitoes will not help  if  the  sources  of\r\n\r\nbreeding remain present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV's Vector Control Team, together with pest control\r\n\r\ncompanies  engaged by ENV, carries out daily surveillance  in\r\n\r\nareas  where the vector population is known to be  high.   We\r\n\r\nhave  good ground surveillance system that is linked  to  our\r\n\r\ngeographical information system (GIS), which will tell us, on\r\n\r\na  real-time basis, where the build-up of vectors are  taking\r\n\r\nplace.  However, ENV will need the help of everyone, from the\r\n\r\nresidents, especially those who live in landed properties, to\r\n\r\nmanagement  agents, including Town Councils and,  contractors\r\n\r\ndoing  construction work, to prevent mosquitoes from breeding\r\n\r\nwithin their premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the concern about new types of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes, our scientists are doing research on the  various\r\n\r\ntypes  of mosquitoes and their genetic labelling so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  better  understand how the mosquitoes  spread  from  one\r\n\r\nregion  to another, and what factors allow one population  to\r\n\r\nincrease,  while another decreases.  I can assure Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament that we have no intention of creating new  species\r\n\r\nof  mosquitoes  in  our laboratories that  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nrelease into the environment.

First, does the Minister know how many  crows  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  Singapore?  Second, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nhas  engaged professional shooters to cull crows.   How  many\r\n\r\nhave  they  culled so far?  Third, many residents  complained\r\n\r\nthat  some  elderly people were attacked by  the  crows.   Is\r\n\r\nthere  any  plan to prevent that from happening?  Fourth,  is\r\n\r\nthere  any plan to stop the propagation of crows?  And fifth,\r\n\r\nI  was  told  that  some  crows flew  from  Johore  Bahru  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the day and then fly back to Johore  Bahru  at\r\n\r\nnight.  Is there any plan to stop them from flying in?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I shall be brief. First, the\r\n\r\ncrow population in Singapore today is about 120,000.  Second,\r\n\r\nwe  have a culling rate of about 60,000 crows a year.  In the\r\n\r\nlast three months we have culled the same number of crows  as\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  last  year, and so our culling  programme  is\r\n\r\nextremely  successful.   We  hope  to  bring  down  the  crow\r\n\r\npopulation eventually to about 10,000 in Singapore.  Crows do\r\n\r\nnot normally attack people.  They may do so only if provoked,\r\n\r\nor  they perceive a threat to their nestlings.  So we do  not\r\n\r\nthink that crow attacks are really a big problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang, would you like to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $456,276,240 for Head L ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $674,608,900 for Head L ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head Q, Ministry of Information,\r\n\r\nCommunications and the Arts.

In short, arts is not just for arts  sake,  but\r\n\r\nalso  for  business  sake.  Any concept  which  promises  job\r\n\r\ncreation and economic growth is, of course, welcome in  these\r\n\r\ndifficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must congratulate MITA for its creativity in extending\r\n\r\nand  repackaging  the Renaissance City  Report  by  adding  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  element,  so  that  expenditure  in  the  arts   is\r\n\r\nincreasingly seen as an investment, something that will  reap\r\n\r\neconomic  rewards.  However, I must say that a close scrutiny\r\n\r\nwill  show that both the cultural capital and the Renaissance\r\n\r\nproposal bear similarities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tenets of the cultural capital are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Creative cluster;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Creative people and workforce; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A connected nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that a creative cluster engaged in traditional\r\n\r\nand  the  fine arts can become a potential growth engine  for\r\n\r\nour  economy  has  already been recognisd in the  Renaissance\r\n\r\nCity   Report.    \"Creative   people   and   workforce\"   was\r\n\r\n\"Renaissance  Singaporeans\",  and  \"Connected   nation\"   was\r\n\r\n\"Renaissance Nation and Society\".  What is new is perhaps the\r\n\r\nnew emphasis on the sector of applied arts, ie, design, media\r\n\r\nand advertising.  When fused with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nartistic  innovation, it is hoped that we can come  out  with\r\n\r\nnew products and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to devise such a thorough and far-reaching proposal\r\n\r\nmust  have required a fair bit of time and energy.  I am sure\r\n\r\nthe ideas behind them are sound, but why two reports when one\r\n\r\nwill do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, we can allocate resources to push\r\n\r\nthrough  the  reforms envisioned under the  Renaissance  City\r\n\r\nReport  rather than putting our entire arts community through\r\n\r\nanother  round of brainstorming and vision seeking.  On  this\r\n\r\nnote, I would like to add a few ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Green Paper should argue for the increase of\r\n\r\nfunding for arts.  I know that in these difficult times it is\r\n\r\nhard  to  argue  for more money to spend on  arts,  something\r\n\r\nwhich  many  see as a luxury.  However, as the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nalready   acknowledged  that  spending  is  now  a  form   of\r\n\r\ninvestment  in the economy, we have no reason  not  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore to stimulate growth through arts spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, in order to introduce arts at all levels,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to start at our education system, to build an  arts\r\n\r\nloving society.  I am happy to note that we will have an arts\r\n\r\nschool  soon.  Let us dare to dream of an arts university  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds for the Arts Education Programme (AEP) have now\r\n\r\nincreased to reach 50% of the student population.  But,  from\r\n\r\nwhat  I  know,  AEP,  in  most  schools,  amounts  to  merely\r\n\r\nsponsoring tickets for students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, parents also have to change their mindset.\r\n\r\nParents  want their children to be a doctor over a violinist,\r\n\r\na  lawyer  over  a  writer, a teacher  over  an  actor.   Our\r\n\r\nchildren are told that this is a pragmatic world, one  cannot\r\n\r\nlive  on  the arts, keep it only as a hobby - as the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsay, er bu si, chi bu bao.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arts education must have a bigger role to play in\r\n\r\nthe  life  of  our young, otherwise we can forget  about  the\r\n\r\ncreative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncluster  of a cultural capital vision.  It will never  create\r\n\r\n5% of our GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there must be a sizable arts industry in\r\n\r\norder  to  provide sufficient job opportunities.  Some,  like\r\n\r\nthe  film  industry, involve high overhead  costs.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhere  funding comes in.  Hence, we come a full  circle.   If\r\n\r\narts  is  to be seen as an investment, we must have not  more\r\n\r\nvisions and reports but a sound and solid business plan.   We\r\n\r\nneed to have a clear direction of where we are heading, where\r\n\r\nare  the returns we expect on our investments, and how we can\r\n\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that everything must reduce itself\r\n\r\nto  dollars  and  cents.  Instead, what I  want  to  see  are\r\n\r\nimplementation plans, and the enhancements to what is already\r\n\r\na very good blueprint.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I support MITA's vision to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  a creative and connected  place.   Arts  and\r\n\r\nculture  can  definitely  play  a  significant  role  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic and social development of Singapore.  We must aim to\r\n\r\ndevelop Singapore into a culture hub.  It should also, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, attract more tourists to Singapore.  Cities  like\r\n\r\nParis  and  Edinburgh are good examples of places which  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  the  arts and cultural capital to  boost  economic\r\n\r\nactivities and community bonding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the plans to develop cultural capital in\r\n\r\nSingapore; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the key performance indicators to measure\r\n\r\ncultural capital?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I was a little\r\n\r\ndisappointed to note that the budget allocation to MITA stood\r\n\r\nstill  at  1.5%  for Financial Year 2002.  It is  a  moderate\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $20.94 million to $425.53 million, in  absolute\r\n\r\nterms, but nevertheless, I was hoping to see more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many may ask, in such time when many face unemployment\r\n\r\nand economic hardship, is there room for arts and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nculture?  The answer is a resounding \"Yes.\"  Perhaps, more so\r\n\r\nnow,  because it is in critical times like this that we  need\r\n\r\nto  delve  deeper into ourselves and bring out the  intrinsic\r\n\r\nvalue  of  our rich cultural capital from within,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a breakthrough.  Let me illustrate my point with  an\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how much is a watch worth? It can be $10, $100 or\r\n\r\ntens  of thousands, depending on who created it, which artist\r\n\r\nhas  his hands on it, and which musician puts a tune  in  it.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, when the famous Swiss watch-making industry was\r\n\r\nfacing  laggard  sales  and serious threats  from  high-tech,\r\n\r\nlower-cost Japanese products, a man called Mr Nicholas G Hyak\r\n\r\ntook an ordinary mass-produced watch and got a few artists to\r\n\r\nexhibit their works on it.  He said, \"We have to give  Swatch\r\n\r\na  warm  heart  and soul so that people would love  it.\"   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  within a short span of five years, Swatch,  a  plastic\r\n\r\nwatch company, became the largest watch making company in the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalising on cultural diversity of a nation brings a\r\n\r\nbreath  of fresh air into the watch economy, and put a  piece\r\n\r\nof Switzerland onto many people's wrist.  In fact, it has got\r\n\r\na back-end added value of promoting tourism in Switzerland as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can do the same too. In fact, Singapore has a\r\n\r\nvery  rich  cultural  capital.  With the diversity  of  race,\r\n\r\nlanguage, religion and a highly cosmopolitan city, we are  in\r\n\r\na  good position to tap on our cultural capital to give us an\r\n\r\nedge in the competitive world.  A few examples are the Banyan\r\n\r\nTree,  and  Creative Technology who has recently created  the\r\n\r\nProdiKey.  These are all very good examples of combining arts\r\n\r\nwith  music  and  culture into traditional and  technological\r\n\r\nplatforms.  As such, my questions are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are some of the programmes that we have put in\r\n\r\nplace  to  tap  on our cultural capital so as to  bring  this\r\n\r\ndiversity into our technology, and into our products?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is this funding sufficient as proportionate to the\r\n\r\nvalue that it can bring to our economy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is this funding sufficient as proportionate to the\r\n\r\nrole   that   it   plays  in  making  Singapore   a   vibrant\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan, as well as it being a social glue?  If I  could\r\n\r\ncoin the 5Cs in cultural capital, the 5Cs would stand for:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Creativity - which is the power to invent and\r\n\r\ninnovate;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Connectivity - which is the power to connect people\r\n\r\non a heart and soul level;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Capability - which is helping all our artists, our\r\n\r\nother talents to come in and contribute to our economy;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Competitiveness - because it makes an ordinary\r\n\r\nproduct  extraordinary, it makes it unique and gives  us  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Community - because it brings together groups of\r\n\r\npeople with different talents to communicate with each  other\r\n\r\nto create new things from this collaboration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would also ask, as some of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have asked, what are some of the yardsticks  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  used  to  measure the success of germinating  this\r\n\r\ncultural   capital,  both  from  the  economic   and   social\r\n\r\nperspectives.    I would like to add that we should  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  that arts and culture, or the germination of a cultural\r\n\r\ncapital itself takes time to come to fruition.  And, as such,\r\n\r\nthe   measurement  used  to  determine  the  ROI  from   such\r\n\r\ninvestments should be different from that of mere  statistics\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as we grow\r\n\r\nand mature as a nation, we have to look at our development in\r\n\r\na  wider perspective than just in the economic sense.   There\r\n\r\nis an increasing need for us to grow and develop our cultural\r\n\r\ncapital.   The  strategy  to grow  our  cultural  capital  is\r\n\r\nlaudable and long overdue.  We must understand that many used\r\n\r\nto  consider the arts and culture as a luxury.  This view  is\r\n\r\npasse,  and  there is a need for a major mindset change.   We\r\n\r\nmust take the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity in our process of remaking Singapore to make this\r\n\r\nshift.  We must view the arts and culture as an integral part\r\n\r\nof our development and growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cultural heritage is rich and multi-faceted. We\r\n\r\nshould  harness this vast potential and exploit  it  to   our\r\n\r\nadvantage.  The investment and resources that we allocate  to\r\n\r\nthe  arts and culture should not be seen as wastage.  We have\r\n\r\nto look at the long-term rewards, and the intangible returns,\r\n\r\nie,  a more culturally rich and vibrant Singapore.   We need,\r\n\r\nover  the long term, to portray Singapore not only as a place\r\n\r\nof  economic  excellence but also as a  centre  for  artistic\r\n\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate what was said by Dr Ng Eng Hen\r\n\r\nyesterday, the congregation of brains and minds would attract\r\n\r\ninvestments.  I would further add that congregation of brains\r\n\r\nand  minds in a vibrant and artistically and culturally  rich\r\n\r\nenvironment will be ever sweeter for investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in view of the growing importance of this\r\n\r\naspect  of  our country's development, I would encourage  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance to allocate more  resources  to  MITA.\r\n\r\nOver  time, we should accord more funds to the Ministry  than\r\n\r\nthe 0.3% of GDP as it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, we are now in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  remaking Singapore.  I would therefore  like  to\r\n\r\njoin  my  fellow colleagues to ask the Minister if  he  would\r\n\r\nshare  his  vision  on the role of arts and  culture  in  the\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  remake  Singapore.   In  particular,   we   are\r\n\r\nsearching for competitive advantages for a changed world, and\r\n\r\nhere  we  must  exploit  all our  strengths.   Our  arts  and\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage does not need to be \"nice to  have\".   Art\r\n\r\nand  cultural  centres of the world have exploited  arts  and\r\n\r\nculture as a source of growth.  For example, London and Paris\r\n\r\nhave used arts and culture to lure both tourists and talents.\r\n\r\nWe  can do the same.  I would therefore like the Minister, in\r\n\r\nhis  reply,  to address, if possible, the role  of  arts  and\r\n\r\nculture as a strategic tool for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour economic development and competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the other day,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong spoke about  attempts  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to try and uplift the morale of Singaporeans.   So\r\n\r\nfar, in Parliament, the only thing that we hear are about the\r\n\r\ndownturn  of  the economy, the doom and the  gloom.   Really,\r\n\r\narts  and culture should be for all seasons.  When times  are\r\n\r\ngood, there are reasons for us to celebrate.  When times  are\r\n\r\nnot  so good, arts and culture can indeed uplift the mood  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Therefore, I would suggest that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ntake  a  contrarian  view as far as the budget  provision  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  If we think that the economy is not likely to  be\r\n\r\ngood, in fact, we should give more money to the Ministry,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there would be the enhanced outreach programmes to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   In  fact,  in  the budget provision,  the  outreach\r\n\r\nprogrammes  have plateaued.  I do not see efforts being  made\r\n\r\nto enhance these outreach programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remain ambitious to achieve the middle class society.\r\n\r\nI think, as we attempt to more forward in our economic ladder\r\n\r\nand   with  a  better  educated  population,  two-thirds   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   are   receiving   tertiary   education.    The\r\n\r\nintangibles  become important.  Singaporeans  are  no  longer\r\n\r\nmaterialistic.  They are very interested in the things of the\r\n\r\nspirit  and  the  soul,  and arts  and  culture  become  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   Singaporeans  are  well  travelled.   They   are\r\n\r\nexposed  to  top  displays  and performances.   We  are  also\r\n\r\ntalking about attracting top talent to Singapore.  So  it  is\r\n\r\nvery,  very  important for a society like ours that  we  have\r\n\r\nthis  wholesome  living, this quality of  life  that  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts\r\n\r\nis  really a very young Ministry.  It is only about 10  years\r\n\r\nold.   It is a very long journey.  I think we have made  very\r\n\r\ngood  progress, and we should encourage the Ministry to press\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to ask the Minister about the balance\r\n\r\nof  the  three  sectors, of Government,  private  and  people\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe  too  much  is imposed on the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  funds.   I think the Government  can  do  more,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have not developed the patronage system as  yet.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not easy to get the private sector  or  even  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector  to cough up the money.  Maybe the  Government\r\n\r\nshould put as much seed money as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is the question of job creation\r\n\r\nopportunities.  In times where jobs are difficult to come by,\r\n\r\nthis is an area where jobs could be created.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have a query about Capitol Cinema. It\r\n\r\nis  in  my constituency.  When Capitol Cinema was closed,  it\r\n\r\nwas intended to become a theatre.  It has been mothballed for\r\n\r\na long while.  One of the problems with eviction is that when\r\n\r\nthe  place becomes empty, the whole place gets hollowed  out.\r\n\r\nAnd  that  is  always  the problem  when  there  is  lack  of\r\n\r\nsynchronisation  between the party that  acquires  Government\r\n\r\nbuildings and filling up the place.  I am waiting to see when\r\n\r\nCapitol Cinema will come back to life again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, arts and heritage play an important\r\n\r\nrole in helping to build a cohesive and gracious society.  It\r\n\r\nstrengthens the sense of belonging of our people and enhances\r\n\r\ntheir  quality  of life.  As a young country, Singapore  must\r\n\r\nchart clear directions to promote arts and heritage.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Government to provide more  resources\r\n\r\nfor  MITA  to work closely with community-based organisations\r\n\r\nto organise more arts and heritage programmes for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also like to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the masterplan for the arts and heritage\r\n\r\nprogramme in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the strategy to promote arts and heritage to our\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How much resources are allocated for arts and heritage\r\n\r\nprogrammes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I was delighted to hear during one\r\n\r\nof the briefings for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   GPC  for  MITA,  that  they  have  an  Arts  Everywhere\r\n\r\nprogramme.   I  was  delighted because  the  Arts  Everywhere\r\n\r\nprogramme  means that it will enable everyone  to  appreciate\r\n\r\nand  to  partake in the process of enjoying the arts  itself.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would like to also ask whether it is  just  arts\r\n\r\neverywhere, or is it arts everywhere, arts everyone and  arts\r\n\r\nevery time as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to inculcate a nation that breathes and lives art,\r\n\r\nthe  art  and  heritage initiatives have  to  permeate  every\r\n\r\nstrata  of  the society, making its presence felt everywhere,\r\n\r\nlives  in  everyone and present every time.

I  hope   there  will   be   more\r\n\r\ninitiatives  and  at  a quick pace that  could  be  generated\r\n\r\nwithin the next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I was very much\r\n\r\nencouraged to read in the newspapers the other day that  MITA\r\n\r\nis  pursuing the concept of cultural capital, ie, the synergy\r\n\r\nbetween arts and enterprise.  I really do think that this  is\r\n\r\nlong  overdue,  because  for too long,  the  arts  have  been\r\n\r\nregarded  as the poor cousin to sciences in Singapore.   When\r\n\r\nwe  were a developing country,  we could understand the  need\r\n\r\nto push science and technology.  But I think that concept, in\r\n\r\nthe present changing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nglobal  economy, is a little outdated, because the arts  does\r\n\r\nhave  a  tremendous economic value.  In this regard, I really\r\n\r\nthink that the budget for MITA should be increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see arts not just as something for arts sake. I am a\r\n\r\nfirm  believer in arts for arts sake, but the problem is that\r\n\r\nI do not think that artists can live off talent and fresh air\r\n\r\nalone.   They obviously need funding.  They obviously need  a\r\n\r\ndemand for the arts and the creative sciences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if the Ministry could comment on whether\r\n\r\nit  sees  Singapore  as  a potential design  centre  for  the\r\n\r\nregion,  because  there  is  a  big  demand  for  design   in\r\n\r\nfurniture,  handphones,  computers.   The  Scandinavians  are\r\n\r\nespecially good at this, but we do not have a reputation  for\r\n\r\nthis   in  Southeast  Asia.   So,  I  was  wondering  whether\r\n\r\nSingapore could be developed as a design centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is in fashion. Fashion, obviously, is\r\n\r\noften  regarded as frivolous  -  girls' stuff. But the  thing\r\n\r\nis  that it is actually a multi-billion dollar industry.  And\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think that, in Singapore, we have actually  fully\r\n\r\ntapped into this.  New York, London, Paris, Milan are fashion\r\n\r\ncapitals  of  the  world, but not a lot of the  manufacturing\r\n\r\ngoes  on  there.  Their value is actually as a design  centre\r\n\r\nfor fashion and, of course, they outsource the manufacturing.\r\n\r\nI  was  wondering  whether it would be  possible  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a fashion centre of the East, something  which\r\n\r\nThailand is aiming to do, but perhaps we can pip them to  it.\r\n\r\nAnd whether, possibly, we could have something like a weekend\r\n\r\nfashion  street  to allow young designers  to  display  their\r\n\r\ndesigns  and sell them.  The reason why I say this is because\r\n\r\nwe  should  not put them in shopping centres where the  rents\r\n\r\nare  high.   Let  them go to somewhere where  the  rents  are\r\n\r\nrelatively  low.  They can sell their designs  and  the  acid\r\n\r\ntest of whether their design is good or not is whether people\r\n\r\nwill  actually buy it.  And this is something where  tourists\r\n\r\ncan go as well, because the demand is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways for branded goods, but sometimes for street fashion  - things which are considered as edgy and funky.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Ministry what are the\r\n\r\nplans  to  develop Singapore as a cultural hub, certainly  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  concerts  and performances.  Again,  this  has  an\r\n\r\neconomic  reason behind it.  If we want to attract  MNCs  and\r\n\r\nexpatriates to Singapore, one of the reasons why  they  might\r\n\r\nchoose  Singapore over another country is when they  look  at\r\n\r\nlifestyle.   If  they had to make a choice between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Hong Kong, if all else remains equal, if we are able  to\r\n\r\noffer  a  better  lifestyle in terms of  arts,  performances,\r\n\r\nconcerts,  we  might  have an edge.  Sir,  I  would  be  very\r\n\r\ngrateful if the Minister could answer that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E.

Lim):</b> Sir, may I first thank Mr\r\n\r\nSeng Han Thong and all the other Members who have just spoken\r\n\r\nfor  their enthusiastic support for the arts, especially  for\r\n\r\nthe  call  for  more money.  Perhaps they could  repeat  that\r\n\r\nanother day when the Minister for Finance is in the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have pointed out that the arts has economic\r\n\r\nvalue.   Indeed,  our economy has changed,  and  we  are  now\r\n\r\nrestructuring the economy and, likewise, the  arts  is  at  a\r\n\r\nturning point.  What I would like to do, before I answer  the\r\n\r\nspecific suggestions that have been raised, is to sketch  out\r\n\r\nMITA's new vision for the arts.  To get the most value out of\r\n\r\nthe  arts, we need to have a new way of looking at the  arts.\r\n\r\nBut  this is a difficult task to do, because many of us  look\r\n\r\nat  the arts as something of an indulgence, something that is\r\n\r\nfor the well-heeled, the rich and those who have the time  to\r\n\r\nspend.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help me illustrate this point, I brought along a\r\n\r\npiece  of  unusual  art.  If I may, I will  hold  it  up  for\r\n\r\nMembers  to  see.  At first glance, this is a  very  ordinary\r\n\r\npicture.   It  is a picture of rows of flower  baskets.   But\r\n\r\nthis   is   no  ordinary  picture.   This  is  a  stereogram.\r\n\r\nStereograms were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall the rage several years ago, all over the world.  You see,\r\n\r\nSir, within this picture, there is a hidden picture, and this\r\n\r\nis  a picture that you can only see if you have the technique\r\n\r\nto  look at it.  It is a special technique.  But if you  know\r\n\r\nhow,  you  will see that within this picture,  right  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of it, is one big heart of flowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem is most of us are very frustrated when\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  this and do not see the heart.  The problem  is\r\n\r\nthat  we have been taught our whole lives, when we look at  a\r\n\r\npicture,  to focus on the picture.  But we can only see  this\r\n\r\nheart  if we do not focus on this picture, but that we  focus\r\n\r\nin  front  of it.  I can cross my eyes like that [indicating]\r\n\r\nor focus my ends behind it.  Like, if I held it up, I look at\r\n\r\nyou while looking at the picture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a fusion of arts and technology. But I\r\n\r\nbring up this illustration because unless we take a different\r\n\r\nway  of  looking at the arts, unless we move  away  from  our\r\n\r\nnotion  that  the arts is only for the well-to-do  or  is  an\r\n\r\nindulgence, then we would not begin to see the potential that\r\n\r\nthe arts has for the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me share MITA's vision. Today, the arts plays\r\n\r\nthree roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the arts keeps alive our traditions and\r\n\r\nculture.  Whether it is gamelan music, or Teochew opera,  the\r\n\r\narts  connects us with our heritage, one of the \"Cs\" that  Ms\r\n\r\nPenny  Low brought up.  We may not understand the opera,  but\r\n\r\nwatching  it  somehow  gives  us  a  sense  of  identity  and\r\n\r\nbelonging.   Or as Ms Penny Low also said, the arts  provides\r\n\r\nthe \"social glue\" that keeps us together, and I think most of\r\n\r\nus accept this view of the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the arts is also important for the sheer\r\n\r\nenjoyment  and  wonder  that  it  brings.   It  arouses   our\r\n\r\nemotions,  and  stimulates our minds, and it  makes  us  feel\r\n\r\nalive.   The arts reminds us that there are some things  that\r\n\r\nmoney cannot buy.  It lifts our human spirit.  It affirms our\r\n\r\nhumanity.   I  think  most of us would also  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nsecond view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, even though the arts is important in and of\r\n\r\nitself, we can leverage on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npower of the arts and especially the fusion of arts, business\r\n\r\nand  technology to spur the growth of a creative economy  and\r\n\r\nto  make  Singapore  a vibrant city.  The arts  has  economic\r\n\r\nvalue,  but here, I think, is when not everybody agrees.   It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  artists  are often  driven  solely  by  their\r\n\r\npassion.   They may create images or play music only  because\r\n\r\nthey  want  to express their innermost thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nBut  whatever their motivations, their performances add  life\r\n\r\nand  zest  to  our  community, and create  economic  benefits\r\n\r\nperhaps in more ways than they intend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me expand on some of the ways that the arts\r\n\r\ncan and do create economic value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as Dr Teo pointed out, the arts attracts\r\n\r\ntourists.   This  creates jobs for Singaporeans.   For  every\r\n\r\ndollar  that a tourist spends on the arts, Singapore  Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard  estimates  that $1.80 is spent on other  things,  like\r\n\r\nfood  and  accommodation.  Can we do more?  Yes, we  can  and\r\n\r\nwill.   NAC and STB collaborate closely to make the arts  one\r\n\r\nof  the attractions for tourists.  The NAC estimates that  up\r\n\r\nto  5% of the people who attended the Singapore Arts Festival\r\n\r\nlast  year  were tourists.  But that is just 5%, at  most,  a\r\n\r\nmere 8,000 people.  So there is clearly potential here to  do\r\n\r\nmore.   Our  new  performing arts centre -  the  Esplanade  - Theatres  on the Bay - which will be a world-class performing\r\n\r\ncentre, will give us a big boost in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the arts creates economic value because it\r\n\r\nmakes talented people want to live in Singapore.  And we  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  talents create jobs.  Our first  priority  is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and retain our own home-grown talent.  Offering  them\r\n\r\ngood  jobs  is  one thing.  But we also need  to  offer  them\r\n\r\ninteresting, exciting and fulfilling lifestyles.  If  through\r\n\r\nthe  arts, we can make Singapore the preferred choice of  our\r\n\r\nown home-grown talents, then, I think we also have the chance\r\n\r\nof attracting international talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as many of the Members have said, the arts is\r\n\r\nalso  an industry.  In developed economies, like the  US  and\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUK,   the   creative  and  copyright  industries,  that   is,\r\n\r\nactivities  such  as  advertising,  film  production,  music,\r\n\r\nfashion  and design, account for between 5-7% of the economy,\r\n\r\nand they are growing more rapidly than the total economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore build up our applied arts industry,\r\n\r\nas  Mr Seng has urged.  MITA, together with our economic  and\r\n\r\neducational partners, will launch a new design initiative  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our design capabilities.  We would include  fashion,\r\n\r\nas  suggested by Ms Indranee, but we also want to  go  beyond\r\n\r\nfashion to exploit the value of design across all sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy.   Media  and  content creation  are  also  good\r\n\r\nindustries to promote.  We have a good chance of turning them\r\n\r\ninto a new growth area if we can leverage on our strength  in\r\n\r\ndigital  technologies such as animation and multi-media,  and\r\n\r\npromote  more  companies to set up pre-  and  post-production\r\n\r\nfacilities in Singapore.  Perhaps, one day, we can get  Harry\r\n\r\nPotter or Gandalf, or Yoda, to make a movie in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nto  conjure  the  magic  here.   Or  perhaps  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\ncombination  of  Mulan  and  Lara  Croft  fighting  the   toy\r\n\r\nsoldiers.  The possibilities, of course, are endless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the arts helps to make us a more creative\r\n\r\neconomy.  The arts shapes the way we think.  It challenges us\r\n\r\nto  think out-of-the-box, and develops new habits of  looking\r\n\r\nat  things  from unusual perspectives.  If we practise  these\r\n\r\nnew  habits, then, over time we develop a more curious spirit\r\n\r\nand  a  more  probing mind.  Such a change will help  promote\r\n\r\noriginal  and  critical thinking in every sector  across  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  so that creativity becomes our natural response  to\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arts and culture have always been an essential\r\n\r\npart  of our society, enhancing the quality of our lives  and\r\n\r\nshaping the character of our communities.  But, today,  in  a\r\n\r\nglobally  and  sharply competitive world, the arts  plays  an\r\n\r\nimportant economic role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this, then, is our new vision for the arts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it adds vim and vitality to our city, drawing\r\n\r\ntourists, and keeping talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it drives new industries and creates new jobs, and\r\n\r\nopens up new employment opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all, that it makes us a more creative people,\r\n\r\nequipped and energised to drive a creative economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me move on to address a number of specific\r\n\r\nissues Members have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See raises a pertinent point when he calls\r\n\r\nfor  the  conservation  of certain old  buildings,  like  the\r\n\r\nCapitol  Cinema,  to  retain  our  heritage.   Such  projects\r\n\r\nrequire the concerted effort of various agencies, such as the\r\n\r\nURA,  STB and NHB, and also the private sector.  I assure  Mr\r\n\r\nLoh  that  these  agencies  will work  actively  to  identify\r\n\r\nsuitable uses for old buildings, including the ones owned  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin wanted to know whether the money spent on\r\n\r\nthe  arts  has brought the sought after benefits.   Over  the\r\n\r\npast  two years, additional funds under the Renaissance  City\r\n\r\nProject  (or RCP) have enabled MITA to support more  artistes\r\n\r\nand  to bring the arts to wider audiences.  Let me cite a few\r\n\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2000 and FY 2001, about $7.5 million and $8.3\r\n\r\nmillion   were   disbursed  through   NAC's   grant   schemes\r\n\r\nrespectively.   This higher funding enabled our  artistes  to\r\n\r\ndevelop new works and also to perform overseas to gain  wider\r\n\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds also provide 31 individuals and 66 arts groups\r\n\r\nwith  affordable space to practise their art under the  NAC's\r\n\r\nArts Housing Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore hosted more than 4,500 art events - so on any one day, you've got more than 10 things you can do\r\n\r\n- attended by about 940,000 people at ticketed events - these\r\n\r\nare  the highest figures we have ever seen in our local  arts\r\n\r\nscene.   Compared to 1997, the number of events has increased\r\n\r\nabout 60% while\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naudiences have grown 25%.  This is not explosive growth,  but\r\n\r\nit  shows a steady and sustained interest in the arts.  So we\r\n\r\nhave made progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See suggested that we work more closely with\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  polytechnic students to tap  them,  both  as\r\n\r\naudiences and artistes.  I agree, but the process of exposure\r\n\r\nshould  start earlier.  This is the aim of the joint MITA-MOE\r\n\r\nArts  Education  Programme, which  reaches  out  to  primary,\r\n\r\nsecondary, JC and ITE students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong expressed his hope that everyone will\r\n\r\ndevelop  an appreciation for the arts.  I agree.  To  achieve\r\n\r\nthis, we need to change people's perception that the arts  is\r\n\r\nonly  for the rich or well-educated.  We can only do this  by\r\n\r\ngiving more people a first-hand experience of the arts.  Some\r\n\r\narts  groups are already doing quite a bit of this.  The  SSO\r\n\r\nperformed  in  Tampines earlier this year,  attracting  about\r\n\r\n2,000  people.  Last month, STB's performance at  West  Coast\r\n\r\nPark drew 3,000 people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can and will do more, and it will not plateau, as\r\n\r\nMr  Loh Meng See fears. MITA will launch an \"Arts Everywhere\"\r\n\r\nmovement to bring the arts to everyone, every time,  to  make\r\n\r\nthe arts a part of our everyday environment.  We will partner\r\n\r\nagencies  like  HDB,  CDCs and grassroots  organisations,  to\r\n\r\nbring  more performances to neighbourhood parks and community\r\n\r\nhalls.   We will also develop mobile exhibits that can travel\r\n\r\nto the heartlands.  Mr Seng will be glad to hear that many of\r\n\r\nthese  performances and programmes will be free.  But if  you\r\n\r\nwant to buy a painting, you have to pay for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, nothing is really for free. Ms Penny Low\r\n\r\nasked,   given  our  new  vision  for  the  arts,   and   the\r\n\r\ncontribution of the arts to the economy, whether we have  set\r\n\r\naside sufficient funds to promote and develop the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCP funds have given the arts a boost, and helped to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore a more \"happening\" place, indeed, a more funky\r\n\r\nplace, as Ms Indranee said.  With our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew vision for the arts, and with the support of hon. Members\r\n\r\nof  this House, MITA will continue to make a case for  higher\r\n\r\nGovernment  funding  and for the arts to develop  a  creative\r\n\r\neconomy, both in good times and bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we need the continuing support of\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  The private sector has been supportive.\r\n\r\nBut MITA will continue to develop new programmes to create  a\r\n\r\nstronger  partnership with them, to unlock the value  of  the\r\n\r\narts in business, and to bring about mutual benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite a few Members have asked how we can measure\r\n\r\nthe  impact of the arts on our society and economy.   We  can\r\n\r\nmeasure the impact of the arts on our economy from the number\r\n\r\nof  tourists,  or  the output of the creative  and  copyright\r\n\r\nindustries,  or the number of talented people who  will  make\r\n\r\nSingapore their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot measure in dollars and cents how the arts\r\n\r\ncontributes to our social bonding.  What value can  we  place\r\n\r\non  the  Singapore heartbeat, or the happiness that  we  feel\r\n\r\nafter  listening to an orchestra play, or the sense of  pride\r\n\r\nthat   beats  within  us  when  others  speak  well  of   our\r\n\r\ncommunities and our nation?  These are priceless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new mindset towards the arts. Like seeing the\r\n\r\nbig  heart in that stereogram, this is easier said than done.\r\n\r\nBut  once you see it [indicating], once you are able  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  heart  within the picture, you always  see  it.   If  we\r\n\r\nsucceed, if we are able to have a paradigm shift in the minds\r\n\r\nof all Singaporeans, then Singaporeans will see that the arts\r\n\r\ncontributes to the well-being of our society, as well  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  creation of new jobs, and greater competitiveness of our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the arts will no longer be something that we have\r\n\r\ngot to push people to support.  But like the air it breathes,\r\n\r\nit  will become an essential part of us.  That is the  vision\r\n\r\nof the arts that MITA will work towards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I read from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  Life!  section on 10th May that the  Ministry  has  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  approach,  that  is,  arts  plus  business  plus\r\n\r\ntechnology  provide the catalyst through cultural capital  to\r\n\r\nbuild a creative and connected Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key goals of the Ministry is to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  a  global media city.  I  must  commend  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  making  significant  progress  in  this  area.\r\n\r\nToday,  major media names, like BBC, Dow Jones and  satellite\r\n\r\nbroadcasters, like HBO, Walt Disney, ESPN and Discovery,  all\r\n\r\nhave  facilities  in  Singapore.  I would  like  to  ask  two\r\n\r\nquestions.  First, what is the Ministry's assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nprogress of Singapore's development as a media city?  Is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   monitoring  closely  the  developments  in   other\r\n\r\ncountries?   I am particularly impressed by the rapid  growth\r\n\r\nof Dubai as a media hub in the Middle East.  It launched a hi-tech, multimillion dollar Media City in January last year, as\r\n\r\npart  of the plan to make Dubai the region's information  and\r\n\r\nIT capital.  Is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere anything that the Ministry can learn from Dubai's rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth as a media hub?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the issue of censorship. Does our censorship\r\n\r\npolicy  hinder our growth as a media hub?  Let  me  cite  one\r\n\r\nexample.   We  have  been trying to develop Singapore's  film\r\n\r\nindustry.   Over the years, we have had hits like  \"Money  No\r\n\r\nEnough\"  and \"I Not Stupid\".  We also had some other  misses.\r\n\r\nRecently, there was a critically acclaimed film \"Lan Yu\" that\r\n\r\nwas  shown  at  the  Singapore International  Film  Festival.\r\n\r\nGranted that the film may not be seen by a wide audience here\r\n\r\ndue  to  our censorship guidelines, my question is: can  such\r\n\r\nfilms, however, be produced here for foreign audiences?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, the partial liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthe  media industry has resulted in some form of competition.\r\n\r\nSome  may  argue  that,  as  a  result,  the  consumers  have\r\n\r\nbenefited.   The choices for local newspapers, TV  and  radio\r\n\r\nhave  increased.  Furthermore, with the availability of cable\r\n\r\nTV, we are all spoilt for choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is the quality and standards of the local\r\n\r\nmedia.   After all, the dust has settled.  Can we really  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  partial liberalisation has achieved its objectives\r\n\r\nand,  in  turn, increased the standards and quality  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral benefit of the public?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore aspires to be a media hub for the region.\r\n\r\nBut,  on  the  other hand, we also exercise  a  cautious  and\r\n\r\nstrict control over the media industry.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to give his position on standards and highlight\r\n\r\nthe  regulations  that  are  in place  to  ensure  our  media\r\n\r\ncompanies are not controlled by foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with the Minister that there is a vast\r\n\r\npotential for content development and production.  This  area\r\n\r\nneeds  enhancement and boost.  I would just like to  cite  an\r\n\r\nexample.   A  few days ago, we were fortunate to welcome  the\r\n\r\ndelegates from Iran.  We asked them how they managed to  grow\r\n\r\ntheir film industry and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  statistics that they cited  to  us  was  quite\r\n\r\nimpressive for a country, like Iran.  It produces  60  to  70\r\n\r\nfilms  a  year and about 2,000-3,000 amateur films per  year.\r\n\r\nThey  have  also attained international recognition  and  won\r\n\r\nseveral  international awards.  Just recently a country  like\r\n\r\nBosnia,  which is stricken by war and trouble in the country,\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  win  the  international  foreign  award  at  the\r\n\r\nAcademy.  So these are the examples that we can see.   For  a\r\n\r\ncountry like Singapore, we can learn from countries which are\r\n\r\nhaving difficulties and yet they are able to grow their  film\r\n\r\nindustry.  So I would like to ask what are the plans of  MITA\r\n\r\nto boost this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Mr Zainudin has asked whether\r\n\r\ncompetition in print and TV media has improved the quality of\r\n\r\nthese  media.  And Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked for a progress\r\n\r\nreport  on  the development of the media industry.   When  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  competition in the print and  TV  media  in  June\r\n\r\n2000, we hoped that this would give viewers and readers  more\r\n\r\nmedia choices, higher quality content, including better news.\r\n\r\nWe  also  wanted  to make our media companies  stronger,  and\r\n\r\nbetter positioned to compete in a multimedia world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years, viewers and readers have more choices.\r\n\r\nThere are two more English language papers and a net increase\r\n\r\nof  one free-to-air channel.  There are more news and current\r\n\r\naffairs   programmes  on  television.   TV   viewership   and\r\n\r\nnewspaper readership are up about 6-8 percentage points.  And\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  to  say  that  the Programmes  and  Publications\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committees have observed that the overall quality of\r\n\r\nboth print and broadcast media has been maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has also brought about innovations. New\r\n\r\nformats  have  been  introduced for TV  news,  some  channels\r\n\r\nleveraging  their  presentations  off  their  pool  of  print\r\n\r\njournalists.   The main local newspapers have introduced  new\r\n\r\nfeatures  and offer more in-depth analysis and discussion  of\r\n\r\nissues.  The media companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  also  started to link and cross-promote their  contents\r\n\r\nacross  different  media,  such as  TV,  newspapers  and  the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take one example, Channel NewsAsia is increasingly\r\n\r\nrecognised as a reliable and credible information source with\r\n\r\na  distinct  Asian  voice, especially  in  the  wake  of  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11  incident.  It not only  provides  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith  excellent news coverage, but now reaches more  than  10\r\n\r\nmillion homes across 15 countries in the region.  So overall,\r\n\r\nwe  can say that competition has given consumers in Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  choices and we are beginning to see some of the  sought\r\n\r\nafter benefits in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for free-to-air television and newspapers is\r\n\r\ncurrently  between  two media groups, each  dominant  in  one\r\n\r\nfield  of  media.  So far, competition, while keen,  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  dysfunctional.   However,  our  local  media  plays  an\r\n\r\nimportant  social  role, and we must  therefore  ensure  that\r\n\r\nsocial  goals are not compromised as a result of competition.\r\n\r\nFor example, we want to ensure that a certain amount of local\r\n\r\nprogramming  is  available during prime time  on  television.\r\n\r\nAnd  we do not want our newspapers to compete for readers  by\r\n\r\nsensationalising the news, or publishing sleazy articles.  To\r\n\r\nensure  that neither group abuses its dominant position,  and\r\n\r\nthat  quality does not decline, MITA is planning to implement\r\n\r\na  competition code later this year for the media sector.   A\r\n\r\ndraft code prepared by MITA's consultants has been circulated\r\n\r\nto the media industry for comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to Mr Zainudin's point and concern about foreign\r\n\r\ninfluence,  I think he need not be concerned about  this,  as\r\n\r\nthis  is adequately taken care of by the existing rules under\r\n\r\nthe  Newspaper  and  Printing Presses Act,  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Broadcasting Authority Act.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a broader perspective, the media industry goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  free-to-air television and newspapers to include  all\r\n\r\ntypes of content creation and content delivery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformats.  This is a rapidly changing industry that offers new\r\n\r\nopportunities for growth, from film production to  animation,\r\n\r\nto multimedia services, to video-on-demand and, soon to come,\r\n\r\n3G  multimedia messaging.  Companies are merging so that they\r\n\r\ncan  leverage their capabilities across different  technology\r\n\r\nplatforms and market segments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has noted that others, like Dubai,\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Zainudin  has also noted Iran, have  recognised  the\r\n\r\neconomic   value  of  this  industry  and  are   aggressively\r\n\r\npromoting  it.   What can we learn from them?   We  must,  at\r\n\r\nleast, be equally aggressive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give focus to the media industry, we will merge\r\n\r\nSingapore   Broadcasting  Authority  (SBA),  the  Films   and\r\n\r\nPublications   Department  (FPD)  and  the  Singapore   Films\r\n\r\nCommission (SFC) into a single statutory body which  will  be\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Media  Development Authority  (MDA).   MDA  will\r\n\r\npromote  the  growth of the media industry,  working  closely\r\n\r\nwith  EDB  and  other  agencies, to  attract  investments  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   to  develop  our  local  content   creation\r\n\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang wanted to know if our censorship\r\n\r\nregime would stifle the growth of the media industry.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  so.   Because  of  our  multi-racial  and  multi-religious  society, we set guidelines for contents  that  are\r\n\r\ntargetted  at  Singaporeans.   But  we  do  not  impose   our\r\n\r\nstandards  on  others.   Media  businesses  are  welcomed  to\r\n\r\noperate  here within the laws of the land.  The formation  of\r\n\r\nthe  MDA  will bring together the various content  regulatory\r\n\r\nbodies,  to ensure that all our content regulations are  well\r\n\r\ncoordinated across different media and correctly balanced  to\r\n\r\npromote social harmony while encouraging industry growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the competition code in place and the formation of\r\n\r\nMDA,  we  expect to see renewed vigour in the media  industry\r\n\r\nand the creation of new job opportunities for Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nthe years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last year, in the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply, I raised the possibility of us having  a\r\n\r\nFreedom  of Information Act.  My argument, if you recall,  is\r\n\r\nthat  governments these days are expected to  be  transparent\r\n\r\nand  accountable.   Freeing  up  information  will  also   be\r\n\r\nconsistent with our desire to become a knowledge economy.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that,  with  information,  people  can  make  better\r\n\r\ninformed choices than they otherwise would have been able  to\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can understand there is a need to consider\r\n\r\nissues  of  national security in deciding whether or  not  to\r\n\r\nrelease   information,  there  could  be   other   types   of\r\n\r\ninformation  where such concerns are not pressing.   In  this\r\n\r\narea, perhaps the Government can be more liberal and open  in\r\n\r\nproviding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did say then that the Freedom of Information\r\n\r\nlegislation serves two purposes.  If I could recap, first, it\r\n\r\nimposes an obligation on the part of the Government to  allow\r\n\r\nnon-security, non-sensitive information to be made  available\r\n\r\nto  citizens  where  such information affects  their  rights.\r\n\r\nOften,  information about a person may be gathered which  has\r\n\r\nan  effect  on  the  way the Government  decides  on  matters\r\n\r\naffecting the person which may not be accurate and which does\r\n\r\nnot  lend itself to being challenged by the interested party.\r\n\r\nSubject  only to requirements of national security, I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  why  such information may not be made available  to  the\r\n\r\nperson  concerned  after, perhaps, an appropriate  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the availability of information to interested\r\n\r\npersons,  as  of right, may have a salutary effect  on  civil\r\n\r\nservants.   As a civil servant, if he knows that  his  record\r\n\r\nwill be subject to public scrutiny at some point of time,  he\r\n\r\nwill be more careful perhaps in the way in which he documents\r\n\r\nhis  record.  This will have a positive effect on maintaining\r\n\r\nand, perhaps, raising the level of conduct of civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his reply to my query last year, my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleague, Mr Yatiman  Yusof,  said  that  our\r\n\r\nNational Heritage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard Act allows for declassification of Government documents\r\n\r\nafter a period of time, and from time to time.  I had a  look\r\n\r\nat  the Act and would add that it falls far short of what  we\r\n\r\nare trying to achieve here for the following reasons.  First,\r\n\r\nthe  Act does not set out any comprehensive framework for the\r\n\r\ndeclassification  of information within a certain  timeframe.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it does not confer upon a person a statutory  right\r\n\r\nto  ask  for information that may be relevant to him.   There\r\n\r\nare many more reasons but, for now, these two are sufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way to feel that we are mature\r\n\r\nenough  to  consider such a legislation  as  the  Freedom  of\r\n\r\nInformation Act.  To be sure, we are not the first to look at\r\n\r\nthis,  as many countries in the west, such as the UK and  the\r\n\r\nUSA,  have  already done so.  And if we want to move  towards\r\n\r\nthe  developed standards elsewhere, it is about time that  we\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  enacting such a legislation  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe Government could consider such a legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Arthur Fong is not here.

In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  would like to ask the Minister  to  choose  more\r\n\r\neducation over control on the issue of Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the right\r\n\r\nto  be  left alone or to keep information about ourselves  to\r\n\r\nourselves  is  a right that I believe everyone  would  value.\r\n\r\nInformational privacy has become one of the most  significant\r\n\r\nforms  of  this  right  in the last decade,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nadvances  made  in  technology and the everyday  use  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet.   Perhaps,  in recognition  of  this,  the  IDA  is\r\n\r\ncharged  with  the  specific duty  and  given  the  power  to\r\n\r\nestablish,  maintain  and promote data protection,  standards\r\n\r\nand codes relating to privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology to make it easier for us to surf the\r\n\r\nInternet   also  presents  risks  to  informational  privacy.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows what cookies are.  Those who have yet to  surf\r\n\r\nthe  Net probably think that they are biscuits.  Children are\r\n\r\nmore  familiar with the cookie monster.   But, for those  who\r\n\r\nsurf the Net, they know cookies as software devices that  are\r\n\r\nused  by server connections to store and retrieve information\r\n\r\nabout  the user.  It is intended to make life easier for  the\r\n\r\nuser, because the user preferences are then stored and become\r\n\r\nknown  to  the server.  But, increasingly, these cookies  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  cookie  monsters.  They are used  by  many  service\r\n\r\nproviders   to  collect  information,  which  is  then   sold\r\n\r\ncommercially, usually to mass marketing agencies.  The  users\r\n\r\nsuddenly find themselves bombarded with thousands of messages\r\n\r\nadvertising all sorts of products.  I am sure the  experience\r\n\r\nis  not  unique to anybody, and it is a common one.  I myself\r\n\r\nhave   had  advertisements  for  flowers,  chocolates,   even\r\n\r\npregnancy  kits  which, of course, I do  not  think  I  need.\r\n\r\nObviously,  many  see this trend as a severe infringement  of\r\n\r\npersonal privacy.  And the US legislature has recognised this\r\n\r\nby  considering a Bill on online personal privacy, which  has\r\n\r\njust   secured  the  approval  of  the  US  Senate   Commerce\r\n\r\nCommittee.   The general view is that good privacy  practices\r\n\r\nmean  good  business.  Consumer confidence will increase  and\r\n\r\nmore will use the Net for their purchases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, a number of letters have surfaced in the\r\n\r\nForum  Page of the Straits Times, lamenting the lack of  such\r\n\r\nlaws  in Singapore.  Singapore has so far preferred the self-regulating solution for both the private and public  sectors.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is generally now regarded as insufficient for a\r\n\r\nnumber  of reasons.  Firstly, companies may set out having  a\r\n\r\ngood  privacy  policy but may actually change in  due  course\r\n\r\nwithout  the  users'  consent after  collecting  information.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are many cases of companies facing bankruptcy\r\n\r\nand  selling their databases as a means of keeping afloat and\r\n\r\nyet  others,  of  course,  may deliberately  use  cookies  to\r\n\r\nsurreptitiously  collect information for commercial  reasons.\r\n\r\nSuch companies are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlikely to abide by any self-regulating code without teeth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to promote consumer confidence is to promote\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce.  Promoting consumer confidence  requires\r\n\r\nserious  attention to be paid to the protection  of  personal\r\n\r\ndata.  Only legislation can lay down the baseline of personal\r\n\r\nprivacy  protection.  Self-regulation has not been a  success\r\n\r\nso  far.   This is recognised in the United States and  other\r\n\r\ncountries, such as the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,\r\n\r\nTaiwan  and Japan.  We must not be lagging behind if  we  see\r\n\r\nourselves in the forefront of electronic commerce.  I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, like to ask the Minister to consider the following\r\n\r\nmeasures:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, ask IDA to seriously explore the legislative option\r\n\r\nfor  providing  a  baseline of protection  for  informational\r\n\r\nprivacy;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, advise and direct all websites or content providers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to  make available a privacy  policy  that  is\r\n\r\ncouched in simple language and not legalese; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, to encourage the use of IBM's free technology\r\n\r\nsolution  to  privacy,  the  Tivoli  programme,  that   will,\r\n\r\namazingly,  translate  all  written  privacy  policies   into\r\n\r\nelectronic  format  and  apply the whole  new  rules  to  the\r\n\r\nwebsite of the content provider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in consumer law, there is a general rule called\r\n\r\ncaveat emptor or \"buyers beware\".  This rule has increasingly\r\n\r\nbeen  supplanted  by  legislation protecting  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nconsumers to physical goods.  In the case of the Internet, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  personal  privacy  is concerned,  it  is  still  the\r\n\r\nsituation   of   \"Surfers  beware.    Cookie   monsters   are\r\n\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to act to protect informational privacy\r\n\r\nin  a  meaningful manner and, I hope, the Minister will  take\r\n\r\nnote of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you have two cuts.

This has caused fear and unease to some of the\r\n\r\nwebsite  operators.  As we have read in the papers,  some  of\r\n\r\nthese active civil society members, like Dr Tan Chong Kee  of\r\n\r\nSintercom, would rather close down the website than  to  have\r\n\r\nit registered with the SBA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Singaporeans to take on and compete in the\r\n\r\nglobal arena, we cannot continue to restrict them to grow  up\r\n\r\nin  a  closed  and  protected environment.   If  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncannot  be trusted to judge issues for themselves,  how  will\r\n\r\nthey  ever learn?  Such requirement for political control  is\r\n\r\nnot  helpful  to  the nurturing and growth of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Will the Minister look into freeing up more space\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  to  own  and operate  discussions  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet without the feeling that Big Brother is watching and\r\n\r\ncoming  to  catch  them?   I hope the  Minister  will  remove\r\n\r\npolitical societies and websites with political contents from\r\n\r\nthis registration requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to my second cut, Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister regarding the application of a printing permit for a\r\n\r\npolitical  party newsletter, what is the reason for requiring\r\n\r\nall  the  CEC  members of a party to apply for this  printing\r\n\r\npermit.  It is not possible for the whole CEC to sit  on  the\r\n\r\neditorial  board  to  edit every article of  the  newsletter.\r\n\r\nShould  not  the  onus and licence requirement responsibility\r\n\r\nfrom the Editorial Board alone be sufficient?  This will help\r\n\r\nto  simplify  requirements and also be a lot more meaningful.\r\n\r\nCan the Minister kindly explain why all the CEC members in  a\r\n\r\npolitical party that applies for such a printing permit  also\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  declare  their personal  assets?   Is  this\r\n\r\nrequirement  also  enforced upon the PAP publication,  Petir?\r\n\r\nAnd  that all the PAP CEC members also have to declare  their\r\n\r\npersonal  assets  to MITA when they apply for  this  printing\r\n\r\npermit.  I am not sure, but I do not think so.  Therefore, is\r\n\r\nsuch   a  requirement  a  veiled  threat  to  the  opposition\r\n\r\npolitical parties and a means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  suppress their freedom of publication?

These are fundamental issues to the way nations\r\n\r\nare  governed  and  to  the  way  societies  function.   Each\r\n\r\ncommunity  has to decide for itself what these  rules  should\r\n\r\nbe.   While  these  issues are not new, our  environment  has\r\n\r\nchanged,  and we cannot duck these changes.  We are a  global\r\n\r\ncity and, therefore, open to influences from everywhere,  and\r\n\r\nwe must adjust and adapt to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One challenge is the Internet. The Internet has become\r\n\r\na  vital tool for business and personal growth.  But, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  it is also a source of all kinds of  undesirable\r\n\r\ncontent,  including pornographic content and hate  materials.\r\n\r\nFiltering software, offered by the Internet Service Providers\r\n\r\n(ISPs),  can  help to keep out some of these materials.   But\r\n\r\nregulations  alone cannot prevent the naive and curious  from\r\n\r\nbeing tricked or lured to undesirable sites.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore agree with Mr Zainudin that we should\r\n\r\neducate  the public and in particular, parents, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan   take  their  own  preventive  actions  to  avoid   such\r\n\r\nmaterials.   Last  February, SBA  established  a  $5  million\r\n\r\nInternet  Public  Education Fund. To-date, $1.2  million  has\r\n\r\nbeen  used to support eight on-line safety projects. The fund\r\n\r\nhas  benefited organisations like the Parents' Advisory Group\r\n\r\nfor  the Internet (PAGi). PAGi was formed two years ago,  and\r\n\r\nhas  trained more than 23,000 parents to provide guidance  to\r\n\r\ntheir children on the safe use of the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we also need to provide safeguards against\r\n\r\nanother  kind  of abuse over the Internet, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nspurious  use of the Internet to spread false information  or\r\n\r\nto  inflame  emotions, causing hurt to affected  parties  and\r\n\r\nharm to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety.

Sintercom\r\n\r\nneed   not   have  closed  down  because  of   these   rules.\r\n\r\nRegistration  does  not  impose any  extra  rule  on  content\r\n\r\nproviders and websites.  Nor does it disallow open discussion\r\n\r\nor criticism of Government policies.  Yes, indeed, the public\r\n\r\nis free to access these sites and to judge for themselves the\r\n\r\ncontents.   These sites are bound by the class licence  rules\r\n\r\nof the Internet, and by the laws of the land. Registration is\r\n\r\na reasonable and prudent measure to establish accountability,\r\n\r\nand  to  deter irresponsible persons from using the cloak  of\r\n\r\nanonymity to create mischief and harm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia also asked why it is necessary for the CEC\r\n\r\nmembers of political parties to be named as the publishers of\r\n\r\nparty websites and newspapers, and to declare their assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in politics, it is only too easy to run down\r\n\r\npolitical opponents or to stir up trouble under the cloak  of\r\n\r\nanonymity.  This is why it is necessary to remove this cover.\r\n\r\nIt  is  reasonable  and fair to expect CEC  members,  as  the\r\n\r\nhighest  decision making body of a party, to stand  by  their\r\n\r\nviews  openly,  and  to  take  responsibility  for  what   is\r\n\r\npublished  on  their  website or in  the  newspapers.   Also,\r\n\r\nrequiring CEC members to declare their assets when they apply\r\n\r\nfor  a  newspaper  permit ensures that  they  are  people  of\r\n\r\nsubstance  who have not tried to avoid their responsibilities\r\n\r\nby appointing proxies to represent them on the CEC, and to be\r\n\r\nthe fall guys should they run into trouble with the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has also asked if this rule applies to Petir and\r\n\r\nto the PAP.  Yes, it does.  But PAP CEC members declare their\r\n\r\nassets to the Prime Minister and SBA accepts that declaration\r\n\r\nas fulfilment of this requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to the issue of data protection which\r\n\r\nwas raised by Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung, who has informed me\r\n\r\nthat, owing to an urgent personal matter, he is unable to  be\r\n\r\npresent  for  the response.  The ability to  store  and  move\r\n\r\ntremendous  amounts  of data and the open  structure  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet  make all of us vulnerable to information misuse  or\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is mindful of this. Apart from basic\r\n\r\nlegislation,  like the Computer Misuse Act, we  have  enacted\r\n\r\nsector-specific legislation, like the Private  Hospitals  and\r\n\r\nMedical Clinics Act, the Banking Act and the Income Tax  Act,\r\n\r\nto protect sensitive personal data like medical and financial\r\n\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sector-specific legislation, however, may not cover all\r\n\r\ntypes  of  information that an individual may  want  to  keep\r\n\r\nprivate.  However,  a wide and sweeping legislation  on  data\r\n\r\nprotection may also not be the best way to move forward or to\r\n\r\nmake  things better.  This is because such a law  could  deny\r\n\r\ncompanies'  access to information that they need to  come  up\r\n\r\nwith   better  ways  to  tailor  products  and  services   to\r\n\r\ncustomers.  It would hinder innovations, and customers  would\r\n\r\nmiss  out on useful and convenient services.  After all,  not\r\n\r\nall  of  us reject cookies.  Some of us do like the taste  of\r\n\r\nsome of those cookies.  And we accept the cookies because  we\r\n\r\nwant  to get to those sites.  Also, complying with a broadly-based law could raise significantly business costs, and  this\r\n\r\nwould affect small businesses and start-ups the most.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These benefits apply both to the private and the public\r\n\r\nsectors.    Indeed,  through  e-Government,  many   new   and\r\n\r\nconvenient  services have been delivered to the  public.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  approach to data protection is,  therefore,  to\r\n\r\nset  in  place  rules  and  processes  that  would  safeguard\r\n\r\nprivacy, without incurring high costs or stifling innovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has its own internal guidelines,\r\n\r\nadministered by the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Finance,  that guard against misuse of information.   The\r\n\r\nSecond Minister for Finance elaborated on this in this  House\r\n\r\nlast week, so I shall not go into that further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, we are working with the private sector to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   industry   self-regulation.   The   industry-led\r\n\r\nNational   Trust  Council  is  currently  conducting   public\r\n\r\nconsultation  on  a  Data Protection  Code  for  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.    The   draft  code  is  modelled  on  international\r\n\r\nstandards, and I would encourage Members to give their  views\r\n\r\nto the Council as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me touch on free access to information. Mr\r\n\r\nSin  Boon Ann has argued that Singapore should have a Freedom\r\n\r\nof  Information  Act.  He has raised this before.   He  feels\r\n\r\nthat  it  is appropriate, in an information-oriented  society\r\n\r\nlike  ours,  that  individuals should  have  free  access  to\r\n\r\ninformation held by the Government, and that this would  make\r\n\r\nthe  Government  more  careful in  the  way  it  manages  its\r\n\r\ninformation resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is natural as we become more and more of an\r\n\r\ninformation society, that the public will want to have  great\r\n\r\naccess  to information that are important to them,  and  that\r\n\r\naffect  their daily lives.   To-date, Government  information\r\n\r\nis available through a variety of channels, for example, mass\r\n\r\nmedia, governmental publications, the Government websites  of\r\n\r\nwhich  there are many, and the National Archives.  Parliament\r\n\r\nis  also  a  source of information where MPs  regularly  file\r\n\r\nquestions to get specific answers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But legislating information access rights, as suggested,\r\n\r\nalso   has  its  pros  and  cons.   Yes,  it  might   improve\r\n\r\ntransparency, but it will also shift more public resources to\r\n\r\naddressing   individual  demands,  rather   than   collective\r\n\r\nbenefits.   It  may  also  impose  rigidities  on   the   way\r\n\r\ninformation  must  be kept and managed in order  to  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  for public scrutiny.  And like data protection,  a\r\n\r\nlegislated approach to information access can raise costs and\r\n\r\nhinder innovation within the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the public today is denied\r\n\r\ninformation they need,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcept for information that could compromise our security  or\r\n\r\nnational  interests.  Is there a practical need that  is  not\r\n\r\nmet?   In practical terms, we have more access to information\r\n\r\nthan  we really can use. But if there are specific needs that\r\n\r\nare not addressed, then we should take a look at them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system we have today is working well. Instead of a\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act, there may be more practical value\r\n\r\nat  this  time  to take a needs-based approach and  cultivate\r\n\r\ngreater  civic  awareness  and  involvement  around  specific\r\n\r\nissues that can benefit the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues that the Members have raised on\r\n\r\ninformation management are fundamental to the development  of\r\n\r\nour  society,  whether  it  is data  protection,  freedom  of\r\n\r\ninformation  access  or censorship.  Our society  is  neither\r\n\r\nstatic  nor closed, and we will review our policies in  these\r\n\r\nareas  from  time to time to keep pace with our economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Members for making these important issues as\r\n\r\npart of this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I just want to seek some\r\n\r\nclarification from the Acting Minister.  Just  now,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the particulars of assets of the members of the CEC  of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  are  handed  to the Prime Minister.  If  I  am  not\r\n\r\nmistaken, the PAP is a private political party, just like any\r\n\r\nother  political  party in Singapore.  I  believe  also  that\r\n\r\nPetir is a publication of a private organisation.  It is  not\r\n\r\na Government publication.  How is the law being complied with\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  required that all the CEC members  must  submit\r\n\r\ntheir  assets  to SBA, but in this case, it was submitted  to\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clarification. When the details of assets are\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the Prime Minister, is it submitted to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  as Prime Minister, or is it submitted to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister as the head of the PAP?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> The PAP is not just a private political\r\n\r\nparty.

When office-holders  declare  their assets to the  Prime  Minister,  they\r\n\r\ndeclare  to  the Prime Minister as the Prime  Minister.   The\r\n\r\npurpose  of having this rule, as I gave Mr Steve Chia  in  my\r\n\r\nreply,  was  to  ensure that the CEC members  are  people  of\r\n\r\nsubstance and that they do not put proxies on board  the  CEC\r\n\r\nso  that  these proxies can be the fall guys for them  should\r\n\r\nthey  run  into trouble.  This objective is achieved  by  the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  that the CEC members make to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin their duties as office -holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, Infocomm Vision 21 aims to achieve\r\n\r\ne-Government, e-business and e-lifestyle in Singapore in five\r\n\r\nyears'  time.   To-date,  many  Singaporeans  understand  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of IT, but many are still experiencing difficulty in\r\n\r\nacquiring   necessary  IT  skills,  especially   the   senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing IT skills and awareness is important. But\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more important is to make sure that those who  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  IT  know how to apply the IT skills to  better  their\r\n\r\nlives.

Is\r\n\r\nthe Minister satisfied with the broadband adoption?  What are\r\n\r\nthe  causes for resistance to broadband access?  Is  price  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent?

Do we have the critical mass  and\r\n\r\nthe economy of scale to enable these networks to survive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, also Sir, the consumers of bandwidth do not see the\r\n\r\nprices   falling,   even   though   telecommunications    has\r\n\r\nliberalised  and we see more competition.  We  read  recently\r\n\r\nthat Starhub is going to acquire SCV and I am concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  role  of content providers and systems integrators.   By\r\n\r\nallowing the two large groups remaining, will there be a role\r\n\r\nfor  content providers?  I think one of the great issues with\r\n\r\nregard  to  telecommunications is really the role of  content\r\n\r\nproviders,  the variety of them, the access and provision  of\r\n\r\ncontent and how the systems could be integrated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with my colleague before me who has spoken, I\r\n\r\nsee  that  the percentage of the workforce which is competent\r\n\r\nin  infocomm, has only risen marginally from 43% to 45%.

It  is  all  good and well  to  anticipate  and\r\n\r\nproject   the   possible  growth  and  earnings   from   this\r\n\r\ntechnology.    There   are  still  many   uncertainties   and\r\n\r\ntechnologically speaking, there are many hurdles to  overcome\r\n\r\nand bugs to cure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could learn from the experience of the European\r\n\r\ncountries    that    had    inadvertently    thrown     their\r\n\r\ntelecommunication companies into battle for  the  coveted  3G\r\n\r\nlicence, even before any concrete system or services could be\r\n\r\nrolled out. Is this a good thing to do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to caution the Minister against\r\n\r\nputting a high premium on the 3G licence, because in the end,\r\n\r\nit  is  the  consumer who is going to pay for these services,\r\n\r\nand  worse still, it could hinder the growth rather than help\r\n\r\nit to develop to its full potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, first\r\n\r\nlet me thank the four Members who spoke up on various aspects\r\n\r\nof  infocomm development in Singapore.  As this is the  first\r\n\r\nBudget in which ICT comes under the purview of MITA, allow me\r\n\r\nto  briefly sketch out MITA's view on this sector, even as  I\r\n\r\nreply to the specific queries of the Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ICT sector in Singapore has come a long way since\r\n\r\n1981  when we formed the National Computer Board.  The  early\r\n\r\npioneers have gone on with age.  Some have moved to  take  on\r\n\r\nnew  responsibilities, like Mr Philip Yeo, who is now leading\r\n\r\nthe  charge  of growing another new industry for Singapore  - the life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsciences.  Another notable pioneer is Minister Lim Swee  Say,\r\n\r\nwho  is  now  championing the cause of clean environment  and\r\n\r\nNEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have these and many other pioneers to thank for the\r\n\r\nsignificant progress that we have achieved.  They helped  lay\r\n\r\nnot only a strong foundation, but a nimble culture, which has\r\n\r\nallowed  us  to  move  in  tandem  with  global  market   and\r\n\r\ntechnology  trends.  Over the years, we see NCB  moving  from\r\n\r\nMindef  to MOF, to MTI and then to MCIT to merge with TAS  to\r\n\r\nbecome IDA.  And now IDA has moved into MITA's stable to help\r\n\r\nus  push  the  ICT  sector to a new  height  as  we  position\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the  next  wave of convergences  between  IT,\r\n\r\ntelecoms and broadcasting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after 20 years, the ICT sector has grown to become a\r\n\r\nvery  significant  contributor to  our  GDP.   Its  value-add\r\n\r\ncontributes  about  5.5%, which is  significant.   The  total\r\n\r\nindustry  revenue is about $26 billion, and growing strongly.\r\n\r\nRight  through  the Asian financial crisis,  the  ICT  sector\r\n\r\ncontinued its strong and robust growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress we have made in the sector does not happen\r\n\r\nnaturally.  It is the result of proactive planning and timely\r\n\r\npolicy  interventions.   On  the policy  side,  let  me  just\r\n\r\nhighlight  three  major initiatives, which have  particularly\r\n\r\npositioned us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government's decision to fully liberalise the\r\n\r\ntelco  sector  in April 2000.  Competition has  brought  down\r\n\r\nprices, and increased the range of service offerings  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  young  and old.  Many of  us  have  personally\r\n\r\nbenefited from this.  My daughters certainly do.  One of them\r\n\r\ntold  me  the other night that she sends 700 SMS  messages  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   She  assured me that she is not among  the  heaviest\r\n\r\nusers in her class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government's decision to bring about a world-class infocomm infrastructure. Our IT 2000 Masterplan\r\n\r\ntransformed  Singapore into an Intelligent  Island.   We  now\r\n\r\nhave  1  million  homes in Singapore, all of which  have  the\r\n\r\noptions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  effect broadband connection, either via ADSL, the  copper\r\n\r\nwire, or SCV cable.  And, increasingly, some homes will  also\r\n\r\nhave a third \"wire\", which is wireless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked about progress in broadband\r\n\r\nadoption in homes and offices, which Mr Loh Meng See asked as\r\n\r\nwell.   We had a recent survey and it showed nearly 1 million\r\n\r\nbroadband  users  in  Singapore.  This  means  that  1  in  3\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, above the age of 10, are broadband users.  More\r\n\r\nsignificantly, more than half of them took up broadband  only\r\n\r\nlast  year.  So clearly, the big bang in telco liberalisation\r\n\r\nhas contributed to this growth, by bringing down prices.   As\r\n\r\nfar  as I know, the cheapest broadband access package in town\r\n\r\nis only $38 per month, for unlimited usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government's initiative to actively cultivate\r\n\r\nsophisticated demand.  We have, as Dr Tan put it, gone beyond\r\n\r\nthe  IT awareness stage to cultivate savvy usage of this very\r\n\r\nimportant medium.  The public sector is leading on this.  Its\r\n\r\n$1.5 billion e-Government Action Plan seeks to transform  the\r\n\r\ncivil service into a leading e-Government in the world.  Two-thirds  of all Government services that can be offered online\r\n\r\nare  already  being delivered electronically.  But,  we  will\r\n\r\npush  towards 100%.  So, similarly, our private sector should\r\n\r\nactively review their business processes to see how they  can\r\n\r\nfurther  exploit ICT to attract, to retain,  and  to  delight\r\n\r\ntheir customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, after 20 years of strong growth, the ICT\r\n\r\nsector  remains in a dynamic, creative and developing  phase.\r\n\r\nTechnology  will continue to surprise.  Broadband,  wireless,\r\n\r\n3G,  web  services, digital media, next generation  Internet,\r\n\r\nand who knows what, will open up many new opportunities.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  merger of ICT with media  should  throw  up\r\n\r\nexciting  opportunities.  For example, in the  digital  media\r\n\r\ncontent  industry, many industry analysts expect it  to  grow\r\n\r\nfrom US$100 billion to possibly US$350 billion by 2004.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  exciting  field where arts, business  and  technology\r\n\r\nintersect.   Winners will go to those with  a  good  dose  of\r\n\r\ncreativity and imagination.  Those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  provide  the consumers with a differentiated  experience\r\n\r\nwill  win.  It is a wide field, including animation, computer\r\n\r\ngames,  music,  entertainment, film  and  print  media  using\r\n\r\ndigital   technology   for   both   content   creation    and\r\n\r\ndistribution.   Our  Singapore  companies  should   seriously\r\n\r\nconsider how they can ride on this wave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan was correct to highlight the boom and\r\n\r\nbust  of  dot-coms.  He asked if the bust should lead  us  to\r\n\r\nreview  our Infocomm 21 Vision.  Many dot-coms have  crashed,\r\n\r\nbut  the  effects of the Internet Revolution in changing  the\r\n\r\nway  we  live, work and play, are permanent.  Industries  and\r\n\r\ncompanies  continue  to be transformed  by  ICT.   Technology\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  make progress.  So we are reviewing,  or  more\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  updating our Infocomm 21 Vision, not so  much  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  bust of the dot-coms,  but  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount the continuing progress in technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one key difference in our approach going\r\n\r\nforward.   In  the  last 20 years, the Government's  role  in\r\n\r\nchampioning   the  industry,  jumpstarting  the  development,\r\n\r\ninvesting  in capabilities and infrastructure,  have  laid  a\r\n\r\nstrong foundation.  It has been largely supply-driven, policy-driven  and domestic focus.  Going forward for the sector  to\r\n\r\nachieve  its next breakthrough, the efforts will have  to  be\r\n\r\nmore demand-driven, industry-driven and export-oriented.   It\r\n\r\nmeans  leadership in exploiting ICT for strategic  advantage.\r\n\r\nIt  means  the  ability  to extract maximum  value  from  our\r\n\r\ncommanding  lead,  to go beyond Singapore  to  penetrate  the\r\n\r\nmarket overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chair the Economic Review Committee's Services\r\n\r\nIndustry Sub-Committee.  We  have identified several  service\r\n\r\nsectors  which we think Singapore can excel in, and  the  ICT\r\n\r\nsector  is  a clear candidate.  Given our 20 years  of  head-start  and investments in capabilities, we are bullish  about\r\n\r\nits continuing growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A completely industry-driven ICT Working Group, led by\r\n\r\nMr Wilson Tan of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  IT Federation, has been busily working  with  more\r\n\r\nthan  100  industry players to help us draw up  the  strategy\r\n\r\ngoing  forward.   They will complete their  work  and  submit\r\n\r\ntheir recommendations in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One strong advantage of Singapore in the ICT sector is\r\n\r\nthat young Singaporeans are not shy of new technology or  new\r\n\r\ngadgets.  Our parents may seem to be shy of ICT, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  because they are shy of new  technology.   The\r\n\r\nlower usage of ICT among the older Singaporeans is often  due\r\n\r\nto other factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I personally dislike SMS (I do not mean my\r\n\r\nneighbours in this Chamber), because I cannot stand the  tiny\r\n\r\nscreen of the mobile phone and my thumb seems too big for the\r\n\r\nkeys.   Likewise,  many  older Singaporeans  are  \"digitally-divided\"  because  the working language on  the  Internet  is\r\n\r\nstill largely English, and many do not know how to type.   So\r\n\r\nunderstanding  these  barriers is  important  if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nfurther bridge the digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA's various initiatives have produced meaningful\r\n\r\nresults.   I will just name a few.  For example, through  its\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  under   the\r\n\r\nNational  IT  Literacy Programme, we have trained  more  than\r\n\r\n80,000  Singaporeans.  The One Learning Place  at  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nCommunity  Library has trained more than 100,000 Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  the  use of broadband.  My mother-in-law attended one  of\r\n\r\nthe  courses in a neighbourhood community centre and she  now\r\n\r\nenjoys  her  real-time mahjong session on Yahoo.com,  playing\r\n\r\nwith players from all over the world, whom she never met.   I\r\n\r\nwatched  her play the other day.  She could not take part  in\r\n\r\nthe  cyber-chat which always accompanies such  games  because\r\n\r\nshe does not understand English.  So she just concentrates on\r\n\r\nthe game, and therefore she wins all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See talked about the upcoming merger between\r\n\r\nStarhub  and SCV.  As the former Chairman of SCV, I played  a\r\n\r\nsmall part in that merger process, which is on-going.  And it\r\n\r\nhas a specific objective, which is to create a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfixed-line  infrastructure in Singapore as an alternative  to\r\n\r\nSingTel.   Just  now  I talked about the three  wires  -  the\r\n\r\nSingTel wire, the SCV wire, and a future \"wireless\".  But  by\r\n\r\ncreating this alternative fixed-line infrastructure we  bring\r\n\r\nabout  greater  competition on domestic fixed-line,  which  I\r\n\r\nthink will further reduce the prices of telephony, as we know\r\n\r\nit today.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainudin that we should not be too\r\n\r\nromantic about 3Gs, and its hype.  Fortunately for us, we are\r\n\r\nnot too much ahead of the curve.  The Europeans were ahead of\r\n\r\nit.  So with huge auction prices, it now caused a big problem\r\n\r\nto  the industry.  That is why sometimes, it does not pay  to\r\n\r\nbe  the early bird because you may end up the early worm.  In\r\n\r\ncertain cases, you have to be the early bird, but I think, in\r\n\r\nthis  case, it is better to see what has been done elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  when  we  took our 3G auctions, it was  many  months\r\n\r\nlater.   As  you can see, the bid prices are quite different.\r\n\r\nI read the Financial Times last week about the 3G development\r\n\r\nin  Europe  where there are great concerns.  We are  watching\r\n\r\nthis whole development very closely so that we can learn from\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about greater use of the Internet\r\n\r\nso as to bring this application to the whole community, young\r\n\r\nand old, IT-literate or otherwise, creating, for example,  e-communities.   I  totally agree.  This  is  a  very  powerful\r\n\r\nmedium  and  a very effective mass communication  tool.   The\r\n\r\nfact  is  we are under-utilising it.  I agree with  him  that\r\n\r\nCDCs,  Town  Councils  and Singaporeans  individually  should\r\n\r\nthink  creatively  on  how much more they  can  exploit  this\r\n\r\nmedium.   IDA  (with a $25 million budget) will be  happy  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate and to cheer them on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, contents and applications are the key drivers.\r\n\r\nOnce  I  got  my  mother-in-law to play mahjong,  my  problem\r\n\r\nbecomes  one  of how to get her off the screen.  My  youngest\r\n\r\ndaughter is addicted to Neopets.com and according to her, her\r\n\r\nentire class too.  This is a US website, which reaches out to\r\n\r\nteenagers, allowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem to set up cyber shops to sell virtual goods to one\r\n\r\nanother.  It is absolutely cool, and along the way, a whole e-community is created globally.  But she learns a thing or two\r\n\r\nabout setting prices, how to take part in auctions and market\r\n\r\ncompetition, and that, for example, a price war is\r\n\r\nfundamentally crazy.  Only the other day, she asked me why a\r\n\r\nparticular player was selling her ware at a price way below\r\n\r\nher cost.  She lost a customer as a result.  She could have\r\n\r\ngone on a price war but she decided against it.  I thought to\r\n\r\nmyself, when she grows up, she may join PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF MONGOLIAN PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Presence in Gallery)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

However,  there  are\r\n\r\ncomplaints of mobile phone service standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue is on mobile phone portability. The\r\n\r\nmobile phone is mobile but the phone number is not.  When one\r\n\r\nswitches to another service provider and wishes to retain the\r\n\r\nphone  number, the operator will use call forwarding  service\r\n\r\nto solve the problem.  But this is not the complete solution,\r\n\r\nas  is  pointed out by many users who had complained  to  the\r\n\r\npress.   I  note that the IDA, in its reply to the complaint,\r\n\r\nhas said that it recognises that with technology advancements\r\n\r\nand market developments, it is necessary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreview  the  MMP solution regularly.  I would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  a  review has been made and what is the position  of\r\n\r\nIDA now on the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, is regarding the issue of the service\r\n\r\nstandard  of  SMS.  There were complaints that  SMS  messages\r\n\r\nwere  not delivered even after days.  I wonder - because  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State dislikes SMS - whether IDA is  going\r\n\r\nto   set  mandated  service  standard  for  the  SMS  service\r\n\r\nproviders.  Or is it just going to deem it as not one of  the\r\n\r\nfunctionalities  not needed by most users, and  thereby  need\r\n\r\nnot set any mandated standard?  And I would advise the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  that if he had a problem  in  using  his\r\n\r\nthumb,  maybe  he should try the PDA phone.   You  can  write\r\n\r\nChinese as well, using your hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it has also been brought to my attention\r\n\r\nthat  there are instances of dropped lines when mobile  phone\r\n\r\nusers enter MRT tunnels during train rides.  There was also a\r\n\r\ncomplaint today from MPs that if one goes inside the lift, he\r\n\r\nwould  also experience dropped lines.  What is the IDA  going\r\n\r\nto  do  about  it  to ensure the service operators  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  action  to  prevent all this frequent  problem  of\r\n\r\ndropped lines?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang has raised a\r\n\r\nnumber  of issues concerning mobile phone services.   Let  me\r\n\r\ndeal with them one by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mobile number portability, or MNP, IDA mandated MNP\r\n\r\nsince the start of mobile competition on 1st April 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several technical ways to achieve portability.\r\n\r\nIDA  decided at that time it was better to leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nmobile operators themselves to decide which was the best way.\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with the regulatory practice in most other\r\n\r\ncountries.   However,  the current solution  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\noperators does not allow portability for mobile data services\r\n\r\nsuch  as SMS.  We recognise that this shortcoming can  hamper\r\n\r\ncompetition and,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlikewise,  innovation.  IDA is working with the  industry  to\r\n\r\nreview  the  existing technical solution, and it will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the market remains competitive and able to deliver  new\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-operator SMS, that is SMS across\r\n\r\ndifferent  mobile  operators, IDA  has  mandated  this  since\r\n\r\nFebruary 2000.  Any mobile user can send and receive messages\r\n\r\nto   and  from  the  customers  of  other  mobile  operators.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is one of the very few countries in the  world  to\r\n\r\nhave  actually mandated inter-operator SMS.  IDA is currently\r\n\r\nworking with the four mobile operators to examine whether the\r\n\r\ninter-operator SMS service can be improved, and will consider\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not to set minimum Quality of Service  standards\r\n\r\nfor SMS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on mobile coverage in MRT tunnels, IDA has\r\n\r\nmandated  that  all operators must provide  coverage  in  MRT\r\n\r\nstations.  But there is a problem here.  We have not  so  far\r\n\r\nimposed minimum Quality of Service standards because of  this\r\n\r\nproblem, and that is, there is limited physical space in  MRT\r\n\r\ntunnels.  There is space for the trains but there is no space\r\n\r\nfor  a lot of other things.  Mobile operators therefore  have\r\n\r\nbeen  required to share infrastructure in MRT tunnels.   This\r\n\r\nlimits  their  mobile capacity, and it makes it difficult  to\r\n\r\nisolate  problems  to  a  particular  operator.   For   these\r\n\r\nreasons,  QOS  standards have not so far been set.   But  IDA\r\n\r\nwill  continue to monitor the overall service levels closely,\r\n\r\nand work with the mobile operators to address and resolve the\r\n\r\nnetwork  congestion or quality of service problems when  they\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, a short clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> He said that service standards were\r\n\r\nset  for  SMS.   But is the standard for delivering  messages\r\n\r\nset?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> No, Sir, I said that service standards\r\n\r\nwere  not  set.   We  have not set them because  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive marketplace.  If there is a competitive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarketplace, you leave it to the operators how they  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this.  One of the problems, of course, with  service\r\n\r\nstandards in SMS today is because of people like Mr Khaw Boon\r\n\r\nWan's  daughter  who sent out 700 messages a month,  maybe  a\r\n\r\nday!   And  there  are many kids who find  this  a  very  fun\r\n\r\ntechnology,  just to keep in touch with each other.   But  it\r\n\r\nputs a lot of traffic onto the system.  One possible solution\r\n\r\ncould be to differentiate service types, so that the business\r\n\r\nusers could subscribe to more expensive service and therefore\r\n\r\nget better quality of service.  But this is something for the\r\n\r\nmarket really to work out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. I\r\n\r\nwonder,  where  is  the balance?  On the  one  hand,  IDA  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to provide the service standard and, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it  is  saying that you leave it to the  market.   So,\r\n\r\nwhich is which?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> IDA's responsibility is to ensure that we\r\n\r\nhave a competitive marketplace, and we leave it to the market\r\n\r\nthen  to decide.  Where there are restrictions to competition\r\n\r\nin the marketplace, then IDA will step in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nanswers, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QA 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, just now, the Acting Minister Mr\r\n\r\nDavid  Lim  asked us to look at this stereogram [indicating].\r\n\r\nHe  said that the Government had a heart there.  I looked  at\r\n\r\nit,  but I cannot see the heart there.  Fortunately,  Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon  Yang  who  will  be taking over as Minister  for  MITA,\r\n\r\ntaught  me how to look for the heart,  and I finally  saw  it\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what you can see, you say you can see. What you\r\n\r\ncannot  see,  you  must say you cannot  see.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\nreminded of the famous story of the Emperor's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew   Clothes.   The  Emperor's  new  clothes  were  not   in\r\n\r\nexistence,  and nobody could actually see it,  but  everybody\r\n\r\npretended that he saw it.  Eventually, it was this little boy\r\n\r\nwho exclaimed, \"Hey, the Emperor is not wearing anything!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we had a Singapore edition of the Emperor's\r\n\r\nNew Clothes, that is the \"Hungarian Ghost Festival\".  We know\r\n\r\nthat this problem arose from a wrongly translated description\r\n\r\nin   the  Chinese  version  of  a  Singapore  Tourism   Board\r\n\r\npublication.   This Hungarian Ghost Festival has  turned  our\r\n\r\nsociety into a nation of ghosts and our ancestors have become\r\n\r\nHungarians.  The Chinese community was naturally very unhappy\r\n\r\nwith it.  There are a lot of articles in the newspapers,  and\r\n\r\neven   the  ordinary  citizens  are  saying  that   this   is\r\n\r\ndisgusting.  The Government saw it, but it said nothing about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people said that this was indeed a \"national\r\n\r\ndisgrace\"!  Why  is  it a   national disgrace!   Because  the\r\n\r\nHungarian  Ghost Festival was not the only problem.  In  this\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourists' Guidebook which was distributed freely to\r\n\r\nincoming  tourists  at the airport, the  Chinese  translation\r\n\r\nstated  that  two former   Prime Ministers of Singapore  were\r\n\r\nburied  at the Kranji War Memorial.   We all know that  there\r\n\r\nis  only one former Prime Minister of Singapore, and he  will\r\n\r\nbe  celebrating his 80th birthday. He is still very  healthy,\r\n\r\nand  he is flying all over the world.  Our Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\nin  the  pink  of  his health, and his face is  shining  with\r\n\r\nvitality.   He can easily live to 100 years old.   How  could\r\n\r\nthey  say such inauspicious thing about them.  This is indeed\r\n\r\ndisgusting!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lianhe Zaobao, many readers wrote to complain\r\n\r\nabout it. Some commented that the Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew  in\r\n\r\ntwo  volumes which ran into some 2,000 pages were  translated\r\n\r\ninto  Chinese,  by our local translators, and  there  was  no\r\n\r\nmistake  in them.  Why was there no mistake?  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nvery simple.  It was because the publishers were very serious\r\n\r\nabout   it.   On  the  other  hand,  although  the  Tourists'\r\n\r\nGuidebook   was   an  official  publication,   the   relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency  did not take it seriously,  and  did  not\r\n\r\nattach any importance to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the problem. Very often, when we write to a\r\n\r\nGovernment   department  about  some  issues,  we  inevitably\r\n\r\nreceive  a reply, \"We will look into it.\"  When we raise  the\r\n\r\nissue  face to face with the Government officials, they  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"I  see, I see\". So, they look and they see. Look  see,\r\n\r\nlook see, and in the end nothing is done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB said that the Guidebook was translated by some\r\n\r\npeople  in Shanghai, some foreign talents!  No doubt,  it  is\r\n\r\ngood  to  use foreign talents.  But the question is: did  our\r\n\r\nown  people  bother to vet and approve it?  We  want  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents, but we also need our own local talents to complement\r\n\r\nthem. Foreign   talents plus local talents, great things  can\r\n\r\nbe  done.  Foreign talents and no local talents to complement\r\n\r\nthem, there will be full of problems.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, we had problems with the wrong\r\n\r\ntranslations  in Contact Singapore that made  us  a  laughing\r\n\r\nstock  within and outside Singapore. This year, we  run  into\r\n\r\nsimilar   trouble   again  with  this   Singapore   Tourists'\r\n\r\nGuidebook.  The  problem is the attitude of these  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments remains unchanged. They do not take their Chinese\r\n\r\npublications seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of Singaporeans feel very hurt because of this. Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Seng Giap wrote an article in the Lianhe Zaobao entitled\r\n\r\n\"Top straight but bottom crooked\".  The common expression  is\r\n\r\n\"Top not straight, hence the bottom is crooked\".  However, in\r\n\r\nthe  present  case, the people at the bottom are doing  well,\r\n\r\nbut the people at the top could not be bothered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many readers have suggested that we should have a\r\n\r\nCentral  Translation Bureau.  This is a  long-term  plan.   I\r\n\r\nthink the immediate plan is to have an official vetting panel\r\n\r\nto  vet through all important official translation works.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government department cannot get enough people to do the\r\n\r\njob, it can make use  of talents from the private sector.  If\r\n\r\nthis cannot be done,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  it  is not a question of not being able to do, but  not\r\n\r\nwanting to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng, you have only 5 minutes left,\r\n\r\nand it includes the Minister's reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): DPM Lee said that,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  remaking Singapore, we  will  leave  no  stone\r\n\r\nunturned.  But the problem is that some stones are turned and\r\n\r\nthen  put back in the same place. In this case, nobody  seems\r\n\r\nto  want  to  remove this stone at all.  Last year,  we  were\r\n\r\ntripped by this stone, this year this stone is obstructing us\r\n\r\nagain.  The  various Government departments are reluctant  to\r\n\r\ntake on this responsibility.  I feel MITA should take on  the\r\n\r\nrole of a coordinator.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to my question, DPM Lee mentioned that when\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese Minister merely said, \"Hm!\", the civil  servant\r\n\r\ntook  the cue and said a lot of things. I hope that  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nwill  now say, \"Hm!\", and let the civil servants go  and  get\r\n\r\nthings done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I share the anguish and anger of\r\n\r\nMr  Seng  Han Thong when our \"Hungry Ghosts\", in the hand  of\r\n\r\nthe Shanghainese translator, became naturalised \"Hungarians\".\r\n\r\nI  was  in  MTI  for  seven years.  So I know  MTI  corporate\r\n\r\nculture  very  well.   In MTI, we are allergic  to  repeating\r\n\r\nmistakes.   Each mistake leads to a thorough  review  of  the\r\n\r\noperating  procedure so that a similar mistake does  not  get\r\n\r\nrepeated.   So I have no doubt that, from now, in STB,  there\r\n\r\nwould  not  be double vetting, there will be triple,  perhaps\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human error cropped up in STB. But it could have\r\n\r\ncropped up in other departments, as in Contact Singapore, two\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   It  could  have also happened  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  Mr Seng felt that a Central Translation Bureau,  or,\r\n\r\nin  the  interim,  some  vetting panel,  would  prevent  such\r\n\r\nproblems in future, at least for the public sector.  I am not\r\n\r\nso sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These incidents underline the importance of context and\r\n\r\nknowledge of cultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnuances.   Hence,  we  cannot treat the  language  as  purely\r\n\r\ntechnical.  For Singapore to be cosmopolitan, we must develop\r\n\r\na  deeper knowledge of culture and context.  And this must be\r\n\r\nachieved  at every level, not just the translators,  but  the\r\n\r\nmanagers in charge must build that up too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every publication is a communication exercise. The\r\n\r\nmanager in charge is finally responsible for the accuracy  of\r\n\r\nthe message.  He must take ownership.  Passing the buck to  a\r\n\r\ncentral bureau, or a vetting panel, is more likely to  result\r\n\r\nin  a loss of accountability on the part of the manager.  The\r\n\r\nlanguage  experts in the Central Bureau can, at  best,  do  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  translation job but they cannot  fully  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  nuances of the content or the intricacies of the  policy\r\n\r\nintent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personal experience of this. Just two-three\r\n\r\nmonths  ago, I have to give a couple of lectures to a largely\r\n\r\nBuddhist  audience.   So  I prepared my  speech  in  English,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am more competent in English.  Then  I  asked  my\r\n\r\ncolleague in MITA to do a translation for me.  But I have  to\r\n\r\ndo the final vetting and, in fact, as it turned out, I had to\r\n\r\nmake  a  few  amendments because the translator,  being  non-Buddhist, cannot fully capture my intent accurately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with Mr Seng that MITA, with its pool of\r\n\r\nlanguage  experts,  is in a position to help.   We  can  help\r\n\r\ntrain  translators.  We can help standardise the  terminology\r\n\r\nto  be  used.  We can help translate the important Government\r\n\r\ndocuments.   And  we  do  provide  such  a  service  for  our\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  the  other Ministries,  but  we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nselective.  For example, our service cannot extend to tourism\r\n\r\npromotion publications which should rightly remain  the  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility of STB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is an important part of our heritage. It can\r\n\r\nalso  be a competitive advantage.  So we must all try  to  be\r\n\r\nbetter at it.  It is therefore very good of Mr Seng to  raise\r\n\r\nthis very important point.  Credit must also be given to  the\r\n\r\nmedia for highlighting these incidents.  If we do not exert\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  standard on ourselves, then we will never  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng Han Thong, would you like to\r\n\r\nwithdraw your amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Arthur Fong is not\r\n\r\nmoving.

The Esplanade's design  and  development\r\n\r\nhave  caused some stir in the architectural circle and  among\r\n\r\nour  citizens.   Personally, I have to admit  that  I  am  an\r\n\r\nadmirer of this national landmark.  Say whatever you like, it\r\n\r\nsure stands out like a sore thumb on the bay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, we could only turn to several common\r\n\r\nsites   for  concerts  and  performances.   Now,   with   the\r\n\r\nEsplanade, I am confident Singaporeans can benefit and  enjoy\r\n\r\na modern, hi-tech, world-class theatre and concert hall.  The\r\n\r\nEsplanade  will go a long way in promoting and elevating  the\r\n\r\nart  scene  in Singapore.  Sir, my only concern is  regarding\r\n\r\nthe status and role of the Esplanade, as a private entity, in\r\n\r\nthe effort to promote arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am for the investment in the arts and culture. It is\r\n\r\nimportant.   With regard to this, I would like  to  highlight\r\n\r\nthe  major  investment  towards  this  project  and  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister how is the Esplanade going to balance its role to be\r\n\r\neconomically viable and, yet, making the arts accessible  and\r\n\r\naffordable to the masses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, for many Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndriving  past or gazing out of the SBS bus as he  passes  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade, one wonders how much he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould appreciate what goes on inside and much less what  went\r\n\r\non inside the Victoria Theatre these past years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recognise that the Esplanade will truly be the\r\n\r\npride  and joy of Singaporeans in time.  Like the arts circle\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, I am anxiously awaiting for the opening of the\r\n\r\nEsplanade.  It will play an important part in developing  and\r\n\r\nencouraging  a  softer  side  and more  holistic  Singaporean\r\n\r\nthrough the appreciation of the arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the Esplanade is simple - to entertain,\r\n\r\nengage,  educate and inspire.  To entertain who?   To  engage\r\n\r\nwho?   To  educate  who?  To inspire  what?   The  answer  is\r\n\r\nsimple.   To  entertain art lovers, engage and interact  with\r\n\r\npeople  who  can  appreciate  and  even  identify  with   the\r\n\r\nperformances and performers, educate people who have  yet  to\r\n\r\nexperience  the various art  forms and finally to  inspire  a\r\n\r\nquest  for  more artistic exposure once entertained,  engaged\r\n\r\nand educated.  Simple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is, however, not as simple when we ask who are\r\n\r\nthese  people that we want to entertain, engage, educate  and\r\n\r\ninspire.   Sir,  how  many affluent  Asian  art  lovers  will\r\n\r\nconsistently  fly  in, cruise in, drive  in  to  support  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes that are obviously going to be of a wide spectrum.\r\n\r\nHow  many Singaporeans will take up all the other seats night\r\n\r\nafter night?  This must be difficult for a few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to increase a healthy mass of art lovers, MITA has\r\n\r\ninstituted many initiatives.  Some good examples are the Arts\r\n\r\nCentral  on our TV, Arts on the Move series, that is  brought\r\n\r\nto  the  HDB  heartlands,  Cross  Talk  events  in  community\r\n\r\ncentres, Music Box - performances by young talented musicians\r\n\r\nand  many  more.   We  even have a Theatre Management  course\r\n\r\nstudy at the university.  There is also a concerted effort to\r\n\r\nbring  in ASEAN artists and also to entice the regional  arts\r\n\r\ncompanies to take root here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom-line is we want to be prominent on the\r\n\r\ninternational arts calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore  that  happens, we ask ourselves, will  the  range  of\r\n\r\nactivities  that the Esplanade will stage be able to  sustain\r\n\r\nits  momentum?  Surely, performers and artistes want to  play\r\n\r\nto  audiences  and not just to experience performing  in  the\r\n\r\nnewest  performing Arts Centre with the latest that  acoustic\r\n\r\nand theatre design has to offer at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have asked earlier, is the regional pool of theatre\r\n\r\ngoers  enough?  Is our own Singaporean pool of theatre  goers\r\n\r\ndeveloped?  Well, maybe after 12th October this year, foreign\r\n\r\ntalents will find Singapore the least stressed place in  Asia\r\n\r\nto  work and play will also say that there is the Theatre  on\r\n\r\nthe  Bay and there is much at play!  But as much as we  would\r\n\r\nlike, the foreign talent pool cannot help us too much in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  filling the seats night after night.  Many  average\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will tell you, this is for the atas  sikit,  the\r\n\r\nartsy  and  even for the ang moh foreign talent that  we  are\r\n\r\nwooing, and not for the average Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that there are, today, in our heartlands,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  have in the past few  years  developed  an\r\n\r\ninterest in the arts, but this group is small.  Will the many\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  as  I have acknowledged earlier, to  \"culturise\"\r\n\r\nour  people,  result  in  a  short time,  help  build  enough\r\n\r\ncultural ballast for all that the Esplanade has the potential\r\n\r\nand will to stage?  I do not think so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, large Government grants will be necessary to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  curtains up for these two honeycomb  architectural\r\n\r\nicons, or for the average Singaporeans it is nan sat du lian,\r\n\r\nthe  glass  skin.   Sir,  for the year  2001,  the  Esplanade\r\n\r\ncompany ran a deficit of $3.8 million.  A Government grant of\r\n\r\n$4 1/2 million  was necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, we are in deficit of time now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> I am finishing. Assuming that the\r\n\r\nlearning  curve  and the reputation of the Esplanade  as  the\r\n\r\nperforming  Arts Centre is on the world stage in,  say,  five\r\n\r\nyears,  I would like to ask the Minister the estimated yearly\r\n\r\nGovernment grant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  next five years and beyond which is needed to  keep\r\n\r\nthe curtains up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I am happy that MITA is\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  Old Parliament House.  This  historical  and\r\n\r\nimportant   heritage  of  our  country  must  be  given   due\r\n\r\nimportance and accorded the right place in our society.  With\r\n\r\nrespect  to  this, can the Minister update the House  on  the\r\n\r\nprogress of the development and the future plans for the  Old\r\n\r\nParliament  House?  May I also ask what is the difference  in\r\n\r\nthe  model of development compared to the old SJI?  I had the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  accompany  the  Minister  on  his  visit  to\r\n\r\nReflections  at Bukit Chandu recently, and it was  really  an\r\n\r\nexciting  and  interesting  experience.   I  would  like   to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  House to pay a visit to this  new  museum  at\r\n\r\nBukit  Chandu.  If this is an example of the kind  of  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment that we can get for our museums, I have to really\r\n\r\nsay  that  it is a commendable effort, and I would  encourage\r\n\r\nMITA to work on the same model for the Old Parliament House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, both Mr Zainudin Nordin and Mr Arthur Fong\r\n\r\nwanted  to  know what programmes the Explanade has to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  public to identify with, enjoy and be proud of  it.   Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin  also wanted to know whether the Esplanade would  be\r\n\r\nmanaged  as  a  business entity or as  an  entity  of  public\r\n\r\ncharacter,  and  how  the  Esplanade's  viability  would   be\r\n\r\nmaintained while allowing Singaporeans to enjoy it  and  feel\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin mentioned the success of the Pepys Road\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  also asked whether the Old  Parliament  House\r\n\r\nwould be modelled along that line or with the SJI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade's mission is to be a performing arts\r\n\r\ncentre  for everyone.  To fulfill this vision, the  Esplanade\r\n\r\nhopes  to  resonate  and  connect with  both  the  local  and\r\n\r\ninternational audience by presenting an extensive and diverse\r\n\r\nrange of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   It  will  strive  to  present  activities  that\r\n\r\neveryone  can  participate in and  enjoy.   To  fulfill  this\r\n\r\nmission, the arts centre will start with three weeks  of  fun\r\n\r\nand   exciting  programmes  immediately  after  its  official\r\n\r\nopening  by  the President on 12th October this year.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be  local and international performances and activities\r\n\r\nreaching   out  to  families,  teenagers,  adults   and   the\r\n\r\ninternational audience.  All her state-of-the-art  facilities\r\n\r\n-  the 1,600-seat concert hall, the 2,000-seat theatres,  two\r\n\r\nsmaller studios and three outdoor performing spaces - will be\r\n\r\nutilised to their fullest, to enable Singaporeans to soak  in\r\n\r\nthe  festivities and fun.  In addition, within the  Esplanade\r\n\r\ncompound,  a  performing  arts library  and  a  3-level  mall\r\n\r\nconsisting of unique restaurants and shops will be opened for\r\n\r\nthe public to explore and enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the opening programme, the Esplanade has\r\n\r\nallocated more than 50% of its annual programming budget  for\r\n\r\nfamily  and  community-based  activities,  such  as  cultural\r\n\r\nfestivals,  public education programmes, free outdoor  events\r\n\r\nevery  weekend, and annual open-house days.  The  public  can\r\n\r\nlook   forward  to  enjoying  programmes,  such   as   ethnic\r\n\r\nfestivals,  Children's  Festival and an  International  Music\r\n\r\nseries throughout the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the distinctive architecture of the Esplanade has\r\n\r\nmade it a talking point among Singaporeans.  It has even been\r\n\r\nfeatured  in  cartoon  strips in  our  local  newspapers.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  some  Members of this  House  have  seen  this\r\n\r\ncartoon in the Sunday Times.  Mr Fong is correct too when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that the Esplanade is iconic to Singapore.  But, beyond\r\n\r\nbeing  an  icon  of our nation's support for  the  arts,  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade  hopes to nurture and strengthen our  social  bonds\r\n\r\nand  ties  through a shared interest in the arts.  And,  with\r\n\r\nthe support of the promotional agencies, such as STB, NAC and\r\n\r\nEDB, it will strive to enhance both her image and Singapore's\r\n\r\noverseas.  In short, the Esplanade will have a heart close to\r\n\r\nits community but it will be known throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade is an entity of public character.\r\n\r\nSimilar to many performing arts centres around the world, the\r\n\r\nEsplanade  will not make direct profits from the  very  broad\r\n\r\nand  diverse  arts  programming it will undertake.   But  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  and  viability  of  the  Esplanade  should  not  be\r\n\r\nmeasured  solely on direct economic terms as it  brings  many\r\n\r\nindirect   and  intangible  benefits.   The  Esplanade   will\r\n\r\nincrease   the   vibrancy  and  creativity   of   our   local\r\n\r\nenvironment,  enhance our attractiveness  to  global  talent,\r\n\r\nencourage more creative and imaginative thoughts, and help to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  relationships and  ties,  both  locally  and\r\n\r\noverseas.    The   corporate   world   can   also   integrate\r\n\r\nperformances  at the Esplanade into their client relationship\r\n\r\ndevelopment   programmes.   This,  in  turn,   sharpens   our\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge.   The  Esplanade should  be  viewed  as  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive tool for Singapore therefore, and it is important\r\n\r\nthat we support the growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question by Mr Fong whether we can sustain\r\n\r\nthis  effort,  I  say  it would be a  big  challenge  to  the\r\n\r\nmanagement   of   the   Esplanade  as  well   as   ourselves,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  How much will it cost?  It will  cost  a  lot.\r\n\r\nBut this is something that we can be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the Old Parliament House, Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin  Nordin  felt that the conversion of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArts  Museum  should  bear its value  to  the  community.   I\r\n\r\ntotally  agree with him.  We should also value the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  Old Parliament House is an important historical building\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans.  So far, the model that we  build  will  be\r\n\r\nbased on the museums that we have earlier developed, eg,  the\r\n\r\nSJI, which have been successful in drawing in both local  and\r\n\r\ntourist  visitors.  He may be glad to know  that  the  annual\r\n\r\nvisitorship  to  the  SAM between 1996  and  2001  was  about\r\n\r\n151,541  and that 30% of the total visitors were tourists  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Arts Museum.  So, because of  the  attraction\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore Arts Museum has, the model that  we  plan  to\r\n\r\nhave  for  the Old Parliament House will also be  along  that\r\n\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical significance of the former Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse  would indeed be preserved.  This will be done  through\r\n\r\nthe conversion of the building into a multi-disciplinary arts\r\n\r\nand  heritage  centre.   A display along  the  walls  of  the\r\n\r\ncorridors  of  the constitutional history of Singapore  would\r\n\r\nhighlight   the  building's  significance  in  our   history.\r\n\r\nArtefacts and plaques indicating important rooms of  the  Old\r\n\r\nParliament  House  will  also  be  displayed  throughout  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The draw of allowing Singaporeans a peek into  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  where  Parliament was once held will  attract  both\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign visitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House will be interested to know\r\n\r\nthat  the Parliament Chamber will now be reused as a  Concert\r\n\r\nChamber.   The  former  library  will  be  converted  into  a\r\n\r\nblackbox  theatre meant for use as a performing venue,  while\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  Room will be used as an art  gallery.   Other\r\n\r\nproposed facilities include a film theatrette, rehearsal  and\r\n\r\nmeeting rooms, restaurants with riverview and alfresco dining\r\n\r\nfacilities.   These will transform the Old  Parliament  House\r\n\r\ninto an arts venue with events all year round.  Together with\r\n\r\nVictoria  Theatre,  Victoria  Concert  Hall,  the  new  Asian\r\n\r\nCivilisations Museum at Empress Place and this new Parliament\r\n\r\nBuilding, the Old Parliament House development will help make\r\n\r\nthe  entire  area  an arts and cultural hub that  speaks  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's present and past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Straits Times report yesterday mentioned the\r\n\r\ndiscovery of four ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yatiman, we have five minutes to\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\" time actually.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Let me conclude by saying that\r\n\r\nwhile we put the former Parliament House to new use, we  will\r\n\r\nalso  highlight  its past role in relation to our  nationhood\r\n\r\nand  constitutional history, and also the ancient history  of\r\n\r\nits  vicinity as revealed from the archaelogical exploration,\r\n\r\nas carried in the Straits Times a few days ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh Meng See, we have five minutes\r\n\r\nbefore \"guillotine\" time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QI 5200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising the subject of the Malay Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre  because I believe it should not be just a centre  for\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  community.

If  we  are  ambitious enough, we should  make  it  a\r\n\r\nregional  centre for Malay heritage.  So I just want  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister what plans we have to make it lively  not  only\r\n\r\nfor the centre but also the surrounding areas, the programmes\r\n\r\nand activities, and for public education as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, heritage should be\r\n\r\neveryone's  hub,  especially for a  country  as  economically\r\n\r\nsuccessful, global and cosmopolitan as Singapore.   Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be proud to have a Malay Heritage Centre to complement\r\n\r\nthat  of  the Indian and Chinese.  It is after all a national\r\n\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just go to the question, Sir. Could MITA share\r\n\r\nits  thinking on the project and explain how it assesses  the\r\n\r\nprogress  made  and  its  direction?   How  will  a  National\r\n\r\nHeritage  Board  and other related agencies  under  MITA  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies like URA, Land Office and STB  help  the\r\n\r\nMHFC make the project viable and a success?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of museums, MITA has done well. We have  now  15\r\n\r\nheritage  and  arts museums. To create museum  going  culture\r\n\r\namong  Singaporeans, MITA has even gone further by organising\r\n\r\na MuseumFest at Suntec city to attract the shoppers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, Singaporeans prefer shopping than visiting\r\n\r\nmuseums. Thus,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMITA has moved the museums to the shopping centre. This is  a\r\n\r\nright strategy. Sad to say, if we ask Singaporeans to name 10\r\n\r\nshopping  centres, many can name them without much difficulty\r\n\r\nwhereas many could not name even a few museums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides focusing on local Singaporeans, I felt that we\r\n\r\nshould  also  focus  on  the  7 million  tourists  who  visit\r\n\r\nSingapore  annually  now  that  we  treat  Arts  spending  as\r\n\r\ninvestment which could also create economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we categorise the 15 museums into a few\r\n\r\ngroups  and actively promote the different groups  of  museum\r\n\r\namong different target audience: certain kind of museums  may\r\n\r\nbe  of  interest  to  the Japanese tourists,  others  to  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the Europeans and some to the Chinese  tourists.\r\n\r\nThe  pamphlets can be printed in the languages of the  target\r\n\r\ngroups and be distributed at MRT stations, hotels and tourist\r\n\r\nresorts.  Many other countries have done this and  have  seen\r\n\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can be creative, innovative and flexible in the\r\n\r\npromotion and operation of museums, I believe, in the  longer\r\n\r\nterm, we can attract more Singaporeans as well as tourists to\r\n\r\nour museums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, time is running short.

Currently, the museums are  closed  on\r\n\r\nMondays to enable the maintenance of gallery items on display\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure that the museums are clean and well kept  for\r\n\r\nvisitors in the week ahead.  At present, our National  Museum\r\n\r\nstays  open until 9.00 pm on Fridays, and if a public holiday\r\n\r\nfalls  on a Monday, with the exception of May Day, they would\r\n\r\nbe open to the public.  Mr Seng suggested that we should also\r\n\r\nopen on Mondays.  Even though it is an international practice\r\n\r\nfor  the museums to be closed on Mondays, I am happy  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  MITA  is glad to accept Mr Seng's challenge for  us  to\r\n\r\ndare to be different, and we will try to open the museums  on\r\n\r\nMondays on a trial basis and we will assess public reaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> \"Guillotine\" time.

It\r\n\r\nis  a  principle  that  has  served  us  well  and  is  often\r\n\r\nattributed  as  the underlying reason for our competitiveness\r\n\r\nand rapid progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that every Singaporean, regardless of\r\n\r\nhow humble his or her family background, can succeed, and  we\r\n\r\noften  read  of students from poor families doing brilliantly\r\n\r\nin  their  studies and succeeding in life. There are  several\r\n\r\ncommon examples here in this House.  It is also true that low-skilled  workers  can get ahead if they were  to  work  hard,\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills and are prepared to undergo  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning.  We  must continue to encourage  and  motivate  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  give of their best,  and  not  to  look  to\r\n\r\nwelfarism  as  a  viable alternative.  But our  policy-makers\r\n\r\nmust  realise that there will always be the bottom 5-7%,  who\r\n\r\ndespite their best efforts, will not be able to keep up  with\r\n\r\nthe rest.  If Singaporeans are to bond as a cohesive society,\r\n\r\nmeritocracy and competitiveness alone will not enable  us  to\r\n\r\nachieve   this  objective.   It  has  to  be  tempered   with\r\n\r\ncompassion for others, other than ourselves and our immediate\r\n\r\nfamily members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Singaporeans have to be personally responsible\r\n\r\nfor their own welfare, the aged, the disabled and those less-gifted  must  never  be  made  to  feel  disenfranchised  and\r\n\r\nneglected.    In  a  society  built  on  meritocracy,   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities lead to unequal outcomes.  Those who lag behind\r\n\r\nmay feel demoralised and resent the success of others.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  succeed  may feel less obligated to help anyone.   After\r\n\r\nall,  did  we not, wittingly or unwittingly, imbibe  in  them\r\n\r\nthat  in  meritocracy whatever success that  is  achieved  is\r\n\r\nbased entirely on one's own effort and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerit?   Could  we  always depend on the  more  able  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity to support the less fortunate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's social welfare system has largely been based\r\n\r\non  the  family and extended family support.  This has served\r\n\r\nus  well  in the past, when families were large and  extended\r\n\r\nfamilies  living  together  quite  common.   But  times  have\r\n\r\nchanged.

There are also prominent\r\n\r\nexamples in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, working with the community, must find\r\n\r\nways to create adequate social safety nets for those who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  keep  up, despite their best efforts,  but  in  a\r\n\r\nmanner  not  to  destroy  the sense  of  self-worth,  or  the\r\n\r\nincentive for them to give of their best, however humble that\r\n\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell the House what social safety\r\n\r\nnets  have  been put in place and the strategies  adopted  by\r\n\r\nMCDS  to  assist  low-income families, the disabled  and  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  to cope with the changed social  and  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and  the  measures to  assist  them  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren to improve the situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the recent recessionary effect of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is affecting the lives of many Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nmore  ways  than  one.  To begin with,  there  are  now  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  unemployed,  and  who  may   not   be\r\n\r\nemployable since for many of them, the restructuring  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy has resulted in many of the lower-skilled jobs  being\r\n\r\nmade permanently redundant.  Unemployment is more than 4% and\r\n\r\nrising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that for the unemployed and the needy families in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  have many public assistance schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nthem.    To   mention  a  few,  the  CDCs  provide  financial\r\n\r\nassistance, utility grants and food allowances for  a  period\r\n\r\nof  time.  There  are also a number of those  who  are  given\r\n\r\npublic  assistance that is worked out based on the number  of\r\n\r\npersons in the family. The question really is, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has  always been the subject of much  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  how much help should we give before one can  in  true\r\n\r\nconscience say that enough has been given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we are not a welfare state and that the\r\n\r\nunderlying concern about welfare assistance is a loss of  the\r\n\r\nwork  ethic  if  public assistance is so  readily  available.\r\n\r\nSir,  I agree that we must not provide help to such an extent\r\n\r\nthat  people lose their willingness and desire to work.  Yet,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  say,  at  the  same  time,  that  those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed  are not willing to work.  There are many  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  who  through no fault of their own, are  without  a\r\n\r\njob,  or  are  without a job because they are  either  single\r\n\r\nparents  or are medically unfit.  And for many of them,  they\r\n\r\noften  have  young  families. Sadly, Sir,  it  is  often  the\r\n\r\nchildren who suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we talk about building a compassionate society and\r\n\r\nasking  Singaporeans to give up their lives for the  country,\r\n\r\nif  necessary.   For  many Singaporeans who  are  desperately\r\n\r\nstruggling, the call to put the country before self,  somehow\r\n\r\nrings hollow if the perception exists that the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot prepared to do more if it is able to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we and should we do more to help these people? Yes,\r\n\r\nI  say  we should. My point is, just because there are people\r\n\r\nwho  may potentially abuse the system, does not mean that  we\r\n\r\nshould not do more to help the genuine poor.  For a start,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we should ensure that all Singaporeans should at least\r\n\r\nbe assured of a minimum standard of living, and this standard\r\n\r\nshould move with the changing standards over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should set up some kind of unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance  or  fund  to help families ease into  unemployment\r\n\r\nslowly and cope with the trauma that comes with unemployment.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  such assistance should not be given at  a  level\r\n\r\nthat is a substitute for the full income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, families of public assistance should not be\r\n\r\nmade to feel like they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeggars  in our society.  They should be counselled regularly\r\n\r\nby  social  workers to ensure that every cent  that  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven will be usefully spent for the benefit of the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will comment on the above proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, when our\r\n\r\neconomy   went  into  recession  last  year,  the  Government\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  Economic Downturn Relief  Scheme  (EDRS)  to\r\n\r\nprovide  short-term help to those affected by the  recession.\r\n\r\nNow  the economy is showing signs of recovery.  I assume that\r\n\r\nat  some  point in time, when the Government is certain  that\r\n\r\nthe  economy is out of the woods, the EDRS will be  suspended\r\n\r\nor terminated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that the EDRS should not be a permanent\r\n\r\nfeature,  I  would like to highlight three areas of  possible\r\n\r\nproblems in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, improvement in the job market usually lags\r\n\r\nbehind economic recovery.  Even when our economy recovers, it\r\n\r\nwill  take time for employers to regain confidence and  start\r\n\r\nrecruiting again.  It will also take time for new investments\r\n\r\nto  come  in  to create new jobs.  Therefore, we need  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  that  the job market will take  a  longer  time  to\r\n\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while the economy may have recovered and the\r\n\r\njob market improved, there may still be segments of residents\r\n\r\nwho  are unable to find a suitable job, or may need more time\r\n\r\nto  find  one  because of skills mismatch.  They  may  remain\r\n\r\nunemployed for a while more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, economic restructuring is likely to be a\r\n\r\npermanent  feature in our economy.  This is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nfast-changing world we are in today. People are  expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  in and out of jobs as the industries they are working  in\r\n\r\nrestructure  themselves.  This is unavoidable,  but  it  does\r\n\r\nmean  that there will always be a good number of workers  who\r\n\r\nmay be temporarily out of job.  Some of them may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  financially  stretched, especially those who  have  heavy\r\n\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we phase out the EDRS when the economy recovers,\r\n\r\nI   would   like  to  appeal  to  the  Ministry  to  consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  some  kind of Economic Restructuring  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme (ERAS) to help these three categories of people.   The\r\n\r\nERAS can be similar to the EDRS in that it is short-term  and\r\n\r\nlimited  in  dollar value, so as not to create  a  dependency\r\n\r\nmentality.   But it is discretionary and simple  to  operate,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we  can  respond  rapidly.   It  has  a  specific\r\n\r\nobjective of helping those who lost their job as a result  of\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring, and yet unable to qualify under  the\r\n\r\nusual  public assistance schemes.  The Ministry could perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider  expanding the Interim Financial  Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the ERAS may even take the form of a\r\n\r\nshort-term interest free loan which the recipient has to  pay\r\n\r\nback  over  time  after he has found  a  job.   Under  normal\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  he  would  find  it  difficult  to   take   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  loan as he is unemployed. With a short-term  loan\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Government, he can avoid having to sell  his\r\n\r\nhouse and risk breaking up the family just because of a short-term cash flow problem.  As the loan needs to be repaid,  the\r\n\r\ntemptation  for abuse is drastically reduced  and  those  who\r\n\r\napply  for  it  are likely to be those who are  genuinely  in\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion  to  put  in place an  Economic  Restructuring\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme, either as a form of short-term grant or  a\r\n\r\nshort-term   loan,  to  help  those  affected   by   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> The current\r\n\r\neconomic downtown has seen many Singaporeans affected  either\r\n\r\ndirectly  or  indirectly.

It should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  stay  that way.  We have  to  ensure  that  any\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance scheme implemented does  not  create  a\r\n\r\ndisincentive to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the role of administering financial assistance\r\n\r\nprogrammes has now been delegated to the CDCs.  It has been a\r\n\r\nyear  since  the  CDCs took over this role  and  somehow,  it\r\n\r\ncoincides  with  the onset of the economic crisis.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister to give an update on two groups  of\r\n\r\npeople who have come to the CDCs for financial assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first group are the retrenched workers. Sir, the\r\n\r\nEDRS  was  introduced  as part of the off-Budget  package  to\r\n\r\nassist  Singaporeans who were retrenched.  Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshare  with  the House how many families have  been  assisted\r\n\r\nthrough  the  EDRS  scheme?   How long  has  assistance  been\r\n\r\nprovided?  What proportion of these recipients return to  the\r\n\r\nCDCs for further assistance?  That is, what is the proportion\r\n\r\nof those who are still in need of assistance at this time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group are the non-retrenched workers. These\r\n\r\nare  the people who are not eligible under the EDRS.  Can the\r\n\r\nCDCs  also administer the other financial assistance  schemes\r\n\r\nto  assist their respective residents?  Since taking over the\r\n\r\nrole from MCDS over the past one year, can the Minister share\r\n\r\nwith  the  House  the effectiveness of CDCs in  administering\r\n\r\nthese  programmes?  What is the turnaround time for  each  of\r\n\r\nthe  case,  that  is  from the time the  case  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the CDC to the time that the case receives  the\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance?  How has this differed  from  the  time\r\n\r\nthese schemes were  administered centrally by MCDS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also share with the House how many\r\n\r\nindividuals  have  come to seek financial  help,  other  than\r\n\r\nEDRS,  at  the CDCs in the last one year?  How many of  these\r\n\r\ncases  were  successful in their applications, and  how  many\r\n\r\nwere   not  successful?   What  are  the  social  demographic\r\n\r\nprofiles of these families who have come to seek help?   What\r\n\r\nis the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproportion of those who have returned for more assistance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that providing financial assistance to these\r\n\r\nfamilies  will  only address the symptom.   There  are  other\r\n\r\nunderlying  problems  that  often  accompany  the   financial\r\n\r\nproblems. The provision of financial assistance should  be  a\r\n\r\nmeans  to  an end rather than an end in itself.  To do  this,\r\n\r\nhowever,    requires   closer   caseload    management    and\r\n\r\nintervention.   In  this  regard, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister what is the average caseload of each worker  in  the\r\n\r\nCDCs with regard to financial assistance cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence indicates that the caseload for each\r\n\r\nCDC's  staff is very high.  If this is so, how can  the  CDCs\r\n\r\nensure  that  their  staff are effective  in  doing  caseload\r\n\r\nmanagement   and   intervention,  thus  ensuring   that   the\r\n\r\nunderlying problems are addressed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs are not the only organisations who provide\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance to needy Singaporeans.   Indeed,  there\r\n\r\nare  many VWOs out there who provide financial assistance  to\r\n\r\nthese  families  also. While we pride ourselves  in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  our  financial assistance programmes do  not  create  a\r\n\r\ndisincentive  to  work, the availability  of  many  financial\r\n\r\nsupport providers may create a buffet syndrome, resulting  in\r\n\r\nwhat social workers call the \"professional cryer\", one who is\r\n\r\nable  to  move  from one organisation to another  in  seeking\r\n\r\nhelp.  May I ask the Minister what efforts are being done  to\r\n\r\nensure that this does not happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the general debate on the Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nI   shared  observations  that  many  families  are   feeling\r\n\r\nfinancially trapped with arrears quickly accumulating as  the\r\n\r\ndays   go   by.   My  understanding  is  that  the  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  provided  by  the CDCs  will  only  assist  these\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  the short-term, and will not be  sufficient  in\r\n\r\nhelping  them settle their arrears.  I would like to  ask  if\r\n\r\nMCDS  shares this same observation and, if so, how does  MCDS\r\n\r\nhope  to  assist  these  families  overcome  their  financial\r\n\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, what I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  say have been succinctly put forth by  those  who\r\n\r\nhave spoken before me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo is not here.

Families are the building  blocks\r\n\r\nof  society.  The families act as the first line of care  and\r\n\r\nsupport for an individual, especially during uncertain times.\r\n\r\nThere  are signs that the family values may slowly be eroded.\r\n\r\nFor example, divorce rates have been rising, singlehood rates\r\n\r\nhave been rising too, while fertility rates have fallen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus our attention on economic uncertainties\r\n\r\nand  restructuring, we should not lose sight of the value  of\r\n\r\nthe  family.   Our  Prime Minister has  identified  declining\r\n\r\nfertility  as  one  of  the key challenges  for  our  future.\r\n\r\nDespite  generous tax incentives, the Baby  Bonus  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures, the number of births has remained low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the young professionals, men and women,\r\n\r\ntold  me  that they are so busy with their work that they  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the time to socialise, meet new friends and find  a\r\n\r\npartner.   And  they  are giving up the  search  for  a  life\r\n\r\npartner even when they are in their early 30s.  Perhaps it is\r\n\r\ntime  for  MCDS to consider privatising the SDU and  SDS  and\r\n\r\nallow  the  private sector to manage these functions.   Maybe\r\n\r\nthey are more imaginative in this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Education Committee (PEC) on the Family,\r\n\r\nafter  consultation with people from all sectors of  society,\r\n\r\nhave come up with 70 recommendations, which include balancing\r\n\r\nthe  work  life  and  family life, family  support  services,\r\n\r\nnarrowing the gap between men and women in their expectations\r\n\r\nof   life  and  marriage,  and  fostering  a  family-friendly\r\n\r\nsociety.  Can the Minister comment on how MCDS will implement\r\n\r\nthe 70 recommendations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there might be a need to review the slogan of\r\n\r\nprocreation \"Have three or more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif you can afford it\", the reason being that it looks like no\r\n\r\none can afford it.  The rich cannot afford the time, the poor\r\n\r\ncannot afford the money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister when the\r\n\r\nMinisterial Committee on Marriage and Procreation is going to\r\n\r\nrelease  its report.  Is it at the courtship stage, pregnancy\r\n\r\nstage, or going to be delivered soon?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in Denmark and Norway, the fertility\r\n\r\nrate  is  quite  good.  This is because of extensive  support\r\n\r\nfrom the Government, such as childcare, nanny-care, financial\r\n\r\nsupport,   and  so  on.   Would  the  Government  look   into\r\n\r\nimplementing some of these schemes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch on abortion. There are about\r\n\r\n14,000  abortions here a year, and about 60% of them  are  by\r\n\r\nmarried  women.  Sir, I am not against abortion.   There  are\r\n\r\nmany reasons for abortion.  According to feedback, women  opt\r\n\r\nfor  abortion because of medical reasons, forced pregnancies,\r\n\r\nfinancial     difficulties,    alternative     contraception,\r\n\r\nimmaturity,  fear  of  losing out on  promotion,  out-station\r\n\r\npostings, studies, or the inability to get a flat.  Abortion,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is  a highly personal decision and it is  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to interfere.  But, in some  cases,  the\r\n\r\nmother might want to keep the baby for adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, abortion counselling would need to be strengthened.\r\n\r\nMandatory   counselling  should  be   done   by   independent\r\n\r\ncounsellors  and  not by the clinic itself,  as  there  is  a\r\n\r\nconflict   of  interest.   Mandatory  conselling  should   be\r\n\r\nextended  to the family as well.  There should also  be  more\r\n\r\njoint  efforts  by MCDS and VWOs to support  distress  cases.\r\n\r\nSir, a life saved is one more Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an important question I wish to ask.\r\n\r\nProcreation is the responsibility of the individual  and  the\r\n\r\nfamily.    How   far   should  the  state   share   in   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, as Mrs Yu-Foo had mentioned, family is the basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  block of our society, and I think many people  know\r\n\r\nthat  it  is also one of our five shared values.  On this,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  there  is no disagreement.  However,  not  everyone\r\n\r\nfound family life to be a job.  Some said that it is becoming\r\n\r\nmore  stressful, and there are many reasons why some families\r\n\r\nfelt  stressed,  and  some failed, resulting  in  abuses  and\r\n\r\ndivorce, and we all know that the children also suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons are, I believe one way to handle\r\n\r\nthe  situation is to see how the problems could  be  reduced.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, Sir, I think our people need to be assisted,\r\n\r\nand  be better prepared for the role in the family.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir, I must stress that we should not  assume  that\r\n\r\nevery  child will grow up and will automatically be  able  to\r\n\r\nknow  how  to become a husband or a wife one day,  and  maybe\r\n\r\nlater  on a father and a mother.  They need something.   They\r\n\r\nneed  to be prepared.  They need to know.  And, even if  many\r\n\r\npeople  claim  that  they are able to cope  without  anyone's\r\n\r\nguidance,  or on their own through reading and  all  that,  I\r\n\r\nthink more should be done to help our people.  And, with some\r\n\r\nhelp,  I  believe those who can cope can manage even  better.\r\n\r\nThose  who are facing problems would at least be in the  know\r\n\r\nof how to manage and to minimise their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, starting a family and managing it is not a new\r\n\r\nhuman  enterprise.  We have been doing it  for  thousands  of\r\n\r\nyears.   And  after  being in this for so long,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould have grown smarter from all our past experiences.  And\r\n\r\nthis  is why, and this is also where, I believe, we could  do\r\n\r\nmore.  We need to share more information on family life  with\r\n\r\nour  young.  I am not just referring to the importance of the\r\n\r\nfamily,  but also to increase their appreciation of  starting\r\n\r\none,  and managing it as well as they could.  For in the end,\r\n\r\nhow  well one manages his or her own family has a lot  to  do\r\n\r\nwith the future of our people and our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see that the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports  has  drawn  up  many  programmes  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nmarriage and the family.  However, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  notice  that  they  are almost entirely  targeted  at  our\r\n\r\nadults.   My  question is:  is it not a little  too  late  to\r\n\r\ntarget  grown-ups in trying to achieve the Ministry's desired\r\n\r\noutcome  of  cultivating positive attitudes  about  marriage,\r\n\r\nabout  family and about parenthood?  In this respect I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  more efforts being done to target our  youths,\r\n\r\neven as early as when they are in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can reach them younger and help more of them\r\n\r\nto  be better informed on family matters, I think by the time\r\n\r\nthey  grow up they could be in a better position to set up  a\r\n\r\nstrong  and stable family.  And this is one of the Ministry's\r\n\r\nmission statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the best is for MCDS to work with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education and try to come up with a programme that  could\r\n\r\nassist  our young to better understand and appreciate  family\r\n\r\nlife.    In  our  schools  today,  for  example,  there   are\r\n\r\nprogrammes like Home Economics and Sexuality.  I think  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  combined with many other family life  activities\r\n\r\ncurrently  promoted  by  the MCDS separately,  could  be  put\r\n\r\ntogether  to  become  something new, something  like  a  non-examinable  subject  that  could  be  taught  at  the   upper\r\n\r\nsecondary level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea is to have our young people understand and\r\n\r\nappreciate  the core areas of family values.   In  this  way,\r\n\r\nthey  are  more  likely  to grow up with  greater  awareness.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with such knowledge the children could also be a more\r\n\r\npositive  helping hand in their own families while  they  are\r\n\r\nstill growing up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone, for example, needs to study English,\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science, and other subjects from a very young\r\n\r\nage  in  order to prepare them for their working  life.   And\r\n\r\nonce  they have a good job, they can continue to improve  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills, and in these areas, I believe we  have\r\n\r\ndone  a  good job.  But, I think there is a case to  consider\r\n\r\nteaching  our young, or at least sharing with them, the  core\r\n\r\nvalues  about  family  life, so that  they  are  also  better\r\n\r\nprepared  for  it when the time comes.  And in  this  way  we\r\n\r\nwould stand a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter chance to have a good career and a joyful family life.\r\n\r\nAnd  they could upgrade their knowledge on both aspects, from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time.  But, by then they should have a  good  basic\r\n\r\nunderstanding about family life.  And even for those who  did\r\n\r\nnot  do  well  in their career, they could at  least  try  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a good and happy family life by making good  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  lessons  about family life that they have learned  while\r\n\r\nthey were still young, or from a young age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to be of help is to try to get every\r\n\r\naspiring  couple to attend some marriage preparatory  course.\r\n\r\nI think not everyone has the time and the ability to think of\r\n\r\nall  potential challenges that one is likely  to  face  in  a\r\n\r\nmarriage,  or  to think of so many ways to make the  marriage\r\n\r\nwork  even  better for the family.  Sir, such  courses  could\r\n\r\nassist  many  people to be able to think and look  ahead,  to\r\n\r\nforesee the challenges and to be prepared when it comes.  And\r\n\r\nthey  could even use the knowledge to avoid certain pitfalls.\r\n\r\nThis  is  where I believe past experiences that  many  others\r\n\r\nhave gone through could be of help to new couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I add that the more happy families\r\n\r\nthat  we  can help to create the better it is for our society\r\n\r\nand  our  future.   Sir, I sincerely hope that  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  look into some of my concerns and to find ways to  get\r\n\r\nfamily  life  education included in a more comprehensive  and\r\n\r\ndigestible way in our schools or to have some programmes  for\r\n\r\nthose who plan to get married.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman :</b> Mr Chairman, one of the\r\n\r\ntenets  of S21 is strong families.  We have often heard  that\r\n\r\nthe  family is the building block of our society.  As the key\r\n\r\nsocial  institution, we will continue to strive to  keep  our\r\n\r\nfamily strong.  It is this importance that has been placed on\r\n\r\nthe family that I am raising this cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not clear, if we do indeed have a family policy.\r\n\r\nMy  understanding is that we do have policies that affect the\r\n\r\nfamily, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe form of housing, healthcare, employment and, even perhaps\r\n\r\neducation.   But,  do we actually have a family  policy  that\r\n\r\nsystematically  attempts to put forth  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore family?  I would appreciate it if the Minister  can\r\n\r\nenlighten the House on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the marriage and divorce statistics, as mentioned\r\n\r\nby  Mrs  Yu-Foo,  do  not  reflect a healthy  trend  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore family.  In 1999, there were 14 divorces for  every\r\n\r\n100  marriages.  In the year 2000, there were 23 divorces for\r\n\r\nevery  100  marriages.   In  terms of  actual  numbers,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbetween  1999  and  the year 2000, the  number  of  marriages\r\n\r\ndropped  by 7%, but the number of divorces increased by  57%.\r\n\r\nThese   statistics,  compared  with  the  much  talked  about\r\n\r\ndecreasing  birthrate and ageing society, raise questions  on\r\n\r\nthe strength of the Singapore family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there fewer marriages, but more divorces? Other\r\n\r\nindicators  of  our  families  being  stressed  include   the\r\n\r\nincidences of domestic violence and juvenile delinquency.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister the following questions:  What\r\n\r\nare  the  programmes that MCDS has developed in strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  family?   What  are  the  outcome  indicators  of  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes, ie, are these programmes effective?  How does the\r\n\r\nMinistry  define  a strong family?  Are our families  getting\r\n\r\nstronger  or  weaker?   How do we know  that  we  are  indeed\r\n\r\nstrengthening our families?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have argued elsewhere that to understand the\r\n\r\ndevelopments of families, we need to appreciate the  changing\r\n\r\nsocietal   trends.    The   increase   in   the   educational\r\n\r\nqualification  of  women, in my opinion,  has  a  significant\r\n\r\ninfluence in understanding the state of the Singapore family.\r\n\r\nI  believe that the role within the family must change,  from\r\n\r\none  that is clearly defined along gender lines, to one  that\r\n\r\nis complementary in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with women making up half of the workforce, and\r\n\r\ndual   income  families  being  the  norm  rather  than   the\r\n\r\nexception,  it is imperative that we recognise the  need  for\r\n\r\ncomplementarity of roles between men and women  in  families.\r\n\r\nSir, while we do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  deny the Asian value that men are seen as being the head\r\n\r\nof  the  household, we also cannot deny the  contribution  of\r\n\r\nwomen  in the family's economy.  It is impractical to  expect\r\n\r\nwomen  to  go  out to work, to supplement the income  of  her\r\n\r\nhusband, and contribute to the country's economy but, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  to  expect  them to continue  to  perform  their\r\n\r\ntraditional roles of mother and homemakers.  While the  women\r\n\r\nare  doing  their part to supplement the men's  role  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic sphere, men must also reciprocate and do their  part\r\n\r\nin supplementing the women's role in the domestic sphere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe strongly that MCDS should focus its\r\n\r\nprogrammes   on   promoting   strong   families,    on    the\r\n\r\ncomplementarity of roles between men and women in the family.\r\n\r\nMen  can,  and should be encouraged, to be nurturing  fathers\r\n\r\nand  domesticated  husbands.    Their  roles  should  not  be\r\n\r\nconfined  to merely being the breadwinner and disciplinarian.\r\n\r\nThe  wives  will certainly appreciate their partners  sharing\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of building this strong family.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have always believed that dual career couples\r\n\r\nshare three jobs between two people, that is, two careers and\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance  of a home.  Indeed, we should  continue  to\r\n\r\npromote  this  and,  I  am sure, it will  contribute  towards\r\n\r\nincreasing our fertility rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note MCDS' support on the role of fathers.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I think we need to do more.  We need to address the\r\n\r\nissues  that men face in families.  As we encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nperform  non-traditional roles, I encourage MCDS  to  develop\r\n\r\nmore  programmes that will focus on the issues that men  face\r\n\r\nas  husband, father, employee, and even son.  This in  itself\r\n\r\nis deviating from the norm - that men do not talk about their\r\n\r\nissues.  Sir, I have worked with men in different groups, and\r\n\r\nI  am  confident that men do need to talk about their issues,\r\n\r\nand  these  issues are directly related to their  ability  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would encourage MCDS to also focus its efforts on\r\n\r\nthe  issues of socialising our children in preparing them for\r\n\r\nadult  roles in families.  While we are socialising our girls\r\n\r\nto  be  independent, educated and career women,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nsocialising   our  boys  to  be  domesticated  husbands   and\r\n\r\nnurturing  fathers.  Unless they are prepared,  and  we  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this at this juncture, we will continue to see stresses\r\n\r\nin  marriages as roles are not performed to expectations.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  a role reversal but a complementarity of roles.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I would encourage MCDS to develop a coordinated\r\n\r\nprogramme  at  addressing  the socialisation  issues  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren in our families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we are living in a\r\n\r\nfast-paced society, from third world to first world's  living\r\n\r\nstandards   in  one  generation.   Now,  with  the   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  families are subject to a lot of pressure  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes.   Some  of the problems are stress-related,  like  job\r\n\r\nlosses,  retrenchments,  relationship  problems,  harassment,\r\n\r\nespecially  now  from  creditors  and  relatives,   divorces,\r\n\r\nseparations,   family   difficulties,   grief,   bereavement,\r\n\r\nproblems  with addictions such as alcohol,, smoking or  other\r\n\r\ndrugs,  gambling,  unwanted pregnancies  and  other  personal\r\n\r\nworries or life stresses, and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two statistics reflect some of the problems of our\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The number of juvenile delinquents is high (31 per\r\n\r\n100,000  children).   The  number  of  persons  divorced   or\r\n\r\nseparated, as what Dr Maliki has said, within the  10  years,\r\n\r\nincreases from 1.3% in 1990 to 2.5% in 2000, that is, double.\r\n\r\nMost  of  these problems are found in dysfunctional  families\r\n\r\nand  normal healthy families too.  With the smaller families,\r\n\r\nfamily support is much reduced.  Some of these problems  must\r\n\r\nbe solved as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose a one-stop support centre in\r\n\r\nevery  constituency.   The Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports  should make residents aware of such centres,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  accessible to them.  We should  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople that these are the centres that they can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  to  for  help in times of need, especially now  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  coupled  with  massive  job  losses.   I\r\n\r\npropose   that   trained  and  professional  counsellors   be\r\n\r\nallocated   to  each  constituency  centre  too.   Retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers can also be trained to assist the counsellors and run\r\n\r\nthe day-to-day operations of these centres.  This creates job\r\n\r\nopenings  for  retrenched workers too.  These centres  should\r\n\r\nalso have a 24-hour telephone counselling service, trained to\r\n\r\nlisten  first  and counsel later.  Presently, there  are  too\r\n\r\nmany  telephone numbers for people to remember when they  are\r\n\r\nin  trouble,  and these are not reaching the  ground.   These\r\n\r\ncentres  could  also  work closely with  schools  within  the\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs are well placed to provide these support\r\n\r\ncentres.  However, Mayors have told me that they do not  have\r\n\r\nenough  finances.  Presently, there are only 12  CDC  service\r\n\r\ncentres,  which  are  too little, ie, one  centre  for  about\r\n\r\n300,000  people.  Therefore, I urge the Ministry  to  support\r\n\r\nthis  one-stop  support centre, which will help  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncope  with  all  these  problems derived  from  dysfunctional\r\n\r\nfamilies   as  well  as  normal  families  in  this  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.  As the saying goes, you shall reap what  you  sow.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would like to support my argument one more time that,\r\n\r\nSir,  even  our court is adopting this one-stop  approach  in\r\n\r\nhandling family cases now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, children from low-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds  who  do  not  have  strong  family  support  home\r\n\r\nenvironment  benefit the most from attending  good  childcare\r\n\r\nand  before-and-after  school care  centres.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nmany  low income families may not be able to afford  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children  to  childcare centres.  During  last  year's\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Supply's debate, I asked the then Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  and Sports  to  consider  introducing\r\n\r\nschemes to make it more affordable to these families to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to good childcare centres.

Childcare  provision  constitutes  an\r\n\r\nimportant  influencing  factor  for  many  parents  to   have\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still short of childcare centres and I know MCDS'\r\n\r\nplans  to increase childcare centres further.  A majority  of\r\n\r\nour  young parents are from the more educated group who  want\r\n\r\nprofessional  care  for  their  children.   Better  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres,  with  increased numbers of certified  professionals\r\n\r\nand  dedicated staff, should, therefore, be planned  for  our\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS should provide childcare facilities to both the HDB\r\n\r\nas  well as the private housing estates.  There is a need for\r\n\r\nchildcare centres to be located in areas where there is  more\r\n\r\ndemand,  such as the new densely built areas with many  young\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare centres at the workplace are convenient for\r\n\r\nmany  parents.   This  calls  for more  assistance  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  encourage  employers  to  consider  providing\r\n\r\nchildcare centres at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are more childcare centres that cater to\r\n\r\nchildren  below  18  months of age now,  the  fees  for  such\r\n\r\ncentres  are  very high, with the cheapest one charging  $650\r\n\r\nafter  subsidy.  Will MCDS please look into the affordability\r\n\r\nissue  and  consider  providing  higher  subsidies  for  such\r\n\r\nchildcare centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that very young children fare\r\n\r\nbetter  with family-based childcare.  MCDS should, therefore,\r\n\r\nencourage  family-based  childcare, especially  for  infants.\r\n\r\nThe  ideal caregivers for infants are, of course, the parents\r\n\r\nthemselves.  However, in the context of Singapore,  immediate\r\n\r\nfamily members, relatives, neighbours and even friends can be\r\n\r\nreasonably good parent-substitutes.  The question is  whether\r\n\r\nMCDS  could subsidise such family-based childcare in lieu  of\r\n\r\ncare  at  childcare  centres.   Granting  subsidy  here   may\r\n\r\nencourage  suitable housewives and retirees to  work  and  to\r\n\r\nhave  income while \"staying home\".  These caregivers  can  be\r\n\r\naccredited   or   monitored  and   registered   under   MCDS'\r\n\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of childcare subsidy, will MCDS\r\n\r\nconsider   giving   full  childcare  subsidy   for   special-circumstance  lower-income families?  The  parents  in  these\r\n\r\nfamilies  need  to go out to work but do not earn  enough  to\r\n\r\ncover childcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, our childcare policy\r\n\r\nhas been in place for many years.  The primary purpose is  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  women  to  continue to remain  in  the  workforce\r\n\r\nfollowing  childbirth.   This  policy  has  served  us  well.\r\n\r\nChildcare  centres  are  excellent  grounds  for  the   total\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  child physically, emotionally,  socially,\r\n\r\npsychologically and, of course, intellectually.   Indeed,  it\r\n\r\nis  a stimulating environment for the children.  I can attest\r\n\r\nto  this as my children have benefited well from the exposure\r\n\r\nto a childcare environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned about the children of low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies,  just like my colleague, Mr Charles  Chong.   I  am\r\n\r\nseeing   many  of  these  families  lately,  with  heads   of\r\n\r\nhouseholds who are not working and with minimal income coming\r\n\r\ninto  the  family.   The mothers do not  work  because  often\r\n\r\ntimes,  they  have more than one to three children.   To  the\r\n\r\nmother, the decision to work is weighed against the cost that\r\n\r\nshe  would  have  to  incur  in placing  her  children  in  a\r\n\r\nchildcare  facility.   This is a practical  consideration  as\r\n\r\nwhat they can possibly earn may actually end up going to  the\r\n\r\nchildcare fees; thus, the decision to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstay at home and look after their children themselves.  While\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  practical  and viable  option  for  them,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned with the development of their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have just completed the debate on the budget for\r\n\r\nMOE,  and  one  of the issues raised by many Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  is  the stress that children face in school.   Indeed,\r\n\r\ntoday's  child  may not have a bright future  if  he  or  she\r\n\r\nenters  primary school without a good foundation  during  the\r\n\r\npre-school  years.   I am concerned that children  from  low-income families do not have access to strong foundations, and\r\n\r\nthey  may  be  disadvantaged for life.  Yes,  there  are  the\r\n\r\nkindergartens  that  provide pre-school education.   I  think\r\n\r\nthese    children   will   benefit   more   from   structured\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  programmes  that are  available  in  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.  They need a headstart to ensure that they  will  be\r\n\r\non  the  same footing as the other children when  they  reach\r\n\r\nprimary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS has put in place the Centre-based Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme  for  Child Care (CFAC)  to  assist  these\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Subsidies  of up to 90% of  the  childcare  fees,\r\n\r\nsubject  to a cap of $250 per child, are provided  to  assist\r\n\r\nthese  families to place their children in childcare centres.\r\n\r\nI  think  MCDS  recognises  that CFAC  not  only  facilitates\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  family income but provides a  headstart  for\r\n\r\nchildren  of low-income families.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what is the take-up rate of the CFAC programme  to-date,  that is, how many children are currently enjoying  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy from CFAC.  My understanding is that the take-up rate\r\n\r\nis  rather low.  If this is so, what are the Ministry's plans\r\n\r\nto  improve the take-up rate?  Can the Minister also  compare\r\n\r\nthis  figure  to the number of families with young  children,\r\n\r\nwho   are  receiving  financial  assistance  from  CDCs,   to\r\n\r\ndetermine the extent of children from low-income families who\r\n\r\ncan benefit from the CFAC programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my suspicion is that the low take-up rate is due,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  to  the  lack of motivation for  private  childcare\r\n\r\noperators to facilitate this process.  For at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday, if these parents are not able to pay the fees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndue  after  the  subsidies, they become a  liability  to  the\r\n\r\nchildcare operators.  The administrative process must be made\r\n\r\nas  simple as possible for the operators, to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nscheme  reaches out to the deserving families.  Perhaps  MCDS\r\n\r\ncan encourage more voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  to\r\n\r\noperate  childcare centres.  As often times, the fees charged\r\n\r\nby VWO-run childcare centres are more manageable for the low-income families after receiving the subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of childcare and related to it, the\r\n\r\nwelfare and development of children, is indeed important  for\r\n\r\nus   to   address.    Children  coming   from   disadvantaged\r\n\r\nbackgrounds  are  likely  to continue  to  be  disadvantaged,\r\n\r\nunless  they are given an alternative environment  that  will\r\n\r\nstimulate their intellectual and social development.   Access\r\n\r\nto  formalised  childcare  services  not  only  benefits  the\r\n\r\nchildren, it will also facilitate upgrading opportunities for\r\n\r\ntheir  mothers.  The children are our future,  regardless  of\r\n\r\ntheir  socio-economic  status that  their  families  are  in.\r\n\r\nThose   who  come  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds,  indeed,\r\n\r\ndeserve  special  attention.  We  need  to  invest  in  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment  for  us  to prevent another generation  of  low-income families to emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MCDS will look into the criteria and\r\n\r\nadministrative processes of administering the CFAC to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe  access to the scheme for children of low-income families\r\n\r\nis further enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not here.

Indeed, one  reason\r\n\r\ncouples are not having more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbabies  is because they do not feel they can cope with  their\r\n\r\nfamily duties, on top of their careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flexible work arrangements are the most common way\r\n\r\nto   help   employees   balance   their   work   and   family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  The experience of other countries is  that\r\n\r\nsuch  work-life  programmes do help in recruitment,  increase\r\n\r\nstaff  productivity and morale, and actually  save  cost,  as\r\n\r\nthey reduce absenteeism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, in Singapore, companies have been slow to offer\r\n\r\nflexible  work  arrangements.   Today,  only  about   3%   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  on flexible work arrangements.   There  is\r\n\r\nalso little progress in the provision of childcare facilities\r\n\r\nor  childcare leave for both men and women at the  workplace.\r\n\r\nA  survey  two years ago by the Singapore National Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation  found that three in four companies  do  not  give\r\n\r\ntheir  staff  paid time-off to care for their sick  children.\r\n\r\nAnd  this is despite all the work and effort by the Work-Life\r\n\r\nUnit  set up under the Ministry.  I am sure that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  studied the experience of other developed countries with\r\n\r\nmore success in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry has any\r\n\r\nmore plans to encourage Singapore companies to adopt flexible\r\n\r\nwork  arrangements  and  work-life programmes.   And  as  the\r\n\r\nbiggest employer in Singapore, I would urge the Government to\r\n\r\ntake  the  lead in adopting work-life strategies and flexible\r\n\r\nwork  arrangements.   In  so doing, it  should  also  take  a\r\n\r\nrealistic account of women's increased participation  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  force  -  women  make up 54%  of  the  public  sector\r\n\r\nworkforce  as  in  the national workforce.   It  should  also\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  trend  towards a greater  sharing  of  family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities between the men and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I would urge the Government to\r\n\r\nremove  the contradictions in its system.  If I may  cite  an\r\n\r\nexample, married women officers are allowed paid child  leave\r\n\r\nto  look  after their sick children below six years old,  but\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  male officers.  It is as if the Government believes that\r\n\r\nit  is not the responsibility of the fathers to care for  the\r\n\r\nchildren  when  they are sick.  I am sure many  fathers  will\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  this.  Another contradiction,  while  married\r\n\r\nwomen  officers  are  entitled to  take  child  leave,  their\r\n\r\nchildren are not entitled to medical benefits, while those of\r\n\r\ntheir  male counterparts do.  I would urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  measures to enable parents, both women and  men,  to\r\n\r\ndischarge    effectively    their    working    and    family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities equally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, like the previous\r\n\r\nspeakers  before me, I agree that the family is an  important\r\n\r\ninstitution that must be cherished and protected.   The  fact\r\n\r\nof  the  matter  though  is  that  Singaporean  families  are\r\n\r\nundergoing  tremendous stress.  This is due to many  factors,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  pace  of  change, rising expectations,  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation   and  the  increasing  number  of   dual   income\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  As jobs become more insecure, the role of men as\r\n\r\nthe sole breadwinners will change and more women will have to\r\n\r\nwork  to  support the family and ensure a continuous flow  of\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, pro-family policies are important to help people\r\n\r\nbalance  work  and  family.  If we do not  put  more  serious\r\n\r\neffort  into this, then I am afraid that something will  have\r\n\r\nto  give, and it will be the family.  The demarcation between\r\n\r\nhome  and  work is artificial, as one affects the other.   An\r\n\r\nunhappy  worker  is  likely  to be  an  unhappy  family  man.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  an unhappy family man is likely to be  an  unhappy\r\n\r\nworker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that have implemented work-life programmes\r\n\r\nhave  found  that their employees perform better and  produce\r\n\r\nhigher quality work.  Work-life programmes are common in many\r\n\r\ndeveloped   countries.   Many  of  them  have  also   adopted\r\n\r\nlegislation   to   promote  work-life  balance.    Our   male\r\n\r\nparliamentarians may be heartened to note that many countries\r\n\r\nin  Europe  today  mandate the provision of paternity  leave.\r\n\r\nPaid  paternity leave ranging from three days to  four  weeks\r\n\r\nare  provided  in Denmark, Finland, Belgium, France,  Norway,\r\n\r\nPortugal and Sweden.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  not know whether our male parliamentarians and other male\r\n\r\nworkers outside will be so fortunate, but at least these  are\r\n\r\nsome of the developments in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the Ministry has embarked on many\r\n\r\nefforts  to  promote and strengthen the family and  help  the\r\n\r\nworkers  balance  work and family.  Unfortunately,  employers\r\n\r\nhere  have been sluggish and slow to respond.  Flexible  work\r\n\r\narrangements  for women who cannot work full time,  or  fixed\r\n\r\nwork  patterns, are uncommon.  Despite the fact that we  have\r\n\r\none  of  the  highest percentage of Internet users  in  Asia,\r\n\r\ntelework has not caught on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many working people continue to struggle between caring\r\n\r\nfor  the needs of children and aged parents and keeping their\r\n\r\njobs.  Often when they have to tend to family needs, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  at  the expense of their jobs as employers view  them  as\r\n\r\nunproductive.  I recall the case of a worker, a man, who told\r\n\r\nme  that, every morning, before he comes to work, he  has  to\r\n\r\nhelp  his  wife bathe his bedridden mother.  As a result,  he\r\n\r\noften  ends up late for work and he receives warning letters.\r\n\r\nSo  people  are caught in this kind of situation  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir family needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to ask the Minister the\r\n\r\nfollowing  questions:  How effective is the Ministry  in  its\r\n\r\nefforts  to promote work-life programmes?  What more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  to  educate  and  change employers'  attitudes  towards\r\n\r\nworkers with family responsibilities?  And finally, will  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider recommending changes to our law to  provide\r\n\r\nfor big family care leave which can be used by the worker  to\r\n\r\ntake care of a sick or disabled family member?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, juvenile delinquency\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  be  a prevalent problem and  I  note  that  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  young  delinquents  are   placed   in\r\n\r\ninstitutions  for rehabilitation.  Solving this will  require\r\n\r\nmulti-partite involvement, such as stronger family and school\r\n\r\nsupport,  the  Police  and  community  organisations  working\r\n\r\ntogether.  But my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcern right now is what is being done to ensure that  these\r\n\r\nyoung  offenders  are  not being influenced  and  emotionally\r\n\r\ndamaged by more seasoned and hardcore delinquents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a recognised fact that there is a need to\r\n\r\nimplement  rehabilitation.   But  we  must  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation  with these young offenders are not made worse  and\r\n\r\nthat  they be given a second chance to redeem themselves  and\r\n\r\nbecome normal individuals when they are discharged.  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if the Minister could provide an insight as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  measures  are  taken  to shield  young  offenders  from\r\n\r\nincorrigible  ones, and what his Ministry is  also  doing  in\r\n\r\npost-rehabilitative measures to prevent the relapse of  these\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore's population will age\r\n\r\nrapidly  over  the  next  30 years.   From  just  7%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  aged 65 years and above in 1999  to  19%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  by 2030, that is, almost one in five Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  be 65 years, or above, by then.  The sheer increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of elderly will create added challenges on society\r\n\r\nand  more  stress on families.  The support through  services\r\n\r\nfor the elderly will therefore become more and more critical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation was formed in 1998 to lead a coordinated  national\r\n\r\nresponse to address the challenges of the elderly.   The  IMC\r\n\r\nhas  finalised  its  recommendations after receiving  reports\r\n\r\nfrom  the six committees in November 1999.  And in June 1999,\r\n\r\na  Services  Review Committee was set up to  review  existing\r\n\r\nelder  care provision and delivery and to develop a blueprint\r\n\r\nfor   elder  care  services.

Singles are the most vulnerable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the elderly in Singapore face the prospect of\r\n\r\nisolation and loneliness in this fast moving society.  First,\r\n\r\nthere  is the trend of the younger generation wanting greater\r\n\r\nindependence and privacy.  They prefer to live on their  own,\r\n\r\naway  from  their aged parents.  Indeed, in the last  decade,\r\n\r\nthe fastest growing type of living arrangement for old people\r\n\r\nwas  that  of living alone, or with their spouse  only,  away\r\n\r\nfrom their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And second, the increasing number of singles means that\r\n\r\nSingapore will see more elderly singles living alone  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Already,  we can see the trend  towards  one-person\r\n\r\nhouseholds.   The  percentage of one-person  households  rose\r\n\r\nfrom  5.2%  in  1990 to 8.2% in 2000, with singles  who  have\r\n\r\nnever  been married before making up more than half  of  such\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have a whole generation of young\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  growing up without much  contact  with  the\r\n\r\nelderly  in  their daily lives.  Often, their caregivers  are\r\n\r\nforeign maids.  This is a society that celebrates youth,  the\r\n\r\ncreators  of  today's fast-changing technology  and  who  are\r\n\r\nplugged  into the globalised world.  They have little  regard\r\n\r\nfor  the wisdom passed down through generations.  In  such  a\r\n\r\nsociety, the elderly face the risk of feeling useless to this\r\n\r\nsociety and that life is meaningless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put these trends together and you will see a society\r\n\r\nsuffering from the effects of an age divide.  It also  points\r\n\r\nto  a  fraying  social  compact, with  the  expectations  and\r\n\r\nobligations  of  the  different generations  to  support  and\r\n\r\nnurture each other becoming more and more unclear.  If we  do\r\n\r\nnot bridge this age divide, but instead enlarge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit by policies and approaches which encourage age segregation\r\n\r\nand  bias  against the elderly, we will only breed a  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  who has little understanding and  value  for  the\r\n\r\nexperience and wisdom that comes with age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pressing need to bring the generations\r\n\r\ntogether, through inter-generational strategies.  This  means\r\n\r\nengaging the young and old in cross-age activities where both\r\n\r\nare  valued  as  active and contributing members.   The  more\r\n\r\ncommon  approach  in  Singapore today  is  to  cater  to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups separately, with programmes  organised  for\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens as a group and the young as  another  group.\r\n\r\nThis will segregate them further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to take a more inter-generational approach in framing public policy for the youth\r\n\r\nand  the elderly.  Today, more than ever, there is a need  to\r\n\r\ntake  an  inter-generational perspective to  create  policies\r\n\r\nthat unite, and not separate the generations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, as we figure how to best prepare for\r\n\r\nthe  demands of our fast ageing population, half  the  battle\r\n\r\nwould  have been won if we could influence Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\nthe  correct mindset.  Positive attitudes towards ageing  and\r\n\r\nthe aged should be actively promoted.  A mindset change needs\r\n\r\ntime and a lot of effort to nurture, and I would like MCDS to\r\n\r\nprioritise and enable us to achieve the desired outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older people should be regarded as useful citizens whose\r\n\r\nwisdom, skill and talent are valuable resources.  The society\r\n\r\nwill  benefit  if  we  tap these resources  for  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible.   The  elderly should not be  perceived  merely  as\r\n\r\npotential  socio-economic problems.  Not all old  people  are\r\n\r\nsenile,  moody  and weak.  We need to have our citizens  move\r\n\r\naway from wrong impressions and treat growing old with dread.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  show  our  people that  ageing  is  not  always\r\n\r\nassociated with disability, and that disability in old age is\r\n\r\noften  due to disease, which, if treated early, may not  give\r\n\r\nrise  to  disability.

Sir, older people can indeed approach ageing and\r\n\r\nretirement in new and exciting ways and MCDS can do  much  to\r\n\r\nhelp them realise that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey of 803 American men and women aged 50 to 75\r\n\r\nhas  found  that 40% are working or plan to work  after  they\r\n\r\nretire,  while an equal percentage do or plan to do volunteer\r\n\r\nwork.  MCDS should be encouraging and facilitating this  type\r\n\r\nof  attitude  by  increasing the avenues for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nremain at work and to do volunteer work.  Although we have  a\r\n\r\nhigher  unemployment rate now because of our recent  economic\r\n\r\nrecession,  we  should  have  a long-term  view  and  not  be\r\n\r\ndeterred.  Matching the seniors to further training or to job\r\n\r\nplacements  can also be enhanced.  People are tending  to  be\r\n\r\nhealthier and are going to live longer.  As we plan,  we  may\r\n\r\nneed  to  turn full circle and adopt policies and programmes,\r\n\r\nprovide  retraining opportunities, offer flexible work  hours\r\n\r\nand encourage those who want to stay on the job to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a large and increasing pool of volunteers\r\n\r\nto  tap from among the older Singaporeans.  Training them  to\r\n\r\nbe  competent in different areas of our needs will give  them\r\n\r\nrecognition  and worth.  The volunteers should be  recognised\r\n\r\nfor  their  work and it would be good if they  can  get  some\r\n\r\nprivileged  or subsidised care when, in turn, they themselves\r\n\r\nneed community services.  They should also be reimbursed  for\r\n\r\ntransportation and minor costs of incidentals.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the aging\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore is one of the matters that is of most\r\n\r\nconcern to Singapore.  By 2030, about 25% of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation will be 65 and above.  That will give  rise  to  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  social  and national problems.  This very  important\r\n\r\nproblem  must  be  jointly resolved by  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nfamily and society, and we should prepare well in advance and\r\n\r\nreduce all the impact that may be brought about by the  aging\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government has introduced a lot of\r\n\r\nnew  measures to look after our senior citizens  and  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  praised by many senior citizens.    What I am concerned\r\n\r\nwith  is  how  to give more care and concern to these  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.  In Singapore, most families are small and, most of\r\n\r\nthe  time, only an aged mother or father is staying at  home.\r\n\r\nIf  they cannot do any work, at the most they will go to  the\r\n\r\nvoid deck to kill time.  They feel very lonely and isolated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suggestion. Maybe, in our community centres or\r\n\r\nin  the  old schools in our constituencies, we can set  up  a\r\n\r\nCommunity Senior Citizens' Institute so that we can make  use\r\n\r\nof  the  facilities at our community centres to provide  some\r\n\r\nleisure   and  training  for  them.   We  encourage  lifelong\r\n\r\ntraining.   We  can open from 8.00 am to  5.00  pm.   In  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  we can encourage these senior citizens to  do  some\r\n\r\nqicong  or exercise, and do something that is good for  their\r\n\r\nhealth.  We can also provide some educational programmes, eg,\r\n\r\nexplain to them some of the important policies of the nation,\r\n\r\nand they can have lunch.  In the afternoon, we can allow them\r\n\r\nto  use  some of the facilities, such as karaoke or let  them\r\n\r\nlearn  computer or some language.  Malays can learn  Chinese,\r\n\r\nand  Chinese can learn Malay, and they can exchange and build\r\n\r\nup a better cohesiveness among themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important point is that many of these\r\n\r\nsenior citizens are still active and they can still work.  We\r\n\r\nalso have healthy senior citizens who can take up the job  of\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the old people at home.  Some  factories  may\r\n\r\nneed  part-time workers.  They can come to the CCs to  employ\r\n\r\nthese senior citizens.  It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  good for the senior citizens because they can earn some\r\n\r\nextra income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the Mayor of our Southwest CDC, and we\r\n\r\nwish  that  we  could set up this Community Senior  Citizens'\r\n\r\nInstitute  as  a pilot project in the Bukit Gombak  Community\r\n\r\nClub.  If this is successful, it will be extended to all  the\r\n\r\nother  constituencies in Singapore.  So I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Community Development and Sports whether  he\r\n\r\nwill  support this suggestion or to give us his  support  and\r\n\r\nperhaps give us some financial support as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Sir, one of the MCDS'\r\n\r\nstated   desired  outcomes  is  to  bring  about  an  elderly\r\n\r\ncommunity that is well prepared for old age.  As we know, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  elderly in Singapore will continue to  grow  from\r\n\r\naround 250,000 today to about 800,000 by the year 2030.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trend of our young having fewer children and\r\n\r\nsome  staying  happily  unmarried,  the  proportion  of   the\r\n\r\nelderly,  ie, those 65 and above, against the young  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole population, is also set to grow.  This is added by  the\r\n\r\nfact that more people are enjoying a longer life expectancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Aging Population has made many\r\n\r\ngood  proposals.   Among others, it touches on  health  care,\r\n\r\nfinancial security, employment, as well as housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current situation in the job market, the\r\n\r\nquestion  of financial security and employment of our  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  has become a matter of great concern.   Last  week,\r\n\r\nfor  example, I was visited by a senior citizen  who  retired\r\n\r\nmore than a decade ago, but continues to work today.  At  the\r\n\r\nage  of  66, he still finds it necessary to find  a  job  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to work to sustain himself.  He is 66.  He is  still\r\n\r\nhealthy  and  is keen to work because he needs  to  get  some\r\n\r\nmoney to get by.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we have heard many reports of\r\n\r\npeople who complain of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulty in getting jobs even when they are only  in  their\r\n\r\n40s.  They are still young, yet they are not treated as young\r\n\r\nanymore.   Many of them have young children in school.   This\r\n\r\ntrend  could affect their ability to pay for their flats  and\r\n\r\nto  save  enough  for  their old  age.   But  can  they  have\r\n\r\nfinancial security?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my hope that this year's budget and other\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  by  the  Government to  increase  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities could help to solve the problem.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  more workers should undertake skills upgrading courses\r\n\r\nso as to improve their employability.  For, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, I believe the elderly may be divided into two groups  of\r\n\r\npeople.   One, those who would be in need of help  and,  two,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are more fortunate and can help others.   Between\r\n\r\nthe two, we should have programmes that could match them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While efforts are being done by the various social and\r\n\r\ncommunity  agencies to assist those in need of help,  I  hope\r\n\r\nmore  efforts are also put in place to help the  majority  of\r\n\r\nour elderly to enjoy their old age meaningfully.  One way  is\r\n\r\nto  capitalise on their experiences and skills.  Many elderly\r\n\r\nare  still  able  to  remain active,  given  a  chance.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  there are retired teachers, nurses, police officers\r\n\r\nand people from various other professions.  I have met many - and  I  believe Members too have met many of them -  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  able  to contribute and want to remain active  and  be\r\n\r\nengaged with the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope there is a way to assist as many of them as\r\n\r\npossible to remain employed or be involved in programmes that\r\n\r\ncould   keep  them  to  remain  partly  employed  and  partly\r\n\r\ncontributing to the betterment of society.  Self-help  groups\r\n\r\nand  Community Development Councils, for example, can  always\r\n\r\ntap   on   the  expertise  of  retired  teachers  for   their\r\n\r\neducational programmes.  Similarly, I believe we  should  tap\r\n\r\non  the  resources of retirees from other professions.   They\r\n\r\nhave  wide experiences, and I believe these can still be  put\r\n\r\nto  good  use  for  the rest of our society,  especially  the\r\n\r\nyounger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also those who will find it more fulfilling to\r\n\r\nspend  much  more  time with their families, especially  with\r\n\r\ntheir  grandchildren.  As long as our elderly can spend their\r\n\r\ntime  happily  and meaningfully, feeling secure  financially,\r\n\r\netc,  I  think they are fine.  And I always believe that  the\r\n\r\nbest  is  left  for those who care to plan  early  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement years.  In fact, I believe it is the only  way  to\r\n\r\nbe well prepared for senior citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Ah Heng is not here.

But in order not to give you more stress, I will try\r\n\r\nto keep my speech brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I reached 40, I thought it was the prime of my\r\n\r\nlife.   I  thought I had a whole life in front  of  me.   But\r\n\r\nbefore  we knew it, we have reached 50.  And, now, at 54,  if\r\n\r\nit  were  10  years  ago, I would have  been  thinking  about\r\n\r\nretirement at 55.  But, alas, no.  We now have to worry about\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have to do for maybe the next 10, if not 15  or  20\r\n\r\nyears.   The  point I would like to make is that there  is  a\r\n\r\ndefinite  change  in profile of aging.  The  people  who  are\r\n\r\naging  today  are different from those who aged before.   And\r\n\r\nthere  are certain policies which we have carried out earlier\r\n\r\non, eg, 2-child family, may have an impact on the parents  of\r\n\r\ntoday,  with  smaller families.  Thus, many parents  who  are\r\n\r\naging  now  are  also  facing a  kind  of  loneliness.   This\r\n\r\nshifting  of retirement age from 50 to 55, to 62 and  to  67,\r\n\r\nwill  also have an impact in the kind of programmes  that  we\r\n\r\nwill need to prepare our society for the greying era.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Japan 20 years ago and I remember that, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Japanese had very extensive programmes -  surveys\r\n\r\nand  programmes  were carried out.  I am sure that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  also  learn  from such more established communities  and\r\n\r\nsocieties.  I would like the Minister to share with  us  what\r\n\r\napproach  the  Ministry has taken in terms of  learning  from\r\n\r\nothers'  experiences, which are the countries  that  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen to, so as to look at their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofiles  of  aging,  and what kind of  programmes  would  be\r\n\r\nrelevant to our needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the changing profile of the aged, we\r\n\r\nshould also realise that they are better educated, the  point\r\n\r\nmentioned  by Mr Maidin earlier on.  I think we  should  find\r\n\r\nways  to  tap their expertise and make them feel more useful.\r\n\r\nAlthough they may have reached retirement age, they can still\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  society in various ways  to  make  them  more\r\n\r\nproductive in part-time work, or in terms of helping  out  in\r\n\r\ncommunity service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would like to make is this question of\r\n\r\npreparing  for  the aged should not be done when  people  are\r\n\r\nalready  retired.  I think they should start early.  And  one\r\n\r\nway  to  achieve that is to have this blend of the not-so-old\r\n\r\nwith  those  who  are aging.  In that way, we  can  make  the\r\n\r\nyounger people realise the need to prepare for aging and also\r\n\r\nto  understand  the problems faced by those who  are  already\r\n\r\naging.   This blending or bonding between the not-so-old  and\r\n\r\nthose  who are aging would provide a very important  learning\r\n\r\ncurve for both age groups, and that will help us in preparing\r\n\r\nfor our greying era.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, first, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  all Members who have, in one way or another, supported\r\n\r\nthe  work  of MCDS and its related agencies.  Let me  address\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  key  issues first before I take  some  of  the\r\n\r\nspecific issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has raised some very thoughtful\r\n\r\nconcerns  about the ability of our current social safety  net\r\n\r\nto help our low-income families cope with the changing social\r\n\r\nand economic realities.  Sir, if the House allows me, let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  how  my Ministry is strengthening the social  safety\r\n\r\nnet in order for us to help needy Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a net that was designed to hold a light weight\r\n\r\nneeds to be strengthened to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbear a heavier load.  Our social safety net was designed  for\r\n\r\na full-employment economy.  It is now coming under increasing\r\n\r\nstrain,  and  two major forces are at play.  First,  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring and our move towards a knowledge-based  economy\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  put  more  workers  at  risk  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  or  under-employment.   Second,  as  has   been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  some speakers, demographic and social  trends,\r\n\r\nsuch as smaller families, nuclear families and, of course, an\r\n\r\naging  population, will test the tenet of family as the first\r\n\r\nline of support.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  doubt  that  with the  economic  downturn  and\r\n\r\nrestructuring, more Singaporeans, particularly our older  and\r\n\r\nless-skilled  workers,  are in need of  short-term  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  while they look for work.  Last year  alone,  the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development   Councils   approved   about   4,200\r\n\r\napplications  for  short-term assistance, a  7-fold  increase\r\n\r\nover  the  previous year.  We need to ensure  that  those  in\r\n\r\ngenuine need receive effective and timely assistance, without\r\n\r\ncreating  an  entitlement  mentality  and  eroding  the  work\r\n\r\nethics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address these challenges, my Ministry will put\r\n\r\nin  place  a  three-prong strategy to strengthen  the  social\r\n\r\nsafety net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will review the policy design of the social\r\n\r\nsafety net to ensure a right level and kind of help is given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will put in place programmes to help children\r\n\r\nfrom lower-income families access educational and development\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will continue to build up the capability of\r\n\r\nthe  social  service sector to deliver effective services  to\r\n\r\nhelp those in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, first, to explain the policy design of the\r\n\r\nsocial  safety net.  Our social assistance schemes are  meant\r\n\r\nto help the most vulnerable or weakest in society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is in line with our philosophy of self-reliance.  Those\r\n\r\nwho can help themselves and their families should do so.  But\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  recognises that many lower-income  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  also  lowly skilled and hence more vulnerable to  losing\r\n\r\ntheir jobs as a result of economic restructuring.  They  also\r\n\r\nhave little savings and limited assets to fall back on when a\r\n\r\nfamily crisis such as retrenchment strikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan has raised concerns over the adequacy of the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Downturn  Relief  Scheme.   He   has   made   some\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   I will address that later. Some  Members  also\r\n\r\nasked  if  more can be done to help individuals in  need,  be\r\n\r\nthey  older  or less skilled workers, or even some  displaced\r\n\r\nmid-level executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, work is still the best form of welfare. The longer\r\n\r\na  worker remains unemployed, the more difficult it  will  be\r\n\r\nfor  him  to find work subsequently. We need to help him  get\r\n\r\nback to work as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS)\r\n\r\nhelps  distressed  Singaporeans with a  short-term  grant  of\r\n\r\nthree  months in the first instance.  There are  no  explicit\r\n\r\nconditions attached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the help being given is effective, the\r\n\r\ngrants  will now be packaged with job counselling, job search\r\n\r\nand  skills  training plans.  Recipients will be helped  with\r\n\r\nIFAS  grants  for the first three months, and  extendable  by\r\n\r\nanother  three months if they are still unable to find  work.\r\n\r\nMCDS  will  work with the Ministry of Manpower and  the  five\r\n\r\nCDCs to help cases in need transit as quickly back to work as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above approach highlights a key principle of\r\n\r\nour  social safety net, that is of \"mutual obligation\". While\r\n\r\nthe  community and the Government will try their best to help\r\n\r\nthose in need, Singaporeans who have landed on the safety net\r\n\r\nmust  also  recognise that their welfare and families'  well-being  are best secured through gainful employment, and  they\r\n\r\nneed to help themselves climb out.  This may mean adapting to\r\n\r\na  new  job, or a job that does not pay quite as well as  the\r\n\r\nold job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there will always be needy Singaporeans who have no\r\n\r\nmeans of subsistence and are unable to support themselves due\r\n\r\nto  old  age,  illness  or some other adverse  circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey will need long-term care and support from the Government\r\n\r\nand  the  community.  The Public Assistance  Scheme  (PA)  is\r\n\r\ntheir main source of financial support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry last reviewed the Public Assistance rates\r\n\r\nin  January last year, and in the light of higher costs  that\r\n\r\nmay  arise  from the GST increase, we are revising the  rates\r\n\r\nagain.  The  new rates will be announced towards the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would be aware that the CDCs also supplement the\r\n\r\nGovernment's schemes with their own local schemes  to  assist\r\n\r\nthose  at the margins who need help, but who may not  qualify\r\n\r\nfor the Government's assistance schemes.  Mr Sin Boon Ann has\r\n\r\nmentioned  a few examples of Singaporeans who would  like  to\r\n\r\nwork  but are unable to do so and yet, still need to  support\r\n\r\ntheir  families.   My Ministry will look into  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthese  families at the margins, and how the appropriate group\r\n\r\ncan be identified and reached without creating an entitlement\r\n\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to re-emphasise that the family is\r\n\r\nstill the first line of care and support for its members.  In\r\n\r\nassessing  applications for financial assistance, whether  it\r\n\r\nbe  Public  Assistance  or the short-term  Interim  Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme (IFAS), case workers in the CDCs will  look\r\n\r\nat  the merits of each case as a whole.  The CDC case workers\r\n\r\nhave   some   flexibility   in   helping   deserving   cases,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those affected by job loss and those  requiring\r\n\r\nshort-term aid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry's second thrust is to help the next\r\n\r\ngeneration stay out of the social safety net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has rightly pointed out the need for\r\n\r\naccess  to good child care.  Poor early development is indeed\r\n\r\na  high risk factor in disadvantaged children faring worse in\r\n\r\nlater  life,  and perpetuating the poverty cycle.   Many  who\r\n\r\napply for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshort-term financial assistance now have young dependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as possible, we should try to prevent these\r\n\r\nchildren  from  becoming the structurally unemployed  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Our challenge, therefore, is to help children  from\r\n\r\nlower-income  families  access and benefit  from  educational\r\n\r\nopportunities available in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have also mentioned that studies show\r\n\r\nthat  early childhood education, especially for children from\r\n\r\nlow-income  families,  is  crucial  to  giving  them  a  good\r\n\r\nfoundation for learning and overall development, so that they\r\n\r\ncan be prepared for school and, in the future, employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two years, my Ministry has been\r\n\r\ncollaborating with Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre to  pilot\r\n\r\nan early intervention case management programme to detect and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  these  families.  The programme,  called  Healthy\r\n\r\nStart,  initially focused on families with infants and  young\r\n\r\nchildren  up  to two years old.  The programme provides  good\r\n\r\ngrounding for the family to uplift itself by helping  parents\r\n\r\nimprove  their  skills  and knowledge of  child  development,\r\n\r\nlinking them to relevant community resources and services and\r\n\r\nextended   family  networks,  and  enhancing   their   family\r\n\r\nfunctioning  through casework and counselling.  So  we  catch\r\n\r\nthem  early,  give  them assistance, build  up  self-reliance\r\n\r\nwithin the parents so that they can run programmes at home on\r\n\r\ntheir own, and where they need assistance, they know where to\r\n\r\nturn  to.  We close the information gap.   We provide  skills\r\n\r\nfor the parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot has shown some very promising results. My\r\n\r\nMinistry  plans  to  extend  the pilot  to  cover  \"at  risk\"\r\n\r\nchildren  up  to  six years old, and to more  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres.   This  initial phase will be evaluated  before  new\r\n\r\nplans are developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry enhanced the Centre-based\r\n\r\nFinancial Assistance for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildcare  (CAFC)  Scheme to make childcare  programmes  more\r\n\r\naffordable for low-income families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enhanced the subsidy levels in the CFAC Scheme to\r\n\r\nprovide   between  $170-250  for  children  from   low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Families  from  the  lowest-income  bracket   are\r\n\r\neligible  to receive the highest amount of subsidy  and  need\r\n\r\nonly  pay  as little as $20 a month in childcare  fee.   This\r\n\r\nyear, the Community Assistance Fund will set aside $2 million\r\n\r\nto  subsidise  childcare  under  the  Centre-based  Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance for Childcare Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked some questions about the utilisation\r\n\r\nrates  of the Centre-based Financial Assistance for Childcare\r\n\r\nScheme and what efforts will be taken to encourage more  from\r\n\r\nthe  low-income  families to take up the Scheme.   Dr  Maliki\r\n\r\nmight  like  to  know  that  in FY2001,  the  CDCs,  who  are\r\n\r\nadministering the scheme, received nearly 1,000 applications.\r\n\r\nOf  these, about 85% were approved.  In terms of applications\r\n\r\nand  approvals, this has been the highest attained thus  far.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  MCDS officers targeted publicity at the  service\r\n\r\nproviders  -  the childcare operators, CDCs,  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres and self-help groups, as they are in touch with  low-income families.  We will try to extend this network as  much\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to find ways to step up\r\n\r\npublicity   efforts  and  our  partners,  whether   childcare\r\n\r\noperators,  social  service agencies,  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils, Members of Parliament and families themselves - all\r\n\r\nhave  an  important role to play in ensuring that  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies utilise available childcare services to better their\r\n\r\nchildren's development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also asked about help for student\r\n\r\ncare.  With  MCDS' subsidies, families earning  at  or  below\r\n\r\n$1,500  per  month need only pay between $42-$60  per  month,\r\n\r\ndepending  on whether the centre is school-based  or  located\r\n\r\naway  from the school.  My Ministry will periodically  review\r\n\r\nthese rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third prong of our strategy to strengthen the\r\n\r\nsocial safety net is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupgrade   the   social  service  sector,   to   improve   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness and the range of social services.  We  need  to\r\n\r\ndevelop the capabilities of the social services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) are a\r\n\r\nlinchpin  of  the social service sector.  Many  of  them  run\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  the  community.   To  help  upgrade   their\r\n\r\nservices, my Ministry will provide more financial support  to\r\n\r\nVWOs.  This amount will be channelled into two directions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, MCDS will increase the recurrent funding to\r\n\r\nprogrammes  run by VWOs by $7 million each year.   This  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  improve the depth and the breadth of the  services\r\n\r\nprovided by our VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my Ministry will set up a VWO Capability Fund\r\n\r\nwith  $30  million over five years to support areas  such  as\r\n\r\ntraining,   development   of  new  services,   organisational\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   the   adoption   of   info-communications\r\n\r\ntechnology. These are some of the things that we will  do  in\r\n\r\nterms  of funding to help our social service sector build  up\r\n\r\ncapabilities to deal with the current problems  that  we  are\r\n\r\nfacing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given greater public funding and increased public\r\n\r\nexpectations  about  accountability,  as  well   as   service\r\n\r\nquality, VWOs will need to improve their governance, as  well\r\n\r\nas service delivery structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, especially for clearer accountability, my\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  spell  out  service  standards   and   other\r\n\r\nrequirements  in  service agreements  between  MCDS  and  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to assist the voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations    on    their    journey    towards    greater\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  and enhanced service to  their  clients,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  the  National Council of Social  Service  will\r\n\r\nprovide   extensive   support  to  them   through   training,\r\n\r\nconsultancy and other initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS is also working with the Ministry of Manpower and\r\n\r\nthe National Council of Social Service on a pilot Strategic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManpower   Conversion  Programme  to  provide  the  necessary\r\n\r\ntraining  for  mid-career  people to  move  into  the  social\r\n\r\nservice  sector, initially as social workers and social  work\r\n\r\naides.   This  will help to address the current  shortage  of\r\n\r\nskilled  social  service personnel and,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nprovide employment opportunities in the social service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity again to re-affirm the fundamental principles underlying our social\r\n\r\nsafety net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the family remains the first line of care and\r\n\r\nsupport  for  its members.  As many Members have  spoken,  we\r\n\r\nacknowledge that the family is under pressure, and I will  be\r\n\r\naddressing  this  later.   But the \"family  first\"  principle\r\n\r\nstill  holds, and any assistance given should not  supplement\r\n\r\nthe family's care-giving role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Many Helping Hands principle remains just as\r\n\r\nrelevant, if not, more so, given the challenges ahead and the\r\n\r\nwidening  range  of needs. The local community,  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  the  people sector and the Government will  need  to\r\n\r\nwork  together  to  expand the network of resources  to  help\r\n\r\nfamilies  and  individuals  in  need.   Long-term  Government\r\n\r\nassistance  is  directly  extended where  the  individual  is\r\n\r\nunable  to work, and the family is unable to provide adequate\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within this social safety net, every individual and\r\n\r\nfamily in genuine need will be helped, either financially  or\r\n\r\nby other means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki has asked about how CDCs have been coping\r\n\r\nwith  the  administration of the various financial assistance\r\n\r\nschemes   and  about  the  profile  of  the  people   seeking\r\n\r\nassistance.  The CDCs have seen an increase in the number  of\r\n\r\napplications  for financial assistance since they  took  over\r\n\r\nthe  administration of social assistance functions  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development and Sports.  Prior to  that\r\n\r\ndelegation, each social assistance officer used to handle  on\r\n\r\naverage  about 15 cases per month. Now, each officer  handles\r\n\r\nas many as 45 cases per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth.  This was mainly due to the economic downturn as  many\r\n\r\nretrenched  Singaporeans  are coming  to  the  CDCs  for  the\r\n\r\nInterim Financial Assistance and job placement services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been greater awareness of the\r\n\r\navailability  of  the  social  assistance  schemes   due   to\r\n\r\nextensive media publicity.  As the CDCs are on the ground and\r\n\r\nthus  more accessible, this has also resulted in more  people\r\n\r\ncoming forward to apply for the assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs have helped almost 15,000 beneficiaries with\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance amounting to $9.5 million between  April\r\n\r\n2001   and   March  2002  through  the  Government's   social\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes.  In  addition, the  CDCs  also  disburse\r\n\r\nanother  $670,000  through their local  financial  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes.   About 76% of the beneficiaries are  HDB  dwellers.\r\n\r\nThe   CDCs   are  also  receiving  requests  from  non-rental\r\n\r\ndwellings, mostly the smaller HDB purchased flats because  of\r\n\r\nthe recession and retrenchments.  About 65% of the recipients\r\n\r\nunder  the  Public Assistance Scheme are aged  70  years  and\r\n\r\nabove.  On the other hand, 67% of those receiving help  under\r\n\r\nthe  Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS) are below  50\r\n\r\nyears  old,  and about 34% of the IFAS recipients have  below\r\n\r\nsecondary qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in terms of processing time, the CDCs took\r\n\r\nan  average  of four weeks for straightforward  cases,  while\r\n\r\ncomplicated cases took about 8-10 weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also raised the concern about whether CDCs\r\n\r\nwill  have  enough  resources to basically  deal  with  these\r\n\r\ncases.   I  just  like to assure Dr Maliki  that  we  are  in\r\n\r\nconstant  contact with the CDCs, especially with the  Mayors,\r\n\r\nwho  understand better what are their needs, and how best  we\r\n\r\ncan  assist  in terms of meeting some of these  demands.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  this morning I had a meeting with the Mayors  for  one\r\n\r\nparticular project, and most of the Mayors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformed me that most of their workers are out in the  field,\r\n\r\ntalking  to  parents and families, in order  to  assist  them\r\n\r\ndirectly and quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has made some other suggestions, eg, we\r\n\r\nshould  do  more to help the genuine needy who are unable  to\r\n\r\nwork,  single  mothers and the elderly; for  MCDS  to  set  a\r\n\r\nminimum   standard  of  living,  some  form  of  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance;  and families on PA should be regularly counselled\r\n\r\nand  not made to feel like beggars.  I assure Mr Sin that the\r\n\r\nlast  thing we want to do is to make Singaporeans  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey are like beggars.  In fact, more often than not, we have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  reaching out to some of these people.   Secondly,\r\n\r\nwhen  we do contact them, and we offer assistance, we try  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  with some programmes.  It is always difficult  to\r\n\r\nget  in touch with them.  So I would like to assure you, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we  will continue to reach out to those at the  bottom,\r\n\r\nbecause they need more help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public assistance rates are pegged to the minimum\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditure.  So, we must ensure that whatever that\r\n\r\nwe  do,  Singaporeans continue to be able to at  least  enjoy\r\n\r\nthat level of standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan has a proposal, ERAS, as a loan scheme to replace\r\n\r\nthe EDRS.  Sir, MCDS used to have a loan scheme to help needy\r\n\r\ncases  set up small personal business efforts, such as school\r\n\r\ncanteen  operations, and the like.  The scheme, however,  was\r\n\r\nunsuccessful.  For one reason or another, the businesses  did\r\n\r\nnot  take off, and the loans were never returned.  We are  of\r\n\r\nthe  view that loans will be better administered by financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions who can assess and advise on the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nthese  small businesses.  But I assure the Member  that  even\r\n\r\nafter  the  economy has recovered, there will  be  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  in  place, either at the CDCs or at  the  CCCs.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  may know, every week MPs will receive requests  from\r\n\r\nresidents,  and I know from my own experience in Jalan  Besar\r\n\r\nGRC,  we will activate a network of grassroots leaders to  go\r\n\r\nout  and assess what are the needs of this particular person,\r\n\r\nbe  it  school children's education, utilities and what  have\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  assurance  that I would like to give to  the  Member  is\r\n\r\nthat,  even after EDRS has been stopped, and I am not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  it will be stopped, because PA will have to review this\r\n\r\nas  we  look  at how the economy recovers, and I  accept  his\r\n\r\npoint that there could be a lag between economic recovery and\r\n\r\njob  creation,  the  schemes which are  in  place  -  welfare\r\n\r\nschemes  run by the CCs and the Interim Financial  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme by the CDCs - could be tweaked to fit the new economic\r\n\r\nconditions, in order to help those who may still need help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the number of families who\r\n\r\nhave  received EDRS and what proportion who returned for more\r\n\r\nhelp.   So far, about 10,300 cases have been approved.   This\r\n\r\nis,  of  course,  smaller than the number of cases  who  have\r\n\r\napplied.   As  you know, many people think that  EDRS  is  an\r\n\r\nentitlement,  so  people who have been out  of  job,  or  the\r\n\r\nelderly, have come forward and demanded their $200.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  approved  only 10,300 cases so far,  and  it  has  cost\r\n\r\nGovernment  $4.13 million.  We are not able  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of numbers who came back for help.  As  you  know\r\n\r\nthe  EDRS  cycle is now moving only into its 2nd  cycle.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue to monitor the number of cases.  If the  cases\r\n\r\ndo jump up, I think we will have to do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With job-matching, Sir, as I have suggested earlier,\r\n\r\nIFAS, which is now without any condition, but once we link it\r\n\r\nto  job matching and job counselling, this will help them  to\r\n\r\ntide over their crisis and solve their key problem, which  is\r\n\r\nbeing out of a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the IFAS cases that Dr Maliki enquired about\r\n\r\nthe  turn-around  time,  roughly, we  are  talking  about  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  four  weeks  for  a  straightforward  case,  but\r\n\r\ncomplicated cases can take 8-10 weeks.  Some of the  problems\r\n\r\nthat  CDC case workers have communicated back to us,  through\r\n\r\nthe Mayors and the general managers, are that, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  sometimes  they  are not  at  home,  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncontactable.  More recently, we have written to all MPs  that\r\n\r\nwhoever may want to ask the Government to assist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of these families, to provide contact numbers so that we\r\n\r\ncan reach them much faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the percentage of cases approved, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, for IFAS we have about 46% for  FY  2001.\r\n\r\nThis  is  about 4,238 cases approved out of 9,216 applicants.\r\n\r\nI mentioned earlier about the case load in the CDCs.  This is\r\n\r\nabout  45 cases per month.  More often than not, the kind  of\r\n\r\nwork  that  they deal with the families, I am sure Dr  Maliki\r\n\r\ntoo  will appreciate, is complicated and complex.  It is  not\r\n\r\njust  a  simple  financial problem.   There  could  be  other\r\n\r\nrelated  cases.   So what the case workers have  done  is  to\r\n\r\nintervene  and  refer some of these cases to  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres  and  VWOs.   We assist where  we  can  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance,  and we do a  lot  of  referral  cases\r\n\r\ndownwards, towards the VWOs and the other agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has talked about unemployment insurance\r\n\r\nas  a possible suggestion.  I think we will all agree that if\r\n\r\nwe  have  unemployment insurance, it will perhaps go  against\r\n\r\nthe   interest  of  workers.   Now,  with  companies   paying\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit, based on the number of years the worker\r\n\r\nhas  been with the company, companies will think twice  about\r\n\r\nretrenching workers.  Also, at the end of the day,  like  all\r\n\r\nsupport  systems, it can be subject to abuse and lead  to  an\r\n\r\nerosion of work ethics.  Some of the experiences that we have\r\n\r\ngathered from overseas, when we studied some of these  social\r\n\r\nsafety net programme, show what we called \"bunching\" in terms\r\n\r\nof many workers all of a sudden becoming unemployed when they\r\n\r\nmeet  the  minimum criteria to be eligible for the insurance.\r\n\r\nSo,  they try and play the system in that sense, because they\r\n\r\nknow there is a supporting network.  Just like the EDRS, some\r\n\r\ncame  forward  because they feel they are  entitled,  because\r\n\r\nthey  want to get the $200.  Our view is that an unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance system may not be sustainable, especially in  times\r\n\r\nof a prolonged economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to the first prong of the social safety\r\n\r\nnet, which is to link all of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes that we have to job matching  and  job\r\n\r\ncounselling.  We know that some of the CDCs have started this\r\n\r\nwork,  but we hope we will be able to make this as  a  formal\r\n\r\narrangement, where possible, to bring the person back to work\r\n\r\nas  quickly  as  possible.  At the same  time,  Members  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that there have been reports in the  papers,  and\r\n\r\neven  in  this House, about some families who are not willing\r\n\r\nto take up the job, because that is not the kind of work that\r\n\r\nthey are used to, or not the pay that they want to enjoy.  So\r\n\r\nadjustments will have to be made, and we will continue to  do\r\n\r\nour  best  to ensure that the matching is done optimally  and\r\n\r\nfamilies are being helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can move on to the next section, which is the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Family.   Many  have  spoken  about  the  need  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the family, and I think we could not  agree  more\r\n\r\nwith  all  the Members who have spoken up.  Sir,  all  of  us\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  the family is operating in  a  more  complex\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Globalisation and technology have  changed  the\r\n\r\nway  we  work and live.  For many, material life  goals  take\r\n\r\npriority.   In  a more competitive environment, parents  face\r\n\r\nwork-life tensions, as they strive to fulfil their  work  and\r\n\r\nfamilial responsibilities.  Often, it is the kids or children\r\n\r\nwho  feel  the brunt of their stress.  Sometimes people  even\r\n\r\ndecide not to have children because of this.  Hence, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to thank Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon for her passionate appeal\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  help  families, Mr Maidin for  his  well-thought\r\n\r\nviews,  and Dr Maliki for raising a number of key  issues  on\r\n\r\nthe  family.   I think, like them, I believe we should  never\r\n\r\nlose  sight  of  the value of the family as one  of  the  key\r\n\r\nbuilding blocks of our Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many family problems could perhaps have been\r\n\r\navoided  if only the families had been aware of the  problems\r\n\r\nearlier  and acted on them.  This is why my Ministry believes\r\n\r\nin  equipping  families  with the  skills  and  knowledge  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   their  family  life.   Our  approach   is   both\r\n\r\ndevelopmental and preventive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key developmental strategy is the promotion of family\r\n\r\nlife  education.  Families can pick up family life  education\r\n\r\nmaterials in public libraries, resource corners, such as  the\r\n\r\n`Family  Connections' set up in December last  year  at  NTUC\r\n\r\nDowntown East Resort.  Early intervention is the crux of  the\r\n\r\npreventive  strategy.   This  is  especially  important   for\r\n\r\nfamilies  that  are at risk.  A good example is  the  Healthy\r\n\r\nStart  Programme which I mentioned earlier,  which  helps  to\r\n\r\nidentify families with babies and young children who may need\r\n\r\nhelp.   As  I  said  earlier, the programme  has  shown  some\r\n\r\npromising results.  We are expanding it, but we will study it\r\n\r\nvery  carefully, because we want to make sure that by helping\r\n\r\nearly  we  can prevent future problems.  Therefore,  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Maidin that we should expend more efforts on  family\r\n\r\nlife education for our young and couples intending to marry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform Mr Maidin that MCDS and the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  have recently  launched  the  School\r\n\r\nFamily  Education Programme.  This programme is my Ministry's\r\n\r\nlatest  initiative  to make family life  education  resources\r\n\r\navailable in schools for the benefit of parents, students and\r\n\r\nteachers.   Students will be taught core values about  family\r\n\r\nlife.   So they are exposed to what family life is all about,\r\n\r\nand  their  parents  and  teachers can  pick  up  skills  for\r\n\r\nparenting and maintaining work-life effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January this year, the School Family Education\r\n\r\nprogramme  has  been piloted at four schools, with  financial\r\n\r\nsupport  by  three Community Development Councils  and  MCDS.\r\n\r\nThe   programme  has  so  far  attracted  a  total  of  9,000\r\n\r\nparticipants,  including  3,000 parents  from  varied  income\r\n\r\nbackgrounds.  My Ministry expects to extend the programme  to\r\n\r\nmore schools next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of involving children in family education\r\n\r\nis  highlighted  in  our  National  Family  Week  this  year.\r\n\r\nChildren,  as  we  know, play a key role in reaching  out  to\r\n\r\ntheir  parents,  and  encouraging them  to  attend  parenting\r\n\r\nprogrammes and bringing family life materials from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  to  home.  Activities involving parents and  children\r\n\r\nwill be emphasised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mr Maidin on the importance of\r\n\r\nmarriage  preparation.   The  importance  of  preparing   for\r\n\r\nmarriage and equipping oneself with skills to stay married is\r\n\r\nfrequently  reinforced  in the various  public  communication\r\n\r\nplatforms  that  MCDS  uses.  These  include  TV  programmes,\r\n\r\nadvertisements,  press coverage and other similar  platforms.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also  one of the reasons why we set up  the  Public\r\n\r\nEducation  Committee  on the Family,  which  was  chaired  by\r\n\r\nformer  Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon,\r\n\r\nand  now currently chaired by Minister of State, Mr Chan  Soo\r\n\r\nSen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has asked about the 70 recommendations of the\r\n\r\nPublic    Education   Committee   on   the    Family.     The\r\n\r\nrecommendations are categorised under four thrusts.   Let  me\r\n\r\nremind her:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Imbuing the young with positive values towards the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family;\r\n\r\n(2)  Reinforcing marriage as a lifelong commitment;\r\n\r\n(3)  Promoting family life and Family Life Education for all;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n(4)  Creating a Family Friendly Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you can see, the recommendations cover the\r\n\r\nentire spectrum, from the young to those who are married,  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  getting married, and  also  to  creating  an\r\n\r\nenvironment which is conducive for family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will prioritise these recommendations\r\n\r\naccording  to  whether  they  are  impactful,  and   can   be\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised over the next ten years; can be  integrated\r\n\r\ninto  the lifestyle of Singaporeans; and can be sustained  by\r\n\r\ncommunity  partners and other service providers in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, we are not just going to run the\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and then after that stop.  But we want  to  find\r\n\r\nways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  which the programmes can be integrated, first, with  some\r\n\r\nof  our partners and, second, how we can make this as part of\r\n\r\nthe lifestyle of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now want to turn to the topic that is of concern\r\n\r\nto  us  all, and that is of marriage and procreation.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has given me the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  raise  this subject.  She mentioned that despite generous\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance, the number of births has remained  low.\r\n\r\nLet me make two points here, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our package of measures go beyond the Baby Bonus.\r\n\r\nI  hope Members can recall what the Baby Bonus scheme is  all\r\n\r\nabout.   For  the 2nd child, we give the parents some  money,\r\n\r\nand  if  they have a 3rd child we give them a bit more  money\r\n\r\nfor  the next 6 years, because we want to help them.  We  are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  creating  a  total  environment  conducive  to\r\n\r\nraising  a  family.  So we do not merely throw money  at  the\r\n\r\nproblem   of   declining  fertility.   Our  efforts   include\r\n\r\npromoting family-friendly work practices, developing more and\r\n\r\nbetter  quality  childcare centres, public  education,  among\r\n\r\nother support services.  My Ministry will continue to try and\r\n\r\nreduce  the  obstacles to marriage and having children.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  however, Sir, can only do so much.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\nit   has  to  be  a  community  effort  involving  employers,\r\n\r\nreligious leaders, people sector groups, the media,  parents,\r\n\r\ngrandparents,   friends,  MPs,  and  an  individual   effort.\r\n\r\nEmployers, for example, must understand that their  employees\r\n\r\nare  not  just  units of production.  Numerous  studies  have\r\n\r\nshown  that  an employee who can balance his work and  family\r\n\r\nwell  will  be  a  loyal,  highly  energised  and  productive\r\n\r\nemployee  who  can contribute significantly to the  company's\r\n\r\nbottom-line.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the end of the day, individuals must want to\r\n\r\nmarry and have children, and be prepared to make compromises.\r\n\r\nOne  cannot  expect to be compensated by the  Government  for\r\n\r\nevery   sacrifice   made  for  his  or   her   family.    The\r\n\r\ngratification and joy that come with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarriage and family are what make these sacrifices worth it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has asked about the work of the Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Marriage and Procreation.  The  Committee,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  know,  is  a  standing one.  It will  give  periodic\r\n\r\nreports  and updates at appropriate forums.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nremind  her that the Ministerial Committee delivered once  in\r\n\r\nAugust 2000.  It is now trying to conceive again, so that  it\r\n\r\ncan deliver again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she also mentioned about the social policies of\r\n\r\nDenmark,  Norway and other countries.  I agree with her  that\r\n\r\ntheir  benefits are indeed generous.  Denmark,  for  example,\r\n\r\nspends  heavily  on  day-care  facilities  for  children  and\r\n\r\ndifferent types of family and child allowances.  But, we must\r\n\r\nremember that in Denmark, total public expenditure represents\r\n\r\nabout  60% of their GDP, and the social sector alone accounts\r\n\r\nfor about 15% of GDP.  We do not have such a budget.  How  do\r\n\r\nthey finance this?  Although their personal tax on income  is\r\n\r\nnot  high, their value-added tax is as high as 25%.  So,  can\r\n\r\none imagine if we were to raise GST in Singapore to 25%?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo also mentioned that it could be timely to\r\n\r\nreview the \"Have three or more, if you can afford it\" policy.\r\n\r\nI  believe that the intent behind the policy is still  valid,\r\n\r\nie,  couples who have large families must be willing and must\r\n\r\nbe able to take care of their children.  So we have to signal\r\n\r\nto  families that there is a cost involved in having children\r\n\r\nand, if you can afford it, why not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem, I agree, is to convince the middle income\r\n\r\nand  the well-to-do that they need not stop at two.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  boils  down  primarily to values and expectations,  which\r\n\r\nchanging a slogan simply would not help.  If our Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave a more holistic and balanced definition of success, they\r\n\r\nmight welcome more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo may also like to know that we are currently\r\n\r\nreviewing the Social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Unit  (SDU), and privatisation  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\npossibilities.  I do not necessarily agree that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  can  do  a  better  job than  the  Government.   But,\r\n\r\nnonetheless,  one  idea  being studied,  as  Mrs  Yu-Foo  has\r\n\r\nsuggested,  is  to  privatise or let the  private  or  people\r\n\r\nsector  do direct services.  SDU will then have a promotional\r\n\r\nand  policy role.  We will study in what way we can basically\r\n\r\nwork better with the private sector or even other bodies, who\r\n\r\nare  not  necessarily from the private sector  but  from  the\r\n\r\npeople sector, to carry out SDU and SDS' work.  Just to  add,\r\n\r\nfor  example, in the Malay-Muslim community, part of the work\r\n\r\nis being done by the Muslim Religious Council where they take\r\n\r\na  slightly  different approach - they work through  informal\r\n\r\nnetworks  and  partners.  So, we will try  whatever  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded  in order to make sure that our efforts at encouraging\r\n\r\npeople to get married remain successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also raised the issue of abortion. I\r\n\r\nagree  with her that abortion is a highly personal  decision.\r\n\r\nLet  me assure the Member that there are sufficient resources\r\n\r\nand  measures in place to assist families who want to and are\r\n\r\nable,  with  a little bit of help, to care adequately  for  a\r\n\r\nchild.   They can seek assistance at community and  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare organisations, such as the Family Service Centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for abortion counselling, we, together with the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health, can look into the issues raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked how our families are faring. A\r\n\r\nbenchmark Study on the Singapore Family, conducted  in  1999,\r\n\r\nshowed   that  families  in  Singapore  are  still  generally\r\n\r\nhealthy.   We  probably have to update the  study.   But,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  in  1999, the data showed that things are  still  all\r\n\r\nright with the Singapore family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also asked about outcome indicators. As a\r\n\r\nMinistry,  MCDS is guided by macro indicators such  as  Total\r\n\r\nFertility Rate, General Marriage Rate, General Divorce  Rate.\r\n\r\nMCDS  also uses attitudinal surveys and studies to supplement\r\n\r\nthe \"hard\" numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the remedial programmes for\r\n\r\nfamilies   that  inadvertently  break  up.   No  matter   how\r\n\r\neffective our preventive and development programmes  can  be,\r\n\r\nthere  would be families needing additional support.   Hence,\r\n\r\nremedial   programmes,  targeted  at  families   already   in\r\n\r\ndistress, are another priority for MCDS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence and marital problems are two major reasons why\r\n\r\nfamilies  break  up.  My Ministry drives and administers  the\r\n\r\nmandatory  counselling  programme for family  violence  cases\r\n\r\nreferred  by  the  Family  Court.   We  also  work  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  implement programmes to help couples  consider\r\n\r\nalternatives before resorting to divorce proceedings.  Family\r\n\r\nService  Centres and specialised counselling centres are  our\r\n\r\nkey partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been asked as to whether our\r\n\r\nprogrammes are effective.  I would like to assure Members  of\r\n\r\nthe House that my Ministry puts in a lot of efforts to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  programmes  remain relevant  and  effective.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we have been working with the National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Service and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to put  in\r\n\r\nplace a Programme Evaluation System (PES) to help us evaluate\r\n\r\nand  ensure the effectiveness of the programmes.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  that we are working with the VWOs.   It  is  being\r\n\r\nrolled  out now, so that at the end of the day, the VWOs  who\r\n\r\nare the social deliverers of such programmes can assess as to\r\n\r\nwhether or not their programmes are effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to the next point, let me just address\r\n\r\nquestions   raised  by  Mr  Ahmad  Magad   in   relation   to\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has asked about the well-being of young\r\n\r\noffenders  in  the juvenile homes.  First, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nclarify that juvenile delinquency has been on the decline  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  five  years.   The number of  juveniles  who  were\r\n\r\narrested  and charged fell by 30% in the period  of  1997  to\r\n\r\n2001.  We also see a decline of 37% in the number of juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders  admitted  to  the homes in  the  same  period.   A\r\n\r\ncontinuum of treatment options is available\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  different types of juvenile offenders.  Those  who  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  less  serious  offences are  placed  in  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare   homes.   Those  who  have  committed  more  serious\r\n\r\noffences  and need more intensive supervision and  discipline\r\n\r\nare  placed in MCDS' juvenile homes, and these are the  Boys'\r\n\r\nHome  and  the  Toa  Payoh  Girls' Home.   Within  the  MCDS'\r\n\r\njuvenile   homes,  we  segregate  residents  who   are   more\r\n\r\nvulnerable   from   those  who  are  older  and   higher-risk\r\n\r\noffenders.  So there is some form of segregation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry adopts a multi-discipline approach in\r\n\r\nrehabilitating   juvenile  offenders.   Upon   admission,   a\r\n\r\njuvenile  offender  is  assessed to identify  his  strengths,\r\n\r\nweaknesses and his propensity to re-offend.  My officers then\r\n\r\nwork   with   the  juvenile  and  his  family  to   draw   up\r\n\r\nindividualised   care   plan.   The   plan   maps   out   the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation needs of the juvenile to enhance  his  success\r\n\r\nin rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Mr Ahmad Magad that my\r\n\r\nMinistry takes every step to ensure that each resident in our\r\n\r\nHomes  is  given the appropriate rehabilitative treatment  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  him  or her into a socially responsible  individual.\r\n\r\nLike Mr Ahmad Magad, we are concerned about recidivism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to how else my Ministry intends to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Singapore family.  Many  speakers  have  talked\r\n\r\nabout balancing work and life.  Let me address this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Singapore economy restructures, work patterns\r\n\r\nwill  change.  The family's position, as the primary provider\r\n\r\nof  care and support to members, will come increasingly under\r\n\r\nstress.  Sir, the Government recognises this dilemma.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  need  to  balance the demands  of  life  and  work  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Our challenge is to facilitate Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nthe  pursuit  of their aspirations, with regard to  work  and\r\n\r\nfamily,  of  preserving  the  quality  of  family  life   and\r\n\r\nmaintaining Singapore's economic and social fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work-life practices enable working parents to spend more\r\n\r\ntime with their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren.   Also,  singles will have more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\npersonal aspirations, socialising and attending to the  needs\r\n\r\nof their family members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Irene Ng has asked what more can be done to push\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the  direction of work-life programmes.   This\r\n\r\nrequires  a  multi-pronged approach.   In  the  first  place,\r\n\r\ncompanies   must   be   convinced  that  adopting   work-life\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  such as flexible work arrangements and  employee\r\n\r\nsupport   programmes,   are  aligned  with   their   business\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has taken a proactive approach by setting up\r\n\r\nthe Work Life Unit (WLU) in September 2000 to promote a work-life friendly culture in Singapore.  We partner MOM, SNEF and\r\n\r\nNTUC  to  organise  the biennial Family Friendly  Firm  Award\r\n\r\n(FFFA), which is aimed at recognising companies for their pro-family  efforts.   This year will be the  third  run  of  the\r\n\r\nAward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit networks and collaborates with partners such as\r\n\r\nthe Employer Alliance on Work and Family, which is a group of\r\n\r\nFamily  Friendly  Firm Awardees, the Health Promotion  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board, business  associations  and\r\n\r\nMNCs  to champion the work-life issue.  In addition, the Unit\r\n\r\nproduces resource materials to guide organisations on how  to\r\n\r\nimplement    work-life   strategies   and    flexible    work\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing mindsets of both employers and employees takes\r\n\r\ntime.   We  need to build the local business case to convince\r\n\r\nemployers about the benefits of being work-life friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to work with new champions and\r\n\r\nexplore  new  channels  to reach out  to  more  CEOs  and  HR\r\n\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has suggested that the public sector take\r\n\r\nthe  lead in pushing for work-life practices.  Let me address\r\n\r\nsome of the things that she has raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has already allowed Ministries and\r\n\r\nDepartments  to  adopt  flexible work  arrangements  provided\r\n\r\nthere  is  no drop in service levels or increase in  manpower\r\n\r\ncost.   Depending  on  the nature of work,  applications  for\r\n\r\ntelecommuting are also considered.  So we have, for  example,\r\n\r\nin  my Ministry and some other Ministries, alternate Saturday\r\n\r\noff.   Some  people  have come back and  do  part-time  work.\r\n\r\nSince  1987, married female officers with children may  apply\r\n\r\nto  work part-time, up to a period of three years, subject to\r\n\r\na yearly review.  So we can make those adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other work-life friendly provisions include maternity\r\n\r\nand paternity leave and full-pay unrecorded child sick leave.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, married female officers are eligible for up  to\r\n\r\nfour  years of no-pay leave if their children are below  four\r\n\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to add also that many companies have\r\n\r\ncome  on  board.   Personally, I think this is  a  very  good\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Those  who are here, who are  from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, may want to consider this as an alternative, and they\r\n\r\ncould  discuss  with their HR professionals on how  work-life\r\n\r\ninitiatives  can be adopted.  I would like to add  also  that\r\n\r\never  since I took over the Chairmanship of MENDAKI,  I  have\r\n\r\nasked  MENDAKI  to examine how work-life initiatives  can  be\r\n\r\nintroduced,  because  over 90% of the staff  in  MENDAKI  are\r\n\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mdm Halimah's question about legislation, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower is reviewing the  Employment  Act  and\r\n\r\nrelated  labour legislation with a view to providing  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility   to   employers  to  implement   flexible   work\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, however, mindful that legislation could\r\n\r\nintroduce   market  rigidities.   The  success  of  work-life\r\n\r\nstrategies,  such  as  flexible work  arrangements,  flexible\r\n\r\nbenefits  and  various employee support programmes,  is  best\r\n\r\nensured when companies are convinced that such programmes are\r\n\r\naligned  with  their business objectives.  We  are  examining\r\n\r\nthis matter in consultation with our tripartite partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, organisations adopt work-life friendly\r\n\r\npractices  as a business imperative.  I am pleased  that  for\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Family Friendly Firms Award, 435 organisations,\r\n\r\ncompared to 344 in 2000, responded to Phase 1 of the process,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to  assess the extent of family friendliness.   Of\r\n\r\nthese, two-thirds have less than 200 employees.  So, even the\r\n\r\nsmaller  companies are coming forward, realising  that  work-family  arrangements are actually ideal and suitable for  the\r\n\r\nmodern  economy, and will help them in terms of their bottom-line and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouraging response shows their recognition of the\r\n\r\nimportance of work-life effectiveness on the bottom-line.  As\r\n\r\naptly  put  by a US work-life expert, who was here last  week\r\n\r\nand  I  had  a  chance  to meet her, I quote  her,  with  her\r\n\r\npermission,  \"When  work is effective, life  benefits.   When\r\n\r\nlife is working, work benefits.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is 7 o'clock.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have half a minute left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.
