However, this rapid rise of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar is more a reflection of the weakness of the US dollar against all international currencies than any unusual strengthening of the Singapore dollar. Over the same period, the Singapore dollar has actually weakened by a range of 2-6% against the Japanese Yen and most European currencies. In trade weighted terms, the Singapore dollar on average has appreciated by much less against the currencies of our export competitors than against the US dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of a country's currency at any point of time is a reflection of its economic fundamentals and market sentiment. The strength of the Singapore dollar over the past few years thus reflects market demand for the Singapore dollar and our strong economic fundamentals which include low inflation, budget surpluses, high savings, large reserves and a strong balance of payments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the strength of the Singapore dollar has itself been a factor underpinning our economic fundamentals. The appreciation of the Singapore dollar in recent years has allowed us to neutralise imported inflation, a crucial consideration, as we import some 70% of consumer goods as well as capital and intermediate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> products used in exports. For the economy as a whole, our international competitiveness has not been affected. Singapore is now in an enviable position of having high economic growth, averaging 10% over 1993 to early 1994, as well as low inflation of about 3%. The volume of non-oil domestic exports has increased by over 20% in the first five months of this year, compared with 17% in 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's exchange rate policy is to promote sustainable non-inflationary growth. Attempts to weaken the Singapore dollar artificially in support of specific export sectors would only buy us temporary improvements which are quickly undermined by inflation, given our heavy reliance on imports and the current tight labour market. A weaker Singapore dollar raises the cost of imports. Under tight labour market conditions, the increase in labour demand resulting from the short-term gain in export competitiveness will exacerbate overheating in the labour market. Workers will want to make up for the cut in real wages caused by higher prices of imported food and other consumer goods. The resulting increase in wages and other costs will quickly offset the gains from a weaker currency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro-economic policy tools, like the exchange rate, can seek to provide a stable framework for sustained economic growth but cannot on their own ensure that this is achieved. With inherent limits to labour force growth in Singapore, only improvements in productivity can generate international competitiveness and sustained economic growth. Government will continue to promote education, skills upgrading and encourage the adoption of new technologies. Government will also continue to lower corporate and personal income tax rates over time in order to enhance the supply side efficiency of the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognised, however, that a strong and appreciating currency will affect some companies more than others, depending on the sources of their income and their import content. Over the short-term, companies sensitive to Singapore dollar appreciation can manage their currency exposures by hedging in the financial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> markets. Over the longer-term, however, such companies can only remain competitive and viable by improvements in productivity, by automation or by relocating their more labour-intensive operations offshore. Singapore Airlines is an example of an international service company which has continued to grow and remain profitable, notwithstanding the fact that much of its income is denominated in foreign currencies. Japanese companies have also learned to survive under much heavier foreign exchange burdens. Between the end of 1984 and July this year, the Japanese Yen appreciated by 156% against the US dollar. Over the same period, the Singapore dollar rose by 44% against the US dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, does the Ministry or the Government take into consideration the hardship being faced by businesses caused by the rapidly rising dollar and what measures is the Government taking to make sure that they will still survive against such a background? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have just said earlier that in trade weighted terms, the appreciation has not been as spectacular as the US dollar.

Environmental audits can yield economic benefits to the company. More and more companies are finding that being environmentally-responsible can help improve their public image and assist in the marketing of their products. More importantly, such audits can help achieve greater energy efficiency and waste minimisation and hence result in cost savings for the companies concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As environmental audits are internal management tools which companies can benefit from, it will not be necessary to provide tax incentives for companies to carry out such audits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that the number of firms which have been prosecuted for flouting environmental regulations has gone up three-fold from 1992 to 1993?

The second supplementary question is: Is the Minister aware that the Ministry of the Environment is moving away from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enforcement regulation towards self-policing regulation for the firms to follow environmental criteria? In the light of this, would the Minister consider that an added incentive for firms to be self-policing would be to give some sort of tax rebate to encourage them to be environmentally-friendly? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The fact that more prosecutions have been made by the Ministry of the Environment means that vigilance in ensuring that companies observe environmental rules has been heightened. Notwithstanding that, I am still not convinced that we need tax incentives. The National Council for the Environment and the Singapore Manufacturers Association have been organising seminars and workshops to teach company managers how to install environmental audit systems and the methodology involved and a handbook covering these items will be issued. Such tools are much more effective in helping companies move in this area rather than tax incentives. I do not think we want to use tax incentives as a crutch for everything in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Does the Minister agree that to be environmentally-friendly is going to be very important for the sustainable development of Singapore?

Otherwise, would the Minister have some other means which he could suggest to make firms more environmentally-conscious? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Tax incentive is an added incentive for everything. I think we need to control this. I am not aware that environmental problems are a major issue in Singapore. I think the Environment Ministry and the companies themselves have, by and large, been good in maintaining careful standards of environmental pollution, whether it is air, oil or smoke emissions.

This is because the enrolments before 1995 included the Primary 7 and 8 streams. The reduced total enrolment for 1995 means that staffing position in primary schools will be comfortable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total enrolment in primary schools is projected to increase steadily from 259,000 in 1995 to 298,000 in the year 2000.

There is going to be a difference of 9,000 more children coming into Primary 1, not the total primary school enrolment. So would the Minister please assure the public that this increased capacity for Primary 1 has been specifically looked after? And how is this going to be contracted for 1996 when there will be 9,000 less students going into Primary 1? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I can assure the House that the increased enrolment of 9,000-plus students in Primary 1 can be accommodated quite comfortably within our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> present primary school resources because, within the primary schools, teachers can be deployed to teach subjects quite easily and the classrooms and facilities are already available. After 1996, would there be a drastic contraction? This is not the case. The Member will note that the number of students who enter Primary 1 every year is dependent on the birth rate six years ago. In 1986, I think we reached a historic low in the number of births. After that, the number of births rose. In 1988, we had a bumper crop, the Dragon Year babies. From 1996 onwards, we will begin to take in babies born in 1989 and the years after. The number of babies born every year since 1989 has been over and above those born six years ago.

The salary ceiling applies only to non-manual employees, and is used to decide whether they are entitled to the statutory benefits stipulated in Part IV of the Employment Act. Based on this salary ceiling, non-manual employees whose monthly salary does not exceed $1,500 are entitled to these benefits which include: payment for overtime work, work on rest day and public holiday, annual leave, sick leave and maximum hours of work allowed. For non-manual employees with a monthly salary exceeding $1,500, the benefits stipulated in Part IV do not apply to them. Their entitlement to such benefits is dependent on what is agreed upon in their contracts of employment with their employers. For other protection and benefits such as claim for arrears of salary, termination of service and maternity benefit, they are covered under other provisions of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manual workers, on the other hand, are covered by all provisions of the Employment Act regardless of their salaries, similar to that of non-manual employees with a monthly salary not exceeding $1,500. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision to the salary ceiling in 1992 allows more workers to be protected by the law.

Should the conciliation fail in such a case, ie, a non-manual employee earning more than $1,500 and has a problem with the employer and we cannot resolve it through conciliation, under the present situation, he would have to seek legal recourse on his own at the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member recalls, on 13th July, the Tripartite Review Committee on the Employment Act released its findings and recommendations. This was widely reported. The Tripartite Review Committee, in fact, had particularly reviewed section 115 of the Employment Act. It has recommended that claims from non-manual employees with a monthly salary exceeding $1,500 should also be eligible for adjudication as long as their claims fall within the provisions of the Act which apply to them or arise from their employment contract with their employers. This would remove an anomaly where non-manual employees with a monthly salary exceeding $1,500 are covered by the provisions in the Act outside Part IV. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment which has been accepted by the Government will enable such employees earning more than $1,500 and are non-manual in the nature of their work, to pursue their claims through conciliation, leading on to adjudication in the labour court, instead of having to engage their own lawyers for such purposes in the civil courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Has this provision been accepted by the Government?

Domestic workers, of course, live with their employers in the employers' residence, while most construction workers stay in workers' quarters on construction sites. As for manufacturing workers who are mainly Malaysians, some of them live in rented HDB flats or private residences while others live in Johor Bahru and commute daily across the Causeway to work in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that some employers with a large number of foreign workers have difficulties providing proper accommodation for their foreign workers. To increase the supply of foreign workers' housing, the Ministry of National Development has allowed employers to build dormitories within their factory premises for their foreign workers. There is also a scheme for employers to lease State land to build and manage dormitories for their large foreign workforce. In addition, the Ministry has also begun to sell residential sites on 60-year leases to provide lower cost private housing for foreign workers and Singaporeans. The Government will continue to monitor the situation and look into new measures to overcome the problem of accommodation for the foreign workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, does the Minister see the present situation as problematic?

The Ministry of National Development has taken steps to provide more land for building dormitories for employers who have a lot of foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that by providing more proper accommodation for the foreign workers will stop entirely the habit or the preference of the foreign workers on their day off from work to gather in certain places to meet their friends and to socialise. While we must continue to try to find ways and means of resolving this accommodation problem, let us not expect that the provision of accommodation would mean that all the foreign workers will stop congregating in certain areas during the weekend or during their day off. This is an opportunity for them to meet fellow countrymen and to socialise. So we may still have to accept that some congregations will take place, be it in Little India, Beach Road or at the Lucky Plaza Shopping Centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, would recreational facilities be considered as part of the overall solution that the Minister is proposing? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I would expect that when employers build dormitories for their workers, particularly if such dormitories are located in their factories, they will consider this factor about providing some recreational facilities for their workers who are living in the dormitories. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as regards foreign workers who work at construction sites, they have temporary accommodation at the construction sites.

Is the Ministry, together with the Ministry of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> National Development, doing something to open up more HDB flats to be used as dormitories for these workers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, there is a limit to how many HDB flats can be made available to the foreign workforce in Singapore. We must bear in mind that HDB builds flats essentially to serve the needs of Singapore citizens, be it by way of sale of flats to them or by rental flats to the lower income group. It is only when there are surplus rental flats available that HDB can set aside some of these flats for the foreign workers or for the employers to rent en bloc and use them to accommodate their foreign workers. So there will always be a limit.

A special effort was made to get school children to attend. This resulted in the high visitorship that year. The visitorship gradually declined in the following three years after the novelty wore off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989/1990, the National Museum was closed for repairs. The entire timber roof of the building and part of the timber floor had to be replaced due to termite infestation. The dome was also restored. It reopened in November 1990 with the permanent displays remaining largely unchanged. We started organising special exhibitions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Children's Discovery Gallery and the Art Gallery were closed for air-conditioning works. The visitorship of 203,100 for 1993 did not include 40,100 students who came on guided school visits. It should have been included. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> total visitorship for 1993 was in fact 243,200.

The 1993 visitorship figure was 275,000.

The approved building programme for new HDB flats from 1994 to 1996 is around 30,000 flats per year. However, in view of the high demand for HDB flats, my Ministry is reviewing the building programme to see if it can be increased further. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

This is because when you have many contractors all competing for the same resource pool of workers or construction materials, there will be a pushing up of building costs. HDB will have to balance the desire to build more flats with the desire to keep the prices affordable. Therefore, the number will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have to be very carefully managed. But the assurance is that we will try to meet the demand and keep the prices low and affordable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, for the building programme, how is the number of flats decided? Is it based on the demand or is it based on some criteria set by the Ministry? From my understanding, the demand is very high at the moment, but we are building only 30,000 flats a year for the next three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the number is determined on the basis of various factors: (1) demand; (2) ability to clear the land and acquire it for such purpose; and (3) whether the infrastructure can support such a building programme. For example, sewerage plants will have to be built if suddenly we build a huge estate in some part of Singapore that does not have such a plant, roads, etc. Therefore, while we wish to build more flats to accommodate demand, we will have to take into account the other factors as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> The very fact that there is public perception that prices are rising and the constraint in supply is making the situation worse. In other words, with rising prices, a limited number of new flats, and more people jumping into the queue for flats, how do we find ways to make sure that we build enough flats to meet the demand and not to set targets like 30,000 flats, which is way out of line with public demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the targets are set from year to year to accommodate the increasing demand. It is true that when prices increase, both in the private sector and public sector housing, the desire to quickly own a flat is there. For those who think they can upgrade to a bigger flat of higher value, they want to do that sooner. The key issue is whether every new household, new family, newly married couple, will have a flat soon enough to start a family in. The Ministry is addressing this issue. The building \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> programme and the allocation programme will address this issue primarily. Whether or not we can supply executive flats for everyone who desires one is a separate issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, is this target of 30,000 flats sufficient to meet the demand in the next few years? At the same time, has the average waiting time been reduced in the last few years? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the number of new households being formed each year is about 26,000. If you take the birth rate of 40,000-50,000 and divide it by two, and they get married, you will have about 25,000 to 26,000 marriages in a year. Our building programme of 30,000 flats will, in fact, cater to the entire group of newly-formed households in one year. However, we will also have to look at upgraders and people who, for various reasons, want to shift from one estate to another for work, etc. Therefore, the building programme for newly-formed households will take care of the demand from them. The HDB and the Ministry are looking at the allocation policy to see how best we can solve this problem for new households. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, what about the question of waiting time? Has it been reduced? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, if the Member proposes that for one year we give all the new flats to new households, we can solve the problem in one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask what proportion of this new housing will be on the design-and-build scheme? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I do not have the data for this question about the design-and-build scheme.

Therefore, what we should look at is the issue of how best to cater to the needs of new households, and we are talking about 26,000 a year.

Flats offered for booking in different quarters are therefore not priced similarly, even for the same type of flats in the same new towns, because of variations in floor areas, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> features, designs and finishes. Such differences make a simple comparison of the average selling prices between quarters misleading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the 4-room and 5-room flats offered for booking at Bukit Batok in the third quarter come with better design and finishes than those offered in the second quarter. Hence, the average price differences ranging from $3,300 for 4-room flats to $12,000 for 5-room flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Executive flats at Jurong West, those offered for booking in the second quarter were flats which were not selected in previous booking exercises more than a year ago. The third quarter flats are also bigger and of better design and finishes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats remain highly affordable to the average Singaporean. Based on the average selling prices for the third quarter, the ratio of monthly mortgage instalments to median household income of the applicants for 4-room flats is only 23%. This is the same level as two years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It seems to me that the reason for the increase in sale price is due to better design and bigger area. So would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary tell us what exactly are \"better design and finishes\"?

As for other differences, HDB has changed from white tiles for the kitchen, toilets and bathrooms to coloured tiles. Better grilles and a better type of doors are provided. I cannot categorise for each item how much the increase is justifiable because they vary from contract to contract. But from the second quarter to the third quarter, for the flats in Bukit Batok, the finishes, the facade, facilities, are indeed better, and the prices are justified. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that he cannot convince Singaporeans by merely saying \"better design\". I am sure there is a way to work out: how much it will cost, let \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> us say, per unit for this kind of design with better quality of tiles. Would he release the figures to the public? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> The price difference is based on the tender prices by the different contractors. It is not set by the HDB or the Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary say that the fact that the level of demand is so high for these flats is an indication that the prices are justified? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, indeed there is a great demand for flats at Bukit Batok and Jurong West and many other parts of Singapore. We will try to keep the prices affordable. We will maintain the ratio of what they have to pay in instalments to the household income at 23%, which is well within their CPF contributions, and what they can pay out of their CPF accounts. The demand is there. People are willing to pay much higher prices on the resale market. Anyone who gets a Bukit Batok flat today, and he puts it on the market immediately the next day, he will probably command a far higher resale value. Therefore, to answer Mr Chng's point, indeed there is a demand and people are willing to pay those prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does it mean that because people can pay and are willing to pay for a higher price, compared with the resale market, therefore, the HDB can just increase prices? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Not at all, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I think the Senior Parliamentary Secretary should release the figures in terms of tender price, in terms of land cost, work it out per unit, and how much HDB would recoup from selling the flat. Would he agree to do that for these particular projects because there is ground for comparison in the same area? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the differences are in the finishes. The contract prices are open for inspection. The successful tenderers have offered certain \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prices and HDB chooses the best offer for coloured tiles, the best offer for better grilles and therefore, it puts all these things into calculation.

A general salary revision of Civil Service salaries was made from 1st January 1994. Hence the judicial and political salaries also have to be adjusted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judges' Remuneration Act (JRA) sets out the amount of annual pensionable salaries payable to the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court. Salary changes for the Judges of the Supreme Court require to be formally effected through an amendment of the JRA. The need to amend the Act each time \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there is a change in Judges' salaries is rather cumbersome as a Bill has to be introduced in Parliament and taken through three readings. Much time and effort is expended before the amending Act is finally approved and gazetted. A more expeditious method of making changes to Judges' salaries is to empower the Minister for Finance to determine the salaries of Judges by order published in the Gazette. This obviates the need to specify such salaries in the Act itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new category of Judges known as Judges of Appeal with a higher pensionable salary than a Judge of the Supreme Court was created from 1st July 1993. The JRA was to have been amended to reflect the salary of a Judge of Appeal who was then paid a basic salary of $21,100 per month or an annual pensionable salary of $253,200. The amendment was, however, deferred in view of the general salary revision, including those of Judges, to be effective from 1st January 1994. Now that the revision has taken place and there has been no change in the annual pensionable salary of a Judge of Appeal and the other Judges of the Supreme Court, it is necessary to validate the pensionable salary paid to Judges of Appeal since July 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is now being introduced in Parliament to repeal and re-enact the JRA to enable the Minister for Finance to determine by order the annual pensionable salaries of the Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal and the other Judges of the Supreme Court as well as to provide for payment of salaries to Judges of Appeal, with retrospective effect from July 1993. Certain obsolete provisions of the existing Act have also been repealed. These changes will expedite the method of revising salaries in future for Judges of the Supreme Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Road Traffic Act to enable the Registrar of Vehicles and the Deputy Commissioner of Police to disallow the renewal of vehicle licences and driving licences of applicants who have outstanding warrants of arrest against them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to deal with motorists who blatantly ignore the summonses and warrants of arrest issued against them for parking offences under the Parking Places Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a motorist is allowed to settle the parking offence notice by paying a composition fine. If he fails to pay the fine after three reminders, he is summoned to Court. If he fails to appear in Court to answer the charge, the Court will issue a warrant for his arrest. When this happens, the Police will first send him a letter asking him to surrender himself at the Police Warrant Enforcement Unit at the Subordinate Courts Complex and settle his warrant of arrest by paying up the fine there. However, if he still fails to do so, the Police will then have to take action to arrest him and bring him before the Court for prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the majority of motorists pay up their fines in time, there are offenders who still persist in ignoring the numerous and repeated reminders sent by the Police. In a major publicity campaign last year, the courts have made it clear that it is to the benefit of the offenders, if they are guilty, to settle their composition fines early. Not to do so may result in heftier fines when their cases are taken up in court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond such a publicity campaign, the Government must impose deterrent measures to deal with recalcitrant offenders who disregard repeated reminders and warrants of arrest. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Although such cases account for only about 2% to 3% of the total number of car parking notices issued, in absolute figures, the number is alarming and increasing. In the 1980s, the Police received from the courts an average of about 20,000 warrants of arrest annually. This figure rose three-fold to about 60,000 a year between 1991 and 1993. As at 30th June this year, there were 9,920 motorists who have accumulated a total of 51,046 warrants of arrest. This amounts to an average of five warrants of arrest per offender. This situation cannot be tolerated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have been taking action against these motorists. Since July last year, 9,180 offenders have been arrested. One of them had accumulated a staggering number of 166 warrants of arrest! He was fined $66,400 and in default sentenced to 664 days of imprisonment. He did not pay his fine and he is still in prison since 18th December 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such enforcement action by Police, the number of outstanding warrants of arrest remains high. Using Police's limited resources to go after each and everyone of these errant motorists is not an effective solution. Many police officers have to be deployed to make house calls. In many cases, the errant motorists are no longer living at their last known addresses. Valuable Police resources are wasted on these recalcitrants. We need a more efficient way to bring these hardcore offenders to task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has already introduced a number of measures against such parking offenders, such as debarring them from purchasing or renewing season tickets for HDB car park lots; withholding from them certain HDB services, such as the purchase and rental of shops, allocation of rental flats, approval of resale of flats, permits for renovation or upgrading and use of HDB facilities. However, these measures are limited in their coverage and leave out those recalcitrant motorists who do not need such HDB services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment of the Road Traffic Act to withhold the renewal of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> vehicle licences and driving licences from recalcitrant motorists for parking offences will be more effective as it is more direct. It targets at all errant local motorists including those who do not need HDB services. Without a valid vehicle licence or driving licence, a person is not allowed to use a vehicle or drive on the road. If he does so, he commits an offence. Under the Road Traffic Act, the penalty for using a vehicle without a valid vehicle licence is a fine of up to $2,000. The penalty for driving without a valid driving licence is a fine of up to $1,000, or imprisonment of up to three months. As the current vehicle licence renewal cycle is six months or one year and the driving licence renewal cycle is one to three years, the amendment will compel motorists who own vehicles to settle their outstanding warrants of arrest quickly if they want to continue driving. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment to empower ROV and the Traffic Police to withhold the renewal of vehicle licence and driving licences of recalcitrant drivers who ignore reminders and warrants of arrest is necessary. We have to tackle this problem more efficiently. For a long time, we have been too lenient and too tolerant with these motorists. I believe it is time for us to take them to task. At stake, it is not just a minor offence of parking violation, but one of total disregard for the law. The act of illegal parking is bad enough. The refusal to pay up the fine despite reminders and subsequently a warrant of arrest is totally unacceptable. With the amendment, such motorists must think twice before ignoring parking summonses for they run the risks of losing their driving licences and the use of their vehicles on the road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the figures given by the Minister are really startling as it relates only to one offence, namely, that of parking. Each year, between 1991 and 1993, at year end, there are 60,000 outstanding warrants of arrest. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has mentioned, before a warrant of arrest is issued, three reminders would have been issued. Then a warrant of arrest is issued. I just wonder how we have reached this state of affairs! Singaporeans are a law-abiding people, but for parking, this seems to be a peculiar problem. Can the Minister tell us how many parking offences were committed in a year? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GPC has been informed that, currently, there are approximately 11,500 motorists with one or more warrants of arrest. 27 of them have accumulated more than 50 warrants of arrest each. This is a serious matter and, therefore, warrants more serious action. I therefore support this Bill to deal with the recalcitrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst supporting this Bill, I worry as to how many of these offenders actually depend on driving as a key means of earning a living, for example, delivery man or despatch clerks. If a driving licence or road tax is not renewed when he presents himself, then the whole family's source of income is lost. This would then throw the whole family into a hardship cycle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make these suggestions to the Minister? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Some of the offenders may not dare to give themselves up as they are not able to afford to pay their accumulated fines. Can the HDB and URA disseminate widely circulars regarding the impact of today's Bill on them? They should try to settle with the authorities these summonses, rather than wait for the renewal date of the driving licence which, as you know, can be renewed for three years in advance, or vehicle licence, and then suddenly find themselves without a means to continue their livelihood. The HDB and URA should also try to work out instalment payments if these persons cannot pay at one go. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Would the Minister ask the HDB and URA to give the CCC advisors a list of these persons? The grassroots leaders can also assist to alert these people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that there are deeper underlying reasons for non-compliance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with regard to parking offences although these are not excuses. This Bill is required to check the problem. Through this Bill, all future offenders, hopefully, will take their parking offences seriously. However, for the past offenders, it is my hope that, guilty as they are, we can soften somewhat the hardship on the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is, in my view, a very harsh Bill, because it is not a question of asking the offender to pay a fine or asking the offender to be sentenced to a jail term but, in fact, the law is taking away the livelihood, ie, the rice bowl of a person who uses his driving licence or his vehicle as a means of livelihood. So I think, in this sense, it is a rather harsh Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think before the Minister enacts such a very strong law, what he should do is to examine the parking problem in Singapore. That is the key issue. Why do so many people commit parking offences? It may not be due entirely to his fault. If one has gone to other countries, there are places where it is clearly marked \"Five minutes parking\" or \"One hour parking\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many instances where these people pay fines because they may be delivering goods. They may just want to go in to deliver the goods and their intention is to go out within five minutes. So they take a chance. Instead of putting a parking coupon, they think that they could rush in, deliver their goods and come out again. What happens is that, sometimes, when they go in, they are held back because of certain problems in relation to their work and, therefore, they cannot come back within five minutes. And when they come back, they see a parking notice slapped on him. Probably, he feels that it is not fair in that circumstances and also due to his busy work schedule, it may have just slipped his mind. In the first place, he is not willing to pay because he feels that it is not fair to him while he is trying to make a living. A parking notice is issued to him because he forgets to display a parking coupon. And because of a 90-cent offence, he ends up losing his rice bowl. For not displaying a 45-cent or 90-cent parking coupon, he may end up with a $66,000 fine. In our society, there \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> must be something wrong with our system here. For such a minor offence, he can go to jail for 3-4 years. It is like the proverbial person who suffers the offence of stealing half a loaf of bread and he loses his life for it. We are coming to that stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a minor parking offence, he may end up with a $66,000 fine, or he may lose his livelihood. His wife and children will also be affected. I do not know whether we have come to that stage. It is not, as the Minister said, as easy as just paying the 90 cents. In the daily working life of the people who are under great stress, it is not just the 90 cents. There are other problems too. My contention is that parking problem is a real problem in Singapore. And I think the Government should look into it rather than slapping more and more penalties on our people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, referring first to Dr Arthur Beng's question about how many parking offences are committed in one year, I am told that there are two million parking offences committed in a year. The URA issued in 1992 about 840,000 summonses for parking offences. The HDB issued 1,246,000 such parking summonses. In 1993, the number was not much different. The HDB issued 1,236,000 and the URA issued 822,000. In other words, on average, we have issued about 2,060,000 parking summonses. I think this is a mind-boggling number. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest that there is a parking problem and therefore we should examine the parking problem and be more lenient to such people, I think we are not facing the reality. All of us have been to our constituencies, we are involved in what is going on, and we know that there are enough parking places. We are also aware that sometimes people take the easy way out. When they see that there is space available along the road, they just park there. Or they find that the car park is a bit too far away or it is already full when they come back in the evening, although there are other parking places available elsewhere within the region, they also decide to take the risk and park just \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> outside their own block, and thereby commit an offence. I think it is not just the question of a person rushing in to send his goods or do an errand and miss out for five minutes and the parking attendant comes and gives him a notice. From what I know, I think our parking attendants have been very tolerant. They will wait for the person for five or ten minutes, and if the person does not turn up, he will get a ticket. I think that has been very liberal. To say that we are harsh, I would suggest that these motorists think twice before they commit an offence. And I would say that we are very tolerant with them. The URA and HDB give them three reminders before issuing them with a warrant of arrest. To say that a person is forgetful, he may have amnesia and that he cannot remember that he was given three reminders, I think that person needs some other kind of help. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person who is jailed because he could not pay up $60,000-odd fine chalked up 166 warrants of arrest. Can you imagine any person who just ignores warrants of arrest after warrants of arrest, and you say be kind and lenient to such a person? What sort of society will we become? A person who is prepared to disregard the law despite repeated reminders before a warrant of arrest is issued and, subsequently even with that, he refused to turn up in court before the Police decides to take action and you say we should be lenient to them. I think we should be very careful about suggesting this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we mitigate the impact of this new law on such people? The suggestion by Dr Arthur Beng is that perhaps URA give them time and work out an instalment plan, and HDB also does the same thing, I think, yes, we can ask them to consider. We can ask both authorities to consider working out an instalment plan for such people who voluntarily turn up at the URA or HDB office and say, \"I have this summons. Please, I can't pay now, but can you let me pay by two, three instalments or whatever?\" I believe those of us who have dealt with such cases will know that HDB and URA have been very accommodating. They have allowed these people to pay by instalments. It is only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when they still default that they finally land themselves in court. And this person who accumulated 166 warrants of arrest is one such case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask URA and HDB to give the list of offenders to the MPs, I could suggest to them. But I am not sure if every MP wants to be burdened with this. On average, it will be about 7,000 such persons in every constituency. If you are prepared to do that, I think HDB and URA will be prepared to oblige. But I am not sure that MPs want to take on this role. I think these people who have accumulated the fines should take this law as the final warning to them and better get to the offices of URA and HDB quickly and pay up before the law catches up with them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I just ask the Minister a further question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, one clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Dr Arthur Beng has suggested one solution, ie, to allow these offenders to pay by instalment. I have another suggestion. Before this law comes into being, perhaps the Minister should consider giving an amnesty to these two million-odd people who have outstanding car parking fines. Why not? I think this is an election year and it will be good. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> How do you know? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think this is a one-off thing and I would hope that the Minister will consider it. Because it will also come out with a clean slate. Whatever way you do it, you cannot deal with these two million offenders. It will always be on record. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Two million people were given notices or summonses by the URA and HDB. Most of them paid up. By the time they get a third reminder, only 3% refused to respond and were given such warrants of arrest. So we do not have two million people waiting to be given this notice. Actually, this should be the final notice to all these people who have outstanding warrants of arrest to turn up and settle with the URA and HDB. For all the others, if they have committed an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> offence, they have to pay for it. That is the only way. You must pay for what you have committed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, can I ask a question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You want to seek clarification on the Minister's speech, yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen:</b> Yes.

Because I think there are insufficient heavy vehicle parking lots. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not have the breakdown of offences committed by drivers of heavy vehicles, small vehicles, motorcyclists and the lot. They are all parking offences. To say that we do not have enough heavy vehicle parking lots, again, is missing the point. The point is that an offence has been committed and a summons given and he should pay the fine. If they know that they would commit an offence that they should not do it, they do not do it. If they think they cannot find a place to park in an HDB car park, find another place where heavy vehicles are allowed to park. And then take a bus or whatever it is to get back home. Having no car park lots next to your block is no excuse for committing a parking offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.08 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, I informed the House that the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme will be revised so as to better prepare CPF members for a longer retirement period. The Bill before the House seeks, among \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> other things, to amend the CPF Act to effect the changes to the Minimum Sum Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, CPF members who continue working after reaching 55 may make lump sum withdrawals of CPF savings, made after 55, at 3-year intervals. Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Act to require CPF members who are unable to set aside the full Minimum Sum at age 55 to top up their Minimum Sum before they are allowed to withdraw lump-sum any CPF contributions made after the age of 55. Nevertheless, such members will always be able to withdraw at least half of their cash savings accumulated during the 3-year period. In other words, every CPF member who continues working after the age of 55 will always be able to withdraw some cash amount three years after they have reached the age of 55, ie, at the age of 58, even if they are not able to meet the full Minimum Sum requirement. It also requires a CPF member and his spouse who wish to jointly set aside 1(r) times the Minimum Sum to irrevocably nominate each other to be the beneficiary of their Minimum Sum. This provision will ensure that the surviving CPF member will not end up having less than the full Minimum Sum when the spouse dies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 4 also allows the Minister to raise the age at which withdrawal of the monthly amount commences to correspond with the prevailing retirement age. The present retirement age is 60 introduced since July 1993. This will be gradually raised to 67 over the next 10 years. Pegging the monthly withdrawal age to the prevailing retirement age is necessary in order to ensure that the Minimum Sum can last the duration of a CPF member's retirement. Also included in the clause is a provision to allow CPF members who have not attained the prevailing retirement age to begin withdrawing from their Minimum Sum if they are physically or mentally incapacitated from ever continuing in any employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate in March this year, I informed the House that my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Ministry will study the implications of allowing CPF members to use their CPF savings to top up their spouses' Minimum Sum. I am pleased to inform the House that the Ministry has since concluded its review and decided that this should be allowed just as we already allow CPF members to use their CPF savings to top up their parents' Minimum Sum requirement. Clauses 5 and 6 amend the Act to provide for this. The provision will help spouses with low or no CPF savings to set aside a minimum sum for their retirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clauses of the Bill contain amendments that are not related to the revised Minimum Sum Scheme. I shall highlight the more significant ones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in clauses 7 and 8 have the effect of raising the upper age limit from the present 55 to 60 years for CPF members covered under the Home Protection Insurance Scheme. The upper age limit was set at 55 as it was then the common retirement age. However, as we have legislated that the retirement age should be set at 60 now, it would be logical to raise the age limit to 60. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends the Act to similarly raise the upper age limit of the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme from the present 55 to 60 years. It also sets 16 years as the lower age limit of the Scheme as it is not the intention of the Scheme to cover young persons who have no dependants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the Home Protection Insurance Scheme and the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme will require payment of additional premiums. However, the additional period of protection for the families and dependants of CPF members will be well worth the premium increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 3 and 11 of the Bill amend the Act to allow CPF members to use their Medisave to pay premiums of a medical insurance approved by the Minister for Health. One such insurance scheme will be the IncomeShield. The intention is to allow CPF members to use their Medisave to pay premiums for IncomeShield insurance cover commencing from 1st \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> July 1994. 1st July 1994 is also the date of implementation of MediShield Plus. Hence, these clauses shall be deemed to have come into operation retrospectively from that date, as provided in clause 1 of this Bill. This will allow regulations made under the enabling provisions of these clauses to be brought into effect retrospectively from 1st July 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the amendment to section 18 of the Central Provident Fund Act, I am happy to note that the Minister has accepted the suggestion made by one of the members of the Labour GPC, Mr Chng Hee Kok, during the debate on the Minimum Sum for the extension of the existing provision to cover spouses. Sir, I hope that the Minister will now take up with the Minister for Finance for cash top-up of spouses' account to be granted tax exempt status. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also happy to note that section 30(5) of the Act will be amended to raise the age for members eligible to join the Home Protection Insurance Scheme to 60 years or above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similarly for the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme, the amendment to paragraph (a) of section 42(2) of the main Act. Here, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for a clarification whether the age will be raised subsequently to keep pace with the raising of the retirement age in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask another clarification on clause 5 of the Amendment Bill. I would like to know whether there will be any limits imposed on the amount which can be transferred to the parent's or spouse's account, especially if the member has adequate funds to cover his own needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, on the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, I would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider extending the scheme to cover mortgages of private properties, ie, loans taken from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sources other than the housing authority as defined in the principal Act. Sir, if it is felt that the mortgages of these properties may be too high, perhaps a limit could be set for a start, say, an amount not exceeding $300,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I congratulate the Minister for proposing the amendment to section 15 by introducing subsection (6A) which requires that if a joint account of a Minimum Sum is set up by a husband and wife, the CPF Board will permit that sum to be reduced to 1 1/2 times the Minimum Sum if they each execute a memorandum under section 26(1) nominating each other to receive the amount of the Minimum Sum belonging to either party on the death of the other party. I would urge the Minister not to stop here but to go one step further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that in all cases where a CPF member is married, he or she should be required to execute a memorandum under section 26(1) nominating the other spouse to receive the amount of the Minimum Sum belonging to the party on the death of that party. The procedure should be the same, whether only the husband or the wife or both parties are members of the Board, and whether or not there are one or two accounts for the Minimum Sum, or whether there is a joint account. In each case, the CPF member should be required to execute a memorandum nominating the spouse as the beneficiary of the Minimum Sum. If a member dies before the age of 55, the whole of the CPF account can go to his or her nominee, as the situation is at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am suggesting is that after withdrawing the CPF account at 55 years of age, the law should step in to make sure that the entitlement to the Minimum Sum after the member's death should go to the remaining spouse and not to any other nominated person. This amendment would reflect the CPF member's personal responsibility towards the financial maintenance of the remaining elderly spouse. We cannot leave the responsibility of looking after the aged only on the children, but it should be shared, wherever possible, by a husband or wife \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who constitute a couple and have the means to do so through the Minimum Sum in the CPF account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not institute this proposed amendment, then the following scenario is possible. Let us look at an example where only the husband is working and the wife is not working for a wage. He withdraws his CPF account at 55, leaving the required Minimum Sum behind. He then unwisely spends his money on the proverbial wine, women and song, and even takes out a mortgage on his home. He then dies an untimely death, after having named the mistress as the nominee to whom the Minimum Sum in the CPF account will go to. In such a case, would it be right that we institute a law, like the proposed Maintenance of Parents Bill, requiring the children to maintain their parents if we have not even ensured the responsibility of one elderly spouse to another? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have a golden opportunity now to amend the CPF Act to ensure that the financial responsibility of looking after the elderly husband or wife is shared, wherever possible, by the couple themselves before expecting the children or the community to shoulder that responsibility. I would urge the Minister to agree to this amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank Encik Othman Haron Eusofe, Chairman of the GPC for Labour, for his support. He raised the question of whether I would continue to pursue this idea of making cash top-up under the Minimum Sum Scheme by CPF members to their parents' or spouses' CPF accounts to be tax exempt. I think this is a matter that really has got to be pursued further with the Ministry of Finance and I would urge the Member to also take it up directly with the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether there is a limit on the amount of top-up that would be allowed by a CPF member who wants to top up his spouse's Minimum Sum account. The way we allow this top-up is to ensure first that the CPF member who is proposing to make such top-up has at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> least twice the Minimum Sum requirement in his account that allows him to set aside his own Minimum Sum requirement and then have another half of his CPF cash balance available. He can then use his excess CPF savings to top up the Minimum Sum account for his parents or his spouse. The maximum topping up that is allowed is the difference between the prevailing Minimum Sum amount and the recipient's CPF balance at the age of 55 before any lump sum withdrawal has been made. That is the limit. In other words, you can only top up your parent's or your spouse's account to the Minimum Sum requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked, under clause 9, which concerns the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme, whether the upper age limit for coverage under the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme will be raised when the retirement age is revised in the future. The answer is yes, the upper age limit for the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme will be raised whenever the retirement age is revised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, Encik Othman has asked whether we will consider enabling private property owners to also seek insurance coverage under the Home Protection Insurance Scheme and he suggests that maybe we set a limit to the coverage of, say, $300,000. Sir, the intention is not to allow private property owners to come under the coverage of the Home Protection Insurance Scheme. The reason is that mortgages for private property can be very high. In today's real estate market, the mortgages for private property could easily exceed a million dollars or more. And if you provide coverage even for a fixed limit, whether it is $200,000 or $300,000, you would still not satisfy the needs of the CPF members who have bought private property. You will only be partially meeting the needs of these members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if you allow a full coverage under the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, you expose the scheme to risks of very hefty claim, many times more than the claims that would be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> made for HDB flats. This could result in the need to raise the insurance premium in order to ensure that the scheme itself is viable and can be continued to be funded in the long term. If you do that, it would be a disadvantage to many lower income owners of HDB flats. Generally, those who own private properties are professionals and others who are in the middle or upper income group and they can well afford to insure their properties with private insurance companies if they wish to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to Dr Soin's comments. She is suggesting that we go beyond just making those who set aside 1 1/2 times the Minimum Sum amount in a joint account to make it automatic that the CPF member must nominate as beneficiary his or her surviving spouse, including those without CPF accounts. We have not done so because there are many circumstances under which this may be contrary to the wishes of the CPF member himself or herself because some CPF members may still want to leave part of their CPF savings to their parents, some may want to leave part of it to their siblings, brothers and sisters. I think it is very difficult for us to envisage all these situations and make it compulsory that as soon as you are married, all your CPF savings automatically go in full to your spouse. We would prefer to encourage CPF members, once they are married, to immediately review their nomination for beneficiary and this is what CPF routinely does in its statement of account to members by asking: Have you updated your nomination? Many people do, in fact, become CPF members before they are married. So for those who are recently married, they should take note of this advice from the CPF Board and take the necessary step, which is a very simple step, of nominating their spouse as beneficiary by just submitting another nomination form to the Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion is to ensure that the Minimum Sum will go to the spouse after 55 years of age. If they are both working, then they would have to set aside 1 1/2 times of the Minimum Sum which is required by law. Of course, they could set aside separately, each one a full Minimum Sum, but, in most cases, people will opt to set aside 1 1/2 times. With this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amendment, it would result in the surviving spouse receiving a minimum of the full Minimum Sum. In most cases, they may even get the 1 1/2 times. In exceptional circumstances, they would still be protected by having access to the full Minimum Sum. That is the purpose of this amendment: to ensure that every surviving spouse will have at least the full Minimum Sum and not be left without anything or less than the full Minimum Sum. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In arguing for the spouses to be automatically legislated as being the beneficiary of the spouse's CPF savings, Dr Soin mentioned about the legislation for children to maintain their parents and, therefore, we should also make it a law to require the spouse to maintain their surviving member. Here, there is a slight difference in that although the legislation, which will be discussed in this Chamber later, argues for a principle that the children will be required to maintain their parents, it is not so clear-cut because the issue still has to be settled in a court of law. The proposal by the Nominated Member is an enabling provision. It should be settled in a court of law. Whether the child should be required to pay maintenance, and how much and how often should the maintenance be given, all these have to be settled in court. The proposition is that there should be a legal basis on which the parents can make the claim. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of CPF, I think it will be very difficult for us to make an exclusive legislation to say that all the deceased CPF member's savings should automatically go to the spouse. We would have to leave it to the CPF member to make the nomination for his beneficiary. We can protect the spouse, in this case, through the Minimum Sum Scheme, to ensure that there is an irrevocable nomination if they choose to benefit by setting aside less than the normal amount of the Minimum Sum. But apart from that, I think it will be extremely difficult to argue that we should insist that they set aside all their CPF savings for the needs of the surviving spouse. Because, as I said earlier on, there may well be cases where CPF members do want to leave behind part of their CPF \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> savings for their parents or for their siblings. So it is very difficult for us to interfere in such a situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Clarification, Sir. Maybe I did not make my point clear. I was not talking about nominating for the full CPF account. On that point, I said that a member could leave the nomination as it is where a member could decide who he or she wants to nominate. I was referring only to the nomination for the Minimum Sum amount, that is, after withdrawing the amount at 55, whatever is left by law for the Minimum Sum amount, that should, by legislation, go to the elderly spouse. From what I can see, Mr Speaker, Sir, by having subsection (6A), you are protecting a couple where both of them are working, but you are not protecting a spouse who is not working. If her husband is working and she is not working, she does not have an account and the one-and-a-half times do not apply to her. And she, in that case, may be left high and dry if that Minimum Sum does not go to her. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing about the rest of the CPF account which can be left to siblings or parents. I am only requesting for that amount in the Minimum Sum which by that time both spouses will be elderly. They will be just around 50. If the man is 55, the woman will be around 50 as well. So that is what I am urging the Minister to look into. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under that scenario, I think, in most cases, elderly CPF members would have nominated their non-working spouses to be the beneficiary of whatever residual CPF savings that they have. I do not think there is a need at this juncture to make this a compulsory requirement. What we can do, as I have said earlier on, is to continue to remind CPF members that if there has been a change in marital status, they must always update their nomination forms. Because, in fact, many people, before they were married, do nominate their parents or siblings as beneficiaries of their CPF savings. But once they are married, we constantly remind them that this is the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time for them to amend their nomination and to register that they now want to nominate the wife. And if it is the case, then, for most CPF members, they will have no difficulty in ensuring that the residual amount of CPF savings in their Minimum Sum account goes to the surviving spouse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a need to make this a requirement in legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Minister tell me what would be the disadvantage? Because we are just making sure that the elderly spouse does not then become a burden on the community. What would be the disadvantage of making sure that the man who is working outside the home is looking after the wife who has stayed at home and has not worked and does not have even the Minimum Sum to cover her? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that this is in their ethos, responsibility for your family members, and not trying to be a burden on the state. I would urge the Minister that this would be something that is worth looking into. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while there may not be an immediate disadvantage, I think we should be careful about imposing such a rigid requirement on all CPF members. It may be advantageous from the Nominated Member's point of view. But we should not jump to the conclusion that that is something that ought to be done immediately. As I said, there is nothing existing in law to stop CPF members, particularly older CPF members, from nominating their spouse as recipient of the CPF savings or the Minimum Sum amount. There is nothing to stop it and the CPF Board constantly reminds members about their obligations to update their nomination of beneficiaries. So we should leave it at that at this juncture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MERCHANT SHIPPING (OIL POLLUTION) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a party to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, otherwise known as CLC 69. This Convention seeks to unify the legal regime in respect of shipowners' liability with regard to oil pollution damage. It imposes a strict liability on an owner for any damage caused by the discharge or escape of oil from a ship which is carrying oil in bulk. It also allows the owner of a ship to limit his liability if the discharge or escape occurred without his actual fault or privity. The owner can limit his liability to an upper limit of 14 million SDR (which is equivalent to about S$30 million). The owner of the ship which carries more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk is also required to have insurance coverage for his liability under this Convention. The Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act (Cap. 180 of the 1985 Revised Edition) gives effect to this Convention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rules of private international law, it is possible for a judgement creditor to have a foreign judgement recognised and enforced in Singapore courts. In such a case, the limits of the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act do not apply. The Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) (Amendment) Bill is intended to remedy this lacuna in our law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop and promote Singapore as an international maritime centre, we need to provide a stable and predictable environment for shipowners to operate from. Otherwise, it sets back our effort to encourage shipowners to relocate to Singapore. It might also encourage existing owners to look elsewhere for a more conducive base for their operations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act is amended by inserting a new section immediately after section 16 to provide that any judgement given against any \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shipowner for any oil pollution damage by a Court in a country which is not a party to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (or CLC 69), which was signed in Brussels in 1969, may be recognised and enforced by a court in Singapore only up to the limit of liability prescribed by section 6 of the Act which are the limits prescribed under the CLC 69. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REPORT OF COMMISSION ON PARLIAMENT STAFF</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc. 4 of 1994, accepts the recommendations of the Commission as contained in paragraph 8 thereof and resolves in accordance with such recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the announcement in December 1993 of the revision of salaries in the public service, a Commission consisting of the Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission and myself was set up in accordance with Article 51(6) of the Constitution of Singapore to advise on the application of the revised salaries to the staff of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has presented its report to Parliament.

The House is asked to accept and approve the recommendations of the Commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the staff of Parliament have served us well and I hope that all Members will support this motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc. 4 of 1994, accepts the recommendations of the Commission as contained in paragraph 8 thereof and resolves in accordance with such recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEPARTMENTAL TITLES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 77), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n       Old Title or                      New Title or\r\n\r\n       Name of Office                    Name of Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Permanent Secretary,               Permanent Secretary,\r\n\r\n      Ministry of Finance                Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\n      (Public Service Division)\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Service Division of the Ministry of Finance was transferred to the Prime Minister's Office with effect from 1st June 1994.

Rather than amend each of the affected written laws, contracts and Instruction Manuals, the Attorney-General \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> has advised that the change in the title of the office may be effected by resolution of Parliament under the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 77).

The amount is expected to increase by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 3.4% a year to 10,500 tonnes by the year 2010. Only 85% of the refuse can be incinerated. The non-incinerable refuse and the ash from the incineration plant are currently disposed of at the landfill at Lorong Halus. This landfill is expected to be used up by 1998. As there is no more suitable land for the development of landfill in Singapore, suitable landfill sites have to be found offshore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An offshore landfill is required to be developed on a 347-hectare site in the seabed east of Pulau Semakau. It will have a holding capacity of 63.2 million cubic metres and is estimated to cost $1.36 billion to develop. Reclamation of land would be required for this landfill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offshore landfill would be developed in three phases. Phase One involves the construction of the entire perimeter bund around the 347-hectare landfill site, a refuse transfer station at Tuas and a refuse receiving station and other supporting facilities at the offshore landfill. Work on Phase One is scheduled to commence later this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landfill is expected to be operational by 1999 and is estimated to last us up to the year 2045.

Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may have read in the media the views that have been expressed since the Bill was introduced. Some critics have said that this Bill does nothing to promote filial piety. They are absolutely right. This Bill has got nothing to do with filial piety at all. The law cannot legislate filial piety any more than it can legislate love between husbands and wives or parents and children. The aim of the Bill is to provide a safety net if filial piety fails. It is not meant to be a replacement for filial piety. It is not meant to be the only solution to social problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, all people should be financially independent when they cease to be economically active. But we know this is impossible to achieve in practice. There will always be a certain number of people who do not have enough CPF, who do not have enough savings, who do not have enough investments. And short of outright welfare, these people will have to rely on others to tide them over. Ideally, people with families should get the support they need in their old age from their families, freely given out of love and respect, not compelled by law. But I think, again, that human nature being what it is, there will always be a few who will not live up to their moral responsibilities and who will not support their aged parents unless they are compelled to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is not aimed at the majority of Singaporeans who know their duty, who know where morals point and who support and love their parents without having to be told. The Bill is aimed at that recalcitrant small minority that cannot be counted on to do what is right, and therefore it will not affect the vast majority of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is one of principle: should children support their parents? This is not as self-evident as it sounds, because in the past few months, as I have been talking to people and as I have been watching the debate in the media, we find views expressed that children did not ask to be born and therefore owe no duty to their parents. I do not know how widespread this view is, but evidently some people do subscribe to it. If you take the view that children did not ask to be born and therefore owe nothing to their parents, then of course you do not support this Bill at all and we have nothing else to talk about, because we start from different premises. But like me, if you do start from the premise that, yes, children should support their parents, then the next question is: should there be a choice about it? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, I was at a forum organised by the Singapore International Foundation. There was a young lady there who said that parents should have a choice about whether they support their children or not and children should have a choice about whether they support their parents. The young lady was educated in a good university - I would not say which one - but she did say that. The view was expressed that some people feel there should be a choice about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take that view that there should be a choice, the next question is: what happens to those parents whose children choose not to support them? As things presently stand, if a person does not have the means to support himself, there are three things he can do. He can get a job and work till he dies. He can go on public assistance or rely on the charity of strangers. Or he can starve quietly and with dignity and not complain. None of these, I suggest, is acceptable in any civilized society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have expressed the view that it is not the individual who is responsible for his parents. It should be the State. The State should take this over. The State should pay an allowance. The State should maintain the old. No doubt this is a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> very seductive thing. But many people tend to forget that the State is not just a metaphysical entity. In the end, the bill comes to each and every one of us who has to pay taxes. So whether we pay directly to our own parents or pay indirectly through higher taxes, eventually we are going to pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there really a problem? Some people have expressed the view that there isn't a problem, that we do not see a lot of people being neglected by their children. That depends on how you define \"problem\". I think there is a danger in looking at things from a bald statistical point of view and not looking at the human element behind it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Council on the Aged was set up in 1989 and it reported to the Prime Minister. In its Report, it said that by the year 2000, we should have about 332,000 people over 60. It said in that Report in 1989 that there is an average of six people a year who claim to be rejected by their children. It said in that Report that 95% of those without their own income received contributions from their family. My question is: what about those 5% who do not receive contributions from their family? What about those 5%? What if someone comes to you at your meet-the-people session or goes to the Legal Aid Bureau and says, \"I've spent my money educating my son or my daughter. And now they refuse to give me anything. I can't make ends meet.\" You tell them, \"Go away. I am sorry. There's not enough of you. You are not a problem.\" Is that a response you make to them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do such people exist? I do not have a constituency to look after, but I have had people come to me. Just a year or so ago, somebody did write to me, a person who is physically disabled and is living on capital. She has a son who is working but he is not giving her anything. So such people do exist in our society. They exist in any society. To pretend that we have a perfect Confucian society or perfect Christian society or perfect Islamic society or perfect Hindu society is to fool ourselves. Even in states which are more conservative than us, there are laws that enshrine this moral duty. Taiwan, for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> example, has it in its Civil Code. India has it in its Criminal Procedure Code. Israel has a law. Many countries have these things. These are countries where perhaps people are much more conservative than us about these matters. So I do not think we can pretend that there is no problem or that there will never be a problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the numbers, 332,000 over 60 by the year 2000. If we say that 5% of this number will not get contributions from their families and are expected to live off their own resources, 5% of 332,000 is 15,000 people. Will things get better or will things get worse? Well, if things get better, then obviously we do not need the law. But can we be sure that things will get better and that we can in fact reach out to everyone and make sure that they do comply with their moral obligations? If there were some way to guarantee this, we do not need the law. But I do not think, human nature being what it is, that we can actually guarantee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does this particular law work? Let me explain, if I may, what I have done. Since I have no authority to speak on behalf of the Government, I have not tried to create a new system that will commit the Government to greater spending. I have tried to draft the Bill within what can be done without extra expenditure. And I have modelled the provisions on the provisions in the Women's Charter for maintenance of wives and children, because it does not seem to me to be cost effective to try and create an entirely new structure just for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have expressed the fear that this kind of law will lead to a sort of share-the-wealth syndrome. The parents may think, \"Well, you know, so-and-so got 20% of his child's income. Therefore, I am entitled to 20%.\" But I think they misunderstand how it works. The key is that if you are unable to maintain yourself adequately, you can apply. You have to be unable to maintain yourself adequately. If you are rich and can maintain yourself, no matter what kind of problem you have between yourself and your children, the law is not there to help you. It is for those who are unable for whatever reason to maintain themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point. You go to court, you ask for an order against your children. The court has to be convinced that it is just and equitable that your children maintain you. In other words, not an absolute obligation. The court must be convinced that it is just and equitable. There are some things like, for example, the parent has neglected his child in childhood, abandoned his child, abused his child, which make it inequitable for the child now to maintain the parent. Or the step-parent may ask for maintenance from his step-child. There are some step-parents who are very good step-parents and may deserve to be maintained. But there are others who do not deserve to be maintained. To try and legislate to cover every single eventuality is to make the law rigid. The court is asked to make the decision, to look at the circumstances and to consider what is just. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the court has to balance the means of the applicant against the means of the person from whom maintenance is sought. So there is no lump sum, no fixed percentage. It is a question of balancing. The child against whom maintenance is sought has his own responsibilities - responsibilities to his spouse, responsibilities to his children and he may not be able to afford it. If we fix a lump sum irregardless of means, you might have unjust situations. So it is a balancing process. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts do this all the time when they fix maintenance for children, when they fix maintenance for wives. Because when somebody goes to court and says, \"I need maintenance for my children\", the court has to look at the means of the respondent before it makes an order. If the order is unrealistic, there is provision for variation, as there is in this Bill. And circumstances do change. So there is provision for variation in this Bill as well. It is not like the order is made once and forever and there is no possibility of change. If a person disagrees with the quantum, there is an appeal to a higher court. So there are safeguards there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I would like to make is that the maintenance should not be put on just one of the children. It is on all of a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> person's children. Therefore, there is provision in the Bill to allow a person against whom a maintenance order is sought to join siblings. This may create a bit of controversy and this can be discussed in this House. But, on principle, I do not think it is fair that only one child should bear the burden to the exclusion of others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several objections have been raised regarding this Bill. One commentator says it is undignified for a parent to take his children to court. I wonder if it is more undignified for the parent to apply for public assistance when he has children, or to ask for charity when he has children. Which is more undignified? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that it is bad for our image, that somehow it implies that we have failed as a society. Again, I am not sure that this is a valid criticism. It is because we recognise that there will be some who cannot be trusted that we put in this law. Putting in this law does not mean that the majority of Singaporeans are bad children. It means that we do recognise that there may be some people who cannot be trusted to live up to morality. It says nothing about society as a whole. And if you look at other countries - we are not the first to have such a law - even the United Kingdom had a law from 1601 to 1967 which placed the responsibility for maintenance of parents upon children. For their own reasons, they repealed it in 1967. Their moral climate has changed. Their social climate has changed. But that does not necessarily mean that the society has become worse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have said that it will weaken the bond between parents and children. I ask hon. Members to think about this very carefully. If you have a good relationship with your parents, will your parents go after you in court for money? If your parents know that you love them, are they going to sue you? It is only in families where the bond has already broken down that there is a possibility of litigation. So having such a law is not going to weaken strong bonds. It is only those situations where there is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> already some sort of bad feeling between parents and children that you might have a situation where these people would go to court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have expressed the view that this will lead to more litigation, but I think that is to miss the point of legislation like this. Israel has had such legislation for a long time and their experience shows that very few people actually end up in court. But that does not mean that the legislation is useless. Let me explain. At present, if a son refuses to support his father, there is nothing the father can do about it. The father can go to the Ministry of Community Development or he can go to clan elders and ask them to mediate. But at the end of the day the son knows that, no matter what the mediator does, he cannot do anything to him. He does not have to listen to mediators. He does not even have to let them in at the door. There is nothing the parent can threaten him with. So what do parents do? I suppose they resort to theatrics - camping outside their children's door, living in cardboard boxes. Why? Because there is no other recourse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was a law that allowed a parent to apply for maintenance, do you seriously think that anybody would say: Sue and be damned! Would they do that? The embarrassment of being taken to court, I think, would be sufficient to induce the most recalcitrant person to pay up rather than to suffer the indignity of a public trial. So the fact that the law exists is some assurance that it will not have to be invoked too much. Right now the mediator has no teeth. He cannot do anything. He can plead, he can beg, he can cajole, but he cannot force. If you have such a law, the mediator can go to the recalcitrant son and say, \"Look, we do not want to sue you, your parents do not want to sue you, but if you force them, you make them desperate, then the alternative is to go to court.\" I think there would be very few children who will risk this and say, \"Sue and be damned. I do not care.\" So you should not judge the law on the basis of how few cases. I do not think there will be an outburst of litigation. In fact, I hope very much that there will be no litigation on this law because that will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> show either that everybody is being cared for by their children or, secondly, there is no need for people to become desperate enough to seek legal recourse. But that does not mean that we do not need the law because you have to give some teeth to the mediators to bargain with the recalcitrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some people said that no one will use it. Some people will say, \"Society being what it is like, no one is going to go to court and use this law.\" People say this like it is self-evident. I do not think it is self-evident. On Saturday, the Straits Times published a poll. 660 people were polled, I believe, and 9% said they might invoke it. 9% out of 660, that is about 60 of them, and 9% spread over 300,000 is 27,000. I do not think the figures are as bad as they look but this is just straight-line projection. But to say that nobody will use it is actually begging the question. We do not know how many people will use it. Hopefully, nobody will use it. But if anybody has to use it, it is there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a better way to do this? Well, I am fully conscious of my limitations in drafting a law like this. If there is a better way, I will be happy to hear it. I do not propose to put the motion that this Bill be carried today. I propose that it should go before a Select Committee where at least we can have the benefit of the collective wisdom of Parliament on the point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully conscious that my term ends on 7th September 1994 and I had hoped that the Bill would have been introduced in April. But, as it was, there was no reading in April, hence the rather tight schedule. Please do not misunderstand me. It has to go before a Select Committee because it has raised such public concerns. If I am not reappointed, it does not necessarily mean that the Bill fails because there is no rule that says that the person who introduces the Bill has to be around to take it through the Third Reading. So if I am not around, then anybody else can pick up the baton where it falls and take it over to the finish line. But I think it is essential that it does go before a Select Committee. People should have a fair shot at saying what they feel about this Bill, apart from the newspapers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me ask: what does it cost us to pass this Bill? If the critics are right and everyone in Singapore is going to be looked after by their children without a law forever and ever, what have we lost by passing the Bill? It does not involve society in more litigation. It does not create a new level of bureaucracy. In fact, this kind of law does not affect most people any more than the law that requires parents to maintain their children affect most people. So even if only one person benefits from it, may I say to hon. Members that the effort is worth it. It is worth it just for that one person. If it helps more than one person, then all the better. So I ask hon. Members to think carefully about the principle of the Bill. No doubt, Members may have many suggestions but, hopefully, this Bill will go before a Select Committee where the suggestions can be considered. So if you feel that on principle and on balance that it might do more good for those people who would not otherwise have any recourse, I ask that you vote in favour of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under discussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until 5.00 pm. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MAINTENANCE OF PARENTS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that I am very glad that this Maintenance of Parents Bill has received widespread attention among Singaporeans. It has been debated extensively, in private and in public, and today in this House. It is only through such frank discussions and debates that we can try to build a consensus on an issue that governs the very basic social relationship - that between a parent and a child. The Feedback Unit recently conducted a straw poll among 100 people to obtain their feedback on this Bill. The sample was fairly represented in terms of race and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> age. 67% supported the Bill.

This shows that people are still rational. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether or not to support this Bill, we have to be very clear of the objective. First, let me touch on an area of growing concern for Singapore and which is fundamental to an understanding of the Bill. This is the reality of an ageing population which is inevitable. With improvements in nutrition, a healthy lifestyle, good health care, the life expectancy of the population is now longer. Not only do the elderly live longer, but their numbers will also grow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has great respect for the elderly because of their wisdom and experience. In private, this respect manifests itself in filial piety. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that I believe that filial piety is still strong among Singaporeans and as supported by figures from two recent surveys. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first survey, commissioned by the Singapore Press Holdings, reveals that 82% of working adults give money to their parents, and 81% will ask their parents to live with them if their parents are sick and had no one to look after them. 86% of the elderly parents interviewed say that they receive monthly allowances from their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second survey was carried out by NTUC on unionised female workers. The findings confirm the premium placed on a 3-tier family living together. Firstly, because it reinforces family values and, secondly, it is less costly. 86% of the married respondents give money to their parents and/or parents-in-law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, Mr Speaker, Sir, filial piety is alive and well. Why is the Bill necessary then? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us first of all look at what the Bill aims to do. Some Singaporeans do not support this Bill because they feel that we should not, and indeed cannot, enforce filial piety by law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> They feel that filial piety is a natural human emotion. They are also afraid that this Bill will induce our young to think that maintaining parents is a legal requirement, not a moral obligation. I sympathise with these reservations. Filial piety is an intangible emotion. I believe that filial piety is a moral obligation. It is part of the broader spirit of mutual help and support within a family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the general view that to strengthen the family unit and strong family relations, there should be more emphasis on moral education and good social behaviour. We have to inculcate the correct social and family values among our young at home, in school, and through the mass media. This is why we have identified and promoted the five core family values. This is why my colleagues in this House are extremely concerned about the kinds of programmes that are televised over SBC and the values they spread. This is also why, time and again, we have emphasized the importance of devoting more resources and curriculum time to teaching moral education in our schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if the survey results which I have mentioned earlier show that most Singaporeans believe in filial piety, why then must we introduce this Bill? Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately our society is not a perfect one. There will always be irresponsible and unfilial children who abandon their aged parents. This law will provide a means as a last resort for these abandoned parents to seek assistance. Let me give some examples. At my meet-the-people session, some elderly people have complained that their children refused to care for them. I referred the case to the Ministry of Community Development but the children refused to attend the counselling session provided. A nun from a home for the aged told me that there are those in the home whose children are high wage earners but who never visited their aged parents. Some have even stopped paying their dues to the home. What should we do in such cases? Should the homes for the aged themselves be forced to finance these cases or should the taxpayers bear the burden? It is at this uncaring minority that this Bill is targeted, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not at the filial majority. Some of us worry that, because of the law, children will only take care of their parents because they are legally obliged to do so but not out of genuine care and affection. I disagree with this view. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we all know that there are provisions in the Women's Charter and the Children and Young Persons Act that bind parents to maintain their children legally. Although these laws have existed for quite some time, the majority of parents take care of their children because they love them, not because it is a legal requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, most children will take care of their parents whom they love and respect. This Bill will not undermine the loving relationship most children have with their parents. In most families, parents care for and bring up their children. Grown-up children reciprocate and care for their parents when their parents grow old and are financially less secure. This behaviour is the cornerstone of our Asian family values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to separate the debate on how to strengthen family relationship from the true merits of this Bill. It is true that the Bill is not meant to strengthen the family unit which can only be done through schools and social and family education. This Bill, like the majority of our laws, exists as a deterrent, for example, the Penal Code and other laws. We are not offended by the existence of such laws because we know we are not going to break them. But the Penal Code and other laws are there to deter undesirable and anti-social behaviour. Likewise, we should not be unduly alarmed by the proposed Bill because it will not affect most of us. Also, to be fair to the children, the proposed Bill does not protect irresponsible parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand when a law concerns the individual relationship it is always a sensitive issue. In fact, some countries like Taiwan, Canada, France and Israel have this kind of laws for quite some time. Let me cite you the example of Israel. Since 1959, there has been in existence in Israel a law that binds a person to maintain his family. This does not mean just his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> children, but his parents, grandparents and his siblings as well. But does this mean that the Israelis lack strong family values? No. The family unit in Israel is very strong. In fact, Israel's socio-cultural and religious values converge to strengthen family relationships and values. Having these values in the law does not mean the Israelis lack them. Instead, the law emphasises the importance of these values by enshrining them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what exactly does the Bill aim to do? In my view, this Bill merely seeks to give some protection to any parent who is abandoned by his children. This Bill gives such a parent the last resort to appeal to the court of law to claim a reasonable amount of maintenance from his children. Besides providing this safety net for the aged, the Bill also serves as a deterrent to children who are persistently unfilial. The proposed Bill does not protect irresponsible parents who did not take care of their children in the past. Clause 5(3) of the proposed Bill states that if the parent has previously abandoned, abused or neglected his child or children, the court may dismiss his application for maintenance or reduce the quantum of maintenance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support the Maintenance of Parents Bill. However, we need to make some refinements to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Asian context, some parents may be reluctant to sue their children in court because they are embarrassed to wash dirty linen in public. In view of this, I would like to suggest that for these parents, an alternate route be provided. I would propose that a Commissioner be appointed who can take up these cases on behalf of the parents. This Commissioner, who will play an important role in assisting these parents, should be strongly supported by a secretariat. Such a Commissioner should have the power to act when approached by aggrieved parents, and the Commissioner should also have the power to act when he has knowledge of any deserving case. In both situations, the Commissioner will have the opportunity to adopt a softer approach such as counselling parent and child to resolve the problem, or reach settlement \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> out of court. The case should be taken to court only if the child remains stubborn despite all efforts to find an amicable settlement. Thus, legal proceedings should only be a last resort. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments take into consideration the sensitivities of the parties involved, and make the Bill more acceptable to the public in general. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to concede that the abandoned aged is more in number today. But we are faced with the reality of an aging population. Let us have the foresight and courage to enact a law that deters acts of gross filial impiety because it goes against the very core of the values on which the family unit stands. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, law should be enacted only when there is absolute necessity. You will recall at the last Budget debate, the Minister for Education, in answer to a call to introduce compulsory education, justified the non-legislation on the ground that the percentage of dropouts in school was very low. Therefore, there is really no necessity for a law to enforce compulsory education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attempt at legislation for provision for the maintenance of parents was made in 1984 by the Committee on the Problems of the Aged. Four years later, in 1988, the Advisory Council again put up recommendations for the introduction of this provision. On both occasions, the Government did not accept this recommendation on the simple ground that from statistics, the number of parents being abandoned by their children was very negligible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we consider introducing this new Bill, what should be the criterion? Should we follow the criterion, as adopted by the Government on the two previous occasions, that there are insufficient cases of this nature for the Bill to be introduced? We have no statistics to say that there is in fact an increase in the number of parents abandoned by their children. In fact, from newspaper report, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the 1,500 old folks in the voluntary welfare organisations, there was not a single case of parents being abandoned by their children. In fact, the Director of the Counselling and Care Centre, who has been a welfare worker for the last 22 years, said that he could not recall a single case of parents being abandoned by their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore behoves the mover of this Bill and its supporters to justify the need for this Bill. More so when you are trying to legislate morality, family values and traditional Asian values. Even if there is a slight increase in the number of parents being abandoned by their children, I am saying that now is not the time for such a Bill. We should wait until an opportune time when considering all these things, bearing in mind the various measures, which the Government has introduced of late, have partially addressed this issue, that is, the extension of the retirement age to 60 with effect from 1st July last year, and in seven to ten years' time, the retirement age will be extended to 67 years old; the widening of the CPF net to cover all self-employed; and the increase in the Minimum Sum to $80,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the House will recall that at the last Budget debate, the Minister for Labour mentioned the fact that the increase in the Minimum Sum is actually meant to cope with the aging problem and to make provision for the aged in their retirement. And I also feel that, most importantly, it is the duty of a government to look after the minority of destitutes. This minority have done their share for society. They have contributed to this country. They pay taxes, dues, and the GST. I feel that there should be no shirking of responsibility to care for this small minority which comes with the mandate to govern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, as there are no statistics to show that there is an increase, and we still have ample time, no effort should be let up to inculcate and imbue in our younger generation the traditional values and filial piety. I would suggest that this Bill is a very bad and sad reflection on our society which emphasises and prides on Asian \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> values, filial piety and Confucianism. I would suggest that we wait until such time when there is a serious necessity for this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of the aged has been occupying the minds of the people and the political leadership for a long time. In July 1984, this House debated the Report of the Committee on the Problems of the Aged. The problem is still with us, and has become even more pronounced. Currently, in Singapore, eight working persons support one aged person. By the year 2010, there will be four working persons to one aged person. And by the year 2020, there will be three working persons to one aged person. By 2030, one-quarter of the population will be aged 60 and above, compared to only 9% today. That is the scale of the problem. The Government has taken the necessary steps to address the potential social and financial burden on the State, in light of the increased life expectancy and potential shortage of manpower in the workforce, so as to sustain the economy in the future years ahead. The amendment to the Central Provident Fund Act this afternoon and the enactment of the Retirement Age Act last year are examples of legislation that have been set in place to address this problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government has done its part to ensure that the aged do not become a social and financial burden to the State, the problem may perhaps be best addressed by tackling it at its root \ufffd the smallest building block of society - the family unit. This private Member's Bill in the name of Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon has generated considerable public interest. While everyone in this House would possibly agree that addressing this problem at the family level is the right thing to do, we would, however, be divided in the approach and the form in which the problem can be addressed. Sir, the real issue is: to legislate or not to legislate - that is the question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a member of the National Youth Council (NYC) and I represent the Council to present the views of the youths in Singapore on this Bill. This Bill, if \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> passed, would make the greatest impact on the youths and their future relationship with their parents. It is therefore important to take heed of the views of the youths in this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1993, at the National Youth Seminar, officiated by the Prime Minister, two out of the four workshops focused on the theme \"Looking after Aged Parents\". These two workshops submitted their recommendations to the National Youth Council. After the Bill was tabled in Parliament, I chaired two NYC round table panel discussions to discuss this matter. The first panel consisted largely of youths and administrators of Homes for the Aged. The second panel comprised representatives from youth organisations, senior administrators of ethnic-based self-help organisations, senior citizens, and representatives from the Institute of Policy Studies and the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both round table groups discussed extensively the approach in addressing the problem of caring for aged parents, ie, to legislate or not to legislate. There was an almost unanimous agreement by both panels and the NYC Seminar's recommendation, that legislation may not be the most appropriate vehicle in finding a solution to this problem. In the same breath, the group also agreed that if there was no other better solution, then legislation could be used as a last resort and as a necessary evil for the errant or recalcitrant few, as Assoc. Prof. Woon put it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups, and in particular all the representatives from the different ethnic-based self-help groups, were opposed to legislation primarily because they felt that if the children were hauled before the court, it would further weaken their family ties. It would also add embarrassment to the family. In our Asian society \"face\" is very important. Going to the court would be embarrassing not only to the children but also to the parents. A young participant in the discussion spoke for all youths when he said that \"legislation might have an adverse effect in that the young would, in the long term, view looking after parents as a legally enforceable requirement rather than as their responsibility as children.\" What is required is to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> inculcate and imbue filial piety, love and concern for the parents. Schools must emphasise to students family values and filial piety. Filial piety must come from the heart, and it cannot be a subject of legislation. While the children have a moral obligation to look after their parents, their parents also must ensure that they also plan for their old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion which emerged and is worthwhile considering is that more family support groups with greater clout be formed to help the neglected parents. This support group can act as a channel to help parents who are in need of help. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the general consensus of the two groups was that legislation was not necessary at this stage. But if the House comes to the decision that legislation is necessary, then we have to look at how best this matter can be resolved by legislation. If legislation is a necessary evil, we must recognise that it will have salutary effects. The panel members felt that the present judicial set up may not be the best forum to adjudicate the matter. The general conclusion was that this matter should not end up in the court. We should, perhaps, set up a new tribunal which could act as a consultative, conciliatory and mediatory body to resolve the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round-table discussion members were in agreement with the proposal contained in the letter to the Forum Page, Straits Times, 1st June 1994. The writer of the letter had suggested the setting up of a Community Court. The panel felt that legislation should not create antagonism and ill-will between parents and children. If the matter were to go to court, the end result would be confrontation between the parents and children. Therefore, the second panel recommends that a three-tier system be set up to resolve the issue between the parents and children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the aggrieved parents could go to a conciliatory unit set up by the Ministry of Community Development. The aggrieved parent could go and see the unit and if the children have failed to maintain, the unit \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> could then counsel the children and try to persuade them to reconsider their position. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this fails, then the matter could go to the Community Court where again the Court Registrar could summon the parties to the privacy of his chambers and try to work out a solution. And if this fails, then the matter should go to the Community Tribunal which should be made up of a lawyer and, perhaps, two community leaders or Justice of Peace. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three could meet the aggrieved parent together with his children and then come to a decision. The decision of this tribunal should carry the same authority as that of District Courts. The hearing should be held in the chambers and it should not be opened to the public or to the press. Like the Small Claims Tribunal, it should not be opened to lawyers to make representations on behalf of their clients. Aggrieved parties can be helped by the Registry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have inherited the British legal system which is an adversarial system. Litigants have to attack each other's testimony in order to win the case. We are an Asian society. We could learn from the Japanese legal system which encourages mediation and arbitration. We should adopt the Japanese approach in Singapore especially in family disputes. Family dispute should be resolved in private rather than in public. We should try the conciliatory approach to resolve family disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot run away from the problem of the aged. Ten years have gone by since the problem was first discussed. We cannot wait for another ten years. There are some signs that our elders are not getting the support and care which they deserve. All of us have enjoyed the love and care of our parents, and we must not forget them in their old age. One should not forget that we too will be old one day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, both parents and children must play their role positively. The parent could help in planning for their old age by setting aside a sum of money. Similarly, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the children must also set aside a reasonable sum of money for their own future as well as taking care of their parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect to Prof. Walter Woon, who was a fellow Rafflesian and who was my former lecturer in Company Law during my undergraduate Engineering Course, I must add some critical comments on the adequacy of the provisions of the Bill. Many legal experts and myself have observed that the Bill is far too broad and has many loopholes. It is so wide open that not only a double-decker bus can pass through but a super jumbo-jet can whiz past and still have enough space to make a U-turn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. For example, clause 11(b) and (c) allows the parent to authorise a third party to apply for maintenance, on his behalf. This is a dangerous precedent as it is open to unscrupulous persons to take advantage of the gullibility of old people. While the maintenance would be paid to the parent, it would be possible to 'scout' for old people with well-off children and encourage them to apply in return for a fee or percentage, like brokering of houses. This is particularly so for lump sum maintenance. Another problem that the Bill does not address is who would administer the money sent to parents staying in old age homes and how would it be possible for children to track if all the money given by them actually goes to the parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 5(3) and (4) may need to be deleted as it would further complicate matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the youths of Singapore have made known their views on the proposed Bill and are of the opinion that legislation may not be necessary at this stage. But if it must be done now to protect parents of the errant few, then a conciliatory approach of a three-tiered Tribunal rather than an adversarial court approach is recommended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I reluctantly support the Bill as it is a necessary evil for the errant or recalcitrant few. I am of the strong opinion that the Bill must be re-written as it is too simplistic in its present form. I therefore \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> propose that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee, where the Bill would benefit from public participation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing for adequate maintenance of parents appears to be a natural duty of children. I support the principle behind the Bill. But the Bill in its present form is a Pandora's box. The guiding principle is to maintain the family unit and strengthen the tenuous links in the family where there is discord between parents and the children. Court measures should only be a last resort as it is likely to drive a wedge into family ties which are already fragile. The end result is that the parents may be maintained materially through the court but they would have lost something more important, the emotional bonding between parents and children. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.08 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill should prevent frivolous suits. There is a danger that parents may use the threat of the Bill to get more maintenance from their children. The mere threat of a court hearing may be sufficient to force the children to bend to the demands of their parents which may not be reasonable. The definition of \"child\" in the Bill includes an illegitimate, adopted and step-child. The likelihood of weak bonding or even neglect of the child is greater in such instances. Only when the parents have taken adequate care of the children should there be adequate justification for parents to clamour for maintenance by their children. Although the Bill seeks to address this in clause 5(3), children who have been abandoned, neglected or abused may not automatically have the case dismissed, but may still be forced to provide for maintenance of their parents although the quantum may be reduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young adults have voiced their concerns that this is not a fair measure. They cannot see the rationale for having to maintain parents who have not treated them as their children. They will also have to recount their traumatic and painful \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> childhood experiences of being abandoned, neglected or abused publicly in the court, a step which they will not relish. The Bill should address these concerns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yuhua had proposed to amend the Bill to include the appointment of a Commissioner for the maintenance of parents who may make an application on behalf of an applicant whether or not the applicant is able to do so. There is some merit to this amendment. In the hospitals, there are instances of aged parents who are left in the hospitals for long periods while children push the responsibility of looking after their parents to each other. Of course, there are situations where there is only one child who is working and supporting his family and hence may have difficulty adjusting to the social difficulties of looking after the aged sick. These families should be helped and the court is not the right place to resolve the problem. However, there are families with many children and none want to take up their responsibility of providing for their sick aged parent. In this instance, the appointment of a Commissioner who can then make an application on behalf of the aged parent will be an unpleasant but viable option. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike the Member for Yuhua, I do not see the Commissioner as someone who is a champion of neglected parents, championing the rights of the parents even if they have no wish to raise the matter in court. In the recent survey by the Straits Times, it was not surprising that 87% of those aged 50 years and above stated that they would not take their children to court if their children did not support them financially. If a Commissioner was to be appointed, the Commissioner in acting on behalf of the parents should not commit the case to court, if the parents are not willing as the case may be weak with the parents unwilling to allege failure of maintenance and it may sow further discord within the family. In the Asian context, one must never underestimate the importance of preserving the dignity or face of the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent frivolous cases from being brought to court and wasting valuable time in court, there should be safeguard measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Bill should give broad criteria on what is considered inadequate maintenance to screen out unwarranted cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every case should be thoroughly and carefully investigated by a social worker appointed by the Ministry of Community Development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Deserving cases should then be raised to the attention of the Commissioner who will make an application on behalf of an applicant only if the applicant consents to the action. In the event the applicant is unable to make a decision because of physical disabilities, the Commissioner can proceed with the application on his behalf. In these deserving cases, the Commissioner can arrange for the applicant to be legally represented without the need to incur high legal fees. Otherwise, the high legal fees will by itself deter those deserving from applying and hence the exercise becomes self-defeating. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Parents who have abandoned, neglected or abused their children should not be entitled to any maintenance cost from these children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In a situation where the circumstances having been carefully investigated by the social worker and reviewed by the Commissioner and it is deemed that there are no merits to proceed with an application, the individual can still proceed to take up a civil suit at his own expense as an individual and the Commissioner is not bound to assist him in the application in any way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to the Bill to take into account these considerations will: (1) allay the fear of frivolous cases; (2) prevent undeserving parents from getting maintenance; and (3) provide an avenue for deserving parents to make an application via the Commissioner without incurring high legal costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is an important and emotional issue with wide-ranging views, I would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> strongly recommend that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for further consideration. \n  <br>4.15 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, there has been a fair amount of public reaction to this Maintenance of Parents Bill. I have heard many comments, both for and against the Bill. I can categorise the reactions into two groups, those that are reacting from the heart and those from the head. To put it in another way, whether the reactions are emotional ones, ie, from the heart, or rational ones, ie, from the head. Allow me to assess this Bill from these two angles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming straight from our hearts, the spontaneous emotional response of many people and I to this Bill is negative. Singapore is essentially an Asian cultural society. As Asians, it has been ingrained into us the importance of filial piety and the importance of the family. These values have been indoctrinated in our minds. There are eight virtues in Chinese teachings. These are which means patriotism, filial piety, mercy, love, courtesy, justice, integrity and shame. These are things we must understand and respect. Hence, Chinese teachings stress the importance of filial piety and family values. I believe the same applies to the teachings of the other Asian cultures of the Indians and the Malays. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the emotional response of all filial sons and daughters to this Bill is that it is shocking and unthinkable. Most will feel that it is only natural that our parents who have devoted their life, love and money to bring up their children, that they should then in turn support their parents in their old age. As many have said, this bondage between the parents and children is emotional. This bondage should not be legislated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, many feel that the emotional response from parents is also similarly negative. Many responsible parents see it as their natural duty to bring up their children and to educate them. The children did not ask to be born, and there is no contract at birth to say that the children must be taken care of by their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parents, and that they in turn must take care of their parents when their parents grow old. Hence, the parents will view this as their personal failing if they have not properly educated their children, and that in failing to do so, their children do not wish to reciprocate and take care of them during their old age. From the parents' point of view, there should not be a need to legislate this requirement. Many consider it as an affront to their personal parenting ability to require the Government to step in and impose an order on their children to maintain them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting aside all the emotional hang-ups that we may have in this Bill, let us ask ourselves rationally: should it be done? What are the rational considerations for having this Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic premise is that if the parents have brought up their children properly, then in turn the children should be responsible for maintaining their parents in their old age. Taken narrowly in the context of the family, this is a private family affair that should be settled and resolved within the family. How, who should do it, how much and when, are matters that should be settled within the family. Why is there a need for the State to get involved? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of differences and disagreements, is it not better for family members to sort things out among themselves or seek mediation from friends and relatives? To have to resort to going to court seems to be a very alien idea for us Asians. This litigious approach is more a Western rather than an Eastern cultural concept. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we have to ask ourselves whether this problem of children neglecting their parents is becoming prevalent in Singapore. Are there many abandoned old parents in the streets? Are the old folks' homes bursting at the seams with rejected, uncared for parents? If this is so, it will then become a national problem. Only then will I feel that it is justifiable for the State to step in. The problem becomes a matter for the Government to tackle and a financial and social burden for the State to bear. At that stage, then there is in fact a rational need \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for such a Bill that requires maintenance of parents by children. If this is not the status, why is there a need for this Bill now? I feel that sad will be the day when there are many Singaporean children neglecting their parents to the extent that it becomes a national problem. Sad will be the day when parents need to or liberally resort to going to court to get their children to support them. Even then, the main effect of the maintenance of parents law is to solve and shift the financial burden of maintaining large numbers of poor aged parents from the State back to their unfilial children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would still have to solve the root causes which rest in, I believe, poor education of the children and the degeneration of social values. Fortunately, this is not the case in Singapore at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the conclusion of my evaluation is that I am not inclined to support the Bill in its present form. I do not feel that it is necessary to have parents resorting to going to court to sue their children to support them. Moreover, the instances of children neglecting their parents are not so prevalent at the present time, such that it becomes a matter for the State to interfere and to resolve. If we ever degenerate to that state of affairs, then we should first look at the root causes of why is there this social degeneration of our family values. Education and societal factors will have to be re-assessed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today's debate on the Maintenance of Parents Bill is really a debate on whether we are for or against Asian values. For over two decades, the Government has been promoting Asian values. The Government tells us that the family is the building block of the nation and that family unity is of paramount importance. It is also Asian practice that disputes in the family should be resolved by discussion and a consensual decision arrived at, and that it is quite shameful to let others know that there is a family dispute. I think most families would prefer disputes to be resolved amicably in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> private rather than in the open. Where disputes cannot be resolved by the immediate family members, they would normally seek the assistance of other members of the family such as the grandparents of the children or brothers and sisters of the parents and also seek the clan association to help them resolve the problem in the family. The general rule is that whatever happens, the family would try as best as it can not to bring the family dispute in the open and make it public, for it is considered very shameful to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore society today, there is still a sense of shame. There are certain things we still do not like to make public, and one of the things is a dispute in the family. If this Maintenance of Parents Bill becomes law and is used in the courts, the sense of shame that we now have in our society shall surely be eroded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese society is very stable and I believe one of the reasons for that stability is the sense of shame. Most Japanese dare not go out of line or do anything wrong, because there is that sense of shame. They dare not face their relatives, their neighbours or their friends if they did anything wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read in Singapore about an engineer who committed suicide whilst building our Singapore Airport because his company lost money. He felt that he had let his employers down. We have also read that after World War II, many Japanese soldiers were left behind in the jungles in the Philippines. They dared not surrender because if they did, they felt that they would let their family down. It would be very shameful for their family. And I believe more so that no Japanese children would dare not to support their parents. That is the sense of shame. So if we can achieve that Japanese value, I believe we have really gone a great distance in building a cohesive society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards this Bill, there are two possibilities. One scenario is that the sense of shame in Singapore is still very strong and parents are too shameful to go to the courts to force their children to pay for their maintenance. That was the case in Israel. Israel, as has already been \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mentioned, has a similar law enacted in 1959, whereby under the Israeli family law, parents and even grandparents who are neglected can claim maintenance from the children and grandchildren in the courts. However, to the good name of Israel, that law has hardly been used at all. It shows that the children over there care for their parents. And if you ask any lawyer in Israel to cite a case when that law was last used, he would probably find it very difficult to find one such case for you. If that is the scenario and it could be transported into Singapore's case, then we really do not need such a law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there could be a different situation. Once the Maintenance of Parents Bill is made into law, due to examples of a few, others may follow them and flood the courts to claim maintenance from their children. If that happens, then the sense of shame in Singapore would definitely have been lost. There is no more privacy of the family. Everything comes out in the open. People no longer feel shameful for parents to claim maintenance from their children. Once that is done, perhaps other family disputes will also go to court, because they have lost their sense of shame, instead of seeking avenues to resolve such family disputes first. Soon, the issue relating to this Bill is just not a matter of dollars and cents. If the Government feels that it could save itself some money, perhaps it is wise to save the money elsewhere. At the moment, I read that the Ministry of Community Development is spending something like $9 million on the care for the aged. This sum, by Singapore Government's standard, is minuscule. It is not even a drop in the ocean. I should say, in fact, it is a very small fraction of a drop in the ocean. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Maintenance of Parents Bill is enacted as law, the Government surely will have to build around it an infrastructure to administer the law. There would be a host of people involved, not only in the courts but also social workers, counsellors and enforcement officers. I think it would be a better proposition that, instead of putting this Bill through, the Government should spend the money that would have been used if the Maintenance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of Parents Bill is made into law to educate Singaporeans on Asian values. It is like strengthening one's body to build up resistance against diseases rather than trying to cure the disease itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Bill hopefully will be assigned to a Select Committee where it can be further examined. If this Bill should become law, in my view, it would do more damage than good. Because we are an Asian society where our family ties are still strong. The whole Asian society is built up on a strong fabric of family ties. If we are to succeed as a cohesive society in the long term, then we should do everything to preserve that fabric, and not to tear it apart. The Bill that is before us is an attempt to tear that fabric apart, and not to preserve it. I therefore cannot support the Bill that is before the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to give my views on the issue of maintenance of parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, if we were to ask a Malay how relevant the Bill might be to him, his answer would probably be that it is not really relevant to a Malay. A Malay, one who subscribes to the values of the Malays and practises the Islamic way of life, should not need this law to live and feel secure that he would be looked after in his old age. This is a valid observation generally, because currently we can see that the Malay community, which has managed to preserve its values and way of life, guided by its religious beliefs, looks upon the maintenance of parents as an important responsibility. It is an important duty in adult life. Thus we see today that very few Malay parents or old folks are neglected by their children. The main reason, as I have explained earlier, is their strong belief in their values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave this reply once to someone who asked me how is it that among the Malays, the old folks are well looked after. The simple answer is that a Malay Muslim who neglects his own parents, or worse, denies them his loyalty is promised hell \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> after his death. It is a firm and clear injunction. A Malay Muslim who seeks a better after-life will make sure that he looks after his parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in daily life, a young Malay is not supposed to be rude to his parents. Never mind being unfilial - just to be rude is a serious offence. These values have been passed down from generation to generation and inculcated from young. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay parents have a clear responsibility to raise their children well. It is a responsibility not only from the Malay point of view, but from the Islamic point of view as well: to give them food, shelter and education. Some continue to be responsible to the extent of finding life partners for their children, holding their wedding ceremony and later even looking after their grandchildren. When a child grows up, he will be explained what his responsibilities are to his parents and how he should carry the same responsibility when he has his own children. This tradition has brought strength to Malay community life and we truly hope that these values will be preserved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, another source of unhappiness among Singaporeans, including the Malays, about this Bill is how a noble act that has been a way of life is now turning into a legal solution. Many feel that the needs of the aged are not just financial needs but also love, respect, concern, etc. However, I agree that with changing times and new values, there will be in the Malay community, as in other communities, some people who will shirk this responsibility and will need a bit of push before they will do it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today there are in the Malay community, although small in number, adult children who refuse to give their parents financial support. But, as in the past, we have within the community a system where relatives will come forward to counsel, or neighbours who might know of the situation will put pressure on the children concerned. Still, in the context of today's life, with fewer three-generation families and new challenges, a higher cost of living, I think the number of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> people who might neglect their parents, including in the Malay community, would probably increase in the future. Granted, no law, this Bill included, can guarantee that a child would voluntarily, under no pressure, come forward to maintain his parents. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel the Bill should receive our attention and support, so that at least parents would have a place to turn to should they find themselves in difficulties, if ever they need to claim their right from the children on whom they had showered love and money to raise, feed and educate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I am confident that Asian children, whether they be Chinese, Indians or Malay, would find themselves under great pressure if they were brought to court to face a claim for maintenance from their parents. I think most of us, being Asians, would try to avoid such a situation. And because there is a law to enable parents to do so, I think many will realise that it is better to provide this basic need for their parents rather than be brought to such an embarrassing situation. Indeed, I think many parents, in spite of difficulties that compel them to go to court, would feel reluctant to do so. I know some would rather live in a state of deprivation than shame their family and descendants. Nevertheless, we should allow them the means to do so and at least in the extreme cases they should be able to find a way out of their problems. And the way out for them is to go back to their own children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would support the Bill and I support that it be referred to a Select Committee so that we can gather more views from the public. In this way, we can refine it and implement it in the best way possible in the interests of our future generations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Bill was first introduced in this House, there has been extensive debate, both in the media, and on the ground. I kept a running count of this afternoon's debate. Eight speakers spoke - three against, one reluctant yes, four yes, but wanted some refinements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, has engaged the passion of Singaporeans, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which is not a bad thing. The broad verdict, as I read about it, is that the majority of Singaporeans, especially young working adults, are in favour of the Bill, with a significant minority of older Singaporeans opposing the Bill because they fear that it would erode and demean existing family values and family ties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is sure, even for those who do not support the Bill, as it stands, they are not saying an outright no. As Mr Leong Horn Kee has put it, their hearts feel that this may not be the right time. Therefore, if we can somehow win over the hearts of those who demurred, this Bill has a chance of getting popular support. I think it deserves clarification. It deserves to be committed to a Select Committee and it deserves to get ultimately popular support, if not overwhelming majority support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us listen to why some of these people are saying no. First, these people are saying that filial piety cannot be legislated. This Bill is not a solution to a moral problem. If legislation is needed, then our education system has failed and it is better, they say, to go back to basics now instead of using the hammer of the law. Many Asian parents, Singaporean parents, are resigned to a traditional Asian way. They say, \"If my children are unfilial, then what is the point of bringing them to court. I will live the shame. I will camp outside the Town Council office, maybe pressure my MP.\" But my response to this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that filial piety certainly cannot be legislated. But this Bill does not even attempt to do that. What it attempts to do is to solve a practical problem of maintenance for the very few abandoned parents. The Government, as I understand, aims to foster filial piety, not through legislation, but by a multi-pronged approach which includes conducting moral education in schools, hosting public seminars, especially during this International Year of the Family, promoting family values through good local SBC programmes in the media - I think SBC should step up its effort - giving tax incentives to support parents via the parents relief scheme, the CPF Top-up scheme, encouraging children to insure their parents under Medisave, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> even recently, to re-prioritise the balloting of flats to allow children and parents to live together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these measures, taken as a whole, in toto, might help to foster filial piety. The Bill does not attempt to legislate filial piety. But we must recognise that even while these educational programmes, these public programmes, are on-going, there is a limit to what we can do. It cannot for a start create a utopian society, which some of my colleagues appear to want us to do. Whatever we do, whatever this Government does, however it does it, however much money it pours into it, there will be abandoned parents. Hence, I think we need a multi-pronged approach - education, tax reliefs, public seminars, and also legislation, because legislation can serve as a last line of defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Walter Woon here is right. Children who are filial need not fear the Bill, nor parents who are the beneficiary of their children's love need fear the Bill. If the Bill is passed into law, the Maintenance of Parents Act will not in any way dissolve at the drop of a hat existing filial relationships. And, of course, here we are on safe territory. We are not entering virgin territory with this Bill. There are precedents in Asia, America, Europe, to assure us that we are entering safe territory. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the sanctity of filial piety will not be violated if this Bill becomes law. There are really two solutions to this very real problem of abandoned parents. The first solution is that the State picks up the maintenance cost. The second one is that the children pick up the maintenance cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, many Singaporeans want the Government to take the first option, which is the Government should pick up the welfare bill, maintain the abandoned parents, pay for them, send them to the old age homes, send them to the voluntary organisations. But what does it mean for us? It means that the negligent few are passing the buck to the responsible majority. So this Bill also serves as an educational exercise that we cannot allow a negligent few from hoisting the problem onto the majority of us who are responsible, who are loving children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think individuals must take personal responsibility and the community cannot share in their negligence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ling How Doong is a strong advocate of using State funds to take care of abandoned parents. He said rhetorically, \"These people pay taxes, Sir. Now they are old, take care of them.\" But Mr Ling will also be aware that the people we need to help most are the people who may not be paying taxes. With GST on, many of the poorer income people have dropped off the tax net. These are the people with little savings. These are the ones that need the protection of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this argument that I pay taxes, you take care of me. When you pay taxes, you are receiving the benefits of the environment, receiving the benefits of the State. So you are actually using up your services. As you are paying taxes, you are using up services. By the time you retire, theoretically, the State should withhold its benefits. But, of course, no government should do that, and this is just to remind advocates of this argument that I pay taxes, you take care of me for life. I think it does not hold water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second group of people, who are afraid to say yes at this point, say, \"Well, there is no serious problem now. So what's the fuss? Why create a problem? Don't fix the problem when none exists.\" And this is particularly prevalent among older Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer to that is that the Bill does not attempt to solve the problem now. The Bill hopes to address the problem which might not even arise in the future. And if it does, just bury bury the Act somewhere, if it is passed. But, Sir, going by the trends of the West and the East, we cannot take things for granted. And I share Mr Maidin's concern that the problem might become worse in the far future. Most aged parents in Singapore today are maintained by their children. In a way, these are lucky parents because even though they have small CPF savings, they have many children. All you need is one child or two children to support them, and they are okay. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in 20 to 30 years' time, say, in the year 2020, a convenient number to choose, when a large percentage of our people would have become aged, then the problem of abandonment will become serious. Because families would have become smaller, the financial burden of the few who help maintain parents would be great. The temptation to opt out must be very real. But some tell me that even then the problem of abandonment is not serious because in the year 2020, we will have lots of CPF. The Labour Minister has put in place various laws to ensure that we top up our CPF, we raise the Minimum Sum. I think these will still not be enough. In any case, the people we need to help most presently are not sufficiently covered by CPF. Many of these are lower-income self-employed who do not pay much into CPF anyway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I met a group of young feedback contributors last Thursday, 21st July, I asked them about this Bill and whether they would be keen to maintain their parents when their parents become old. By show of hands, 16 of the young working adults agreed that they will support the Bill, they like the Bill. In fact, they think that they will be the beneficiaries. In the meantime, they do not mind supporting their parents. Five were against and five were not sure, because they want to see some refinements before they make their verdict. And I am encouraged by the young working Singaporeans for their positive attitude. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem does not lie with the young working adults. The problem right now, the concern, the worries, lie with a group of elderly Singaporeans. They echo the view and they say that we are an Asian society, so do not mimic the ways of the West, do not try to legislate filial piety, do not try to legislate love. But there are many precedents in Asia - Taiwan is an example quoted both by Mdm Foo and Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan is an Asian country - a Confucian society where the ways of the sage, the old, is honoured in both rituals and practice. They have a teachers' day, a Confucius day, where all the students pay homage to Confucius, and then they recite \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> all the familiar teachings of Confucius. Yet Taiwan has already legislated an equivalent of the Maintenance of Parents Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel has long had a law - the Family (Maintenance) Law - to make sure that children maintain parents under certain conditions. For Members' information, Israel is an Asian country, although situated in the turbulent Middle East. And I personally know of a few cultures which are more passionate about family values than the Jews. Because of the fresh memories of pogroms, the persecution in Europe, and around the world Jewish families are very close together, they cherish family values perhaps more than any other culture today. And yet they have an equivalent of this Maintenance of Parents Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, so if the argument from the heart is that the law will dilute family values and replace a filial relationship with a legal one, then the experiences of Israel and Taiwan will confirm this fear to be totally exaggerated and misplaced. There are, as Mr Chiam confirmed, very, very few cases of Israelis and Taiwanese being brought to court. So this Bill, if passed into law, is really non-intimidating. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their collective experiences in administering their laws also suggest that a litigious culture will not be nurtured. And most of all, the experiences of these two countries - Taiwan and Israel, both in Asia - dispel the fear that family values will not be sacrificed on the cross of legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are more precedents, Mr Deputy Speaker. According to the laws governing Muslims in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria and the United Arab Republic, children are obliged, under law, to support their needy parents. In India, even children in straitened circumstances, must maintain their abandoned parents. And all these are ancient societies with established traditions of filial piety. In other words, I am saying the Asian voices have said yes to a modern law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Sir, those unsure of the deleterious effects of this Bill can rest assured that no harm can be done, much good will flow in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with those who have shown some concern about various provisions in the Bill and, for these reasons, I recommend that this Bill be committed to a Select Committee so that it will receive wider representations from the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one refinement which I hope the Select Committee will consider, and that is something which I share with Mdm Foo, that it would be convenient, sometimes necessary, to help abandoned parents to seek redress under this law. And I propose that some authority, perhaps by a Commissioner of the Maintenance of Parents, be appointed to bring charges against children. The Commissioner can act on his or her own or can act when he or she is alerted by MPs or community leaders, or act on behalf of institutions caring for abandoned parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence to let me speak tomorrow, because there is not much time left. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You have got three more minutes.

Prof. Walter Woon, I was a bit disappointed because he did not place much value on this traditional belief that we hold so dear of looking after our parents, and he did not seem to think that it is that important now. There is little faith in this age-old tradition. But I have still very strong faith and I feel that looking after our parents, and maintaining them financially, is also a very important aspect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that 5% of the aged, that is, 15,000, will be a problem next time. But I think he has got his arithmetic wrong. I do not think it is 5%, because he fails to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> realise that of this 5%, a fair number will have their own CPF and also there are the Top-up and Minimum Sum schemes. So I think that 5% can be trimmed to even a smaller figure, maybe about 1% or so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that there is disagreement between what Mr Sinnakaruppan and Mr Koo Tsai Kee have said. Mr Koo Tsai Kee said that when a group of young people were asked about the Bill only 16 voted for the legislation; 5 were against, and 5 were not sure. I think it is too small a figure for him to come to this House and tell us that this is representative. I think the sample size provided by Mr Sinnakaruppan is more representative. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A total of 156 Government buildings under the management of the Land Office have been vacant for more than one year. Most of these buildings are in former army camps which have been vacated by MINDEF as they have become obsolete or are affected by re-development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Most of the vacant buildings have not been leased as they are affected by re-development in the near future. With only a short or uncertain tenure available for use, it is often not practical or viable to lease such buildings out as they usually require substantial refurbishment before they can be re-used. These buildings will usually be demolished when development plans are finalised and re-development of the site commences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where vacant buildings are capable of re-use, the Land Office will liaise with the various ministries to see if they require the building for their use or for the use of any of the private welfare, educational, cultural or social organisations under their charge. If so, and the proposal to use the building is suitable, the Land Office will allocate the building to the ministry or organisation concerned. In cases where there are no suitable applications, the Land Office will tender the buildings out for short term rental. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The market value of Government buildings is determined by the Chief Valuer based on the usage approved by the Chief Planner and varies significantly depending on the location and condition of the buildings. It is difficult to determine the market value of the vacant buildings as the possibility and nature of usage of the buildings in most cases has not yet been determined. In any case, buildings which are affected by re-development and therefore cannot be used have no market value. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS/CONVENTIONS RELATING</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TO WOMEN AND FAMILY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the number of international agreements or conventions relating to (i) the status of women and (ii) workers with family responsibilities to which Singapore is a party. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

Registration of companies and businesses in Singapore has therefore to be done in English. However, the Registry of Companies and Businesses (RCB) accepts registration of non-English names so long as they are given in romanised form. Thus, Chinese names can be registered in Hanyu Pinyin and Malay names are accepted for registration since the Malay language is based on the English alphabet system. RCB has on its register such names as \"Huat Chye and Company\", \"Sabar Menanti Siang dan Malam\" and \"Daiichi Jitsugyo Co. Ltd\". Since there is no requirement for names in other language forms to be registered, companies have the flexibility to use a name in any particular language form to represent their company, in addition to their legal English or romanised form. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied the possibility of allowing names in other language forms, like Chinese, to be legally recognised and accepted for registration by RCB, and concluded that it would not be feasible to do so. The main problem lies in the complexities of the various languages, both in their written form as well as in their pronunciation. A Chinese character, for example, can be written in the original complex form or several simplified forms. It can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be pronounced in different ways by different dialect groups. Also, different Chinese characters can have exactly the same pronunciation in Mandarin or other dialects. In addition, it is possible for a name in romanised form to be shared by different language forms. This happens when the meaning of a name in a particular language form and as expressed in romanised form is used in the registration of the company. For example, \"Berjaya Pte Ltd\" and \"Sheng Li Pte Ltd\" in their respective language forms could share the same English name \"Success Pte Ltd\". It would not be possible to build up a database that is able to link the different pronunciations, as well as different written forms and meaning to a specific word. Furthermore, even if these problems can be overcome, there are already existing companies with different English or romanised names sharing the same name in a particular language form. It would not be possible to decide which company should be allowed the exclusive right to use the name. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, the present system of registration of a company's name in English or romanised form remains the most feasible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYERS WHO ENGAGE DISABLED WORKERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Tax rebates)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will grant tax rebates to employers who engage disabled workers so as to help the disabled find employment and become self sufficient. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage employers to engage disabled workers, the Government has already allowed a one-off deduction against income of expenditure incurred by employers in building modifications to cater for the disabled, subject to a maximum of $100,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADMISSION TO FACULTY OF MEDICINE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Cap on number of applicants)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Education whether his Ministry will change its policy to bar students with good grades from studying medicine at the National University of Singapore in cases where such students cannot afford to do so overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cap on the number of applicants with outstanding 'A' level results to be admitted to Medicine to ensure a better spread of talent to other faculties.

The main concern of MSG is its sodium component. Excessive use of MSG in food will result in a high sodium intake. Too much sodium in the diet increases the risk of developing high blood pressure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other component of MSG is glutamate. It is this component that gives food its flavour. It causes the Chinese restaurant syndrome in people who are hyper-sensitive to glutamate. This is why some people get headaches, flushing, numbness and dizziness during or after a meal in Chinese restaurants. These symptoms, however, are temporary and have not been found to have long term effects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSG is only one of many dietary components that could increase the risk of hypertension when taken excessively. Others in the same category include salt, soya sauce and various seasonings containing salt and MSG. We need to use these ingredients judiciously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not ban MSG any more than we should ban, say, soya sauce. Glutamate is a natural substance found in many animal and vegetable products. Taken in small quantities, MSG enhances the flavour of food. We should instead educate both consumers and food suppliers. Nutrition education raises public awareness and helps consumers make better food choices. Requests by consumers for less MSG and avoidance of food stalls and restaurants which use MSG excessively will send a strong signal to food suppliers to cut down on its usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH's nutrition education programmes include advice on reducing the intake of salt, MSG and other salty seasonings to lower the risk of high blood pressure and related illnesses such as heart disease and stroke.

SAF servicemen are good organisers, work well in teams and possess discipline, diligence, perseverance and good work attitudes. These qualities coupled with strong demand in the job market make it very unlikely that they would fall out of the job market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the SAF is committed to help retiring servicemen phase into their second career. Servicemen interested in venturing into business are provided specially packaged courses on setting up businesses, and on specific topics such as import and export procedures, life insurance and real estate. Servicemen can also opt for external courses at subsidized rates and will be eligible for half pay for up to 6 months if these courses are conducted during office hours. Alternatively under a pre-release employment programme, servicemen can go on half pay leave for up to 6 months during which time they can take up full-time paid employment in a private company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF also provides information to servicemen on employment opportunities collated from civilian employers in the market.

With their military background and experience, they can help provide a more rounded education to our students, particularly in physical fitness training and in inculcating a spirit of adventure by serving as male role models. Similar schemes will be established with other suitable organisations to make good use of the experience and training of ex-SAF servicemen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LOCAL WORKFORCE WITHOUT CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND ACCOUNTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour if he will give the breakdown by gender and occupation of the 28% of the local workforce who have no active Central Provident Fund accounts, excluding those who are self-employed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th June 1994, there were 363,690 male and 407,922 female Singaporean CPF members whose accounts are inactive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board does not keep data on CPF members by occupation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DAILY RATED SINGAPOREAN WORKERS IN GOVERNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRIES/DEPARTMENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Contribution to CPF)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) whether the 5,000 or so daily rated Singaporean workers in the ministries and departments are contributing to Central Provident Fund and b) if he will give a gender breakdown of these workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Daily-rated Singaporean workers in Government Ministries and Departments contribute to CPF in accordance with the rates prescribed in the CPF (Government Employees) Regulations, just as in the case of monthly-rated Government employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) While the CPF Board keeps data by gender for the total membership, it does not keep such data on the basis of whether the member is a monthly-rated or daily-rated employee.

Such schemes include the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme administered by the National Council of Social Service and the Financial Assistance Scheme administered by Ministry of Education. The eligibility for assistance to these families varies according to the objectives and types of assistance provided. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINIMUM HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE FOR DESTITUTE FAMILIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development whether he accepts the Minimum Household Expenditure for destitute families established by the Committee on Destitute Families and whether he will be able to give the number of families which are below the Minimum Household Expenditure guidelines. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Destitute Families, one of the 3 Committees set up by the Advisory Council on Family and Community Life, adopted the operational definition of destitute families as those families with household income below the MHE. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in determining the number of destitute families, the Committee noted that earnings and income statistics in Singapore, as in all countries, were subjected to under-reporting. This was particularly true for those employed in the informal sector where many destitutes were employed. Hence, the MHE (as an income measure) could not be relied upon totally to determine the number of destitute families and had to be qualified by other criteria such as: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Head of household being a single parent with dependent children and without other means of support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Principal wage earner or family member suffering from chronic disease or physical, intellectual or mental disability and facing hardship. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Elderly person(s) or couple above the age of 60 years without other means of support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Death of principal wage earner causing hardship to the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee estimated that the number of families likely to face destitution was between 900 and 1,300. They comprised mainly families under public assistance, those receiving assistance from community and other social organisations as well as families in rent arrears of more than 12 months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1991, the MHE had been used to peg the rates of public assistance. In 1990, my Ministry commissioned a consultant firm to conduct a Survey on Lifestyles and Consumption Patterns of Low-income Families in June 1990 to determine the consumption values of low-income families. In March 1991, the rates of public assistance were revised upwards based on the results of the Survey. In the subsequent upward revisions of public assistance rates in January 1993 and April 1994, the Consumer Price Index was used to update the consumption values to peg the public assistance rates. The public assistance rates will be reviewed in January 1995. We are in the process of conducting another survey to find out the changes in consumption values. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940725/19940725-HA-0630219.htm\">Annex I(A) &amp; I(B) - INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS/CONVENTIONS ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN,INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS/CONVENTIONS ON WORKERS WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES (Cols. 219 - 222)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940725/19940725-HA-0630223.htm\">Table 1 &amp; 2 - BREAKDOWN OF OFFENDERS AGAINST PROPERTY AND PERSONS BY GENDER 1990-1993, BREAKDOWN OF OFFENDERS AGAINST PROPERTY AND PERSONS WHO ARE EX-CONVICTS 1990-1993 (Cols. 223 - 224)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940725/19940725-HA-0630225.htm\">Table - RESIDENT SINGLE PARENT POPULATION BY MARITAL STATUS AND MONTHLY HOUSEHOLD INCOME, 1990 (Cols. 225 - 226)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
