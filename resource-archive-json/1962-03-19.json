First, there are serving officers who  are\r\n\r\nsent  abroad  on short-term training  courses;  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the staff of Civil Aviation who were sent\r\n\r\neither   to  Australia  or  New  Zealand  to   take\r\n\r\nspecialist courses in Airport Management, in  radar\r\n\r\ncontrol,  and so on, and when they come  back  they\r\n\r\nwill be more efficient after having undergone these\r\n\r\ntraining courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are specialist professional courses\r\n\r\nwhich  we  offer  to  serving officers  in  certain\r\n\r\nsenior  technical grades. Most of these really  are\r\n\r\ncourses  leading  to  post-graduate  or  specialist\r\n\r\nqualifications which are offered to doctors, and  a\r\n\r\nfair  number of doctors are studying in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are first professional training\r\n\r\ncourses  or first degree courses which we offer  to\r\n\r\nyoung   persons.  Under  the  previous  Government,\r\n\r\nrecruitment for such training courses has been from\r\n\r\nserving   officers  in  the  junior   grades;   for\r\n\r\ninstance,   P.W.D. architectural  or   engineering\r\n\r\ntechnicians or Telecommunications technicians  have\r\n\r\nbeen   given   the   opportunity   to   take   full\r\n\r\nprofessional courses, say, in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that this policy is wasteful\r\n\r\nbecause quite often these junior technical officers\r\n\r\nhave  not either the intellectual capacity  or  the\r\n\r\nacademic  background to benefit from these courses.\r\n\r\nThey  either just scrape through with  a  very  low\r\n\r\npass  degree  or, as happens only too  often,  they\r\n\r\nfail    in    their   professional   or    academic\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for such courses - for instance, we are having any\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons doing professional  degrees  in\r\n\r\nEngineering   or  Science  or  Quantity   Surveying\r\n\r\netc. - we  are getting them straight from  those  who\r\n\r\nhave   passed   the   Higher   School   Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination, and each year we are getting  some  of\r\n\r\nthe   best  of  these  persons  for  these   higher\r\n\r\nprofessional training courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, is it true to\r\n\r\nsay  then  that at the top where there  are  senior\r\n\r\nofficers serving under the expatriates, the  senior\r\n\r\nofficer   is  being  trained  to  take   over   the\r\n\r\nexpatriate's job, apart from the junior officers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the question may give\r\n\r\nthe  impression that expatriate officers are always\r\n\r\nabove  the local senior officers. In fact, all  the\r\n\r\ntop  posts,  i.e, the highest posts  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice, like the post of Permanent Secretary, have\r\n\r\nalready  been  Malayanised, and the expatriates  do\r\n\r\nnot  occupy them. Take the P.W.D., for instance. The\r\n\r\nDirector  of Public Works and his Deputy are  local\r\n\r\nofficers.  That is the case too in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth. But we need bodies - that is the main  thing.\r\n\r\nYou  have  to  have a doctor, or a surgeon,  or  an\r\n\r\nengineer. Because we ate so short of these persons.\r\n\r\nand  if  they are expatriates and willing  to  work\r\n\r\nhere. I would say it is all for the good if we  can\r\n\r\nget an extra body to carry the load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry\r\n\r\nI  did not make it clear to the Minister. I did lot\r\n\r\nmean that the expatriate is always at the top. What\r\n\r\nI  meant is that if a serving expatriate is  to  be\r\n\r\nMalayanised,  is  the  local  officer   immediately\r\n\r\nbeneath  him,  irrespective  of  whatever  post  he\r\n\r\nholds, being trained to take over his post?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would say that is the\r\n\r\ngeneral   position.

For  instance,  in  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's portfolio there are Departments such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Marine Survey Department where you just do not\r\n\r\nhave  any local officer, or very few of them,  with\r\n\r\nthe requisite professional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualifications.

He does not view the mounting\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest  with  grave  concern.  By   his\r\n\r\namendment,  he  wants this House not  to  view  the\r\n\r\nmounting  industrial  unrest  with  grave  concern.\r\n\r\nStrange,  Sir. But is it really strange, especially\r\n\r\nas  this  comes from the Member for Anson?  in  his\r\n\r\nshort speech last Friday, he made reference to  the\r\n\r\ntime  when  I  was Minister for Labour and  Welfare\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was Chief Minister. When he took  office,\r\n\r\nthere  was  too a spate of strikes, some  of  which\r\n\r\nwere of a political character. He did not view this\r\n\r\nwith  alarm.  He  did  not  view  this  with  grave\r\n\r\nconcern, in  fact, when he was surrounded  by  the\r\n\r\nPress, who were anxious to hear from him what plans\r\n\r\nhe had to meet this challenge, he said with a broad\r\n\r\nsmile.  \"I  love strikes.\" He loves  strikes,  Sir.\r\n\r\nindeed, it might be that it is because of his  love\r\n\r\nfor  strikes  that  the Hock  Lee  strike  in  1955\r\n\r\nculminated  in  a bloody riot and  the  then  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister became\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  sick  man. One would have thought, Sir, that  he\r\n\r\nwould   have  learned  something  from  his  bitter\r\n\r\nexperience.   But   it   would   seem   from    his\r\n\r\nmanifestations last Friday in this House that he is\r\n\r\nincurable,  in  so far as this particular  economic\r\n\r\nill is concerned. He wants this House to take note.\r\n\r\nTake  note! Surely hon. Members of this  House,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the public, have been taking note for some\r\n\r\nmonths past of the mounting industrial unrest.  And\r\n\r\nwe,  having  taken note of the mounting  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  now feel grave concern for such a situation\r\n\r\nas  it  has created havoc in the economic field  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. There may be some hon. Members  who  may\r\n\r\nnot view this mounting industrial unrest with grave\r\n\r\nconcern,  but if there are such Members, they  have\r\n\r\nfailed  in  their  sacred duty to  look  after  the\r\n\r\neconomic well-being of the people who elected them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what does the Member for Anson want us to\r\n\r\ntake  note? He wants us to take note of the  public\r\n\r\nmanifestations of industrial dissatisfaction. I say\r\n\r\nthere has been mounting industrial unrest and there\r\n\r\nare  facts and figures to bear me out. This  simple\r\n\r\nstatement  of absolute truth appears to have  stung\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson into attempting to  interpret\r\n\r\nthe   present  lamentable  situation  as  a  public\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of industrial dissatisfaction.  High\r\n\r\nsounding words indeed, Sir. Behind them is  implied\r\n\r\nthe  attitude of the Member for Anson. By  his  own\r\n\r\nwords, he takes the stand that all the strikes that\r\n\r\nhave  bedevilled  the country are  just,  and  that\r\n\r\ntrade unions should be given free rein to do damage\r\n\r\nto the economy of the country and thus to do damage\r\n\r\nto  their  own  members. I have not  in  my  speech\r\n\r\ncondemned  the  trade  unions  for  the  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest. What I have sought to do in my motion is to\r\n\r\ncall on the Government to do everything possible to\r\n\r\nbring  about industrial peace with justice, because\r\n\r\nwithout industrial peace the economic well-being of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore will be  jeopardised.  A\r\n\r\nsober  speech of mine seems to have made the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson see in it a touch of hysteria. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nonly one who has been on the fringe of hysteria who\r\n\r\ncan see hysteria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is no hysteria.

Perhaps that shows that all  the  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in the House are agreed that the  state\r\n\r\nof  industrial unrest in Singapore is such that  it\r\n\r\ncauses  grave concern to all who are interested  in\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when the general public\r\n\r\nwould read a report of some industrial trouble with\r\n\r\na  smile,  with  passing interest, and  make  it  a\r\n\r\nsubject of conversation at tea parties and  so  on.\r\n\r\nToday  we are all conscious that when we view  this\r\n\r\nproblem, we view it against a sombre background  of\r\n\r\nan   ever  increasing  number  of  unemployed.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  not merely a question of getting  fair\r\n\r\nwages and increasing wages, of which we are all  in\r\n\r\nfavour,  hut  it is a question of encouraging  more\r\n\r\nindustries  and encouraging traders to  expand  and\r\n\r\nemploy  more  people,  so that  this  grave  social\r\n\r\nproblem of unemployment can be solved. It is  quite\r\n\r\nfrequent  coming across a family  of  five  or  six\r\n\r\ndepending  just on one member. I was visiting  some\r\n\r\nfamilies in an attap house area and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncame  across  a family with about five  able-bodied\r\n\r\nyoung  men,  and a widowed mother. Of  these  five,\r\n\r\nonly  one  was  employed. This one  had  taken  his\r\n\r\nSenior  Cambridge examination and, after a year  of\r\n\r\nunemployment, had at last got a job as  a  watchman\r\n\r\nat $4.75 a day. When he looked at me wondering what\r\n\r\nmy  opinion was, I said, \"You are very lucky to  be\r\n\r\nemployed.  Never mind false pride. Take it  on  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of your family.\" I asked the  young  men\r\n\r\naround  him. One said, \"I too applied for the  post\r\n\r\nof watchman, but there were so many applying that I\r\n\r\ncould not get the job.\" What about the others,  who\r\n\r\nwere not highly educated? They would not be able to\r\n\r\nget jobs even as casual labourers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case of another man, who had a good\r\n\r\njob and then was retrenched. He has a large family.\r\n\r\nAfter a desperate search for a job, he gave up  and\r\n\r\nhis  young son who had just left school managed  to\r\n\r\nget  a job as an apprentice at a salary of slightly\r\n\r\nover $100 a month. The whole family, about five  or\r\n\r\nsix  of  them,  are  dependent on  this  particular\r\n\r\nyoungster.  Naturally, he cannot  make  ends  meet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  the schools are producing thousands  of\r\n\r\nyoungsters. Youngsters are leaving the  schools  by\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  looking for jobs,  and  instead  of\r\n\r\nfinding  more  jobs  in  Singapore,  they  find   a\r\n\r\nsituation where jobs are decreasing in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have read out statistics to prove that\r\n\r\nsince 1957 there are probably something like 15,000\r\n\r\nto 17,000 jobs less than before. It is against this\r\n\r\nbackground  that you have to study this problem  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest. Yesterday in the  Sunday  Mail,\r\n\r\nSir, we had almost a full-page article entitled \"In\r\n\r\nSearch  of  a Job\". The article describes  how  the\r\n\r\nwriter  in 1945 found he could choose any  of  four\r\n\r\njobs. Today there is just a scramble. There are the\r\n\r\njob-seekers, but there are no jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance was optimistic that\r\n\r\nhis  industrial plans could be effected and he went\r\n\r\nto  Japan optimistically trying to attract Japanese\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  When he came back, he  admitted  that\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese investors were worried because of the\r\n\r\npossibility of more labour troubles when they had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvested  their  capital in Singapore  enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe  question now is this: who are responsible  for\r\n\r\nthese   labour  troubles?  Some  people   say   the\r\n\r\nCommunists are responsible. When I spoke to some of\r\n\r\nthese   workers,   they   admitted   that,   viewed\r\n\r\nselfishly, they liked these labour troubles because\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  every strike they  gained  higher\r\n\r\nwages. One cannot but view sympathetically when  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the problems simply from that angle.  But\r\n\r\nthey  have  to see that if by getting  an  increase\r\n\r\nthey  thereby  penalise their unemployed  sons  and\r\n\r\ndaughters,  that price may be too high.  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat, instead  of  viewing this problem  from  two\r\n\r\nsides - we  usually  talk  about  two  sides   to   a\r\n\r\nquestion - we  should  view it this  time  from  four\r\n\r\nsides.  There is the viewpoint of the  workers.  We\r\n\r\nare  all very much in favour of giving them  higher\r\n\r\nand  higher  wages.  The Government  has  a  grouse\r\n\r\nagainst  me  in particular because I have  kept  on\r\n\r\ndigging at them because of the pay-cuts. We are all\r\n\r\nin  favour, if the Government earns more, it  gets\r\n\r\nmore revenue, and we want better treatment for  the\r\n\r\nemployees.  In the same way, if the employers  earn\r\n\r\nmore  and  make more profits, we want higher  wages\r\n\r\nfor their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look at it from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nmerchants, the investors, the capitalists. If  they\r\n\r\ndump  money  into  Singapore, they expect  returns.\r\n\r\nJust  two weeks ago, a man was telling me  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  building a factory. I asked him, \"Where?\" \"Not\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,\" he said. Where? Johore Bahru.  That\r\n\r\nmeans  more  employment for the people  across  the\r\n\r\ncauseway  and not enough employment, for  us  here.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the investors look at it from the  angle\r\n\r\nof profits themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at it from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nunemployed. I sometimes wonder whether they  should\r\n\r\nnot  be allowed to organise themselves into another\r\n\r\ntrade  union in this situation where in  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests,  if  industrial unrest  reaches  a  high\r\n\r\nproportion,  they could demand that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  step  in  and compel every  dispute  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted to arbitration. Perhaps when we  look  at\r\n\r\nit  in  that  light from the point of view  of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed, we see reason, we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee that there is need for another approach to this\r\n\r\nproblem,  not merely for ourselves, but of  service\r\n\r\nto the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the other people the general\r\n\r\npublic?  The  general public suffer inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe  general public are made up of not only  people\r\n\r\nwho  are unemployed, but they are also made  up  of\r\n\r\nthe  wives and children of the strikers. I remember\r\n\r\ntalking to one trade union leader who led a  strike\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore Traction Company for  over  five\r\n\r\nmonths  and the Communists supplied him with  money\r\n\r\nto enable him to go on with the strike. But he said\r\n\r\na  year  after that when he had seen the sufferings\r\n\r\nof the wives of the strikers and their children, he\r\n\r\ndecided that thereafter if he could find a  way  of\r\n\r\nsolving  a deadlock without a strike, he  would  do\r\n\r\nit.  The  strike would be  the last weapon  and  the\r\n\r\nlast  resort, because innocent people would be made\r\n\r\nto  suffer.  I  hope, Sir, that  we  look  at  this\r\n\r\nproblem  of industrial unrest therefore not  merely\r\n\r\nfrom  the  view  point  of  the  workers  and   the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, but also from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nunemployed in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say it is natural that in a strike\r\n\r\nthere  is a clash of interests. Any political Party\r\n\r\nmust  be  on the side of the workers, it is agreed.\r\n\r\nBut  let  us  look at it from another angle,  using\r\n\r\nanother approach. Why should the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the employers clash? Are not these two\r\n\r\nlike  the  wings of a bird? If we damage one  wing,\r\n\r\nwhat  happens to the bird? It cannot fly any more.\r\n\r\nif  we can look at it in that way, that workers and\r\n\r\nemployers both play important parts, that both  are\r\n\r\nlike  the wings of a bird, and if both are  equally\r\n\r\nstrong and cooperating, the bird can fly to greater\r\n\r\nheights  and Singapore can reap greater prosperity,\r\n\r\nand  this  prosperity  can  be  shared  among  more\r\n\r\npeople.  The unemployed will have a chance in  life\r\n\r\nand  the young people coming out from schools  will\r\n\r\nhave  a future they can look forward to. If we  can\r\n\r\nlook  at  it from that point of view, Sir, then  we\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  hope  of  solving  this  problem   of\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest. But if we look at it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the point of view of a political struggle,  if\r\n\r\none  Party must outbid the other Party, then,  Sir,\r\n\r\nGod help the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, industrial unrest is\r\n\r\nnot  peculiar  to  Singapore. It is  a  feature  of\r\n\r\nindustrialised  or  industrialising  societies  all\r\n\r\nover the world, in England today, the Government is\r\n\r\nfaced with balance of payments difficulties, and to\r\n\r\noffset  inflationary  pressures  for  general  wage\r\n\r\nincreases,  has  refused civil service  claims  for\r\n\r\nimprovements in pay and conditions, with the result\r\n\r\nthat teachers, local government employees technical\r\n\r\nstaff, postal clerks and civil service clerks,  who\r\n\r\nare  the  traditional moderates of the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  in  England, have been  forced  into  the\r\n\r\nfront line of the industrial battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strike can arise for a variety of reasons and\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily because of a dispute  about  wages\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of  work. In the  B.O.A.C. strike\r\n\r\nwhich  took place last July, the engineering  staff\r\n\r\nwere   up  in  arms  against  the  reorganisational\r\n\r\nprogramme  of the management with which  the  union\r\n\r\ndisagreed,  even though the management could  prove\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  reorganisation, not a single  worker\r\n\r\nwould  lose  his  job.  The P.A.P.  Government  has\r\n\r\nconsistently  been pro-worker. The first  thing  we\r\n\r\ndid  as  a Government was to amend the Trade  Union\r\n\r\nOrdinance to give the Registrar of Trade Unions the\r\n\r\npower  to  cancel the registration of trade  unions\r\n\r\nwho  were  splinter or yellow unions and to  refuse\r\n\r\nregistration to dissident groups who sought to  set\r\n\r\nup    breakaway   unions.   This   prevented    the\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of  the  trade  union   movement   by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we did was to ensure that the\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  were  enforced.  All  employers  were\r\n\r\nrequired  to send in returns of their employees  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and  whenever a report  reached  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  that  the  labour  laws  were  not  being\r\n\r\nobserved, an inspector was sent round to make an on-the-spot enquiry. If the enquiry disclosed that  an\r\n\r\nemployer   was  not  observing  the  labour   laws,\r\n\r\nimmediate action was taken to compel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompliance.  The Labour Court was strengthened  and\r\n\r\nemployees who were wrongfully dismissed or who were\r\n\r\ndenied the benefits of the labour legislation  were\r\n\r\ngiven  every facility to claim payments in lieu  of\r\n\r\narrears of overtime pay and annual leave which  had\r\n\r\nbeen denied to them. A sum of more than $1\u00bd million\r\n\r\nwas  recovered  from employers for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\ntheir employees in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the unions, legislation was enacted to\r\n\r\nmake it obligatory for all collective agreements to\r\n\r\nbe registered with the Industrial Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nand   every  registered  collective  agreement   is\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  Government Gazette.  Where  the\r\n\r\nparties  fail  to reach agreement,  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court,  which  is  constituted  by  an\r\n\r\nindependent Chairman and two members, each of  whom\r\n\r\nis  drawn  from  a  panel of  employers  and  union\r\n\r\nnominees,  is empowered to take evidence  from  the\r\n\r\ndisputing  parties and to make an award.  Both  the\r\n\r\naward  and  the  registered agreement  are  legally\r\n\r\nenforceable by the Court. The Court has  the  power\r\n\r\nin   trade   disputes  to  fix   wages,   salaries,\r\n\r\nallowances  and  other remuneration by  prescribing\r\n\r\ntime  rates, piece work rates, salary scales, bonus\r\n\r\npayments, severance pay, retirement benefits, or to\r\n\r\nmake  other prescriptions which it considers to  be\r\n\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the same legislation provides ample\r\n\r\nmachinery for conciliation when a trade dispute  is\r\n\r\nthreatened  or  arises and recourse to  arbitration\r\n\r\ncan  be  had  by a joint request by the  contending\r\n\r\nparties  or  by a reference of the dispute  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  by  the  Minister and, in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service or the essential  services,  by\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 15th September, 1960 to 31st\r\n\r\nDecember,  1960,  eight awards  were  made  by  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court in industrial disputes\r\n\r\nand a total of 121 collective agreements covering a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  36,269  employees  were  certified   and\r\n\r\nregistered  by  the Court. Up to  date,  there  are\r\n\r\neight  cases pending before the Court, two of which\r\n\r\nare considered to be major disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the machinery for\r\n\r\nconciliation and settlement of industrial  disputes\r\n\r\nis being used by the bona fide union leaders in the\r\n\r\nnon-Communist unions. But these facts by themselves\r\n\r\ndo  not give us a true picture of what is happening\r\n\r\nin the trade union field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 45 strikes and lockouts in 1960\r\n\r\ninvolving  5,939 workers and 152,005 man-days  were\r\n\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The split in the trade union movement between\r\n\r\nunions affiliated to the S.A.T.U group of Communist-controlled  trade unions and unions not so  aligned\r\n\r\ntook  place in July last year. From the  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1961,  to  the  31st  January,  1962,  there   were\r\n\r\naltogether  96 strikes as compared to 27  only  for\r\n\r\nthe first six months of 1961. Of the 96 strikes, 69\r\n\r\nwere called by the unions affiliated to the S.A.TU.\r\n\r\ngroup,  24  by unions not so aligned and  three  by\r\n\r\nemployees  not presented by any union.  Of  the  69 strikes  called  by  the S.A.T.U. group  of  trade unions,   25  strikes  involved  expatriate   firms whereas only six of the 24 strikes called by unions not   aligned   to   the  S.A.T.U. group   involved expatriate employers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty of the 31 strikes against expatriate\r\n\r\nemployers  were  called by the  Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses Employees' Union, two by the Singapore Motor\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees'  Union and  one  each  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  General Employees' Union, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSpinning  Workers'  Union and  the  Singapore  Shoe\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger number of strikes called against\r\n\r\nexpatriate employers by the S.A.T.U. group of trade\r\n\r\nunions is clearly indicative of an intention on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  leaders of this group of  unions  to\r\n\r\ncreate dissatisfaction against foreign capital.  It\r\n\r\nhas been noticeable that whereas the pickets in the\r\n\r\nstrikes  called by the non-aligned group  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions   were   comparatively  well  behaved,   the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  strikers in strikes  called  by  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group  was  aggressive  and   offensive.\r\n\r\nEuropean   executives  of  the  firms  were   often\r\n\r\nassaulted  and  subjected  to  various   forms   of\r\n\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison of the strike action taken by the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group of trade unions in the same  period\r\n\r\nthat the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachinery for conciliation and settlement of  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes has been working for the benefit  of  bona\r\n\r\nfide  trade unionists .shows clearly that there  is\r\n\r\nample  machinery provided by law for the settlement\r\n\r\nof  trade disputes where these disputes spring from\r\n\r\ngenuine grievances; hut where the industrial unrest\r\n\r\nis  simulated  and created for political  purposes,\r\n\r\nthe  Communists invariably resort to direct  action\r\n\r\nby-passing the conciliation machinery available  to\r\n\r\nthem  and  forcing  settlements by  way  of  direct\r\n\r\nstrike action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done in defiance of Government policy for\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of industrial peace with justice and\r\n\r\nlends support to the forecast of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  this  House  on the 20th July,  1961,  when  he\r\n\r\npointed out that after the open split of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  possibility that the  pro-Communists\r\n\r\nwould   mount  an  offensive  in  the  labour   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  other fields. I would  refer  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers to Legislative Assembly Debates, Volume 14,\r\n\r\nNo. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the question of industrial unrest,\r\n\r\nwe  must  therefore be very careful to  distinguish\r\n\r\ngenuine  industrial unrest from  industrial  unrest\r\n\r\nsimulated or created for political purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the S.A.T.U. group of pro-Communist trade\r\n\r\nunions  are always seeking to do is not to  advance\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the workers per  se  as  this  is\r\n\r\nalways  to them a subsidiary consideration  hut  to\r\n\r\nconvert genuine grievances into political campaigns\r\n\r\nagainst  the Government. For instance, in the  case\r\n\r\nof   the   Robinson's  strike  there  was   genuine\r\n\r\nprovocation offered to the workers by the  employer\r\n\r\nbut  Messrs. Dominic Puthucheary and company  never\r\n\r\nintended   to  take  the  dispute  to  the   Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry. Strike Acton was taken, the main business\r\n\r\nentrance of the company was obstructed and when the\r\n\r\npolice  had  to  remove  the  picketers  who   were\r\n\r\nillegally   obstructing  the  entrance  under   the\r\n\r\npretence  that they were picketing, a demonstration\r\n\r\nwas  mounted against the police and the Government.\r\n\r\nThere were many witnesses of this demonstration and\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  police  vans  turned up  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nremoving  those who were illegally obstructing  the\r\n\r\nmain entrance. Dominic Puthucheary was seen by mans\r\n\r\nto  urge  all the strikers to get into  the  police\r\n\r\nvans to go to the police station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prosecution was brought against those who were\r\n\r\nguilty  of  obstruction but  this  prosecution  was\r\n\r\nlater  withdrawn by the State Advocate-General  as,\r\n\r\non  a  closer  examination of the case,  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General thought that the strikers had been\r\n\r\nmisled   into  their  foolish  actions  by  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary and company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Labour officials arc  posted  on\r\n\r\nduty  at  establishments affected  by  strikes  and\r\n\r\npolice  assistance is sought whenever  violence  is\r\n\r\nresorted  to  either  by the picketers  or  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers. As a result of the close watch  kept  on\r\n\r\nthese  establishments by labour officials, a number\r\n\r\nof   prosecutions  have  been  instituted   against\r\n\r\nemployees  who  have  been  involved  in  acts   of\r\n\r\nviolence whilst picketing, and an employer has also\r\n\r\nbeen  charged for assault of an employee  during  a\r\n\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers, too, have failed to learn that\r\n\r\ntheir disputes can be processed in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe   provisions   of   the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  We  have seen recently  a  bad  example\r\n\r\nwhich the members of the Exchange Banks Association\r\n\r\nhave set by refusing clearing facilities to members\r\n\r\nof the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhenever there was an industrial dispute in one  of\r\n\r\ntheir  associated  banks. This was  done  to  bring\r\n\r\npressure on the union to get a settlement on  their\r\n\r\nterms  without  any  regard to the  merits  of  the\r\n\r\nunion's  claims. They would have been the first  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  that  the union was acting  irresponsibly\r\n\r\nand  unreasonably if it decided to call out all its\r\n\r\nworkers  whenever  there was an industrial  dispute\r\n\r\nwith any member of the Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has drawn the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  House  to Table IV of the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Industrial Arbitration Court,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  eight  pending  cases  are  listed,  and  to\r\n\r\nsection 29 of the Ordinance which requires cases to\r\n\r\nbe  heard  expeditiously by the Court.  The  latest\r\n\r\ninformation  I have received in a letter  from  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court dated 16th March is that the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  pending cases has been reduced  as  the\r\n\r\nleast  important of these cases are presently being\r\n\r\ndealt with. No new cases have been notified to  the\r\n\r\nCourt and he expects the Straits Times case to  end\r\n\r\nwithin  a fortnight and the only other big case  is\r\n\r\nthe  Standard  Vacuum  Oil Company  case  which  is\r\n\r\nexpected to begin on the 19th May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has also referred to the\r\n\r\nstrike  of  the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation\r\n\r\nand  suggested that if a Board of Enquiry had  been\r\n\r\nappointed  under  section 7 of  the  Ordinance  the\r\n\r\nstrike might have been avoided. This strike, as  he\r\n\r\nvery  well knows, was not over wages and conditions\r\n\r\nof service but because the management had attempted\r\n\r\nto   deal  with  some  of  their  employees  on  an\r\n\r\nindividual  basis  at  a time  when  the  bank  was\r\n\r\nnegotiating  new  terms  with  the  Bank  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion.  The union had come to know about  this  and\r\n\r\nhad  asked  for  an expression of regret  from  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  an undertaking by  the  management\r\n\r\nthat  it would in future deal exclusively with  the\r\n\r\nunion.  But this request of the union was  refused,\r\n\r\nwith the result that the strike was called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no question which could have been put\r\n\r\nto  a  Board of Enquiry for determination. The bank\r\n\r\neventually saw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe error of its ways and it has been reported that\r\n\r\na  sum  of  $30,000  was paid to  the  union  by  a\r\n\r\nDirector of the Bank to compensate the workers  for\r\n\r\nthe  period  when they remained away from  work.  I\r\n\r\ncannot see how a hard-headed businessman could have\r\n\r\nmade  such a settlement with the union if the  bank\r\n\r\nhad been without blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has said that all trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  which are dead-locked should be  referred\r\n\r\nto  the  Court for arbitration, but the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson has mentioned in this House that when he  was\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  and the Member for  Cairnhill  was\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Welfare, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  had advised his Chief Minister  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  opposed to compulsory arbitration, because  he\r\n\r\nwas  of the view that nothing should be put in  the\r\n\r\nway  to  prevent  the  unions  reaching  negotiated\r\n\r\nagreements  with their employers even if industrial\r\n\r\naction had to be resorted to for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also referred to a\r\n\r\ncase  where a secret ballot was held but the  party\r\n\r\nthat   lost  in  that  secret  ballot  nevertheless\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  strike. Sir, the  Labour  Department\r\n\r\nconcluded a total of 21 secret ballots since August\r\n\r\n1959 to settle the question of union representation\r\n\r\nin  all cases, the employers accepted the result of\r\n\r\nthe ballots and gave recognition to the union which\r\n\r\nwon  a  majority vote. Only in one case, the  union\r\n\r\nwith  a minority of votes continued to strike after\r\n\r\na  secret ballot had been conducted. This  was  the\r\n\r\nHwa  Heng  Rubber Company case and  eventually  the\r\n\r\ncompany duly recognised the union that won  in  the\r\n\r\nballot.  The  strike was nevertheless continued  by\r\n\r\nthe  union representatives of the minority  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson referred to the loss of\r\n\r\nearnings of the workers. He made the point that the\r\n\r\nworkers  got  a better deal when he was  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  than they get now. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\naverage  daily earnings of manual workers  in  1955\r\n\r\nwas  74  cents  as  against  65  cents  in  1954 - an\r\n\r\nincrease of nine cents. In the last six years,  the\r\n\r\nhourly  earnings  have  increased  by  another  six\r\n\r\ncents, that is, up to 80 cents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  hour.  Sir, there is a reason  given  for  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  9  cents average hourly  earnings  of\r\n\r\nworkers from 1954 to 1955, and our economist  tells\r\n\r\nus  that  this  is  probably due  to  the  economic\r\n\r\neffects on wage earnings felt as late as 1955 after\r\n\r\nthe boom in trade as a result of the Korean war  in\r\n\r\n1951-52.  Sir,  reasons have  been  given  for  the\r\n\r\ngradual  increase of the hourly rate from  1955  to\r\n\r\n1961, and it is suggested that after 1955 there was\r\n\r\na   gradual   decline  in  trading  conditions   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  resulting from the  world  recession  in\r\n\r\ntrade which reached its height in 1958. This caused\r\n\r\nmany   establishments  in  Singapore  to   retrench\r\n\r\nworkers, others to close down and workers were  put\r\n\r\non  a  rotation basis. There were also restrictions\r\n\r\non   trade   imposed  by  neighbouring   countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly Indonesia, which affected  the  rubber\r\n\r\nmilling industry and the copra industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we as a Government have implemented our\r\n\r\npolicy of industrial peace with justice, and  since\r\n\r\nwe have been in Government, we have done everything\r\n\r\nto advance the cause of the workers without killing\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise, on which the entrepot  economy\r\n\r\nof Singapore is based. We have not been able to put\r\n\r\nan  end  to  the  exploitation of  the  workers  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers, but we  have  reduced  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  their  exploitation  and   have\r\n\r\nensured  that all workers get the benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  which  have been  enacted  for  their\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to take immediate action to plug the\r\n\r\nloop-holes  in  the  present  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance which enable the had employers as well as\r\n\r\nthe pro-Communists in the S.A.T.U. group to by-pass\r\n\r\nthe lawful channels of conciliation, settlement  or\r\n\r\narbitration which have been placed at the  disposal\r\n\r\nof  all bona, fide trade unions and good employers.\r\n\r\nThe   recommendations  of  the  President  of   the\r\n\r\nindustrial Arbitration Court are now being  closely\r\n\r\nstudied  by Government and action will be  taken  to\r\n\r\ngive  effect  to  the  improvements  which  he  has\r\n\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson said earlier on, in moving his amendment\r\n\r\nto  the  motion,  that he wanted  to  restore  some\r\n\r\nsemblance of balance to the industrial picture.

Government. That  workers\r\n\r\nhave   to  struggle  at  heavy  odds  against   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists is a painful fact known to all workers.\r\n\r\nThe  workers  know  from their own  experience  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  they  have  to  face  and  the  class\r\n\r\nstruggle  they have to undergo in order  that  they\r\n\r\nmay earn enough to keep themselves, their wives and\r\n\r\ntheir  children from starvation, and in order  that\r\n\r\nthey may raise their standard of living. Getting  a\r\n\r\nsmall   increase  in  wages  from   the   rapacious\r\n\r\ncapitalist  who  is making a huge profit  sometimes\r\n\r\ncan be as difficult and as impossible as trying  to\r\n\r\nsqueeze blood out of a stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless the struggle goes on unceasingly and\r\n\r\nunremittingly.  As  has been  pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Anson,  it  goes  on  in  all  modern\r\n\r\ncountries - in  the  United States  of  America, the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom.  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,\r\n\r\nFrance; all over the world. And it goes on also  in\r\n\r\nMalaya and in Singapore. Thousands and thousands of\r\n\r\nman-days  are  lost,  usually not  because  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  wanting  it  but because  of  the  stupid,\r\n\r\nunreasonable   and   stubborn   attitude   of   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and  the employers  in  resisting  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate demands of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of the struggle of the\r\n\r\nworkers,  we  now  have  the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nexpressing grave concern, as he calls it,  for  the\r\n\r\nso-called  industrial unrest, and which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Anson   has   earlier  on   called   \"public\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of industrial dissatisfaction\".  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Sir, \"public manifestations of  industrial\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction\"   is  an  ingenious   phrase   and\r\n\r\ncertainly   is  a  phrase  more  appropriate   than\r\n\r\n\"industrial unrest\". Because when one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalks  of  industrial unrest, one is  automatically\r\n\r\nled to think of quelling the unrest, and this would\r\n\r\nsuit  the P.A.P. very much and lots of other people\r\n\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, there is undoubtedly a large\r\n\r\nsection of workers bubbling over with their pent-up\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction. This is not a difficult  thing  to\r\n\r\nrecognize.  All  we  have to do  is  just  to  look\r\n\r\naround. Neither is this the thing which we all need\r\n\r\nexpress  grave concern or alarm about. And a  false\r\n\r\nalarm,  Sir,  is  not  only  mischievous  but  also\r\n\r\nmisleading to all concerned, and it will  certainly\r\n\r\ndo  nobody any good. Except, of course, people  who\r\n\r\nwant to suppress the legitimate aspirations of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy to paint a horrifying picture of\r\n\r\nthe  labour turmoil in Singapore today. All one has\r\n\r\nto do is to point an accusing finger at the workers\r\n\r\nand  their  trade  unions,  or  their  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders, and then start listing the crimes and  the\r\n\r\nsins  of  the  workers, the number of strikes  that\r\n\r\nhave taken place, the number of man-days lost,  the\r\n\r\ndamage  done  to  the economy of  the  island,  the\r\n\r\nfright  and  the  flight of capital  on  which  the\r\n\r\nworkers  depend for their employment and  survival,\r\n\r\nand  so  on  and so forth. The vicious forces  will\r\n\r\nperhaps be quick to say - and on this the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  has joined in in quickly mouthing  the  same\r\n\r\nplatitude - that  this  is all caused  by  subversive\r\n\r\nelements  and the Communists. From this  reasoning,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  would  appear  that  had  there  been  no\r\n\r\nCommunists and such people, there would  have  been\r\n\r\nno  strikes and no industrial unrest. What a simple\r\n\r\nsolution it would be if only it were true. All  you\r\n\r\nhave to do is to finish off the subversives and the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  you  get rid of - according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance - the labour plague. The trouble\r\n\r\nis  this:  this sort of simple formula simply  does\r\n\r\nnot  exist,  and  it  can never work.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and the subversives are finished off  or\r\n\r\nnot,  labour will forever be in ferment,  at  least\r\n\r\nuntil we get a more equal and just society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Does the S.P.A. really believe\r\n\r\nthat peace will prevail and tranquillity will reign\r\n\r\nonly  if  there  are a few more Arbitration  Courts\r\n\r\nfunctioning?  What  does the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nmean  by  the  term \"reasonable\"?

We  had occasion to  refer  to  this\r\n\r\nbefore,  Sir,It is that the Prime Minister  has  a\r\n\r\nmuch  better  command of the English language,  and\r\n\r\nwhen he formulated his labour policy, it came to be \r\n\r\nknown   as   \"industrial   peace   with   justice\".\r\n\r\nIndustrial  peace  with justice! What  a  wonderful\r\n\r\nphrase! For neither the capitalists nor the workers\r\n\r\ncan  disagree with this perfect terminology.  Peace\r\n\r\nand  justice  are what the capitalists want.  Peace\r\n\r\nand  justice are what the workers want. It  may  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that, on the face of it, both the capitalists\r\n\r\nand  the  workers  appear to have very  significant\r\n\r\ncommon  ground  in this slogan of industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice. But peace and justice are not merely\r\n\r\nthings  of  absolute standard, things abstract  and\r\n\r\nvague.  When  these  concepts are  translated  into\r\n\r\nrealities,  they  assume definite  forms  and  have\r\n\r\ndefinite  meanings.  Thus  it  is  that  when   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and the employers talk  of  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  they mean that the workers should  not  make\r\n\r\ndemands on them. They mean that the workers  should\r\n\r\nbe  obedient,  pliable and be  subservient  to  the\r\n\r\nbosses. They mean that the workers should not  talk\r\n\r\nof  joining  trade unions and ask for higher  wages\r\n\r\nand  better working conditions. By industrial peace\r\n\r\nthey  also  mean,  of course, that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be on the side of the employers,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not hesitate to put the  workers\r\n\r\nin  their  places by using the police and  the  law\r\n\r\ncourts  on the workers, arresting their leaders  in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions,  and  dissolving  forcibly  the\r\n\r\nworking   class   organisations.   Sir,   to    the\r\n\r\ncapitalists, industrial peace means that, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and their trade unions should  be  so\r\n\r\nweakened and so disorganised as not to be  able  to\r\n\r\nassert themselves in any legitimate way. This  sort\r\n\r\nof industrial peace confers on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  capitalists  and the employers  the  right  to\r\n\r\nexploit,  bully, oppress and suppress the  workers,\r\n\r\nand  this  was  the kind of industrial  peace  that\r\n\r\nprevailed in Singapore during the lime of  the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  Government. But it was industrial  peace\r\n\r\nthat was devoid of justice. This type of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  is  a  dangerous peace, because the  pent-up\r\n\r\nfeelings  of the workers will inevitably burst  the\r\n\r\nlid  wide open and disaster will inevitably follow.\r\n\r\nSo let us not lose our sense of proportion, because\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace  by itself is not  necessarily  a\r\n\r\nvirtue,  just  as  industrial  dissatisfaction   or\r\n\r\nunrest is not necessarily a vice. By this, I do not\r\n\r\nmean  to  suggest that I am in favour of industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.  What I would like to say is  that  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  can  no  longer tolerate their  oppressive\r\n\r\nworking conditions, then it is perfectly legitimate\r\n\r\nand necessary that they organise themselves and try\r\n\r\nto  do  something to improve their lot  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of the law. This is the basic  right  of\r\n\r\nworkers, a right now recognised the world over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody talks of industrial peace these\r\n\r\ndays,  but it is easier to talk of industrial peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice  than to carry it out. The  important\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  justice for whom?  Justice  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers or justice for the employers? That  is  the\r\n\r\nrub. If it is going to be justice for both then the\r\n\r\ninterests of both parties must be reconciled. It is\r\n\r\nno  mean  task  trying to reconcile  two  different\r\n\r\npoles   of   interests.  It  means  doing   justice\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  to  two  antagonistic  classes   of\r\n\r\npeople.  This  task is rendered more difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe simple reason that justice cannot be split into\r\n\r\nhalves.  You  cannot  have  half  justice  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers and half justice for the workers. It just\r\n\r\ncannot be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present context of our society the\r\n\r\nemployers,    generally    speaking,    enjoy    an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  advantage over the workers  and  more\r\n\r\noften  than  not justice is denied to the  workers.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  what justice can there  be  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers  when their employers acquire the help  and\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  weighty  police  force  in  their\r\n\r\ndealings with the workers? It is a recognised fact,\r\n\r\nSir, that the law is weighted heavily on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nside of the employers.

They then  call  it  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.  Is this not a mockery, an irony, the  peace\r\n\r\nof  the  wilderness?  It is important,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government makes  its  policy  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace  with justice  a  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nliving  reality  especially with reference  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers who, in their unfortunate position  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  today, are yet to receive a just and  fair\r\n\r\nshare of the fruits of their labour. Of course, for\r\n\r\nthis  to  take place, for a just and fair share  of\r\n\r\nthe  fruits  of  their labour to be   given  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  it will have to mean that the  Government\r\n\r\nthat implements the policy of industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice  must necessarily he a worker's government.\r\n\r\nIt will mean that the aim of the Government must be\r\n\r\nto  encourage  and  to build up a strong  socialist\r\n\r\nmovement both in the trade union field as  well  as\r\n\r\nin the political field so as to realise a socialist\r\n\r\nsociety within the shortest possible time. It  will\r\n\r\nmean  that the Government, with the cooperation  of\r\n\r\nthe   trade  union  movement, should  allow   free\r\n\r\nenterprise  to  function before  the  coining  into\r\n\r\nbeing  of  a socialist society, provided such  free\r\n\r\nenterprise  does  not  hamper  the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  movement in general and the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the pre-requisites if the policy\r\n\r\nof  industrial peace with justice is  to  become  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful and living reality as far as the  people\r\n\r\nare concerned. Then the workers will not be unhappy\r\n\r\neven  if  it  means  that  they  have  to  exercise\r\n\r\nrestraint in their organised efforts and even if it\r\n\r\nmeans  that  they  have  to  put  up  with  certain\r\n\r\ntemporary hardships. Because the workers will  then\r\n\r\nknow  that the Government is really On their  side.\r\n\r\nThey will know that the Government will work in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the welfare of the people  and  will\r\n\r\nneed  their  help in the struggle ahead,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  then place their trust and confidence in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  when they have no reason to  doubt  its\r\n\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such conditions existed at one time, or so\r\n\r\nthe  workers thought. Thus it was that there was  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  industrial stability and calm following\r\n\r\nthe general elections in June 1959. Because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   workers  of  Singapore  in  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  thought and also felt at that  time  that\r\n\r\nthey   had  created  a  pro-labour  government;   a\r\n\r\ngovernment which they then felt confident would  do\r\n\r\njustice  to  labour  a  government  that  had  also\r\n\r\npledged  to work hand-in-hand with the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement   towards  bringing  about  the   earliest\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a socialist society.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  were  sporadic cases of  workers  showing  a\r\n\r\ntendency  to  over-exuberance as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nresurgence of their organised power. But  then  the\r\n\r\nunion  leadership  had  gone  out  of  its  way  to\r\n\r\nexercise a restraining influence on the excesses of\r\n\r\ntrade unions in industrial matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this post-election period was also the time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  employers did make efforts  to  readjust\r\n\r\nthemselves to the new political situation. They had\r\n\r\nto   readjust   themselves  to  the  realities   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  democracy  and to  the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  trade  union movement in  Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation the Government had no difficulty\r\n\r\nat  all  in  maintaining industrial stability.  The\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister   conveniently   attributed    and\r\n\r\narrogated  all  the  industrial  stability  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  wonderful and sagacious  Government.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately the confidence of the workers and  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions cannot be  gained by lip  service\r\n\r\nand tricky manoeuvres. If the workers are convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is only interested in its  own\r\n\r\nselfish  political  gains, that  it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\ninterested in working together with the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  for the building up of a strong socialist\r\n\r\nmovement,  that  it intends to depend  entirely  on\r\n\r\nforeign   capital   to  solve   the   problems   of\r\n\r\nunemployment difficulties, and that it  intends  to\r\n\r\nadvance the interests of foreign capitalists at the\r\n\r\nexpense  of the interests of the workers and  their\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, then the Government ceases to  be   a\r\n\r\ngovernment on the workers' side. It then ceases  to\r\n\r\nbe a workers' government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, industrial peace with justice has\r\n\r\nbecome a meaningless and an empty slogan. In  spite\r\n\r\nof  what  the Minister for Health and Law has  said\r\n\r\nand  his  efforts at trying to give a list  of  the\r\n\r\ngood  things  the P.A.P. has done for the  workers,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has lost the confidence of the workers.\r\n\r\nEverybody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknows the P.A.P. Government is no longer interested\r\n\r\nin  doing justice to the workers of Singapore.  All\r\n\r\nits talk of wanting social security as revealed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance shows how one-sided  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has become. The Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw  has  said  that  the P.A.P. is  a  pro-labour\r\n\r\nGovernment  and a pro-workers' Government.  But  he\r\n\r\nhas very conveniently forgotten to mention that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  banned  the  Federation  of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions,  has  not  lived  up  to  its  promise   of\r\n\r\nunification  of the trade union movement,  and  has\r\n\r\nwithdrawn the Trade Union Bill which was passed  by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.  All these things  are  very,  very\r\n\r\nconveniently forgotten. All the requisites for  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful   implementation  of   the   policy   of\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice are no longer present\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  today. The P.A.P. Government  has  now\r\n\r\nceased  to  struggle  for  the  ultimate  goal   of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a socialist society. The  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nmade   all   Left-wing   political   Parties    and\r\n\r\norganisations its bitter enemies, whether  they  be\r\n\r\nin  Singapore or in the Federation of Malaya or  in\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories. The Socialist  Conference\r\n\r\nrecently  held  in  Kula Lumpur and  to  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  invited  had  to  pass  a  resolution\r\n\r\nexpelling  the  P.A.P. from  the  conference.   As\r\n\r\neverybody  knows, the P.A.P. is now seeking  refuge\r\n\r\nunder  the banner of nationalism. The P.A.P. today\r\n\r\ndoes not call itself a socialist Party any more. It\r\n\r\ncalls   itself  a  nationalist  Party.  Even   that\r\n\r\numbrella  will not save it from doom. Now following\r\n\r\nits  change in policy, the P.A.P. Government  today\r\n\r\nincreasingly  allows  the  service  of  the   State\r\n\r\nmachinery  to  be  used by the  employers  for  the\r\n\r\nPurposes  of  union-busting. We  see  nowadays  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government eagerly rushing the police force,\r\n\r\nLabour  Ministry officials and even the law  courts\r\n\r\nto  the help of the employers whose sole purpose is\r\n\r\nto  break  the industrial action initiated  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers    through    their   own    trade    union\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very curious phenomenon has arisen in\r\n\r\ntoday's  curious political situation in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   police  force,  hitherto  trained   for   the\r\n\r\noppression of labourers and of the Chinese-educated\r\n\r\nis being used more and more to deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   strikers  who  are  predominantly   English-speaking commercial workers and who happen also  to\r\n\r\nbe   members   of  the  Singapore  Business   House\r\n\r\nEmployees Union. The police are supposed to enforce\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order as stipulated in the Trade Disputes\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  a law which the P.A.P. had  pledged  to\r\n\r\namend  to the advantage of the working people.  But\r\n\r\nnow  the  police are more and more  being  used  to\r\n\r\nbreak  strikes  and  to protect  non-union  workers\r\n\r\nworking  in strike-bound establishments. As regards\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ministry, it is known to have  provided\r\n\r\nfacilities  so  that expatriate  personnel  may  be\r\n\r\nemployed  to overcome difficulties arising  out  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  initiated  by  English-speaking\r\n\r\ncommercial workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this clearly indicates that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has indeed become anti-worker. I suppose\r\n\r\nit  is  only a matter of time before the Government\r\n\r\nwill  even  go  so far as to recruit blacklegs  and\r\n\r\nprovide   them  with  the  facilities   of   police\r\n\r\nprotection in order that they may go to work  in  a\r\n\r\nstrike-hound establishment and so break  a  strike,\r\n\r\nall because the organised workers do not see eye to\r\n\r\neye   with  the  Government -  a  discredited  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite clear, as I have said, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  gone  over  to  the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers. It finds more and more things in  common\r\n\r\nwith the capitalists and their Right-wing political\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, and less and less things in common\r\n\r\nwith  the  workers  and their  Left-wing  political\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  I  have no hesitation  in  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government, contrary to its  past\r\n\r\nprotestations,  is today pro-capitalist  and  anti-worker.  It  is  only a matter of time  before  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  goes all Out  in  resorting  to\r\n\r\nrepressive measures like those of the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  to maintain their so-called  industrial\r\n\r\npeace. The Minister for Finance hinted as much when\r\n\r\nhe said that the Government should deal firmly with\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see at the present moment late efforts being\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  P.A.P. Government  and  its  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  to induce Japanese capitalists to  invest\r\n\r\nin  this country. The Minister for Finance  on  his\r\n\r\nreturn from Tokyo on the 10th of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis month made a statement of censure against  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement. He said that the local labour\r\n\r\nin  Singapore was the key to Japanese investment in\r\n\r\nSingapore. By that he meant that the conduct of the\r\n\r\ntrade   union  movement  constituted  the  greatest\r\n\r\nobstacle  to foreign capital coming into  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor industrial investment. I would like to ask him,\r\n\r\nwhy  must  he  blame the labour situation?  Is  not\r\n\r\npolitical instability the real cause of the lack of\r\n\r\nindustrial investments? Surely he should know  that\r\n\r\nthe real plague on economy is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - political instability and the\r\n\r\nabout-to-topple position of the P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nIt is the distrust and the lack of confidence in  a\r\n\r\ndiscredited  Government in  an  unstable  political\r\n\r\nsituation  that  is the cause of non-investment  in\r\n\r\nthe industrial field. And crying Communism with the\r\n\r\nobject  of isolating the Barisan Sosialis will  not\r\n\r\nhelp matters. That is why I have said that what the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson has touched on is not conducive to\r\n\r\nindustrial   peace.  It  can   only   help   P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda. In fact, crying Communism will actually\r\n\r\nhelp to frighten away whatever investment there  is\r\n\r\nthat  may want to come to Singapore. This  fact  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  and  I wonder  if  the  Government\r\n\r\nrealises it. There is even an editorial comment  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh a week or so  ago  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  The  Government should  really  look  into\r\n\r\nthis.  It  will  not help the industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   it  will  not   help   to   solve\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one important fact that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment seems unable to understand. It  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  capitalists  are always on  the  look-out  for\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  pressure  the  Government   into\r\n\r\ntaking  anti-labour  measures.  Such  measures,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, will allow them to exploit the workers  and\r\n\r\nblackmail  the  Government at the same  time.  When\r\n\r\nthere  was  industrial stability immediately  after\r\n\r\nthe  last general elections, the complaints of  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists then were that high wages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  high  taxes  deterred  large-scale  industrial\r\n\r\ninvestment by private foreign capitalists. Now that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has lost the confidence of the  workers\r\n\r\nand  their  trade  unions, the  complaints  of  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  are that the conduct of the  organised\r\n\r\nworkers constitutes the greatest deterrent to  such\r\n\r\ninvestment. Well, the P.A.P. says the same thing as\r\n\r\nthe  capitalists say. Is this not evidence that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  already succumbing to the pressure  and\r\n\r\nblackmail of foreign capitalists? Let us  ask,  how\r\n\r\ncan  such  a  Government achieve genuine industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with  justice? Surely the  Government  knows\r\n\r\nthat  to achieve industrial peace with justice,  it\r\n\r\nneeds co-operation all round. As is well known  and\r\n\r\nas  repeated  time and again by the P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\npast,  it takes three parties to achieve industrial\r\n\r\npeace   with  justice - namely,  capital,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and the Government. Now with the Government\r\n\r\non  the  side  of the employers, how can  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave genuine industrial peace with justice? Let the\r\n\r\nGovernment explain. As far as foreign employers are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  they need very little encouragement  in\r\n\r\ntheir  policy  of  exploitation and  oppression  of\r\n\r\nworkers. Their conduct has been largely governed by\r\n\r\ntwo  main factors - the political situation  of  the\r\n\r\nday and the attitude of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is common knowledge that whenever there\r\n\r\nis   political   uncertainty,  the  employers   are\r\n\r\ninclined  to flex their muscles before the workers.\r\n\r\nWe  may still recall the speeches made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister immediately after the 1956 purge  when  he\r\n\r\nlaunched  very scathing attacks on employers  like\r\n\r\nthe  Naval Base authorities and the Tay Koh Yat Bus\r\n\r\nCompany.  That  was  the time when  many  employers\r\n\r\nthought  fit  to mount a capital offensive  against\r\n\r\nlabour, especially when the trade unions and  their\r\n\r\nleaders   had  been  severely  curbed.  A   similar\r\n\r\npolitical uncertainty prevails today in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of talk about Malaysia and\r\n\r\nthis  so-called  merger between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.   The  encouragement   employers   have\r\n\r\nreceived from statements made by political  leaders\r\n\r\nin the Federation is considerable,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticularly when the Government Ministers say that\r\n\r\nthere have been far more strikes than are desirable\r\n\r\nand   that  the  Federation  Government  will   not\r\n\r\ntolerate  the existence and expansion of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement in Singapore. May I refer, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nthe  statement made by the Tunku and printed by the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times on 12th January, saying  that  after\r\n\r\nmerger  \"we  will  try  to  reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstrikes.\"  These were the words of the Tunku,  Sir.\r\n\r\n\"I  do not know how he will do it, but our Minister\r\n\r\nof  internal Security will do it.\" Such words!  And\r\n\r\nthis  statement,  by the way, also  clearly  proves\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have said all along. The P.A.P. has  been\r\n\r\ntrying to tell the people that there is autonomy in\r\n\r\nthis  White Paper merger of theirs. This  statement\r\n\r\nof  the Tunku proves conclusively that there is  no\r\n\r\nautonomy -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They feel that they need no longer put\r\n\r\nup with the so-called nonsense of the employees and\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions, and they feel  that  they  must\r\n\r\nuphold   and   defend  their  so-called  management\r\n\r\nrights.  Sir, I am told provocation from such  type\r\n\r\nof  employers  constitutes a rich source  of  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes. The point is that such employers  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger   afraid  of  creating  disputes  with   the\r\n\r\nworkers,  when they know full well that  they  have\r\n\r\nthe  State machinery, the Labour Ministry and  even\r\n\r\nthe law courts all on their side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour situation in Singapore today is\r\n\r\nfurther  complicated by the Government deliberately\r\n\r\npursuing a policy of union rivalry. We all know for\r\n\r\na fact that it has always been the intention of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to dominate and monopolise the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  pity  of  it  is that this aspiration  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has turned out to be merely a pipe-dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government's patronage of certain trade\r\n\r\nunions  in Singapore is well known. Through Mr  C.\r\n\r\nV.  Devan Nair (whose salary I believe is paid  out\r\n\r\nof  State funds) and the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Culture, together with  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of the State machinery, the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ntrying to control as many trade unions as possible.\r\n\r\nThus you find certain pro-P.A.P. union boys running\r\n\r\naround  trying their level best to outdo  the  main\r\n\r\nstream  of  the  trade  union movement,  i.e.,  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  trade union movement. I understand  they\r\n\r\ngo  round  telling workers not to join unions  that\r\n\r\nare  non-P.A.P. And I stress \"non-P.A.P.\"  They  go\r\n\r\nround  promising workers heaven on  earth  if  they\r\n\r\nwould  only  join the P.A.P. unions.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ncause of many a strike in Singapore today. You will\r\n\r\nremember  the recent City Council workers'  strike.\r\n\r\nIt was actually sparked off because of A.U.P.E., of\r\n\r\nwhich  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  is its leader, fighting  against  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions of the daily-rated workers. Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  this is a clear case of union  rivalry\r\n\r\nsponsored by the P.A.P. And because of the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\npolicy  of  union rivalry, the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  greatly inconvenienced and the public  health\r\n\r\ngravely endangered. When it was clear to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunion boys that the City Council workers could  not\r\n\r\nbe  broken, they quickly beat a retreat and covered\r\n\r\nup  their  complete fiasco with a lot of  Communist\r\n\r\nbogey  propaganda, and blaming the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P.'s own machinations and intrigues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the P.A.P. for quite some time,\r\n\r\nSir, and we have learnt - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That we speak the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the maze of thinking that the\r\n\r\ntriumvirate of the P.A.P. indulge in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Similar warnings were given by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the hey-day when he was fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe rights of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Under different\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And I am merely repeating what\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  had himself  championed  with\r\n\r\ngreat  gusto  at  that time.

There  would  then  really  be  chaos\r\n\r\nbecause  mounting a capital offensive on labour  is\r\n\r\nsheer stupidity, sheer unadulterated stupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore situation of today, the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement is fully conscious that it has\r\n\r\nto  contend with three hostile forces. They are (1)\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government with its big stick  of  the\r\n\r\nState machinery, the Police Force, the Prisons, the\r\n\r\nLaw  Courts,  Senior Crown Counsel,  all  the  top-notchers, and so-called \"witnesses\"; (2) the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunion  boys  backed by the might of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  also by the Government's Police Force; and (3)\r\n\r\nthe  employers  who  look upon  Malaysia  as  their\r\n\r\nopportunity  for unleashing an attack on  the  main\r\n\r\nstream of the trade union movement. If these  three\r\n\r\nforces  flock  together and  join  forces  together\r\n\r\nagainst the main stream of the trade union movement\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  then  there  will  be  trouble  for\r\n\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, Sir, I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore will know wherein  lie\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of industrial  unrest.  Let  us\r\n\r\nhope that such a day will never arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it was not my intention\r\n\r\nto speak so early in the debate. But I feel that if\r\n\r\nI  am  given an hour to produce certain  facts  and\r\n\r\nfigures, it may perhaps help the other speakers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis to come more directly to  the\r\n\r\npoint. As the Leader of the House has indicated, we\r\n\r\nare  prepared to sit every night up till 12 o'clock\r\n\r\nto  listen to one harangue after another, and  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time, if we may, peacefully  make  a  few\r\n\r\ncomments, albeit humorously, on the futility of the\r\n\r\nclosed circuit mind. The speech that has just  been\r\n\r\nread  out by the Member for Queenstown, and  I  say\r\n\r\naccurately  read out by the Member for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nillustrates  the inability to think  out  of  fixed\r\n\r\nclassified situations. Governments that do not  toe\r\n\r\ntheir line are always pro-employer, supporting  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists,  and using the police  to  coerce  and\r\n\r\nintimidate the workers. Governments which  are  not\r\n\r\namenable  to  their  pressures  always  consist  of\r\n\r\ndesperate  men  who  are always  on  the  verge  of\r\n\r\ntoppling.   If   the   industrial   situation    is\r\n\r\nunquestionably worse, it cannot be because  of  any\r\n\r\nother  reason  connected with  the  unions  or  the\r\n\r\nwisdom  of their leadership, but surely it must  be\r\n\r\nbecause  the  employers have no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tragedy with the closed circuit mind is\r\n\r\nsimply this. It often produces contradictions.  One\r\n\r\nof  the first contradictions I want to point out to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown is that he has to make up\r\n\r\nhis  mind. If as he or his ghost writers would like\r\n\r\nus  to  believe, and like the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly the workers, to believe, we  are  pro-employer  and  pro-capitalist, and are  willing  to\r\n\r\nemploy  the  State machinery, that is, the  police,\r\n\r\nthe  courts and everything to crush and oppress the\r\n\r\nworkers, then surely this is an ideal situation for\r\n\r\nthe employers. On the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  hand,  they say employers  do  not  like  it\r\n\r\nbecause there is no stability, created by the  same\r\n\r\ninstability  which  the  forces  behind  them  have\r\n\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion speaks of mounting of industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.  Nobody has denied that. It is a  fact.  It\r\n\r\nalso talks of the Government's policy of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with  justice. There are certain  facts  and\r\n\r\nfigures  which have to be explained away  by  those\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the switch in the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist sector of the trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of 1960, there were only 5,939\r\n\r\nworkers  involved in strikes with a loss of 152,000\r\n\r\nman-days, compare  this to the  five  months  from\r\n\r\nAugust.  You will remember the fateful day when  we\r\n\r\nsat here till the early hours of the morning of the\r\n\r\n21st  of July. From August till December last year,\r\n\r\nthere were 39,000 workers involved in strike with a\r\n\r\nloss  of 370,000 man-days. In other words, in  five\r\n\r\nmonths,  after  the  break  following  Anson,   the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of man-days lost is 120  per\r\n\r\ncent extra, 220 per cent of the whole of 1960. This\r\n\r\nis a fact, a fact for which I claim not much credit\r\n\r\nin  predicting in July. What is all this about?  Is\r\n\r\nthere  a  change  in the industrial  situation?  Is\r\n\r\nthere  a  change  in policy of the Government?  Has\r\n\r\nthere  been  a  sudden  right about  turn - employers\r\n\r\nsacking  people  all  over the place  and  becoming\r\n\r\nunreasonable? A change took place in Anson when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. refused  to be brow-beaten  or  intimidated\r\n\r\ninto   taking  the  Communist-front  line  of   the\r\n\r\nabolition of the Internal Security Council and full\r\n\r\ninternal self-government. Once we said merger,  the\r\n\r\nfight  started  and  it  went  on  to  its  logical\r\n\r\nconclusion.  The fight is still going  on,  not  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  fight,  but  a  political  fight  using\r\n\r\nindustrial means to coerce the Government and upset\r\n\r\nthe  economy. I suggest to the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps this Government, having the advantage\r\n\r\nnot  only of having seen what happened in the  last\r\n\r\nseven  years since 1955, but also knowing the minds\r\n\r\nand  the  workings of the Communist cadres  in  the\r\n\r\nunions, is wise enough to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreat  this basically as a political and not as  an\r\n\r\nindustrial problem. It is not the shortage  or  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy  of  the machinery for conciliation  and\r\n\r\narbitration.  They are there. We can  quadruplicate\r\n\r\nit  and we can improve it a hundred thousand times.\r\n\r\nThe   men  who  mount  this  unrest  have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  intention of making use of  conciliation\r\n\r\nor arbitration proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain that out of the 96 strikes called\r\n\r\nlast year, 69 or 72 per cent of them were called by\r\n\r\nthe  unions  connected  with  the  Communist  front\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.  As I have explained earlier, the majority\r\n\r\nof  them  took  place  after August.  Let  me  just\r\n\r\ncompare  the  figures January/July last  year  with\r\n\r\nAugust/December. In January/July, there were  2,400\r\n\r\nworkers  involved in strikes with a loss of  40,000\r\n\r\nman-days  compared  to,  in  seven  months,   2,400\r\n\r\nworkers   and  40,000  man-days.  In  five   months\r\n\r\nAugust/December,  39,000 workers and  370,000  man-days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I wonder whether the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill  clarify  how many man-days  were  lost  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the City Council strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That may be so.

They\r\n\r\nwanted  a  fight, to slug it out, to have incidents\r\n\r\nwith  the  police,  to  have  incidents  with   the\r\n\r\nemployers,  to  try and sour up the  situation  and\r\n\r\nshow  the  workers, \"Look at the Government - wicked,\r\n\r\ncruel,  unjust.\" Two cases - Guthrie's and  William\r\n\r\nJacks' - had  to  be ordered by the Ministry  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court.  Only 15 cases  throughout  the\r\n\r\nwhole  period were referred to the Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\nby   the   Business  Houses  Employees  group   for\r\n\r\nconciliation. A minor puffing problem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how these disputes are fought out,\r\n\r\n\"for  the benefit of the workers,\" says the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown. I say, explain a few facts  away.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of  the Ford Motor  Engineering  and\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees Union, they went on strike  for\r\n\r\n110  days  and lost pay for 110 days and  ended  up\r\n\r\nwith a seven-cent per day increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Six cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Six cents.

They thought they could capture  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  coerce the Government and  rattle  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The net result is they  are  going  to\r\n\r\nlose. Many of them have found\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  jobs  because they have lost  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis forming the next  government  and\r\n\r\nwinning the next victory.

Only those\r\n\r\nwho   are  not  good  enough  to  look  for   other\r\n\r\nemployment are still hanging around, hoping somehow\r\n\r\nor  other that something may fall down from  heaven\r\n\r\nor the Barisan may give something to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give them another example for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the workers. There were four Shaw disputes, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  None of them was  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ministry even for conciliation, or  brought\r\n\r\nto  the notice of the Labour Ministry. They did not\r\n\r\nwant the Labour Ministry to intervene. They went on\r\n\r\nstrike  for  33  days  for  an  overtime  claim  of\r\n\r\narrears.  A  33-day strike. They have not  got  the\r\n\r\narrears. What they have definitely sustained  is  a\r\n\r\nloss of 33 days' wages. All they have succeeded  is\r\n\r\nto  get  the  matter  referred to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt,  which  they  could have done  and  achieved\r\n\r\nwithout  a  strike of 33 days. It is a  defeat.  It\r\n\r\nbrought  misery and suffering to the workers.  They\r\n\r\nthought, of course, why not increase the hostility?\r\n\r\nGovernment  moves  in  with  the  police  in  steel\r\n\r\nhelmets and batons. It is not as simple as that. If\r\n\r\nMembers   on  this  side  were  innocent,   stupid,\r\n\r\nguileless,   willing  tools   of   the   employers,\r\n\r\nreactionary  capitalists,  then  perhaps.  But   no\r\n\r\namount  of  harangue can convince  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore that they have never had a Government  so\r\n\r\ngood.  It  is  a  fact. They  have  never  had  the\r\n\r\nemployers  put in a position where they are  always\r\n\r\nwilling to talk, where reason and argument  is  the\r\n\r\nonly thing that can prevail. Now, Sir  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Police\r\n\r\naction,  repression,  broken bones,  broken  heads,\r\n\r\nfire  hoses? Never. But, of course, let me  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  admit  that it is the  business  of  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  prevent  people from  having  cigarette\r\n\r\nbutts stuck into their necks when they refuse to be\r\n\r\nintimidated,  it  is  the duty  of  the  police  to\r\n\r\nprevent  people from being assaulted  and  molested\r\n\r\nwhen  they  refuse to join or are being intimidated\r\n\r\nby  the unionists. But if the unionists want to  go\r\n\r\non  strike, let them. There is a limit beyond which\r\n\r\nthey cannot go, because beyond that limit the goose\r\n\r\nis  killed, the workers are put out of jobs, and it\r\n\r\nrebounds back on the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for hysteria. Everybody knows\r\n\r\nthe  situation  is a political one and  has  to  be\r\n\r\nsettled  politically.  I am  glad  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  has referred to the statement  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  of the Federation  about  the\r\n\r\nnumber of strikes in Singapore. There are two kinds\r\n\r\nof  strike,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. One  is  a  genuine\r\n\r\nindustrial  issue, not complicated  either  in  the\r\n\r\nissue or in the pushing of it by political factors.\r\n\r\nThese  cases can find settlement, sometimes with  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of difficulty, through strikes and other\r\n\r\nopen methods of protest, but always inevitably they\r\n\r\nend  up, with reason in arguments, in an agreement,\r\n\r\neither with or without conciliation with the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  or arbitration in the Arbitration  Court.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  sector that is the autonomy  of  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore after merger. And  it  is  our\r\n\r\nbusiness, with the experience that we have  gained,\r\n\r\nto make it really work. The principle of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with justice will work. There will  be  more\r\n\r\nArbitration  Courts. There will be more  reasonable\r\n\r\npeople  who will actually seek the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and of the people of Singapore. But  chaps\r\n\r\nrefuse  to have agreements which have any  finality\r\n\r\neven  for  a  relative period of time, and  of  the\r\n\r\nhundred over agreements made by the groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  S.G.E.U. and  the   Business\r\n\r\nHouses, there are only two cases that we have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  discover, on going through  the  records,\r\n\r\nwhere  there are salary scales.

What  these\r\n\r\nunions  want  is  a  constant state  of  industrial\r\n\r\nexcitement upon which they could expand  and  mount\r\n\r\ntheir world revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, these are facts and figures\r\n\r\nrelated  to  the  activities of  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\ncadres in the union.

The fact of the matter is  that\r\n\r\nafter  merger, internal security will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe Communist element of the political manipulation\r\n\r\nof unions will be checked and free play given to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  collective bargaining for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\narriving  at  an  agreement which is  fair  to  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the employee, to the workers  and  the\r\n\r\nState,   to   ensure   industrial   stability   for\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion, without which Members on  the\r\n\r\nother  side know full well that there will be utter\r\n\r\nchaos  and  disaster, but chaos and disaster  which\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  are quite prepared unabashedly  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  in  order that they can  bring  their\r\n\r\nworld revolution one step further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

That\r\n\r\nis  why  it is essential to find the cause  of  the\r\n\r\ndeterioration  in labour and capital  relationship.\r\n\r\nNo  matter  what the motive of the  mover  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is,  and  no matter how he  criticises  and\r\n\r\nridicules the Government in dealing with strikes, I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that during his term of office  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front  Government,  he  sided   with   the\r\n\r\ncapitalists and the employers, sent trade unionists\r\n\r\nto  gaol  and  used  the  police  to  intervene  in\r\n\r\nstrikes.   I  would  also  say  that  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment   did  not  only  fail  in   alleviating\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest but it also exploited the workers\r\n\r\nand  sided with the employers, thus giving rise  to\r\n\r\ngeneral  discontent among the workers. So  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that if the Member for Cairnhill is urging the\r\n\r\npresent Government to resort to similar tactics  in\r\n\r\ndealing with the industrial workers, then it  would\r\n\r\nbring about a worse situation than it is now.  This\r\n\r\nis because if this line is taken, all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore will do their best to counter-attack the oppression imposed on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present industrial unrest started during the\r\n\r\nsecond  half of last year when the Government  took\r\n\r\naction  to  close down the T.U.C. at  a  time  when\r\n\r\nthere  was a political crisis within the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower.  It  is  undoubtedly true that  the  present\r\n\r\ninstability  in  politics is one of  the  important\r\n\r\nfactors  of  industrial unrest. Before  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment Report was given in 1961, we were unable\r\n\r\nto find out the number of strikes in Singapore. But\r\n\r\nfrom  information published in newspapers, we  find\r\n\r\nthat  in  November last year there  were  about  20\r\n\r\nstrikes affecting some 33,000 workers with  a  loss\r\n\r\nof  a few hundred working days. An important strike\r\n\r\nat  that  period was the strike of the Daily  Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union  of  the City Council.  The  worst\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest  in Singapore  took  place  last\r\n\r\nyear. From records of the past we can see why there\r\n\r\nwere  so many strikes. As we know, the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\nto  power with the support of the left-wing people,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  workers.  When  the  P.A.P. took\r\n\r\noffice,  they promised to bring about  unity  among\r\n\r\nthe  labourers, amend the labour laws and carry out\r\n\r\nall  the  election pledges they made to the workers\r\n\r\nof Singapore. That was why they were so welcomed by\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore, especially the workers who\r\n\r\nhad  full  confidence in them and  who  hoped  that\r\n\r\ntheir  lot  would be improved. So in the first  two\r\n\r\nyears  of  the  P.A.P. Government, it  was  a  most\r\n\r\ndifficult time for the Government to deal with  all\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of the workers. At  that  time,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of labour disputes was not as great as it is\r\n\r\nnow.  This was because of the fair attitude adopted\r\n\r\nby  the Labour Department, as a result of which the\r\n\r\nemployers  did not take advantage of the  situation\r\n\r\nand  they had to cooperate with the unions. It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this  that there were  more  cases  of\r\n\r\nlabour disputes being settled. In the meantime, the\r\n\r\nworkers  also understood that they should  not  ask\r\n\r\ntoo much of the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the leaders of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  sincere and are prepared to keep the  promises\r\n\r\nthey  made  during the election to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nreunification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement and bring about industrial\r\n\r\npeace,  then in all sincerity the Government should\r\n\r\ncooperate  with  the  workers and  the  unions  and\r\n\r\nimprove the relationship between the employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers. This is very possible. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the Government had, to a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,  brought about industrial peace. This  came\r\n\r\nabout  as  a result of the cooperation between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  T.U.C. at  that  time.  This\r\n\r\nattitude  of  cooperation was very  promising.  All\r\n\r\nthis  was done in the interest of the workers.  But\r\n\r\nfrom  what  we  see  now, it is very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nensure  industrial peace. The Government  has  lost\r\n\r\nthe confidence of the workers at present and it  is\r\n\r\nonly the irresponsible P.A.P. leaders who should be\r\n\r\nblamed for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the contention of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to use the Industrial Arbitration Court as a\r\n\r\nmeans  to  bring  about industrial  peace.  On  1st\r\n\r\nMarch,  1959 the Prime Minister said at a rally  in\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai that the setting up of the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  was only a  means  to  try  and\r\n\r\nsettle  industrial disputes legally. If the workers\r\n\r\nand the unions did not want this to be legalised by\r\n\r\nlaw,  then they could decide for themselves whether\r\n\r\nindustrial   disputes  should  be   submitted   for\r\n\r\narbitration in the Court. But after the Party  came\r\n\r\nto  power,  the  Prime Minister and his  colleagues\r\n\r\nwanted  to  force  compulsory  arbitration  on  the\r\n\r\nworkers, that is to say, if the workers and  unions\r\n\r\nwanted to resort to a strike, they could not do so.\r\n\r\nThen  there  would be consultation and conciliation\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government and the workers'  leaders,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Lim  Ching  Siong .In this  respect,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not been able to contribute anything\r\n\r\nto  industrial peace. And the present situation  is\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the Arbitration Court was set up,\r\n\r\nthe union leaders were very disappointed. Now there\r\n\r\nis  an  indication  that  the  Government  has  the\r\n\r\nintention   to  enforce  the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  We  must  point out  that  the  present\r\n\r\nOrdinance has already given enough powers  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  can be abused by it to restrict the  freedom\r\n\r\nto  strike by workers; especially so in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe   non-P.A.P. unions.  As  a  matter  of  fact,\r\n\r\nGovernment already has got an occasion to make  use\r\n\r\nof this Ordinance to negate the right of non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions to strike. The Industrial Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\ngives  union  leaders, especially leaders  of  non-P.A.P. unions  no  chance  for  any  defence   or\r\n\r\nargument.  So we have doubts whether the Government\r\n\r\nhas  true intentions to amend the Ordinance in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people.  And  we  are  doubtful\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is not an ulterior  motive  in  the\r\n\r\namendments to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing down of the T.U.C. by the Government\r\n\r\nhas  given rise to a situation in which there is  a\r\n\r\nsplit  in  the trade union movement.  This  act  of\r\n\r\nclosing  down the T.U.C. has encouraged  anti-union\r\n\r\nemployers   to  take  advantage  of   the   present\r\n\r\nsituation and to be stubborn against union leaders.\r\n\r\nThis  clearly  shows  that there  is  a  180-degree\r\n\r\nchange in the labour policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September last year the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nopenly said, in regard to the Shaw Brothers'  trade\r\n\r\ndispute, that he urged the Shaw Brothers management\r\n\r\nto   disregard  the  appeal  of  the  workers   for\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  The  Government  instead  urged  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of Shaw Organisation to have individual\r\n\r\ntalks with officials of the unions. In another case\r\n\r\nthe Singapore General Employees Union won a victory\r\n\r\nin   a   secret  ballot  conducted  by  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry,  but the Singapore Manual and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers  Union,  which  is  pro-P.A.P.,  was   very\r\n\r\nunhappy   about  the  situation,  and  its  members\r\n\r\nresorted  to  stone-throwing. But the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour turned a deaf ear to this complaint. And  so\r\n\r\nthere  is a conflict between the P.A.P. unions  and\r\n\r\nthe  non-P.A.P. unions. This is another factor which\r\n\r\ncan be attributed to the present split in the trade\r\n\r\nunion movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the City Council strike the Government\r\n\r\nmade use of new workers to break down the strike of\r\n\r\nthe  union. The Government at that time pointed out\r\n\r\nto the union that the trade dispute was politically\r\n\r\ninvolved, and so such steps were necessary. On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Amalgamated Union of Public Employees is given\r\n\r\nspecial privileges by the Government whenever there\r\n\r\nis  any  strike,  and A.U.P.E. is  headed  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture. From all this, we can clearly see that the\r\n\r\nParty   in  power  is  now  adopting  retrogressive\r\n\r\nmethods and is siding with the pro-P.A.P. unions at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of the non-P.A.P. unions.  These  acts\r\n\r\nreally  are  some  of  the causes  of  the  present\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the trade\r\n\r\ndispute  is  a  social problem. Trade disputes  and\r\n\r\nlabour  troubles  cannot  be  solved  easily  in  a\r\n\r\ncapitalist  society. It is only  when  there  is  a\r\n\r\npolicy  which  is in the interests  of  Labour  and\r\n\r\nwhich is carried out by the Government supported by\r\n\r\nthe  workers  that industrial relationship  between\r\n\r\nworkers  and employers can be improved. It is  only\r\n\r\nin these circumstances that industrial peace can be\r\n\r\nbrought  about to improve the lot of  the  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  relationship  between  labour  and\r\n\r\ncapital.  This policy must have the cooperation  of\r\n\r\nthree  parties  concerned, namely, the  Government,\r\n\r\nlabour  and  capital. As a matter of  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  there  was  cooperation  among  the  three\r\n\r\nparties at the beginning of P.A.P. rule that  there\r\n\r\nwas some form of industrial peace. In 1955-57 there\r\n\r\nwere  some very great strikes in the bus companies.\r\n\r\nIn   the   last  two  or  three  years  there   was\r\n\r\ncooperation  between  workers  and  management.  We\r\n\r\nwould not say that the Hock Lee Bus Company and the\r\n\r\nTay Koh Yat Bus Company have changed their attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the workers. Neither do we say that  there\r\n\r\nhas been a change of attitude of the leaders of the\r\n\r\nbus  workers. All we say is that these two parties,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  labour  and  capital,  have  come  to   some\r\n\r\nagreement  concerning working conditions  and  wage\r\n\r\nincreases. Therefore, strikes have been avoided  in\r\n\r\nthe bus companies. But unfortunately, the Party  in\r\n\r\npower, in order to deal their political opponents a\r\n\r\nblow,   have   assisted  and   helped   out   their\r\n\r\ncolleagues. So there has been no balance in  labour\r\n\r\nand  management relationship, and this move is  not\r\n\r\ngood to the bringing about of industrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are of the opinion that the\r\n\r\nmain  way to bring about industrial peace  lies  in\r\n\r\nthe   cooperation   of   all   parties   concerned,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the mutual interest of the  parties,\r\n\r\nso  that the questions concerning industrial  peace\r\n\r\nand  industrial relationship can be solved. We  are\r\n\r\nof  the  opinion that the workers in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  people. They have  a  great  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and as long as employers do not take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the  present situation  and  try  to\r\n\r\nprevent  and  restrict their  activities  in  union\r\n\r\nmatters, then there is no reason whatsoever for any\r\n\r\ndeterioration  in relationship between  labour  and\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  has been quiet and silence in the industrial\r\n\r\nfield  for  nearly two years, since June 1959  when\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. formed the Government, until  not  long\r\n\r\nafter  the defeat of the P.A.P. Government  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim by-election. During this period, for some\r\n\r\nreason  or  other,  we seldom  hear  of  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes, industrial strike, not to say strikes. It\r\n\r\nwas  a  comparatively long period  of  silence  and\r\n\r\ncertain  trade  union leaders were then  under  the\r\n\r\nimpression   that  the  P.A.P. was   a   Left-wing\r\n\r\nGovernment and was cooperating with the workers. It\r\n\r\nwas  not  so  much a fact that for two years  there\r\n\r\nwere no deep-seated grievances of the workers,  not\r\n\r\nthat  the  workers were satisfied with their  wages\r\n\r\nand  conditions of service; but it  was  said  that\r\n\r\nwhen  certain workers wished to press on with their\r\n\r\nindustrial demands, they were asked to give this so-called  Left-wing Government a chance to prove  its\r\n\r\nworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, came the Hong Lim by-election and we\r\n\r\nhave seen -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Historical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan: Historical Hong Lim by-election. And we have seen more strikes in the past\r\n\r\nfew  months  than  in the first two  years  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, why are  there\r\n\r\nso many strikes and so many industrial disputes? It\r\n\r\nis because the workers' deep-seated grievances have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  pegged down for two years. We were faced with\r\n\r\na  similar  situation  in 1955  when,  with  a  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  coming  in,  there  was   a   wave   of\r\n\r\nindustrial disputes which restored wages  to  their\r\n\r\nnormal  position.  So  this  period  of  industrial\r\n\r\nactivity  during  the  last  few  months,  in   our\r\n\r\nopinion, is to catch up with what has been lost  by\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the first two years of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere   is   no  need  for  experienced   political\r\n\r\nagitators to tell a worker that he should strike to\r\n\r\nget more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when workers do not get\r\n\r\nsubsistence wages, there is a necessity  to  resort\r\n\r\nto   industrial  action  in  order  to  get  better\r\n\r\nconditions of living. One characteristic during the\r\n\r\npast few months is the spate of industrial disputes\r\n\r\nof  white-collar workers, i.e., clerks  of  British\r\n\r\nand  foreign commercial houses. This is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that since the return of the British  in\r\n\r\n1945  these white-collar workers have not generally\r\n\r\nresorted  to collective bargaining. They  have  not\r\n\r\nobtained  any general wage increase, and  after  so\r\n\r\nmany  years of silence, they have woken up  to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  they would be able to get better  wages\r\n\r\nand  better conditions of service if they  resorted\r\n\r\nto industrial action. Mr Speaker, Sir, if a worker\r\n\r\nis  contented,  and  if  a  white-collar  clerk  is\r\n\r\ncontented, however much agitation is being  brought\r\n\r\nabout, it is very difficult for us or for political\r\n\r\nagitators  or  industrial agitators  to  make  them\r\n\r\nstrike. We are thus faced with a situation where in\r\n\r\nthis  semi-colonial society we are trying to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  equilibrium  between  the  workers  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers.   During  the  past   two   years,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment have not done much to bring the  workers\r\n\r\ninto their confidence. They have never shown in any\r\n\r\nconcrete way that they are sympathetic towards  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was in the City Council\r\n\r\nwe voluntarily raised the wages of the workers, the\r\n\r\npeons,  the messengers and the poorly paid  workers\r\n\r\nof  the City Council. Not that we could do much for\r\n\r\nthem - 40  cents increase a day for the workers,  and\r\n\r\n$10 a month increase for the peon would not go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalong  way.  But it was a gesture of  goodwill  and\r\n\r\nsympathy  for the working class. But what has  this\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  done?  [Interruption]  That  is\r\n\r\nright,   Mr  Speaker.  And  why  not  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment now also do the same thing? They  should\r\n\r\nhave done the same thing also.

He  chose  to\r\n\r\nanswer  the  interjection. I think he  should  also\r\n\r\ntranslate the interjection if he can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Delta said that the increase of the  wages  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the City Council was also the  work\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. That is why it is necessary for me to\r\n\r\nclarify  the  position,  that  is,  if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment are really sincere, they could have done\r\n\r\nit  when  they are in the Government. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there was no wage increase. There was instead\r\n\r\na  deflationary situation where many  workers  lost\r\n\r\ntheir job. Some received less pay. There was also a\r\n\r\nsituation where more taxes were taken from the poor\r\n\r\nworkers.  Therefore, the workers are faced  with  a\r\n\r\nGovernment in whom they have no confidence and they\r\n\r\nfeel that it is only through industrial action that\r\n\r\nthey could get what they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was very long after the Government was formed that they set up the Industrial Arbitration Court to try to conciliate the contradictions in this capitalist society between the employer and the employee. Now we have one Industrial Arbitration Court. But from what I gather, that one Industrial Arbitration Court is not sufficient for the purpose, and many unions and\r\n\r\nemployees  have to queue up for a long time  before\r\n\r\nthey can send their cases to arbitration. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said just now perhaps  that  is  the\r\n\r\nreason why many employees do not want to send their\r\n\r\ncase  to  arbitration. It takes months  before  the\r\n\r\ncases  could be heard. So I would suggest that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment    should   set   up   more   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Courts. Now the snag in industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narbitration is that you need qualified men who have\r\n\r\nmuch   experience,  and  there  are  not  many   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  are prepared to  do  it  without  a\r\n\r\nprice - not  necessarily  in  terms  of  dollars  and\r\n\r\ncents - to put up the cases of the workers before the\r\n\r\nCourt. Therefore, we must have certain substitutes,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, like wage councils, or whatever name\r\n\r\nwe  call it, where the employees can bring up their\r\n\r\ncase  in  an informal atmosphere before these  wage\r\n\r\ncouncils and the employer will be asked to meet and\r\n\r\nsettle their dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the principle of\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice not only in name  but\r\n\r\nalso  in  practice, and we hope that the Government\r\n\r\ncould  set  up more Industrial Arbitration  Courts,\r\n\r\nput  up more wage councils so that we would be able\r\n\r\nto  bring more employment and more stability to the\r\n\r\npresent industrial position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, many Opposition Members from\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis have accused the Government of\r\n\r\nusing the State machinery to suppress trade unions.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Toa Payoh, my  former  colleague,\r\n\r\nafter  having undergone such an experience, has  no\r\n\r\nfurther  interest  in  labour  problems.  But,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  myself  have  been  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral Employees Union right from the beginning. I\r\n\r\nwas  a Committee member. Subsequently, I became its\r\n\r\nChairman, then Vice-Chairman, and finally I  became\r\n\r\nits  Secretary-General. I am fully conversant  with\r\n\r\nhow   the   front-line   Communist   leaders   have\r\n\r\nmanipulated the labour movement in order to  oppose\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government now.  When  the  Government\r\n\r\nwanted to establish an Arbitration Court, Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee Suan exchanged views with me. He expressed his\r\n\r\nobjection because he considered that this  was  not\r\n\r\nin the interest of the trade unions. At first I was\r\n\r\nunable  to  grasp the motive behind the reasons  of\r\n\r\nMr Fong Swee Suan. Later on when I made inquiries,\r\n\r\nI  discovered that the setting up of the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be a disadvantage to the Communists  because\r\n\r\nthey  would  then have no opportunity  to  use  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement  in  its struggle  to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. In addition, Mr Speaker -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is addressing\r\n\r\nthe  Chair as Mr Chairman, that is Tuan Pengerusi,\r\n\r\nI  think  the  correct address is Mr  Speaker - Tuan\r\n\r\nSpeaker or Tuan Yang di-Pertua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (In Malay): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I apologise for the mix-up in the usage of\r\n\r\nthe  terms  \"Mr Chairman\" and \"Mr  Speaker\".  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  when  the  Government intended  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  the unification of the trade union  movement\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,  similarly  Mr  Fong   Swee   Suan\r\n\r\nexpressed his views against the step taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  fail  to  understand  this  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning. But later I was fully convinced that the\r\n\r\nreason was this. Mr Fong Swee Suan himself was the\r\n\r\nadviser  to  the S.G.E.U. when I was the Secretary-General, and the reason for his objection was  that\r\n\r\nthe  S.G.E.U. itself comprised various  classes  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  so that when the unification took  place,\r\n\r\nthe S.G.E.U. would lose its strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. Just now many of the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   Members   have   charged   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for using the State machinery, that  is,\r\n\r\nusing  the  police  force, to  suppress  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  I ask the Barisan Sosialis to go back  and\r\n\r\nask  their  S.G.E.U. leaders like  Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  Mr Fong Swee Suan, Mr Dominic Puthucheary\r\n\r\nand  others,  whether or not there  were  occasions\r\n\r\nwhen the unions sought help from the police, as  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the  Malayan Tin  Printing  dispute.\r\n\r\nDuring the dispute, the S.G.E.U. sought police help\r\n\r\nfrom  the workers of the Lighterage Company.  I  am\r\n\r\ntelling  nothing but the truth. As  its  Secretary-General  then,  I know the position  very  well.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Barisan Sosialis in  this  Chamber  are\r\n\r\nmerely   receiving  directives  from  irresponsible\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders  to utter  unfounded  charges\r\n\r\nwhich they themselves do not know. It is because of\r\n\r\nthe unreasonable tactics adopted by them that I, of\r\n\r\nmy own free will, resigned as the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof the S.G.E.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the accusation by the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim,  he said that during the past two years, deep-seated  industrial unrest has been prevailing.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   during   the  last  Government,   labour\r\n\r\nlegislation   was   introduced  concerning   public\r\n\r\nholidays  and  so  on. But the previous  Government\r\n\r\ntook   no   action  to  enforce  these   provisions\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  law. When  the  P.A.P. assumed\r\n\r\noffice,  all  workers  came forward  to  claim  for\r\n\r\novertime pay, such as the employees of the  Raffles\r\n\r\nHotel  and  the Adelphi Hotel. They were successful\r\n\r\nin their claims. The reason can easily be seen. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  took all steps  to  bring  both\r\n\r\nparties to negotiation in the Arbitration Court and\r\n\r\nthen   settlement  was  reached.  Such  accusations\r\n\r\nhurled  by the Barisan Sosialis are merely designed\r\n\r\nto  confuse the workers so that they will  be  anti\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government. There are many problems  in\r\n\r\ntrade disputes and certain leaders, particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  S.G.E.U.,  do  not  like   such\r\n\r\ndisputes  to be referred to the Arbitration  Court.\r\n\r\nThe  reason can easily be given, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  if the Arbitration Court is successful  in\r\n\r\naffecting a settlement, the workers can claim  that\r\n\r\nit  is  not the Communist front that has  made  the\r\n\r\nsettlement.  It  is  the Government  who  does  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Barisan Sosialis leaders have  found\r\n\r\nways  and means to prevent such trade disputes from\r\n\r\nbeing  brought before the Arbitration Court. I  say\r\n\r\nso.  Mr  Speaker, because earlier I  have  already\r\n\r\nsaid  what transpired in the discussions I had with\r\n\r\nMr  Fong Swee Suan. I know very well what is going\r\n\r\non  in  the  S.G.E.U. Unlike the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  who  merely  receive  directions  to  read\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  this  Assembly,  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown,  wants\r\n\r\npublicity  that  he  is championing  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nlabour.

The total number of strikes during  this\r\n\r\nperiod was 77 as against 116 for the whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this sudden perceptible increase in\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest after the Anson by election?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that during the\r\n\r\nAnson  by election the call for merger and Malaysia\r\n\r\nwas  in  the  air, and the Government took  a  firm\r\n\r\nstand  in response to that call; but Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and the pro-Communist elements in the unions\r\n\r\ncame  out  with  a  statement to ask  for  complete\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government only, with  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council abolished instead of  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Therefore, it was over a political  issue\r\n\r\nbetween the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the pro-Communist Party elements in the unions\r\n\r\nthat they have waged a political battle against the\r\n\r\nGovernment  over the issue of merger and  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe   historical  and  inevitable  event   of   the\r\n\r\nreunification of the people of the two  territories\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and the Federation was taking  shape\r\n\r\nday  by  day and the pro-Communist elements in  the\r\n\r\nunion  became  agitated and decided  to  use  every\r\n\r\nmeans  to  fight the Government with  the  view  to\r\n\r\nfrustrating  the  materialisation  of  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  They  therefore mounted  the  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  with the view to forcing the Government  to\r\n\r\nshift its stand on the issue of merger and, failing\r\n\r\nwhich,  to  topple  the  Government  in  order   to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  the  reunification  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore move an amendment\r\n\r\nto the motion as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to add after the words \"industrial unrest\" in\r\n\r\nline 2 - \"by pro-Communist political agitators for\r\n\r\npolitical ends\";\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to add after the words \"in the interests of\"\r\n\r\nin line 3 - \"industrial expansion so vital to\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)to add at the end of the motion after the\r\n\r\nword \"Singapore\" - \"and to prevent genuine industrial\r\n\r\ngrievances from being exploited for Communist\r\n\r\nends\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The amended motion will thus read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"That  this  House  views with grave  concern  the\r\n\r\nmounting  of  industrial unrest  by  pro-Communist\r\n\r\npolitical  agitators for political ends and  calls\r\n\r\non  the Government to take all reasonable steps to\r\n\r\nensure  industrial  peace  with  justice  in   the\r\n\r\ninterests of industrial expansion so vital to  the\r\n\r\neconomic  well-being  of the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to prevent genuine industrial grievances from\r\n\r\nbeing exploited for Communist ends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It therefore led to the test of  strength\r\n\r\nbetween  the  non-Communist Left and the  Communist\r\n\r\nLeft.  The  Government  had anticipated  that  pro-Communists   would  mount  industrial  unrest   for\r\n\r\npolitical objectives. Let me quote from the  letter\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwho  is  the  Chairman  of  the  P.A.P.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his  letter  pointed  out  the  grave\r\n\r\ndifficulties that faced the Government then because\r\n\r\nof  the  three  Political Secretaries (Messrs.  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong,  Fong Swee Suan and S. Woodhull)  who\r\n\r\nhad  openly  opposed  the Government's  policy  for\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger.

The number of strikes and lockouts  during\r\n\r\n1961   was   116,  involving  43,584  workers   and\r\n\r\nresulting in a loss of 410,889 man-days as  against\r\n\r\n45  strikes  and  lockouts in 1960 involving  5,539\r\n\r\nworkers  and  resulting in 152,005  man-days  lost.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  marked increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstrikes  from  August to December  1961,  i.e. the\r\n\r\nperiod immediately after the Anson by-election. The\r\n\r\ntotal  number of strikes during this period was  77\r\n\r\nas against 116 for the whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period from 1st July, 1961 to 31st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1962, there were altogether 96 strikes, as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  27 only for the first six  months  of\r\n\r\n1961.  Of  the  96 strikes, 69 were  by  Communist-controlled  or Communist-penetrated unions,  24  by\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  unions and three  by  employees  not\r\n\r\nrepresented by any union. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore General Employees' Union called 31 strikes; the Singapore Business Houses Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  25;  and the Singapore Textile  and  General\r\n\r\nMerchants Employees' Union seven, making a total of\r\n\r\n63 strikes or about 54 per cent of the total number\r\n\r\nof  strikes  during the year. For the period  under\r\n\r\nreview,  the  Singapore Business Houses  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion,  on  the  one hand, called  a  total  of  25\r\n\r\nstrikes  but, on the other, referred only 13  minor\r\n\r\ndisputes  to the Labour Department. Again,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of the dispute between the four Shaw Companies\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore  General  Employees'  Union  in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1961, no attempt was made by either party\r\n\r\nto  avail  itself of the machinery provided  before\r\n\r\ntaking industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a difference in behaviour of\r\n\r\nstrikers between the non-Communist unions  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunist-controlled unions. The  pickets  of  non-Communist  unions were comparatively  well-behaved,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  behaviour of strikers of the Communist-controlled  unions,  particularly  those   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  was\r\n\r\naggressive and offensive. Executives of  the  firms\r\n\r\nwere often assaulted and subjected to various forms\r\n\r\nof humiliation. The following diary of events gives\r\n\r\nthe picture of the extent of misconduct by pickets:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On 18-8-61 - Robinson and Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following breakdown of negotiations over the\r\n\r\nrecognition of S.B.H.E.U. as the representative  of\r\n\r\nthe firm's employees, members of the union staged a\r\n\r\n\"go-slow\" on 18th August, 1961, and prevented  non-strikers from entering the premises before  9  a.m.\r\n\r\nWhen  Mr  Warren and Mr Hazel, employees  of  the\r\n\r\nfirm,  attempted to enter the store at  8.45  a.m.,\r\n\r\nthey  were  assaulted by four or five  persons.  An\r\n\r\noptician,  Mr Meyer, who went to, the aid  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo Europeans, was also assaulted. Mrs Khoo, a non-striking  Chinese  woman worker, was  knocked  down\r\n\r\nwhen she insisted on entering the store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11-9-61-Robinson and Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-two pickets were arrested and charged in\r\n\r\ncourt  for  causing obstruction. At  the  time  the\r\n\r\narrests  were effected, other obstreperous strikers\r\n\r\npresent  insisted that they should also be arrested\r\n\r\nand taken to Central Police Station. Altogether 216\r\n\r\nwere brought to the Central Police Station where it\r\n\r\nwas  found  that  of these persons  only  150  were\r\n\r\nactual  employees of the firm, the other  66  being\r\n\r\nmembers of the S.B.H.E.U. employed at other firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On l7-l1-61 - Seiclene Laundry and Dry-Cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day during the strike, the workers held\r\n\r\nup  a  British  Army truck which had  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nlaundry  to reclaim unwashed linen sent  there  for\r\n\r\nwashing  under  contract. The  strikers  under  the\r\n\r\ninstructions of Mr Tan Teck Wah, President of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    General   Employees'   Union    (which\r\n\r\nrepresents the strikers), used two of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany's  vans to block the entrance to  the  firm\r\n\r\nand so prevented the Army vehicle from leaving.  It\r\n\r\nis  known that the strikers were instructed by  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Teck  Wah  to make the police feel  ridiculous\r\n\r\nonce it was decided to disperse them. However,  Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan  who  arrived  later  advised  the\r\n\r\nstrikers not to defy the police. In the event,  the\r\n\r\npolice  had to push the company's vans out  of  the\r\n\r\nway  in  order to clear a passage for the  military\r\n\r\ntruck. Finally, when the police formed up to leave,\r\n\r\nthey  were  jeered  at and had  exploding  crackers\r\n\r\nflung at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On 25-11-61 - Gammon (Singapore) Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers went on a one-day strike on 25-11-61.\r\n\r\nAt about 8.15 a.m. when an engineer of the firm was\r\n\r\nbeing  driven  into  the firm's premises  at  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  Road his car was stopped by about 70 pickets\r\n\r\nincluding  members of the S.B.H.E.U. who  were  not\r\n\r\nemployees of the firm. The Malay driver was ordered\r\n\r\nto  leave  the car and when the engineer  tried  to\r\n\r\ndrive  on,  he was assaulted by two of the  pickets\r\n\r\nwho   were  not  employees  of  the  firm.   Timely\r\n\r\nintervention  by two uniformed constables  on  duty\r\n\r\nsaved  the  engineer  from  serious  injuries.  The\r\n\r\nstrikers were defiant and the two police constables\r\n\r\nhad to draw their revolvers to deter the crowd from\r\n\r\nfurther assaulting the engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On 2-12-6l - Guthrie and Co. Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9.30 a.m., a mercantile assistant of this\r\n\r\nfirm,   Mr   Walker,  was  escorting   two   women\r\n\r\nemployees - non-union members of the firm - to  office.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were prevented from going in to work  at\r\n\r\nthe staircase leading to the office. Mr Walker was\r\n\r\nfisted by a male picket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day at 12.30 p.m., the director of\r\n\r\nthe firm and the manager of the Pan-Malayan Imports\r\n\r\nwere leaving the Chartered Bank Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order.

It was not  because\r\n\r\nthe Government had changed its attitude towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe working class and frustrated the moves made  by\r\n\r\nthe  workers  for  better terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  It  was  entirely  due  to  the  pro-C.P.\r\n\r\nelements  who were opposed to merger and  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThey picked a quarrel with the Government over this\r\n\r\npolitical  issue  and  they wanted  to  create  the\r\n\r\nimpression  in  the minds of the workers  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was unsympathetic to the workers so that\r\n\r\nthe   workers  would  be  discontented   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  so fight against  the  Government.\r\n\r\nThey,   therefore,   had   purposely   mounted   an\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest and deliberately led the  workers\r\n\r\nto  clash with the police. But they have failed  in\r\n\r\nthe attempt to cause discontentment and ill-feeling\r\n\r\nof the workers towards the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have failed because the Government did not\r\n\r\nallow   the  employers  in  the  present  political\r\n\r\nconfusion   which  was  created  by  the   pro-C.P.\r\n\r\nelements to take advantage of it and to oppress the\r\n\r\nworkers   as  the  previous  Government   did.   No\r\n\r\nopportunity was given to the employer to weaken the\r\n\r\nworkers' bargaining position or the employers being\r\n\r\nallowed  to  repudiate agreements  which  they  had\r\n\r\nconcluded   with   the   workers.   Further,    the\r\n\r\nGovernment, unlike the previous Government, did not\r\n\r\nallow  itself  to be manipulated by  obstinate  and\r\n\r\nreactionary employers nor allow itself to  be  made\r\n\r\nuse  of  as a tool against the workers. As a result\r\n\r\nof  the consistent labour policy of the Government,\r\n\r\nthe  workers had confidence in the Government  that\r\n\r\nthey could have their grievances redressed with the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  the  machinery provided  under  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Ordinance.  The  House  will\r\n\r\nnotice  from  the  Press  from  time  to  time  the\r\n\r\nimproved  benefits  that the workers  had  achieved\r\n\r\nfrom the day the P.A.P. took office up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have illustrated a few cases in which\r\n\r\nthe  pro-Communist unions agitated its  workers  to\r\n\r\nuse  violence in the course of industrial disputes.\r\n\r\nTheir  main object was to lead the innocent workers\r\n\r\ninto  a  clash with the police so that  they  could\r\n\r\nconvince the workers that the Government was wicked\r\n\r\nand anti-worker. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  these  means, they could  exploit  genuine\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes  for  their  own  selfish  aims  by\r\n\r\nimplicating  the  workers in a  political  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst the Government. The pro-C.P. unions  always\r\n\r\nissued statements blaming the Government for  using\r\n\r\nthe  police against strikers. It is quite clear now\r\n\r\nfrom  the  incidents enumerated just now  that  the\r\n\r\npolice  had  no  alternative but to  step  in  when\r\n\r\nviolence was resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-C.P. elements in the unions raised a hue\r\n\r\nand  cry over the question of reunification of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement. Mr Speaker, Sir, as I  have\r\n\r\npointed  out earlier, the split in the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement was caused by the pro-C.P. elements over a\r\n\r\npolitical  issue. They wanted the consolidation  of\r\n\r\nthe  working  class not for the workers'  interests\r\n\r\nbut for them to manipulate the trade union movement\r\n\r\nfor  their  own selfish political ends.  They  made\r\n\r\nevery attempt to capture control of the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  so  that they can bring pressure  on  and\r\n\r\nmanipulate  an elected Government to advance  their\r\n\r\nown factional political ends. They have made use of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement for political manoeuvres\r\n\r\ncalculated to create conditions of political unrest\r\n\r\nand instability in the State of Singapore. This was\r\n\r\nthe cause of the spilt in the trade union movement,\r\n\r\nand  the  blame should go to the pro-C.P. elements\r\n\r\nand no one else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there was a split in the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  because  they  opposed  the  Government's\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  merger, the  Government  has  done\r\n\r\neverything  possible  to  preserve  the  collective\r\n\r\norganisation of the workers in order that their own\r\n\r\ninterests  can  be  protected. You  will  therefore\r\n\r\nobserve, Mr Speaker, Sir, that though there was  a\r\n\r\nsplit in the trade union movement, nevertheless the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  preserved an  impartial  and  fair\r\n\r\nattitude  in the face of provocation. Though  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  split  in  the  trade  unions,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  sees to it that no employer is  allowed\r\n\r\nto  create  yellow unions to weaken the  bargaining\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  workers, as  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What about the A.U.P.E.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> For that matter, there are\r\n\r\nrecords and it can be dismissed as a distortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, you will now see that no matter\r\n\r\nhow  hard  the pro-C.P. elements have attempted  to\r\n\r\ncreate  discontent and to instil  in  the  workers'\r\n\r\nminds  the  fact that the Government has  abandoned\r\n\r\nits  labour  policy  and  is unsympathetic  towards\r\n\r\nthem, they have failed because we in the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\ngenuinely working for the interests of the  workers\r\n\r\nby  not  allowing  the  employers  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\npolitical   situation  or  allow   itself   to   be\r\n\r\nmanipulated  by the capitalists. I would  therefore\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity to warn the pro-C.P. elements\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan and in the unions that they have to\r\n\r\nbe responsible and answerable to those workers whom\r\n\r\nthey have misled by creating industrial unrest,  as\r\n\r\na  result of which the workers themselves have lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs or suffered, as a consequence of  which\r\n\r\ntheir families have also suffered, and they have to\r\n\r\nbe   responsible  for  these  workers   and   their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has accused the Government of being pro-employer.  Let us see who really has the  interests\r\n\r\nof   the  workers  at  heart  and  who  really   is\r\n\r\ninterested in maintaining industrial peace so  that\r\n\r\neconomic development could be proceeded with. There\r\n\r\nare  many  cases which I could cite to, prove  that\r\n\r\nthe pro-C.P. unions are making use of these genuine\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes for their own ends.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Theatres, i.e, the Shaw Organisation,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has cited it just  now  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to give more details of this  case  to\r\n\r\nshow  how  they have put the workers to unnecessary\r\n\r\nsuffering and loss of income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute in this case was over claims for\r\n\r\narrears  of  public holiday pay and allowances  for\r\n\r\nmorning and midnight shows. Mr Speaker, Sir,  they\r\n\r\nare  quite  aware that there is an Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nprovides for all these amenities and employers have\r\n\r\nto  abide by them, and in case of a breach of  this\r\n\r\nsection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance the workers do not have to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  it but they could just simply either raise the\r\n\r\nmatter  with  the management or report  it  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Department,  and the  Inspectorate  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Department  will no  doubt  look  into  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of  a  breach of  this  section  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  But the pro-C.P. union,  as  is  usual,\r\n\r\nclaimed that what they had done was for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the workers without political motives. In  this\r\n\r\ncase, if that was their intention, in their failure\r\n\r\nto   resolve   this  matter  with  the   management\r\n\r\ndirectly,  why did they not just lodge a  complaint\r\n\r\nwith  the  Labour Department? Instead, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  they decided to mislead the workers  and  ask\r\n\r\nthem  to take industrial action. In this particular\r\n\r\ncase,  they had a previous discussion at the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry and it was adjourned to the following day.\r\n\r\nBut  the union, knowing full well the situation and\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  no breakdown in the  negotiation,\r\n\r\ncalled off the workers on the eve when negotiations\r\n\r\nshould be resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a clear example of what\r\n\r\nthey  claimed to be acting in the interests of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   As   a  result  of  their   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nexploitation of a genuine trade dispute  for  their\r\n\r\nown  political ends, the workers had to lose  wages\r\n\r\nwhen  they  went on strike from the 21st  December,\r\n\r\n1961  to 31st January, 1962. Both parties have  now\r\n\r\nagreed  to  refer  the matter  to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt,  but  as the Prime Minister has pointed  out\r\n\r\njust  now, the management had, in fact, offered  to\r\n\r\nrefer  the  matter to the Labour Court  or  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, because in this case the dispute\r\n\r\nwas purely over a matter of facts and figures. So I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  to what extent they can substantiate\r\n\r\ntheir claim. Anyway, 419 workers had been asked  to\r\n\r\ngo  on strike unnecessarily for 2\u00bd months, and they\r\n\r\nhad  to  suffer  during this period as  they  would\r\n\r\nderive  no income. I wonder if they would or  could\r\n\r\nultimately  get back a substantial  sum  to  offset\r\n\r\nthis  period when the workers went on strike  which\r\n\r\nresulted in a loss of income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the non-Communist trade unions and\r\n\r\nthe Communist-controlled trade unions. Do they make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  attempt and effort to bring about  long-term\r\n\r\nindustrial  stability  in  industry?  Surely,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if you were to examine the agreements\r\n\r\nthat   were   concluded  between   the   Communist-controlled  unions  and  the  employers,  you  will\r\n\r\nnotice  that  in most cases they just asked  for  a\r\n\r\nnominal  sum of increments to which, I believe,  in\r\n\r\nany  case  they would have been entitled. They  had\r\n\r\nmade no attempt to study their claims or to put  up\r\n\r\nclaims where the workers did not have to go through\r\n\r\nthe  same  procedure  and the trouble  to  ask  for\r\n\r\nrevision of terms and conditions of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the non-Communist trade union group, they\r\n\r\nalways  study the case, consult their members,  and\r\n\r\nput  up  claims  which lead to  ultimate  long-term\r\n\r\nstability  in  employment. The House probably  will\r\n\r\nhave   seen  from  the  newspapers  that  in  every\r\n\r\nagreement  concluded,  for instance,  by  the  Bank\r\n\r\nEmployees Union, the Insurance Employees Union, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Manual and Mercantile Workers Union,  and\r\n\r\nother  unions,  i.e, under the non-C.P.-controlled\r\n\r\ngroup, they always asked for salary scales.  So  we\r\n\r\nsee  that  once  these unions take the  trouble  to\r\n\r\nfight  for better terms and conditions of  service,\r\n\r\nthey achieve real benefits and they do not have  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate again every year or every two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there such a difference in their tactics?\r\n\r\nIt is very simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Communist-controlled  unions accuse the Government  of  being\r\n\r\npro-employer, but how was it that the non-Communist-controlled   unions   concluded   agreements   with\r\n\r\nemployers  on  time  scales which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson said the employer always refused to accept?\r\n\r\nApart  from  this  nominal increment,  they  always\r\n\r\nconclude  an  agreement for only  a  period  of  18\r\n\r\nmonths  or  two  years, and  they  are  very,  very\r\n\r\nreluctant to conclude an agreement for two years or\r\n\r\nmore.  This shows the intention behind their  move.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, they always say the\r\n\r\nworkers  are dissatisfied with the Government.  Let\r\n\r\nus look at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   statement   and  see  what   is   the   real\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction, as they allege, the  workers  have\r\n\r\nwith the Government.

They were\r\n\r\naddressing  the 5th Annual Delegates Conference  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial Workers Union at its premises in Kallang\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> At that time we were in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes, that is the period when\r\n\r\nyou had already decided to betray the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Hon. Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is addressing the Chair. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe Speaker has betrayed any Party so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nreferring to the Member for Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They said: `A chief cause of dissatisfaction was\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  failure to implement  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion   Bill   which   would   provide   for    the\r\n\r\nreunification of the trade union movement.  Another\r\n\r\nreason  was  the  Government's loss  of  its  anti-colonial  fervour and the fact that  it  would  not\r\n\r\ntake   a  courageous  stand  against  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said: `The Government had deprived active\r\n\r\ntrade unionists and anti-colonialists o citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  and  had  not  implemented  the  unionists'\r\n\r\ndemand  for release of all political detainees  and\r\n\r\nthe  granting of freedom of speech and Assembly for\r\n\r\nanti-colonial purposes.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, what has this got to do with the\r\n\r\ngeneral  workers?  Again,  at  a  meeting  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business Houses Employees  Union,  which\r\n\r\nwas reported on 16th February, 1962, in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  Mr  Foo Yong Fong, the Union's  President,\r\n\r\nsaid this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Wrong statement, it seems!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> These are Communist virtues\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are trying to impress  on  the  white-collar workers. He started off with saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All the time we are told that the Communists are\r\n\r\nsupposed to be had people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And he continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Countries such as Russia, China and Cuba which\r\n\r\ncan   supply  us  with  cheaper  things   are   bad\r\n\r\ncountries. Many people are not aware that they  can\r\n\r\nget  cheaper  goods,  such as clothes,  shirts  and\r\n\r\ncanned  food from countries like Russia  and  China\r\n\r\nthan  from  America,  Britain,  Holland  and  South\r\n\r\nAfrica.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I do not have  to  waste  this\r\n\r\nHouse's time to go through the resolutions and  the\r\n\r\nstatements  the Communist-controlled unions  issued\r\n\r\nduring  the Anson by-election and even up till  now\r\n\r\nwhen  merger  is taking shape. The  main  theme  of\r\n\r\ntheir  resolution was nothing else but to  try  and\r\n\r\ndeceive  the workers. They want to incite  them  to\r\n\r\nfight against the Government on the ground that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  has  sold  out  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  it  wants  a  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and the P.A.P. Government was reluctant\r\n\r\nto  fight  for  internal self-government  with  the\r\n\r\nabolition   of   the  Internal  Security   Council.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, from all this, we  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  it  is not the Government, due  to  this\r\n\r\npolitical situation, that has lost interest in  the\r\n\r\nworkers. On the contrary, it is the pro-C.P. in the\r\n\r\nunions which do not want to see the realisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  unification  of the people  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now many Opposition Members criticised the\r\n\r\nGovernment for not providing enough facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions in order that  they  can  settle\r\n\r\ntheir disputes without resort to industrial action.\r\n\r\nLet  me  reveal to this House what the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  done  in order to help the workers to  achieve\r\n\r\nbetter  terms  and  conditions of  service  without\r\n\r\nundue  hardship by going on strike.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Ordinance  under  which   an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court  was  established  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   industrial  peace  with   justice.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken  steps  to  strengthen   the\r\n\r\nconciliation  team in the Ministry of  Labour.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  conciliation  officers  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment  was increased from 4 to 9  officers  as\r\n\r\nfrom  8th January, 1962. The organisation was  also\r\n\r\nchanged. In this new set-up there are five officers\r\n\r\nwith  considerable experience in conciliation work.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Speaker,  do they really  ask  for  this\r\n\r\nconciliation machinery in order that they will make\r\n\r\nuse of it to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintain  industrial peace? No, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nConciliation and arbitration machinery is not  what\r\n\r\nthe  pro-C.P. elements in the unions want  to  make\r\n\r\nuse of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, they have\r\n\r\nbrought  trouble  on their own shoulders  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  to face their own medicine when, in spite  of\r\n\r\nall  their  evil deeds, they still fail to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe   historical,   inevitable   reunion   of   our\r\n\r\nterritories   on  whose  political   and   economic\r\n\r\nstability  we  can build a more prosperous  society\r\n\r\nfor our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House views with grave concern the\r\n\r\nmounting  of  industrial unrest and  calls  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe   economic   well-being  of   the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words from \"unrest\" to the\r\n\r\nend,   and   there  to  insert  \"by   pro-Communist\r\n\r\npolitical agitators for political ends and calls on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  take all reasonable  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure   industrial  peace  with  justice  in   the\r\n\r\ninterests of industrial expansion so vital  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic well-being of the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nto prevent genuine industrial grievances from being\r\n\r\nexploited for Communist ends\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nsurprising that the amendment should have come from\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  sits  behind  the  Government   Front\r\n\r\nBenches.  One  would have thought  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  with  all his knowledge about  Communism\r\n\r\nand his twelve talks, would have been the first one\r\n\r\nto  bring  this amendment before the House.  If  he\r\n\r\nshould  fail, then, of course, there  is  his  next\r\n\r\nbest,  the  one who knows all about Communism,  who\r\n\r\ndepends  on the Special Branch for his information,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs. What  is  the  real\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  this amendment? It says here,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond   part,  \"in  the  interests  of  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  so  vital to the economic well-being  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore\". Who disagrees  with  a\r\n\r\nstatement  like  that? But the  Government,  having\r\n\r\nfailed in its responsibility, having failed in  its\r\n\r\nindustrialisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme, now tries to find a scapegoat. And where\r\n\r\nelse  better  than to pin it on the Communists  and\r\n\r\nthe pro-Communist elements? Crying \"Communism\",  as\r\n\r\nI  have  said  already a little while ago,  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to benefit anybody, except in this particular\r\n\r\ncase  the  P.A.P. and all those forces allied  with\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. for the suppression of the  legitimate\r\n\r\naspirations  of the workers. Crying \"Communism\"  is\r\n\r\nnot  new. It has been done before, Sir, and on many\r\n\r\noccasions,  we  had also touched on this.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso told the House that long ago the cry \"radical\"\r\n\r\nwas directed against anti-anyone who happened to be\r\n\r\nagainst the Government. Later on the smear word was\r\n\r\n\"socialists\".  A thing which a lot  of  people  may\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten is that 1900 years  ago  the  smear\r\n\r\nword  was  \"Christian\". Of course, today, they  use\r\n\r\nother smear words. They are \"red\", \"pink\", \"fellow-travellers\"  and  \"Communist\".  Do  they  not  have\r\n\r\nanything  new?  Is the P.A.P. Government  today  so\r\n\r\nutterly bankrupt that their leaders cannot think of\r\n\r\nanything to salvage their sinking prestige?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motives behind this amendment are very\r\n\r\nclear.  First, in moving the motion here they  want\r\n\r\nto adopt the same tactics which they adopted at the\r\n\r\nlast  Assembly  sitting;  namely,  they  want   the\r\n\r\nAssembly to cover the action which they want to but\r\n\r\ndare  not  take. It is clear to everybody that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  intention  of  the  Government  is  to  take\r\n\r\nrepressive  action  against the workers.  But  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  got the guts to do it. They  want  cover\r\n\r\nfrom  the Assembly. Then they would say, if anybody\r\n\r\nshould  complain, that the action was  endorsed  by\r\n\r\nthe Assembly. In the Assembly the Opposition too is\r\n\r\nthere, and, therefore, the whole responsibility  of\r\n\r\nsuch repressive action would not fall on the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalone.  That  is their line of argument.  But  that\r\n\r\nwill not deceive anybody. They are always trying to\r\n\r\nget  the  Assembly as cover. It is a  very  foolish\r\n\r\nthing  because it is becoming too common. Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  it  already. By crying \"Communism\"  at  this\r\n\r\nstage, Sir, of course, they also want to create\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  atmosphere of fear, doubt and uncertainty;  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they have created this atmosphere of tension,\r\n\r\nthey  hope that a lot of people will get frightened\r\n\r\nso that when ultimately they take repressive action\r\n\r\nvery  few  people will dare raise their  voices  in\r\n\r\nprotest.  These are tricks which have been  adopted\r\n\r\nin the colonial mother countries on many occasions,\r\n\r\nand  the P.A.P. are trying the same tactics  today.\r\n\r\nBut  let  me  tell  them this. In their  trying  to\r\n\r\ncreate doubt and uncertainty, fear and suspense  in\r\n\r\nthe  minds of the people, they are actually  trying\r\n\r\nto shove responsibility away from the Government in\r\n\r\ntheir  inability  to  carry  out  their  industrial\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Everybody  knows  that  the   fear   of\r\n\r\nindustrialists in coming forward today  is  because\r\n\r\nof  the political instability. They would not  want\r\n\r\nto  invest  in  a country when they know  that  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the day may be pushed  out  at  any\r\n\r\nminute  and  when  they very  well  know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no earthly chance whatsoever of ever\r\n\r\nbeing  returned to power. Such being the case,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. think it might be a good idea to  pass  the\r\n\r\nbuck  over  to the unions instead. They  have  been\r\n\r\nstigmatizing  the  unions for a long  time.  It  is\r\n\r\nalways  an  easy  way out crying \"Communism\",  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is very safe. When you cry \"Communism\",\r\n\r\nthe  Communists who are underground will  not  come\r\n\r\nforward  to  defend  themselves,  and  we  in   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional arena will also not come forward  to\r\n\r\ndefend  Communism. So is it not  nice,  is  it  not\r\n\r\neasy?  Always  blame  the  Communists.  Nobody  can\r\n\r\nanswer  anything.  When  it  comes  to  talking  of\r\n\r\nCommunism,  I would like to tell them  a  few  home\r\n\r\ntruths,  namely,  that it is only  people  who  are\r\n\r\nutterly  bankrupt of ideas and who  are  hopelessly\r\n\r\nirresponsible who will go on this particular  line.\r\n\r\nThe  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  has  listed so many instances of  so-called\r\n\r\nCommunist and pro-Communist activities. Why not  be\r\n\r\nbrave  enough  to identify those people  concerned?\r\n\r\nName  them.  Then  carry out  what  you  have  long\r\n\r\nintended to do; send them to the country, put  them\r\n\r\nbehind  bars,  so  that the  people  who  are  now\r\n\r\nagainst the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  the people who are supporting the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the people who are completely  disgusted\r\n\r\nwith  the  present Government, can be put away,  so\r\n\r\nthat they may not be able to come forward to oppose\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Then maybe the P.A.P. hope to  isolate\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis,  reduce  our  strength  and\r\n\r\nperhaps when there is a general election, they hope\r\n\r\nthat  they might still have a fighting chance.  And\r\n\r\nif  they could take away the core, the real  ground\r\n\r\nwork   from   our   Barisan  Sosialis,   then   our\r\n\r\norganisation,  our strength, will  be  reduced  and\r\n\r\nthen,  so they think, they will be able to take  us\r\n\r\non   at   an  advantage.  All  these  actions   and\r\n\r\nintentions  of  the P.A.P. are very reminiscent  of\r\n\r\nthe days of the Lim Yew Hock Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said that the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\ntoday  does  not  differ very much from  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of the previous Government. Now that  the\r\n\r\namendment has come forward, it makes me wonder what\r\n\r\nis  the  real  intention  and  motive  behind  that\r\n\r\noriginal  motion. Is it to allow a chance  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  move  their amendment  about  the  pro-Communist  elements? Is it or is it not? I  wonder,\r\n\r\nSir, what really was in the mind of the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill. Because we know during the days  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government repressive action was taken  on\r\n\r\nthe  slightest excuse against workers. They  called\r\n\r\nthem subversives. They called them so many things - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill can speak his mind afterwards.

(since  so\r\n\r\nmany  of  them are not here, I hope they will  pass\r\n\r\nthe  word round). Do not let yourselves be used  by\r\n\r\nthe  selfish Front benches just to keep  their  own\r\n\r\npositions.   Do  not  lend  your  names   to   such\r\n\r\nrepressive  action. Never allow your  names  to  be\r\n\r\nlinked with people who want to suppress people just\r\n\r\nfor  their own selfish ends. Never do a thing  like\r\n\r\nthat.  We all know the Prime Minister is trying  to\r\n\r\nprove   himself  not  only  an  anti-Communist   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  is  anxious to gain  repute  as  an\r\n\r\ninternational anti-Communist. By so doing, he hopes\r\n\r\nto  gain  a  lot of support from the Americans  and\r\n\r\nfrom  other sources. Then all the power of  capital\r\n\r\nand  capitalists from outside Singapore  will  also\r\n\r\nhelp to influence the power that be to keep him  in\r\n\r\npower. The only snag is, in spite of all this,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  still not be able  to  make  it.

Even when they sleep and dream,\r\n\r\nthey  dream of Communists. I would like to  suggest\r\n\r\nto  them  that this kind of behaviour is  something\r\n\r\nlike  a disease. They have been enchanted according\r\n\r\nto  the Chinese, and the best thing for them to  do\r\n\r\nis  to go to Sago Lane to have a Chinese Taoist  to\r\n\r\ndrive   away  the  evil  spirits,  so  that   their\r\n\r\nbewilderment  can be driven away. In  this  manner,\r\n\r\nthey  will  not be so confused when  they  look  at\r\n\r\nthings.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is  said  that  when\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore was moving on to the present site,\r\n\r\nthere  was some sort of evil spirit there. At  that\r\n\r\ntime the Government invited all the leaders of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  religious groups to drive away the  ghost.\r\n\r\nSince there has been a precedent in this matter,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  suggest to the  P.A.P. that  they\r\n\r\nshould  have some religious man to drive  away  the\r\n\r\nspirit of the Communists. The best course for  them\r\n\r\nto  take is to go before the Government building in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council, put up there a very huge  paper\r\n\r\nfigure  representing the Communists  and  then  set\r\n\r\nthis paper figure on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Serjeant-at-Arms, will\r\n\r\nyou see that order is kept in the Gallery? There is\r\n\r\nunnecessary laughter in the Gallery and even  as  I\r\n\r\nlook  up  there, I see some strangers indulging  in\r\n\r\nlaughter.  I  would like you to keep order  in  the\r\n\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (In Mandarin): I believe that\r\n\r\nif  the  Government accept my suggestion of burning\r\n\r\nthe  effigy of a Communist they will then calm down\r\n\r\nand come to their senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I am going back to the\r\n\r\nmotion  itself.  I  do  not claim  to  be  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist. Because of this, I am not very sure about\r\n\r\ntrade  union  matters. But according to  my  common\r\n\r\nsense, I feel that this amendment of the Government\r\n\r\nis  very  preposterous and illogical. In the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  I  would  like to ask: if this  House  does\r\n\r\naccept  this motion, then the Government will  take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  suppress and gaol all the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\npeople - does  it mean that there will be  industrial\r\n\r\npeace in Singapore after this action? I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  a  Minister of the P.A.P, to  answer  that\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that everybody who\r\n\r\nreads   newspapers  knows  that   in   industrially\r\n\r\nadvanced countries like the United Kingdom and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of America the Communists  are  not\r\n\r\nsupported and welcomed by the people. Although  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  those  countries  do  not  welcome  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  are  there  no  strikes?   There   are\r\n\r\nwidespread strikes and there is industrial  strife.\r\n\r\nWhat explanation can be given for such a situation?\r\n\r\nWe  will  leave  the U.K. and the U.S.A. and  take\r\n\r\nIndia  for  example.  Not  long  ago,  there   were\r\n\r\nwidespread  strikes in India. The  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nIndian Government servants were not manipulated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, and therefore the  union  was  not\r\n\r\nmanipulated  by  the  Communists.  Yet  there  were\r\n\r\nunprecedented   strikes.   Therefore,   it   is   a\r\n\r\ndistortion  of  fact and a deceiving  statement  to\r\n\r\nattribute  our  local  industrial  unrest  to   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. I personally do not know the details of\r\n\r\nevery case of industrial unrest or strike. But from\r\n\r\nreports  in the newspapers, I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nstrikes by non-P.A.P. unions were blamed for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe industrial strife. But we do remember very well\r\n\r\nthat  the  Daily-Rated Employees Union of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  held a three-week strike. Can it  be  said\r\n\r\nthat the leaders of this union were manipulated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communists? From the newspapers it can be seen\r\n\r\nthat  the  present Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture is the head of the  A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\nwhich  has  given notice of strike action.  Another\r\n\r\nsponsored trade unionist of the P.A.P. is Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair  who  is  the  leader of  the  Singapore  Bank\r\n\r\nEmployees Union which has taken industrial  action.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also another union - the Singapore  Manual\r\n\r\nand  Mercantile Workers Union - led  by  Mr  Gomez.\r\n\r\nThis union has often given notice of strike action.\r\n\r\nIn all the instances I have mentioned, the cause of\r\n\r\nindustrial strife and industrial unrest  cannot  be\r\n\r\npurely attributed to the Communists. You cannot say\r\n\r\nthat all strikes are Communist inspired. If you say\r\n\r\nthat  that  is  so, then all unions  including  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. and those led by Mr Devan Nair can be  so\r\n\r\nclassified.  If  the Government intends  really  to\r\n\r\ntake  action against these people, then  they  must\r\n\r\ntreat other people alike. They must put in gaol all\r\n\r\nthose  responsible for industrial  unrest.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to take action against unions which\r\n\r\nare  their political opponents, then they would not\r\n\r\nbring about industrial peace in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather reluctant to\r\n\r\ndisclose this, but since the P.A.P. Government  now\r\n\r\npretend to be a Government in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, I feel compelled to disclose the  facts  I\r\n\r\nknow.  When I first began to work in the P.A.P.,  I\r\n\r\nwas   engaged  in  the  Trade  Union  Research  and\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Bureau of the P.A.P. I was the only  paid\r\n\r\nworker  of this organisation and there was  also  a\r\n\r\nperson who was paid but did no work. If you want to\r\n\r\nlook up this matter, you can find out that the  man\r\n\r\nwho  held this post was a sinecurist. You can  also\r\n\r\nfind out the amount of provident fund in respect of\r\n\r\nmy  post.  This so-called Trade Union Research  and\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Bureau was one in which I  worked  as  an\r\n\r\ninvestigator.  At  the  beginning,   I   was   very\r\n\r\nenthusiastic in my work. But what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  there to investigate? There was no plan. I did\r\n\r\nnot  know  the kind of work I was to do. I  had  to\r\n\r\ndraw on my experience as a journalist to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe  work  in  my capacity as an investigator  when\r\n\r\ntalking  to the leaders of the unions in  order  to\r\n\r\nget  their views. Who asked me to do this  kind  of\r\n\r\nwork? It was none other than the Prime Minister who\r\n\r\nwas  then  the Secretary-General of the P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nTrade Union Advisory Bureau had a signboard next to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. signboard. They were  using  the  same\r\n\r\noffice  and the same table. So from this experience\r\n\r\nI  know  all about the labour policy of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nNow  if  they  were  just to keep  quiet  about  it\r\n\r\ninstead of boasting about their labour policy, then\r\n\r\nI will not have to disclose the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But as  far  as  the  Chair  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  is  what he is saying relevant  to  the\r\n\r\namendment,  which introduces the  element  of  pro-Communist  political agitators for  political  ends\r\n\r\ncreating  industrial  unrest,  and  calls  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice in the interests - and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the addition - \"of industrial expansion  so\r\n\r\nvital  to the economic well-being of the people...\",\r\n\r\nand  with  a further addition in order \"to  prevent\r\n\r\ngenuine  industrial grievances from being exploited\r\n\r\nfor Communist ends\"? The Communist element has been\r\n\r\nintroduced  as  well as the element  of  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion vital to the economic well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. The hon.

Mr Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what I was saying was actually aimed  at  the\r\n\r\namendment  because I have already said that  I  was\r\n\r\nrising to speak on the preposterous amendment moved\r\n\r\nby the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was trying to show was that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\noriginally did not have any labour policy. Now that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  get the support of the workers,  they\r\n\r\nare  therefore very worried that the leaders of the\r\n\r\nworkers   and  the  broad  masses  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves will discard the P.A.P. policy.  And  so\r\n\r\nthe  Government have moved this amendment.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   this   amendment  aims  at   the   political\r\n\r\nachievements  of the P.A.P. instead  of  aiming  at\r\n\r\nbringing about industrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes\r\n\r\nto speak only on the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu) (In Mandarin):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, originally I did not  intend  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  but  having listened to the speech  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\non this amendment, I have a feeling that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  present  is  trying  to  shirk  its\r\n\r\nresponsibility, instead of facing the people. Take,\r\n\r\nfor  example, the question of industrial peace. All\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore can see clearly that it  is\r\n\r\nbecause of the failure of the P.A.P. to keep  their\r\n\r\npromises   that  there  is  industrial  unrest   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And so just for the sake of  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests,  the P.A.P. have set up many unions.  The\r\n\r\nCity Council strike actually came about as a result\r\n\r\nof their manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I made it clear\r\n\r\nthat  the debate now is on the amendment only,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is, the introduction of the Communist element\r\n\r\nin  the  motion as well as the effect  of  that  on\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion vital to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economic well-being of the people. That is all\r\n\r\nwe  are debating about at the moment. Later on, the\r\n\r\nhon.   Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  will  have   every\r\n\r\nopportunity of saying what he wishes to say on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral aspects of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am only trying to say that it is  not  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  who are trying to bring about  strikes.\r\n\r\nIt is the Government itself that is causing strike.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot  shirk its responsibility and blame  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  who  just cannot  stand  up  to  defend\r\n\r\nthemselves. So, as a representative of the  people,\r\n\r\nsay that there is a lot of work not yet done by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Instead   of   carrying   out   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, they are trying to use  the  name\r\n\r\nof Communists to cover up their failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This term \"Communists\" was frequently used by the\r\n\r\ncolonial Government and the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nbecause  at that time they were trying to  suppress\r\n\r\nthe  people instead of trying to serve the  people.\r\n\r\nSo  whenever  anyone criticised the Government  for\r\n\r\nnot doing work for the people, he would be called a\r\n\r\nCommunist.  The P.A.P. Government now is  resorting\r\n\r\nto  the  same  tactics  employed  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the colonial Government.  So  I  am\r\n\r\njust saying that there is an ulterior motive in the\r\n\r\namendment - to put the responsibility partly  on  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and partly on the Communists. They\r\n\r\nare trying to create this Communist phobia in order\r\n\r\nto  use  it as an excuse to suppress the people  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  In  the past two years of its office,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has failed in many respects, especially\r\n\r\nin  dealing with strikes. It is now trying  to  put\r\n\r\nthe blame on the Communists in order to confuse the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about seven or eight months\r\n\r\nago,  the  People's Association was set up  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take charge of community centres.  We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  the  setting up  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, as stated in its constitution, was  to\r\n\r\ngive  proper  recreation facilities to the  people.\r\n\r\nBut  in  actual practice this was not done, because\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  gave  directives  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  People's  Association  that  they\r\n\r\nshould serve the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member satisfy the\r\n\r\nChair  that  this  has something  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  element which has been  introduced  into\r\n\r\nthe motion? If he can, he can carry on; otherwise I\r\n\r\nsuggest that he reserve his remarks until later  on\r\n\r\nwhen he has an opportunity of speaking. We are  now\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the  amendment. Let  us  come  to  a\r\n\r\ndecision in so far as the amendment is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  People's Association went on strike  for\r\n\r\nseven to eight months, and because the Union or the\r\n\r\norganisation   of   workers   was   involved,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not recognise this strike.  Instead\r\n\r\nit  disregarded their grievances and put the  whole\r\n\r\nblame on the Communists. So I say that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has not as\r\n\r\nyet  satisfied the Chair that this trouble  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association has anything to do with  this\r\n\r\nCommunist  element which has been  introduced  into\r\n\r\nthe  motion.  Is  he  alleging  that  there  was  a\r\n\r\nCommunist element there? Or is he saying  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have alleged that there was a  Communist\r\n\r\nelement  there? I do not know. But will he come  to\r\n\r\nthe point, and the Chair will be satisfied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): r Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  strike  in the People's Association  was\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  one agitated by the Communists,  and\r\n\r\nsince  the  Communist element has  been  introduced\r\n\r\ninto the amendment, I am trying to link them up  to\r\n\r\nshow  that instead of trying to settle the  strike,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  put  the  whole  blame   on   the\r\n\r\nCommunists, unless the workers' organisation can be\r\n\r\nexploited  by  them.  Now, if  the  unions  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  organisation cannot  be  exploited  and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred  by  the P.A.P., then  action  would  be\r\n\r\ntaken  against  them. That is why I say  that  this\r\n\r\nincident in the People's Association is related  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment. I am just giving an example to show\r\n\r\nthat all the blame regarding strikes is put on  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is necessary to\r\n\r\ncriticise  the Government for trying to  shirk  its\r\n\r\nduties. The Government is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot doing anything for the workers. Let us take the\r\n\r\nincident at the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation\r\n\r\nas  an  example. The strike at the O.C.B.C. was  a\r\n\r\ncause  of  great  inconvenience to  businessmen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is this another of the\r\n\r\nstrikes   which   the  Member  alleges   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment say was Communist-inspired? If so,  then\r\n\r\nhe is in order. If not, then he is out of order.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest to the hon. Member that he  has  the\r\n\r\nopportunity,  and he will have the opportunity,  of\r\n\r\nspeaking about these strikes individually  when  we\r\n\r\ncome  to  the main motion. We are now dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  because  this  union  concerned  is  inclined\r\n\r\ntowards  the P.A.P., and since this amendment  says\r\n\r\nthat  industrial unrest is the result of  agitation\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists, I dare say that  not  all  the\r\n\r\nblame  of  industrial unrest  should  fall  on  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Even without Communist agitation  there\r\n\r\nis  industrial unrest or industrial strife. This is\r\n\r\nthe  position as I know it, and it is because  they\r\n\r\nwant  to oppress the workers and fail to keep their\r\n\r\npromises made to the workers that they have to find\r\n\r\na way out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nafraid of the freedom for people to organise.  This\r\n\r\namendment  aims at threatening people in regard  to\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech. Because of the tone contained in\r\n\r\nthe amendment, if future union leaders who want  to\r\n\r\nfight for the interests of the workers should carry\r\n\r\nout  a struggle, then they have to think twice,  in\r\n\r\nview  of this amendment, as it claims that the  so-called industrial unrest is the result of agitation\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists.  So if they  should  take  any\r\n\r\nindustrial  action,  they  would  be  described  as\r\n\r\nCommunist agitators and be dealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel it necessary to express my\r\n\r\nviews  to the Government Benches. It is my  opinion\r\n\r\nthat the struggle of the workers sometimes, if  not\r\n\r\nalways,   is  reasonable.  In  this  respect,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should try its best to help  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the workers.

What they are dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  is not the scheme for the development of  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh   itself,  but  the  Government's   rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation   in   regard  to  the   question   of\r\n\r\nresettlement  for  the care of the  residents.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not taken into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nlosses  incurred by the 25,000 residents there.  It\r\n\r\nhas  never taken their interest into consideration.\r\n\r\nIt  has only passed decrees to carry out its  plans\r\n\r\nwithout such consideration. This rude attitude  and\r\n\r\naction  of  the  Government  is  contrary  to   the\r\n\r\npromises  made by it to the people at the  time  of\r\n\r\nthe   general  elections.  The  present   rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation   is  based  on  the  Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  rate which was stipulated in  1956.  In\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.

According  to page  2  of  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\npamphlet, Book I, it says in regard to the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nrural policy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The position of all agricultural lands at\r\n\r\npresent in the occupation of squatter farmers which\r\n\r\nhave  been  zoned in the Master Plan as  sites  for\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns  or  potential industrial  estates\r\n\r\nwill be  reviewed and the fullest consideration will\r\n\r\nbe  given  to the representation of the members  of\r\n\r\nthe farming community before any decisions are made\r\n\r\nas  to the future use to which such lands shall  be \r\n\r\nput.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, the most important part which  merits\r\n\r\nour  attention in this passage is that the  fullest\r\n\r\nconsideration would be given to representations  of\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the farming community. The request  of\r\n\r\nthe  Toa Payoh residents to the Government is  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government   should  fully   consider   their\r\n\r\nrepresentations. But what has the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ndone?  It  should consider carefully the views  and\r\n\r\nrepresentations of the Toa Payoh residents. But has\r\n\r\nthe    P.A.P.    Government    done    so?    Their\r\n\r\nrepresentations are very simple and clear. They are\r\n\r\nnot  like the P.A.P. promises made at the  time  of\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections, which were  some  kind  of\r\n\r\ntrickery and were of a very confused nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the request of the Toa Payoh residents is\r\n\r\nthat  when they are asked to remove, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  give  them  adequate, reasonable  and  just\r\n\r\ncompensation  for  the loss of  their  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce  and all the structures built on the  land.\r\n\r\nAt   the   moment,   the   Government's   rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation   is  based  on  the  Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment's rate of compensation which  was  fixed\r\n\r\nin   1956.   The  rate  of  this  old   scheme   of\r\n\r\ncompensation was very low. Thus the rural residents\r\n\r\nwould have to incur great losses if they were to be\r\n\r\npaid  according  to  this old rate.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nrequest of the residents of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  is that after they have resettled,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  look after  their  welfare.  It\r\n\r\nshould  not  let them be homeless or unemployed  so\r\n\r\nthat  they would suffer the misery of unemployment.\r\n\r\nBut  according to the present Government  measures,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has not given any safeguard to  the\r\n\r\nresidents  who  are affected in  respect  of  their\r\n\r\nfuture  livelihood. At the present moment, most  of\r\n\r\nthem  are carrying on farming. In future, when they\r\n\r\nare removed to new resettlement areas, they will be\r\n\r\nfaced  with the problem of a shortage of  land  and\r\n\r\nthey  may not have adequate land to carry  on  with\r\n\r\ntheir  own trade, that is to say, farming and other\r\n\r\nthings.  Hawkers perhaps will also  be  unemployed.\r\n\r\nThere  is  always  such  a danger  and  uncertainty\r\n\r\nbefore  them. About 1,000 residents who  have  been\r\n\r\nengaging  in  the  bean-curd  business  and  rattan\r\n\r\nindustry  will  also be faced with the  problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.  Therefore, the Toa  Payoh  residents\r\n\r\nare  rather worried about their future.  They  have\r\n\r\nall  sorts of misgivings and uncertainty.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the P.A.P. leaders whether they  have\r\n\r\ngiven full consideration to the representations and\r\n\r\nviews  of the Toa Payoh residents affected  by  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  scheme.  The  answer  from   them   is\r\n\r\nobviously   no.   In   order   to   present   their\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and views to the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nresidents of Toa Payoh convened mass rallies.  They\r\n\r\nlaunched  signature  campaigns  in  the  area.  The\r\n\r\nCountry  People's Association also spent  over  one\r\n\r\nmonth  interviewing the residents in the  area  and\r\n\r\nseeking  their  views. In the end  the  Association\r\n\r\ndrafted two memoranda which were presented  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.    These    memoranda    systematically\r\n\r\npresented  the  views  of the residents  and  their\r\n\r\nrequest  to  the  Government. But the  Government's\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  these representations  was  very\r\n\r\nbad.   The   Government   entirely   ignored    the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives     from    the     people.     The\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people wanted  to  see  the\r\n\r\nMinister,   but  the  Minister  and  the   officers\r\n\r\nresponsible  refused  to see them.  They  used  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of pretexts and elusive tactics not  to  see\r\n\r\nthem.  Can  this  attitude  on  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  be  satisfactory  to  the   Toa   Payoh\r\n\r\nresidents? Can this kind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Government be pleasant to the people?  Can  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  any confidence in such a  Government?\r\n\r\nThe  Government's barbarity and its wrong  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the Toa Payoh problem have incurred the ill-feelings and misgivings of the Toa Payoh residents.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. Government has involved itself in a way\r\n\r\nwhich is just like hitting itself with a stone. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government has not tried to review its  past\r\n\r\nmistakes and rectify them. On the contrary,  it  is\r\n\r\nlevelling  accusations against me and  the  Country\r\n\r\nPeople's Association for creating troubles  against\r\n\r\nthe Government. All this is absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Toa Payoh satellite town\r\n\r\nplan  was  proposed last year. At that time  I  was\r\n\r\nstill  with the P.A.P. Government. Ever  since  the\r\n\r\nplan   was  proposed,  it  has  caused  worry   and\r\n\r\nmisgivings  to  the  Toa Payoh residents.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government did not at the  same  time\r\n\r\nannounce   a  reasonable  and  adequate   rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation and they did not announce its plan for\r\n\r\nresettlement  of the residents in Toa Payoh.  After\r\n\r\nseveral  contacts, with them, I came to  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  misgivings  and worry. On many  occasions  I\r\n\r\ntold the leaders o, the P.A.P. about the views  and\r\n\r\nthe  requests of the people affected. As  early  as\r\n\r\n3rd  May,  1961,  I presented a memorandum  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, and also to  the\r\n\r\nleaders,  to  remind them of the  worries  and  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the people. I suggested that  the  three\r\n\r\nparties,  that  is, myself, certain representatives\r\n\r\nfrom   the   people   and  the   Country   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  should form a consultative  committee\r\n\r\nto look into the Toa Payoh resettlement problem. At\r\n\r\nthe   same  time,  the  Toa  Payoh  P.A.P.   Branch\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  also convened a joint  Branch  and\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  meeting  to discuss  various  matters\r\n\r\naffecting  the  Toa  Payoh  residents  which   were\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to their interest and to the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the people living there. At that time, that is,\r\n\r\nin  May last year, about 20 Branch secretaries  and\r\n\r\nassistant    secretaries   had   presented    their\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the leaders of the P.A.P. on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the Toa Payoh development  scheme  and\r\n\r\nresettlement  problems.  The  representations  said\r\n\r\nthat in implementing the Toa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayoh satellite town plan, the Government had  held\r\n\r\nno  prior consultation with the residents there and\r\n\r\nhad  no  understanding of the living conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents there. In fact, it had not paid much\r\n\r\nattention   to   the  problems  of  resolving   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the people affected by  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nThough  the  plan itself is good, nevertheless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has never taken into consideration  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people affected.  The  People's\r\n\r\nlivelihood  depends on business and  trades.  These\r\n\r\nare  closely linked with the place they live in and\r\n\r\nthe  people affected will incur certain  losses  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  their  property and  belongings.  This\r\n\r\nshould also be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the request and views of the\r\n\r\npeople affected can be likened to a stone which has\r\n\r\nsunk  in  the sea. They did not evoke any  response\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P.  Government. The  Government  has\r\n\r\nentirely ignored the misery and the difficulties of\r\n\r\nthe  people affected. On this point we, the  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  suggested various views and requests  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government, had in the end to part ways\r\n\r\nwith  the P.A.P. leadership politically. At present\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leadership  have  incurred  the  great\r\n\r\ndispleasure  and dissatisfaction of the  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nresidents.  Now the P.A.P. leaders  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nseek  some  other  side issues in order  to  divert\r\n\r\nattention. They now construe the Toa Payoh  problem\r\n\r\nas  a  kind of political question and put the blame\r\n\r\non  the Barisan Sosialis. They are accusing  us  of\r\n\r\npurposely  trying to create confusion  and  trouble\r\n\r\nand    also   create   ill-feelings   against   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. These tactics on the part of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndisclose   the  Party's  barbarity,  rudeness   and\r\n\r\nunreasonableness  in  dealing with  this  question.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of  levelling accusations and  throwing\r\n\r\nblame  will  not  help  solve the  various  matters\r\n\r\narising from the Toa Payoh development plan at all.\r\n\r\nIf  the  P.A.P. Government had sincerely  respected\r\n\r\nthe views and representations of the people and the\r\n\r\nRural  People's Association in thinking out a  good\r\n\r\nplan to deal with the Toa Payoh problems, i.e.,  to\r\n\r\nlook after the interests of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  affected  and to have  a  certain  kind  of\r\n\r\nsafeguard for their livelihood, then this  question\r\n\r\ncould have been resolved amicably. It is now trying\r\n\r\nto pay for its phoney merger and Malaysia Plan with\r\n\r\nthe  money it has, but it is not willing to  settle\r\n\r\nthe Toa Payoh problem. It has spent about $130,000\r\n\r\non   Malaysia  Week  and  the  Malaysia  Solidarity\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee. It has spent about  $40,000\r\n\r\nto  $50,000  in  distributing Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew's\r\n\r\npamphlets  for his personal propaganda.  These  are\r\n\r\nissued   in   small  pamphlets  numbering   a   few\r\n\r\nthousands. But as to the request made by the 25,000\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh residents, the P.A.P. Government is  not\r\n\r\neven interested in their livelihood and after-care.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, the P.A.P. Government is issuing\r\n\r\nstatements  in  the newspapers and trying  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  it is helping the Toa Payoh residents to move\r\n\r\ninto  a kind of paradise, whereas we, on the  other\r\n\r\nhand, are trying to prevent them from resettling in\r\n\r\na  paradise. It has been said that we have lost the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the people of Singapore. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the people are the supreme authority and  the\r\n\r\nfinal  judge on the question of what is  right  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  wrong, what is true and what is false.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  draw the attention of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership to this fact. I would like seriously  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  the P.A.P. leadership. If  any  of  them\r\n\r\nwants to resign now, I would like to contest him in\r\n\r\na  future  by-election in order to let  the  people\r\n\r\npass their final judgment on us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, I would like to quote from a\r\n\r\nGovernment Press release dated 10th March, 1962. It\r\n\r\nstarted off briefly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has now become clear that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  having failed to work up  public  opinion\r\n\r\nagainst the Government among the workers, students,\r\n\r\nPeople's Association employees and members  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade, are now, in conjunction  with  their\r\n\r\nsympathisers,  the  Country  People's  Association,\r\n\r\nturning their attention to farmers and other  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  Towards this end, they are now  trying  to\r\n\r\nwork  up anti-Government feeling over the Ton Payoh\r\n\r\nDevelopment Scheme.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of us knows that they are turning\r\n\r\ntheir  attention  to  the  farmers  and  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople. One week ago, the Member for Toa Payoh  and\r\n\r\nhis  Party  held a mass meeting in  Toa  Payoh.  We\r\n\r\nheard  from the Member for Toa Payoh just now  that\r\n\r\nthere  are about 25,000 settlers in Toa Payoh,  and\r\n\r\nout  of  this  25,000 settlers, only  150  of  them\r\n\r\nturned up at this meeting. The other 400 or 500 who\r\n\r\nmade  up  the crowd were brought in. It just  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the people who voted for the Member  for  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  voted for the P.A.P. They did not  vote  for\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Toa Payoh was still in\r\n\r\nthe Government, he vigorously advised the people of\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  to  accept  the Government's  terms  of\r\n\r\ncompensation as fair and reasonable, and  he  urged\r\n\r\nthem  to  move out to resettlement areas set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  them by the Government. Now that he is in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, he sings a different tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh and his friends in the\r\n\r\nCountry People's Association have been told of  the\r\n\r\nmany  amendments this Government has  made  to  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  terms.  They pretend,  however,  that\r\n\r\nthey do not know. To refresh their memories, I will\r\n\r\nmention  some  of these items. For  concrete  water\r\n\r\nponds   in  the  agricultural  areas,  which   were\r\n\r\npreviously not eligible for compensation  they  are\r\n\r\nnow compensated for by the Government according  to\r\n\r\ntheir  cubic capacity. This was introduced  on  8th\r\n\r\nOctober,  1959.  Again  on  11th  July,  1960,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  enlarged the list of  items  for  which\r\n\r\ncompensation would be paid by including such  other\r\n\r\nitems as Buah Namnam, Daun Pandan and orchids,  all\r\n\r\nof  which  are  crops grown fairly  widely  by  the\r\n\r\ncountry  people. On 15th January, 1962,  a  further\r\n\r\namendment  was made to provide for compensation  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid to owners of prawn ponds due for clearance\r\n\r\nbased on the cubic yardage of the earth fillings to\r\n\r\nbunds  and  the number of sluice gates  and  Bakau\r\n\r\npayas.  These new rates of compensation  for  prawn\r\n\r\nponds   proved  so  satisfactory  to  all   parties\r\n\r\nconcerned that the clearance of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsettlers  at Tanjong Kling and Joe David  Road  for\r\n\r\nthe  development project was affected smoothly  and\r\n\r\nwithout disruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to expanding the list of items for\r\n\r\nwhich  compensation  will be paid,  Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  removed from the schemes of compensation  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  as to the maximum amount of  payment  a\r\n\r\nsettler with less than one acre of land may  obtain\r\n\r\nfrom   Government  by  way  of  compensation.  This\r\n\r\namendment,  which  was introduced  on  28th  April,\r\n\r\n1960, enables a farmer with a holding of less  than\r\n\r\none  acre  to be eligible for the possible  maximum\r\n\r\ncompensation of $1,500 for his crops,  fruit  trees\r\n\r\nand  flowers.  In  November  1960,  the  Government\r\n\r\nrevised  Resettlement Scheme C  to  provide  for  a\r\n\r\nsettler who cannot be classified as a farmer to get\r\n\r\ncompensation also. Under the unrevised scheme, such\r\n\r\na  settler was not entitled to any compensation for\r\n\r\nimprovements effected to the land he occupied. Now,\r\n\r\nnot  only this settler, but also his bona fide sub-tenants  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for\r\n\r\nimprovements.  In addition, each of  them  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a free basic house and a small plot of  land\r\n\r\non  which  he can continue to carry on his  present\r\n\r\noccupation.  Government has already  announced  its\r\n\r\nintention  to apply this revised Scheme C  together\r\n\r\nwith a special scheme of house exchange to meet the\r\n\r\nspecial  conditions in Toa Payoh. A $5,000  terrace\r\n\r\nhouse with its own yard along Kim Keat Road will be\r\n\r\ngiven free to the owner-occupier of an existing hut\r\n\r\nin  Toa Payoh, who, is willing to give up his whole\r\n\r\nhut  in  exchange  for  a Government-built  terrace\r\n\r\nhouse.  He  will pay a ground rent of $5 per  month\r\n\r\nand   will   be  free  to  carry  on  his  previous\r\n\r\noccupation   of  beancurd-making,  poultry-rearing,\r\n\r\netc.  This  exchange will, in fact, mean  that  the\r\n\r\nsettler  concerned will be getting a $5,000 terrace\r\n\r\nhouse  with  all the amenities laid on in  exchange\r\n\r\nfor an old and often unsanitary hut worth less than\r\n\r\n$2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation by the Member for Toa Payoh and\r\n\r\nhis friends that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  Toa Payoh did not know where they  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be resettled is without foundation.  The\r\n\r\nsettlers had been told individually by resettlement\r\n\r\ninspectors  where they were going to be  resettled.\r\n\r\nThey  were  also told that they would  be  free  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  the same occupation in their new  homes.\r\n\r\nThe  further charge that the settlers were  not  or\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  given full compensation is nonsense.\r\n\r\nGovernment compensation terms have been given  wide\r\n\r\npublicity in the last few days. Yet the Member  for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh, the Country People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  the Rural Residents'  Association\r\n\r\nkeep  on  repeating that the terms of  compensation\r\n\r\nare  insufficient and are pressing their  fantastic\r\n\r\ndemands. For instance, they want the Government  to\r\n\r\npay  compensation at the rate of $30 per  vegetable\r\n\r\nbed  to  farmers. Sir, one acre of land can  easily\r\n\r\naccommodate  300  such  beds and  the  compensation\r\n\r\nwould  amount  to $9,000. Again, for  earth  orchid\r\n\r\nnurseries,  the  Association wants  a  compensation\r\n\r\nrate  of  $100  per plot and, on the basis  of  300\r\n\r\nplots  to an acre, the total compensation  for  one\r\n\r\nacre of orchid nurseries works out to $30,000. They\r\n\r\nknow full well that no government can afford to pay\r\n\r\nsuch  fantastic compensation terms. But then,  Sir.\r\n\r\ntheir  objective  is  not  to  reach  any  amicable\r\n\r\nsettlement  of the issue, but only to create  chaos\r\n\r\nand  confusion among country people to  suit  their\r\n\r\nown  political ends, i.e., to involve country folks\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan  Sosialis'  futile  fight  against\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's schemes of resettlement are\r\n\r\naimed at assisting the people affected by clearance\r\n\r\nto  settle down quickly and continue earning  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  in  their  new  homes.  The  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Scheme   will   provide   not    only\r\n\r\naccommodation for thousands of people who  have  no\r\n\r\nproper homes, hut also employment, both direct  and\r\n\r\nindirect,  for  many thousands of its  inhabitants.\r\n\r\n250,000  to  300,000 people will be housed  in  the\r\n\r\n50,000  housing units and 100 shops that will  rise\r\n\r\nup  in  this  area. There will be four markets,  20\r\n\r\nprimary and secondary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools, community centres and theatres, and  other\r\n\r\namenities  will  also be built to cater  for  these\r\n\r\npeople. But more important than anything else,  the\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh scheme will provide employment for 8,000\r\n\r\npeople  engaged in construction work and the supply\r\n\r\nof  building  materials over a period  of  about  5\r\n\r\nyears.  The  earth that will be cut  off  from  the\r\n\r\nhilly  parts of the Toa Payoh area will be used  to\r\n\r\nreclaim  about  400 acres of land  in  the  Kallang\r\n\r\nBasin.  The  land  so reclaimed will  be  used  for\r\n\r\nresettlement   for  establishment   of   industrial\r\n\r\nestates  that  will  provide  employment  for  some\r\n\r\n30,000 to 40,000 people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the tremendous benefits that the\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  scheme  will bring  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Government  will  not  allow   its\r\n\r\nintentions and its objectives to be deterred by the\r\n\r\nagitations  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and   their\r\n\r\npolitical   stooges   in   the   Country   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  whose sole interest  is  to  see  the\r\n\r\nfailure  of  the Government's Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan  so that the pro-Communists can thrive on  the\r\n\r\nresultant  widespread chaos and  unemployment  that\r\n\r\nwill  arise  from  the failure of this  development\r\n\r\nscheme -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.
