The\r\n\r\nemployer is presented with his requirements plus  50\r\n\r\nper  cent  subject  to a minimum  of  two  men.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  he requires four men, he  is  given  a\r\n\r\nchoice of six men. If the employer fails to complete\r\n\r\nhis  requirements  from the first selection,  he  is\r\n\r\ngiven a second and last selection on the same basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen are permitted to refuse two offers of\r\n\r\nemployment without any penalty. If a third offer  of\r\n\r\nemployment is refused, the seamen's name is  removed\r\n\r\nto the bottom of the roster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of Section 4 of the\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Registry Board Ordinance, 1957, the  Board\r\n\r\nis  required to enter a registered seaman's name  in\r\n\r\nthe  roster according to the date of discharge  from\r\n\r\nhis  last ship or, if the person concerned  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  previously  employed  as  a  seaman,  then  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the date of his registration  as  a\r\n\r\nseaman. This section provides that the Board may sub-divide  a roster or rosters into such categories  as\r\n\r\nit may consider necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provision which requires that a\r\n\r\nregistered seaman shall have his name entered in the\r\n\r\nroster  according to the date of discharge from  his\r\n\r\nlast  ship  causes,  in certain circumstances,  some\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among the seamen. An example of this\r\n\r\ncan  be seen as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seaman may be discharged from a ship on 1st January and he applies to the Board for three months' leave of absence. On reporting back to the Board after the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of his leave, the Ordinance provides that the\r\n\r\nseaman  be  replaced on the roster with effect  from\r\n\r\n1st  January. Seamen who have been discharged  after\r\n\r\n1st  January, and who had not taken leave, and  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reporting regularly for employment  find  that\r\n\r\nthis particular person who had gone away on leave is\r\n\r\nstill   placed  ahead  of  them.  They  feel   quite\r\n\r\nnaturally  that those who had asked  for  leave  and\r\n\r\ntaken such leave should not be given preference over\r\n\r\nthem  in  the roster. In a similar manner, a  seaman\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  suspended for disciplinary  offences\r\n\r\nwould under the existing provision, after the period\r\n\r\nof  suspension,  be placed on the  roster  ahead  of\r\n\r\nseamen  who  have  not been under  suspension.  This\r\n\r\nagain causes extreme dissatisfaction among seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill seeks to delete the requirement\r\n\r\nthat the Board shall enter the seamen's names in the\r\n\r\nroster in accordance with the date of discharge from\r\n\r\ntheir  last  ship. The Board intends to specify  the\r\n\r\nvarious conditions and methods of placing seamen  on\r\n\r\nthe  roster  in the Regulations which the  Board  is\r\n\r\nempowered to make with the approval of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome these various anomalies and\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  caused by them, the  Board  intends\r\n\r\nthat the names of registered seamen shall be entered\r\n\r\nin the appropriate roster in the following manner: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in the case of seamen, who have not been\r\n\r\npreviously registered, according to the  date\r\n\r\nof registration;\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in the case of seamen, who have been granted\r\n\r\nleave  of absence by the Board for any reason\r\n\r\nother than that of illness, according to  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  reporting to the Board,  after  the\r\n\r\nexpiry of their leave;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in the case of seamen, who have had their\r\n\r\nregistration suspended, according to the date\r\n\r\nof reporting to the Board after the period of\r\n\r\nsuspension; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) in the case of seamen, who have been\r\n\r\ndischarged from their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nship,  according to the date of reporting  to\r\n\r\nthe Board after they had been discharged from\r\n\r\nthe  ship:  Provided that in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nregistered  seaman, who has  been  discharged\r\n\r\nfrom the ship without any culpability on  his\r\n\r\npart  after  a period of employment  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  two  months,  the  Board  may,  at  its\r\n\r\nabsolute  discretion, decide the position  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  name  of  such registered  seaman\r\n\r\nshall be entered in the appropriate roster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the Report of the Commission of inquiry\r\n\r\ninto the Port of Singapore (Sessional Paper No.  S10\r\n\r\nof 1957) made the following main recommendations:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That a single Authority should be set up to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible  for the whole  of  the  port\r\n\r\narea.

Since Singapore is in the  front  line  of\r\n\r\nthis  economic  confrontation,  she  has  been   hit\r\n\r\nhardest and certain trades and industries which have\r\n\r\nbeen   traditionally  dependent  on  supplies   from\r\n\r\nIndonesia  have naturally been the first casualties.\r\n\r\nBoth  employers  and employees have  been  adversely\r\n\r\naffected, but whereas employers are used to the  ups\r\n\r\nand  downs  of  business activity and are  generally\r\n\r\nable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  withstand  the  hardships imposed  by  decreased\r\n\r\nactivity,  the employees, on the other hand,  become\r\n\r\nthe  helpless victims of circumstances beyond  their\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have, therefore, set up the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Economic  Defence  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nformulating a scheme to protect workers of Singapore\r\n\r\nagainst  the unpleasant consequences of unemployment\r\n\r\narising   from  the  trade  suspension.  The   broad\r\n\r\nprinciple is that during a period of six months from\r\n\r\nthe  date  a worker is laid off, he will receive  an\r\n\r\namount  equal to two-thirds of his normal wages,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  one-third will be paid by the Government  and\r\n\r\none-third  by  the employer. I must  emphasise  here\r\n\r\nthat  this  is not a relief scheme or  a  dole;  the\r\n\r\nintention is that workers laid off because of  trade\r\n\r\nsuspension should continue to be on the pay-roll  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual  firms during the  currency  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  unless  and  until  they  obtain  employment\r\n\r\nelsewhere. Should confrontation be called off in the\r\n\r\nmeantime, then normal activities will resume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was recognised, however, that in the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  this  principle,   the   special\r\n\r\nproblems   and  peculiarities  of  the   trades   or\r\n\r\nindustries    concerned    should    be    examined.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,    consultations   were    held    with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the trade associations  in  the\r\n\r\nShipping  Industry, the Rubber Industry,  the  Copra\r\n\r\nand  Coconut  Oil Mill Industry, the Sago  Industry,\r\n\r\nthe  Rattan  Industry  and  the  Coffee  and  Pepper\r\n\r\nIndustries  and  with  the  National  Trades   Union\r\n\r\nCongress   in   order  to  overcome  any   practical\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that might arise in the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  scheme.  I  am happy to  state  that  these\r\n\r\nconsultations  have revealed that both  workers  and\r\n\r\nemployers'   representatives   are,   in    general,\r\n\r\nagreeable  to  the  scheme in  principle  but  would\r\n\r\nprefer legislation so that the administration of the\r\n\r\nscheme   could   be   put  on  a  fair,   impartial,\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  and  effective  basis.  This   is   a\r\n\r\nsensible approach, for even though a scheme with the\r\n\r\nvoluntary co-operation of all concerned is laudable,\r\n\r\nthe  detailed administration of the scheme is  bound\r\n\r\nto   generate   difficulties  that   can   only   be\r\n\r\neffectively  dealt  with on the firm  foundation  of\r\n\r\nlegislation. At the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoment,  1,300 workers are receiving benefits  under\r\n\r\nthe  scheme. It is anticipated that, in due  course,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  full  impact of the trade  suspension  is\r\n\r\nfelt,  and  more  factories and  establishments  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  lay  off workers, the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nworkers laid off may rise to somewhere around 8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is, in the light of what I\r\n\r\nhave  already said, to provide financial  assistance\r\n\r\nto  the employees in certain businesses affected  by\r\n\r\nthe   severance  of  trade  between   Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   The  businesses  that  are  immediately\r\n\r\naffected   are   shipping  between   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, rubber processing, sago, rattan,  coffee,\r\n\r\ncoconut oil and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the appointment of a\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Economic Defence  and  such  Assistant\r\n\r\nDirectors  as may be required. A salient feature  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  that  no employer or  contractor,  as\r\n\r\ndefined in the Bill, may terminate the service of an\r\n\r\nemployee for a period of six months from a  date  to\r\n\r\nbe  determined by the Director. This is important if\r\n\r\nthe very purpose of this Bill is not to be defeated.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  also  seeks to ensure  that  those  whose\r\n\r\nearnings  are  affected  by  partial  employment  as\r\n\r\nagainst  full employment will also receive benefits.\r\n\r\nAn  Economic Defence Fund is to be administered  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the Director. Into this fund employers\r\n\r\nare required to pay in their contributions based  on\r\n\r\none-third  of their monthly total wage bill.  Whilst\r\n\r\nworkers  affected can enjoy the benefits  prescribed\r\n\r\nfor them, certain restrictions on the application of\r\n\r\nthe  scheme are imposed. It is provided that if  any\r\n\r\nemployee  in  receipt  of payments  under  the  Bill\r\n\r\nrefuses,  without  reasonable excuse,  an  offer  of\r\n\r\nemployment  or  an  offer of suitable  training  for\r\n\r\nalternative  employment made by the Director  or  an\r\n\r\noffer  of  full  employment made  by  the  employer,\r\n\r\nfurther  payments  to him may be  stopped.  However,\r\n\r\nwith regard to an offer of employment or of training\r\n\r\nfor alternative employment made by the Director,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  a  right of appeal to an Appeals  Board\r\n\r\nappointed under the provisions of clause 15  of  the\r\n\r\nBill when the decision of the Director may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreviewed. The decision of the Appeals Board on every\r\n\r\nappeal would be final and binding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will appreciate, Sir, that while the rights of\r\n\r\nemployees  to  enjoy benefits have been  laid  down,\r\n\r\ncertain  legal  obligations of  employers  to  their\r\n\r\nemployees  cannot continue during  the  period  that\r\n\r\nemployees enjoy benefits under this Bill. The  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore, provides that the employer, contractor or\r\n\r\nemployee  shall  not be liable to pay  contributions\r\n\r\nunder  the  Central Provident Fund Ordinance  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  that  the employee  is  in  receipt  of\r\n\r\npayments  under the Bill. In addition,  during  such\r\n\r\nperiod,  the  employee  will  not  be  entitled   to\r\n\r\nbenefits in respect of holidays and annual leave  as\r\n\r\nprovided  in the labour laws nor to any  award  made\r\n\r\nunder  the Industrial Relations Ordinance: he  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,   continue   to  enjoy  any   accommodation\r\n\r\nprovided by his employer. Again, provision  is  made\r\n\r\nunder  clause 16 that an employer may terminate  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  an  employee after 6  months  from  the\r\n\r\nrelevant date but in such an event, the employer may\r\n\r\nset  off the total amount paid by him in respect  of\r\n\r\nan  employee against wages payable in lieu of notice\r\n\r\nfor  terminating  the service of  the  employee  and\r\n\r\nagainst  any  other payments or award which  may  be\r\n\r\npayable or ordered to be paid for the termination of\r\n\r\nthe employee's service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I emphasise that this Bill, in concept and\r\n\r\ndesign,  seeks  to  cushion  the  immediate  adverse\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  hardship of the workers  for  which\r\n\r\npositive concrete measures have to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I wish to put forward my views on  the\r\n\r\nBill  before I touch on the detailed clauses. I wish\r\n\r\nto  speak on the background and the spirit  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said that because of the economic\r\n\r\nconfrontation brought about by Malaysia, business in\r\n\r\nSingapore has suffered a lot and the extent  of  the\r\n\r\nloss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  very  great. Not only shipping workers,  rubber,\r\n\r\nrattan, coffee and other trades have suffered, there\r\n\r\nare also many other trades and industries which have\r\n\r\nsuffered   indirectly.  Workers   are   faced   with\r\n\r\nunemployment. At the same time, it will push up  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living  indirectly, so as  to  bring  more\r\n\r\nsuffering  and hardship to the people. We had  urged\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government to persuade  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment to settle our differences with  Indonesia\r\n\r\npeacefully, but the Government did not do so. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  the  Government  put  the  blame  on  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis for the confrontation. If the Party\r\n\r\nin  power did not want to accept our views  and  did\r\n\r\nnot  have the courage to face reality, we cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything.  How  much  can the  Party  in  power,  in\r\n\r\nintroducing this Economic Defence Bill, make up  for\r\n\r\nthe  loss brought about by the confrontation? It  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  palliative; it will not solve  the  problem\r\n\r\nfundamentally. It is amounting to cutting the  flesh\r\n\r\nof  a  person  to  patch a sore.  At  present  those\r\n\r\nhardest  hit  are the broad masses  of  the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  the workers. Normally they  cannot  make\r\n\r\nends  meet. They have to work very hard in order  to\r\n\r\nfeed  themselves and their families.  But  now  that\r\n\r\nthey  have become unemployed or under-employed, they\r\n\r\nhave  to  tighten  their belts and their  burden  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  will  be  heavier.  Therefore,  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  want  to  look  after  those   who   are\r\n\r\naffected, these people should deserve the best care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to give some suggestions on the\r\n\r\nprovisions.  Because  of  the  severance  of   trade\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and  Indonesia,  the  stevedores\r\n\r\n- several  hundreds  of  them - have  become  jobless.\r\n\r\nThese  people are not within the orbit of this Bill.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  the  Government not include the  stevedores\r\n\r\nwithin   the  orbit  of  this  Bill?  We  urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to implement this Bill so as to  benefit\r\n\r\neven the waterfront workers and the stevedores.  The\r\n\r\nso-called  prosperity and development  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  closely  connected  with  the  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nwaterfront  workers and the stevedores. We  can  see\r\n\r\nships   all   lying  idle  in  our  harbours.   Many\r\n\r\nstevedores have become unemployed. But the  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence Board do not help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.  This is very unfair. These people  should  be\r\n\r\nlooked  after  by the Economic Defence  Board  which\r\n\r\nshould  provide  a  safeguard for their  livelihood.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  stoppage of the  raw  rubber  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  our rubber factories have  closed  down.\r\n\r\nAccording to our investigations there are  at  least\r\n\r\n40  rubber  factories  which  have  closed  down  or\r\n\r\npartially closed down. Workers who are unemployed or\r\n\r\nunder-employed  are  numerous. The  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nrubber  factories are not included in the Bill.  But\r\n\r\nin  our view, these workers should also be included.\r\n\r\nBecause  these workers have all along found it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to make a living and the effects  of  the\r\n\r\nconfrontation   have   worsened   their   means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood. The temporary workers are not  only  not\r\n\r\nprotected  under  the law but they  have  also  been\r\n\r\nbarred  from  the  orbit of  the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Defence Board. On the one hand,  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  protected by the law of the Government and,  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, they are employed or under-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present stipulation to exclude these workers\r\n\r\nfrom  the  orbit  of the operation of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  Board  is deplorable. So my  suggestion  is\r\n\r\nthat  this Board should take this into consideration\r\n\r\nand bring these workers into its orbit. According to\r\n\r\nthe  Board's  investigations, there are about  8,000\r\n\r\npeople  affected by the confrontation.  But  in  our\r\n\r\nview,  more than 10,000 people are out of  job.  The\r\n\r\nfigures  given by the Minister are not very correct.\r\n\r\nHe  has minimised them. Up to now, we have not  seen\r\n\r\nany  achievement of the Economic Defence  Board.  We\r\n\r\nonly  read in the newspapers that the Board has been\r\n\r\nlooking  after  this  and  that  factory,  and   yet\r\n\r\nthousands   of   people   are   unemployed,   facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  their  livelihood.  I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not exaggerate the achievements  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Defence Board. We are of  the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  the workers who should be looked after  should\r\n\r\ninclude all those affected directly or indirectly by\r\n\r\nthe   severance  of  trade  between  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  such  as stevedores, waterfront  workers,\r\n\r\nworkers employed in rubber, pepper, copra industries\r\n\r\nand local produce. All these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers should be protected and looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the employer is not allowed\r\n\r\nto sack the workers affected by confrontation within\r\n\r\nsix  months.  This is not a long period.  What  will\r\n\r\nhappen after this six-month period?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the unemployed workers\r\n\r\nshould be given priority in recruitment of jobs.  It\r\n\r\nlooks  all right superficially but, in actual  fact,\r\n\r\nit  will not be effective because so far we can see\r\n\r\nmany  unemployed workers who are still  not  working\r\n\r\ntoday  and many hawkers in the streets of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhy are there so many hawkers? It does not mean that\r\n\r\nthey  do not want to work. If we think carefully  we\r\n\r\nwill  know the various reasons. Some of the  workers\r\n\r\nhave been retrenched or sacked, and some of them are\r\n\r\nunemployed  for other reasons. If these workers  are\r\n\r\nkept  unemployed  for too long a  time,  then  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  will  suffer. What will  happen  to  their\r\n\r\nfamilies after the period of six months? I urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to take positive steps to  persuade  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government to consider the sufferings of the\r\n\r\npeople   and   the   losses   resulting   from   the\r\n\r\nconfrontation. The Government should take  effective\r\n\r\nmeasures to resolve their difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the six-month period will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be decided by the Director of the Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  Board. Now when will this period start?  If\r\n\r\nit  is  to be decided by the Director, he must  give\r\n\r\nearlier   assistance  to  those  workers   who   are\r\n\r\naffected.  We know that trade suspension took  place\r\n\r\nthree  months  ago and the families of such  workers\r\n\r\nhave no savings. If the Government do not take steps\r\n\r\nto  give  them  earlier assistance, then  they  will\r\n\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Apparently the Member is under\r\n\r\nthe impression that the scheme has not been running.\r\n\r\nActually  the scheme has been in operation for  more\r\n\r\nthan one month.

The Director of the\r\n\r\nEconomic Defence Board should take positive steps to\r\n\r\nexpedite assistance to the workers who are affected.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any delay in this payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that if the workers do not\r\n\r\nget  food  and  employment  in  certain  trades  and\r\n\r\nindustries, then the employers must contribute  one-third  of the workers' salaries to the fund. Such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  means  that the employers  will  have  to\r\n\r\nshare  the  burden with the Government, each  paying\r\n\r\none-third to the workers. If an employer is not in a\r\n\r\nposition to pay one-third of the wages of a  worker,\r\n\r\nthen  what right do the Economic Defence Board  have\r\n\r\nto enforce this contribution by the employer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision is that the quantum of the wages\r\n\r\nshould  be decided by the Director. We do not  agree\r\n\r\nwith  this. Why should he decide the quantum of  the\r\n\r\nwages since the workers have their own salary scale?\r\n\r\nWhat  will that mean? Will it mean an increase or  a\r\n\r\ndecrease  in the wages? Will the Government  or  the\r\n\r\nemployers increase their wages? I do not think  that\r\n\r\nis  possible. Or will they decrease the wages of the\r\n\r\nworkers?  If  so, I do not think this is  good.  The\r\n\r\nwages  of the workers should be maintained and  this\r\n\r\nquestion should not be decided by the Director.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision in the Bill is that during this\r\n\r\nperiod,  the  employees  will  not  be  entitled  to\r\n\r\nholidays and annual leave benefits under other laws.\r\n\r\nWe  think this is not proper. The workers have  been\r\n\r\nand  are living from hand to mouth, and yet the Bill\r\n\r\nwants  to deprive them of the benefits provided  for\r\n\r\nin  other  labour  laws. This  will  increase  their\r\n\r\nhardship.  I hope the Government will consider  this\r\n\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision is that the employees can\r\n\r\ncontinue to enjoy accommodation and other facilities\r\n\r\nprovided by the employers and contractors.  This  is\r\n\r\nwell  and  good. We admit that. But I  want  to  ask\r\n\r\nMembers of this House: what will happen to those who\r\n\r\ndo  not  enjoy  accommodation and other  facilities?\r\n\r\nWill the Government consider giving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  living  in  Housing  Board  flats  a  housing\r\n\r\nallowance  or  granting  them  a  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nrentals  or  even  exempting them  from  payment  of\r\n\r\nrentals? We hope they will consider these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally this Bill confers a few benefits on a\r\n\r\ncertain  section of the workers.

The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that when diplomatic relations are\r\n\r\nresumed  between Malaysia and Indonesia,  the  trade\r\n\r\nrelations will not be the same as before.

The  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures given by the Government are only for 1,300.\r\n\r\nIt is not even enough to cover those affected in one\r\n\r\nparticular  trade. The main defect of  the  Bill  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  might only be an eyewash to  show  to  the\r\n\r\npeople that the Government are doing something. But,\r\n\r\nas a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  of fact, in my opinion, taking some pictures\r\n\r\nof  seamen  getting a few dollars from the  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  Board does not help matters very much.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  these three months are not so bad  because\r\n\r\nmany  of the workers still have jewellery to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  pawnshop, a bit of savings, some friends to  go\r\n\r\nto.  But  after the New Year, when all these sources\r\n\r\nhave  dried  up, when there is no more jewellery  to\r\n\r\npawn,  no more friends to turn to, they will face  a\r\n\r\nvery serious crisis. And if the Government can prove\r\n\r\nto  us that it is only 1,300 who have been affected,\r\n\r\nthen I will agree with them that they have done much\r\n\r\nfor  the people. That is why, Mr Speaker, the first\r\n\r\nmatter  which  I wish to bring up is that  the  Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not cover many categories of people. I think if\r\n\r\nwe  check with the coffee importers, there are 3,000\r\n\r\nor  4,000  people  alone  who  are  engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nselection  of coffee beans scattered throughout  the\r\n\r\nwhole island.

The  Government are going to  compel  all\r\n\r\nemployers  to  pay one-third of the wage  bill.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in  my  opinion, it is very  difficult  to\r\n\r\ncompel, for instance, rattan manufacturers, who  are\r\n\r\nonly  doing a cottage industry, to pay one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe  wage  bill; or sago factories, which live  from\r\n\r\nhand to mouth,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto pay one-third of the wage bill. [Interruption]  I\r\n\r\nam  not  an  expert like the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  who was more associated with  the  sago\r\n\r\nindustry. But as far as I know, many of them do  not\r\n\r\nhave much capital and cannot cover one-third of  the\r\n\r\nwage  bill. In the processing of sago, the wage cost\r\n\r\nis  a  very  important part of the cost.  Most  sago\r\n\r\nfactories engage a lot of workmen. So, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in my opinion, every employer should have  the\r\n\r\nright  to discuss with the Government, and  if  they\r\n\r\ncan  prove that they cannot afford to pay their part\r\n\r\nof  the  contribution under the Bill, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  pay  their share and when times are  better,\r\n\r\nthey  can  recover back from them as  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nloan. The Government have $420 million. In the  case\r\n\r\nof  such employers, the Government should not compel\r\n\r\nthem to pay one-third of the wage bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, this Bill is only going to be an eye-wash. So far as I know, not many persons who are affected by the Indonesian boycott have benefited from the economic defence measures set up by Government. I suggest the Government learn from what President Roosevelt did in his New Deal\r\n\r\nmeasures which he introduced to counter the American\r\n\r\ndepression. If some of the measures in the New  Deal\r\n\r\nwere to be re-introduced here, and if the Government\r\n\r\nare more keen and sincere in helping the unemployed,\r\n\r\nI  think  we could expect more from them  than  just\r\n\r\nthis Economic Defence Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> We know the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis will come forward to defend  their\r\n\r\nfriends  in  Indonesia.

I say\r\n\r\nbold  because, by introducing legislation  i.e. the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Defence Bill at this stage, it  has  given\r\n\r\nsufficient  indication  of  the  stand  that  it  is\r\n\r\nprepared to take in the interest of workers, however\r\n\r\nunpalatable  such  steps may  be  to  the  world  of\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that workers affected by this\r\n\r\ntrade  severence are not required to stand in queues\r\n\r\nawaiting  charity and subjected to  means  test  and\r\n\r\nsuch  like methods. I, therefore, feel proud  to  be\r\n\r\nassociated with a Government that has stood  by  its\r\n\r\nword  of protecting the interest of workers  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Economic Defence Bill, there\r\n\r\nare a few points with which workers in Singapore are\r\n\r\ndirectly  concerned. It is on these aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nBill that I wish to touch upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become common knowledge that while certain\r\n\r\nemployers have agreed to subscribe to the intentions\r\n\r\nbehind  the  Economic  Defence  Scheme,  they   have\r\n\r\nsubsequently  had second thoughts and made  attempts\r\n\r\nto  wriggle  out  of  their  obligations  under  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Defence Scheme. I refer specially  to  the\r\n\r\naspect of their contributions of one-third wages  to\r\n\r\na  Fund from which payments are made to workers.  In\r\n\r\nsome  cases I am aware, particularly in the shipping\r\n\r\nfield,  there have been instances of companies  that\r\n\r\neither pleaded exemption from payment on grounds  of\r\n\r\nheavy  financial losses and others who after  making\r\n\r\nthe   first  payment  under  the  Scheme  have   now\r\n\r\nprotracted   subsequent   payments   under   various\r\n\r\npretexts.  I  am  glad to see that  this  particular\r\n\r\naspect  is  adequately provided for in the  Bill  in\r\n\r\nthat  sums due to the Fund may be used and recovered\r\n\r\nas  if it were a debt to the Government. At least by\r\n\r\nthis  process  adequate  safeguards  exist  for  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  of such monies. However, a point  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider is that legal  processes  in\r\n\r\nmaking such recoveries can take a considerable time.\r\n\r\nI  feel  I  should at this stage say that while  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  justice  takes time,  the  human  belly\r\n\r\ncannot take this into account and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawait Court judgment. I hope that Government will in\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  provide for the payment of advances  on\r\n\r\nthe employer's contribution so that workers affected\r\n\r\nthereby are not seriously hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that the Barisan Members will not take this constructive criticism as an anti-national criticism. At the same time, Mr Speaker, I wish to go back to the point I made at the beginning, when you pulled me up. What I was trying to say was that if the confrontation policy were to\r\n\r\nchange  into a military confrontation, then I  would\r\n\r\nbe  the first one to register with the firing  squad\r\n\r\nto  shoot the friends of our enemies of this country\r\n\r\nwho sit opposite these benches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, from the Minister for  Finance's\r\n\r\nspeech, we can see how serious the position is. This\r\n\r\nBill  has now been suggested by the Government,  but\r\n\r\nthey   have  not  pointed  it  out  to  the  workers\r\n\r\naffected.  But  will  this  Bill  be  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nsolution of this problem? What is the real solution?\r\n\r\nThe  real solution is the taking of steps to restore\r\n\r\ntrade  relations.

That  is\r\n\r\nequivalent to one-third of the wages of the  worker,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say,  the  worker  is  only  partially\r\n\r\nemployed. Take, for instance, a worker whose monthly\r\n\r\nincome is $150 -and, we do not know for how long  he\r\n\r\nis  employed. He works only four days  in  a  month.\r\n\r\nWhat about the remaining days that he does not work?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, the Government and the employer\r\n\r\nwill  each have to contribute $40 per month  towards\r\n\r\nthe  Fund.  The result is that the worker will  only\r\n\r\nget  $40 for the whole month, and not $120. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I say there are loopholes in this Bill. And  in\r\n\r\norder  to  plug  the loopholes, the Bill  should  be\r\n\r\nimproved,  and  can  be improved by  changing  \"one-third\"  to  \"two-thirds\", so that the  workers  will\r\n\r\nreally benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there should be provisions to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that if an employer resumes his business\r\n\r\nor  has  invested  his capital in some  other  small\r\n\r\nindustries,  the  workers should  have  priority  of\r\n\r\nemployment,  and not by nomination by the  Director,\r\n\r\nwhich means that only those approved by the Minister\r\n\r\nwill be nominated for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about assistance for the workers, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  make  a provision of  one-third  of  the\r\n\r\nwages  and  the  employer also  pay  one-third.  But\r\n\r\nnormally  when a worker is retrenched, the  employer\r\n\r\npays  him  three months' wages. Here, the assistance\r\n\r\nto be doled out to the workers is only operative for\r\n\r\nsix  months.  So if the employer pays out  severance\r\n\r\npay for retrenching his workers, the workers can  be\r\n\r\nsacked  within  six months. The employer  will  then\r\n\r\nhave to pay one month's wages in lieu of notice.  So\r\n\r\nthis provision in the Bill is no real help at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Bill is meant to look after  those\r\n\r\nworkers  affected by confrontation, as  declared  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  Actually there are many  defects  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Since the Minister for  Finance  is  an\r\n\r\neconomist, he should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  more realistic and practical, and should realise\r\n\r\nthat there are loopholes in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim, Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment figures given by us are described\r\n\r\nas  an  exaggeration  on  our  part.  To  prove  our\r\n\r\nfigures,  I  would  like to give an  instance  of  a\r\n\r\nfactory   which   closed  down  as   a   result   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  It  is at the  10th  m.s.  Sembawang\r\n\r\nRoad.  On  the  closing down  of  the  factory,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were the first batch to receive  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the Board. Over 100 of these workers were  not\r\n\r\nrecognised  as normal workers because some  of  them\r\n\r\nhad  asked  for  medical leave. In  the  end,  these\r\n\r\nworkers  did  not  receive any assistance  from  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  On  what basis was the amount of  assistance\r\n\r\ncalculated?  It  was  based on their  August  wages.\r\n\r\nTheir August wages were the lowest for the whole  of\r\n\r\nthat  year. This was based on business calculations.\r\n\r\nThere  was  the  case  of a female  worker  who  was\r\n\r\ninjured, and did not work for two days. The  monthly\r\n\r\nassistance  amounted  to only  $3.86.  The  employer\r\n\r\nreported  the  case to the Ministry of  Labour.  For\r\n\r\nthat  month,  she  got $5.80 for the  two  days  she\r\n\r\nworked.  So two-thirds of $5.80 amounted  to  $3.86.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of such meagre assistance doled  out\r\n\r\nto  her? Other workers were given from $7 or $10, to\r\n\r\n$20.  This  matter was addressed to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour that the calculation of the assistance  given\r\n\r\nwas  not  correct. But the employer  said  that  the\r\n\r\nfigure was calculated by the Ministry of Labour.  So\r\n\r\nI  hope the Minister will look into this matter  and\r\n\r\nnormalise  the  situation.  This  is  not   just   a\r\n\r\ntriviality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, out of the 500 workers, there were\r\n\r\nabout 100 of them who did not receive any assistance\r\n\r\nat all because they were either temporary workers or\r\n\r\nbecause  they  did  not work in August  for  medical\r\n\r\nreasons. So they did not get a single cent for  that\r\n\r\nmonth for assistance. The calculations should not be\r\n\r\nbased on their August wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that the workers affected by confrontation\r\n\r\nnumber  about 30,000 to 50,000, because the  numbers\r\n\r\nof temporary workers, piece-rate workers, and hourly\r\n\r\nrate workers were not included in the figures. These\r\n\r\nworkers  should,  in fact, be included  in  the  aid\r\n\r\nscheme. The Minister accused us of exaggerating  the\r\n\r\nfigures. Actually he himself has underestimated  the\r\n\r\nfigures.  And there are other workers who  are  also\r\n\r\naffected. For instance, in one week some workers can\r\n\r\nwork  for  only  one  or two  days.  In  the  rubber\r\n\r\nindustry, those who work in the smokehouse can  only\r\n\r\nwork for one or two days or, at the most, three days\r\n\r\nper  week, when the smokehouse is in operation.  Are\r\n\r\nthey  not also affected? How can they say that these\r\n\r\nworkers  are not affected and be excluded  from  the\r\n\r\naid  scheme? According to normal calculations, their\r\n\r\nwages  are low. So the Economic Defence Board should\r\n\r\nprovide  some help for them. Instead the  assistance\r\n\r\nfor them is based on their low wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the unemployment figure stands at 8,200, and that next year it will probably be 18,000. But I say that it should be more. The unemployment figure for the present is higher than that given by the Minister. Can he send someone to investigate into this matter? If he can do that in\r\n\r\nthis particular rubber factory, he can find out  the\r\n\r\nactual  facts.  The Yen Chou Rubber Factory  workers\r\n\r\nare  the  first  batch of workers who received  this\r\n\r\neconomic assistance. This factory is situated at 101\r\n\r\nm.s.   Sembawang  Road.  This  factory  closed  down\r\n\r\nsometime  ago. Rubber factory workers fully  out  of\r\n\r\njob  as  a result of confrontation number 4,000.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Yen  Chou Rubber Factory, only 300 out  of  500\r\n\r\nworkers  received  economic  assistance.  The  other\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially working in the smokehouses  and\r\n\r\nother processing departments, numbering about 1,000,\r\n\r\nare  not  included in the Bill. The Minister  should\r\n\r\npay attention to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, as the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. is a party to this Economic Defence  Bill,\r\n\r\nwe can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassure  the  Members  opposite  that  most  of   the\r\n\r\ncategories  of  workers who  are  affected  by  this\r\n\r\nIndonesian anti-economic confrontation are  covered.\r\n\r\nWe   the  N.T.U.C. are  a  national  body  of   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of workers and we know our jobs. The\r\n\r\nGovernment have consulted us before introducing this\r\n\r\nBill.  There  are difficulties in implementing  this\r\n\r\nrelief.  Take,  for instance, the  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nworking in the rubber mill factories. As long as the\r\n\r\nworkers  are working on a monthly basis,  they  will\r\n\r\nreceive  two-thirds of their salary, one-third  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government and one-third from the employer. But\r\n\r\nthe  difficulty is this. Most of the workers are not\r\n\r\nworking  on  a  monthly pay basis. They  are  casual\r\n\r\nworkers.  In  one day they can be employed  by  five\r\n\r\ncontractors. The workers themselves form a pool  and\r\n\r\nwhenever  the  contractors get a job, they  come  to\r\n\r\nthis  pool and engage them. So for this category  of\r\n\r\nworkers we are devising a means to give them relief.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot be categorised as monthly-paid workers.\r\n\r\nBut  we have to find the root basis of the cause  of\r\n\r\nthis  Indonesian  anti-economic  confrontation.  The\r\n\r\nworkers,  we  agree, are unexpectedly  hit  by  this\r\n\r\neconomic  confrontation. But this  is  no  fault  of\r\n\r\nanybody, except that it is the fault of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and their Indonesian friends --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Why do they  not\r\n\r\ncondemn the Indonesian Government? Confrontation was\r\n\r\nfirst  announced by the Indonesians on  the  pretext\r\n\r\nthat  Malaysia  was  a threat  to  the  security  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia. We have touched on this before.

The Government also  provide\r\n\r\none-third of the wages. This is a sort of relief  to\r\n\r\nhelp them in this transitional period. After the end\r\n\r\nof  the  six  months, the employer can,  of  course,\r\n\r\nretrench the employee. When that time comes, it  can\r\n\r\nbe  a  matter of negotiations. It does not mean that\r\n\r\nthe  employers  will not have to  pay  anything  for\r\n\r\nretrenching the workers concerned. If the problem is\r\n\r\nnot resolved when the factories are closed down, the\r\n\r\nworkers  will  be  affected.  The  Government   have\r\n\r\nintroduced  this Bill to tide over the hardships  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  for  a period of six  months.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, the workers will be able to look for other\r\n\r\nemployment elsewhere. The fact that the workers have\r\n\r\nbeen  unemployed  due  to the closing  down  of  the\r\n\r\nfactories should not induce us to blame the workers.\r\n\r\nThe  blame should not be put on them. If anybody  is\r\n\r\nto  be  blamed, it is the Barisan Sosialis. If  they\r\n\r\nare  really sincere, they should put forward a  plan\r\n\r\nto help the workers. Of course, the operative period\r\n\r\ncan  only  be six months. How can you go  on  giving\r\n\r\ndole  perpetually? If Members of the Opposition  are\r\n\r\nreally  interested in the welfare  of  the  workers,\r\n\r\nthey should support the Government in their measures\r\n\r\nto  solve the problem. They should also support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  industrialisation  plan  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more jobs to the workers. They  should  not\r\n\r\nattack  Government's labour policy and the  measures\r\n\r\nthey  have  taken  without  rhyme  or  reason.   The\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill shows that at  a  time  of\r\n\r\ncrisis,  and  even before confrontation,  Government\r\n\r\nhave  been able to foresee what is going to  happen.\r\n\r\nThe  Government conducted a series of investigations\r\n\r\nand  assessment in July before the Bill was drafted.\r\n\r\nOnly  two  months after confrontation we  have  been\r\n\r\nable   to  produce  this  Bill  to  deal  with   the\r\n\r\nsituation. Hence this Bill before the House today. I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell the people of Singapore that  the\r\n\r\nsituation was brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  by the Barisan. They have inconvenienced  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. If there  is  anybody  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed,  it  is the Barisan Sosialis who  should  be\r\n\r\nblamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I will not follow the P.A.P.  Benches\r\n\r\nin  wanting to attack them. The introduction of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Defence Bill by the Government  may  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  idea  because  it may, to  a  certain  extent,\r\n\r\nalleviate the problems of the unemployed workers  as\r\n\r\na  result of confrontation. It is no use to put  the\r\n\r\nblame on anybody. Both sides have seen the result of\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  We  also agree to  certain  measures\r\n\r\nrecommended in this Bill. Stevedores and water-front\r\n\r\nworkers  are  the  sinews  of  Singapore's  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.  Yet  many of them are not included  in  this\r\n\r\nscheme  of  assistance. Once trade between Singapore\r\n\r\nand Indonesia stops, the livelihood of these workers\r\n\r\nis   affected.  The  burden  of  maintaining   their\r\n\r\nfamilies has not increased. If these workers are not\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  Bill,  their  hardship  will   be\r\n\r\ngreater.  I would also suggest to the Minister  that\r\n\r\nthese  workers  should also be included  within  the\r\n\r\nambit of the provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. What happens after\r\n\r\nconfrontation?  The  Minister  has  said  that   the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are directly affected by confrontation\r\n\r\nare  those  in  industries like rubber,  copra,  and\r\n\r\nrattan.  The  stevedores are  also  affected.  Other\r\n\r\nworkers who are indirectly affected are those in the\r\n\r\nindustries of shoe-making, fishery, etc. As a result\r\n\r\nof confrontation, there is a severance of trade. The\r\n\r\nmarkets for our local products are now closed.  Many\r\n\r\nworkers  are now unemployed as a result of  this.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister for Finance will look  into  the\r\n\r\nplight  of these workers who are indirectly affected\r\n\r\nby confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the one-third of the wages to be\r\n\r\ncontributed  by the employer and the period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths in which contributions will be made. Although\r\n\r\nthere is such a provision here, there may be certain\r\n\r\nemployers  who  may  see  some  loopholes  in   this\r\n\r\nprovision.  In  spite of the amount of  their  stock\r\n\r\navailable in their storehouses at the moment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- the  stock  may  last for one  month  for  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers  - many  employers extend  the  work  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  They give, say, one or two days' work  each\r\n\r\nweek  in  order to spread the work over a period  of\r\n\r\nsix months, so that they could take advantage of the\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill relating to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on this point I feel that since the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  is in charge of this Economic  Defence\r\n\r\nDepartment,  it is more convenient for him  to  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter, and not let certain employers take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the loopholes in the Bill.  I  advance\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion out of sincerity  and  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can carry it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am elated to hear the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  expressing his support for  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  is  introduced in order to  resolve  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  resulting  from  Indonesia's  economic\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  Are  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nreally  interested in the interests and  welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe workers or the people of Singapore? No, they are\r\n\r\nnot  interested at all. They have tried to amend the\r\n\r\nmotion  of  thanks  of  the Prime  Minister  to  the\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  by asking that  negotiations  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia be carried out. They oppose Malaysia,  and\r\n\r\nthe  least they can do is to try to help bring about\r\n\r\npeace  and prosperity to Singapore even if  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  bring about peace and  prosperity  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Instead  they talk  about  prosperity  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East   Asia.  [Interruption]   You   are   not\r\n\r\nconcerned with Singapore.

But are they able to help us  resolve  the\r\n\r\nproblem? When Singapore boats were detained  by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian authorities, did the Barisan Members  try\r\n\r\nto  persuade the Indonesian authorities  to  release\r\n\r\nthem,  and to persuade them to release the  property\r\n\r\nseized  by  them? And when they hear  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nsabotage  here in Singapore, none of them has  dared\r\n\r\nto touch on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I wish the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  will come back to the discussion  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Defence Bill and not stray away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is because they in their  speeches\r\n\r\nasked us to begin negotiations with Indonesia.

Instead  all\r\n\r\nalong  they have been supporting Indonesia.

There  was  reference\r\n\r\nfrom  the Members for Choa Chu Kang, Paya Lebar  and\r\n\r\nThomson, about the loopholes of the Bill. They  said\r\n\r\nthat  employers can give, let us say, two  or  three\r\n\r\ndays'  employment a month and then keep the  workers\r\n\r\nwithout work for the rest of the month. And this can\r\n\r\ngo  on  for  the whole of six months, and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey  avoid having to go into the scheme. Well,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, may I refer them to clause 5 (2) .  Let\r\n\r\nme read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if the Director is satisfied, from information\r\n\r\nreceived  from an employer, contractor or any  other\r\n\r\nsource,  that  for the reason set out in  subsection\r\n\r\n(1)    of  this  section  [i.e. confrontation],  any\r\n\r\nemployer  or  contractor is unable to  provide  full\r\n\r\nemployment  or  is  able  to  provide  only  partial\r\n\r\nemployment  to  any of his employees,  the  director\r\n\r\nmay,  after  making such inquiries as  he  may  deem\r\n\r\nnecessary,  determine  the  date  from   which   the\r\n\r\nemployer  or  contractor is unable to  provide  full\r\n\r\nemployment  or  is  able  to  provide  only  partial\r\n\r\nemployment  ..... and  shall advise  the  employer  or\r\n\r\ncontractor  in writing of the relevant date  and  of\r\n\r\nhis obligations under this Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Clause  2 of the Bill defines \"full employment\"  and\r\n\r\n\"partial employment\". The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"partial employment\" is, I  think,  of\r\n\r\nsignificance. The operative words are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`..... the employee's total wages per month are less\r\n\r\nthan the wages received by him from his employer  or\r\n\r\ncontractor  immediately prior to the adverse  effect\r\n\r\non the business of the employer or contractor.....'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  it is not possible for employers to escape their\r\n\r\nobligations  by giving two or three days'  work  per\r\n\r\nmonth, if that happens, then the workers  will  get\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three days' full pay for the  days  he  has\r\n\r\nworked,  and  for the days he does no work  he  goes\r\n\r\nunder this scheme, that is to say, one-third pay  to\r\n\r\nhe paid by the employer and one-third pay to be paid\r\n\r\nby  the Government. I hope this is made clear and is\r\n\r\nunderstood all round. If the employers try to  evade\r\n\r\ntheir   responsibility   and   avoid   their   legal\r\n\r\nobligation in this way, then, of course,  they  have\r\n\r\ncommitted an offence under this Bill and are liable\r\n\r\nto  substantial  penalties. So  I  think  that  will\r\n\r\nanswer  the doubts raised by the Opposition on  this\r\n\r\ncoverage  of  the  Bill  and  the  possibilities  of\r\n\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has referred to a\r\n\r\nparticular company in Sembawang Road.

They\r\n\r\nnow have 381 workers on the scheme. As far as we are\r\n\r\ninformed,  all  the permanent labour force  of  this\r\n\r\nfactory  are under the scheme. They have been  under\r\n\r\nthe scheme for some time actually. He said that some\r\n\r\nworkers arc offered only two days' pay as the  basis\r\n\r\nof  this  two-thirds  contribution.  There  are  few\r\n\r\nworkers attached to this factory who regard work  at\r\n\r\nthis  factory as casual work. Normally they  do  not\r\n\r\nwork  there.

It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to include stevedores in this  scheme  for\r\n\r\ntwo   reasons.  One  is,  there  are  no  stevedores\r\n\r\nspecifically   engaged  in  loading  and   unloading\r\n\r\nIndonesian  cargo. They unload all types  of  cargo.\r\n\r\nThe  loss of Indonesian cargo means that there is  a\r\n\r\npartial  loss of income to them, not a  total  loss.\r\n\r\nThat is one reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that in the case of such\r\n\r\npeople like stevedores, fishermen, and even crews on\r\n\r\nthese   twakows,   there  is  no   employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship. Who are the employers of a crew of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfishing boat? They all work together on a collective\r\n\r\nbasis  and a profit sharing basis, and obviously  it\r\n\r\nis not possible to get a chief fisherman or the head\r\n\r\nof  the crew and ask him to pay one-third the normal\r\n\r\nincomes of the other members of the crew, because he\r\n\r\nis  equally poor. So for these people, we are trying\r\n\r\nto  solve  their difficulties in some other  way.  A\r\n\r\ntypical problem is for these people in wooden boats.\r\n\r\nYou  see  quite  a  number of them  laid  off  along\r\n\r\nShenton  Way. There may be about 40 boats and  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  about 300 or 400 people involved  in  this.\r\n\r\nThey  used to carry timber from the Rhio Archipelago\r\n\r\n- firewood,  timber,  raw sago, attap  roofing,  that\r\n\r\nsort  of  thing.  We are trying to  arrange  to  get\r\n\r\nalternative sources of timber and firewood for them.\r\n\r\nThese  alternative supplies are from the West  Coast\r\n\r\nand the East Coast of Malaya. We are in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the persons engaged in the firewood trade  and\r\n\r\nif  it is technically possible, the Government  will\r\n\r\nbe  quite prepared to advance loans to them to start\r\n\r\nindustries  on the west coast of Malaya  to  produce\r\n\r\nfirewood from the bakau timber which abounds there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that if the employer\r\n\r\ncannot  pay, then what happens? The Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  also says if the employer cannot pay, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  pay.  Under  this  law,  if  the\r\n\r\nemployer  cannot  pay,  then  his  assets  will   be\r\n\r\nliquidated and the worker will have a prior claim on\r\n\r\nwhatever is left of his assets on liquidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both the Member for Tampines and the Member\r\n\r\nfor Choa Chu Kang are worried about the authority of\r\n\r\nthe  Director  to  determine  the  normal  wages  of\r\n\r\npersons included in this scheme. They think that  he\r\n\r\nmay try to reduce it or to increase it. They are not\r\n\r\nhappy. I am not quite sure on what grounds they  are\r\n\r\nnot  happy about it. The reason is a simple one.  In\r\n\r\nmost  instances, the pay for August can be  accepted\r\n\r\nas  a  reasonable standard. It was a  fairly  active\r\n\r\nmonth  for persons engaged in these industries.  But\r\n\r\nyou may have the odd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase  where a person is sick for a part of the month\r\n\r\nor  he  may  have  gone  on leave.  So  under  those\r\n\r\nconditions then, the Director will probably take the\r\n\r\nprevious  month. Anyway he has the right under  this\r\n\r\nlaw  to  vary the basis of calculation in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure  that a just assessment of the average  wages\r\n\r\nis  arrived  at.  Obviously, without  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nprovision,  then either you stick to  a  very  rigid\r\n\r\nformula  and  get unfair results because  of  a  few\r\n\r\npeople  being  sick or being off  work  during  that\r\n\r\nmonth,  or you may get results which will  in  other\r\n\r\nways be equally unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the number of unemployed, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n10,000,  says the Member for Tampines; 20,000,  says\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Choa Chu Kang;  30,000,  says  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim. May I say, obviously  this  is\r\n\r\nabsolute rubbish? If they want me to believe  it  is\r\n\r\n10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000, let me have a list - name\r\n\r\nof  firm and number of workers. Then we can add. If\r\n\r\nit  comes to 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000, then  it  is\r\n\r\nacceptable. But these wild statements made either to\r\n\r\ndenigrate  the  Government  or  to  demoralise   the\r\n\r\npopulation or to encourage the Indonesians,  are  of\r\n\r\nno  use at all.

Members will  accept  that  monetary\r\n\r\nassistance  and loans to workers laid off  will  not\r\n\r\nsolve  for  all time the difficulties that  will  he\r\n\r\ncaused in the employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfield; nor can the engagement or reengagement of the\r\n\r\nworkers affected be left to the play of free  market\r\n\r\nforces. It is therefore necessary to provide for the\r\n\r\ndirection  of  employment in order  effectively  and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  to  reabsorb such  workers  in  other\r\n\r\nindustries. The purpose of this Bill is therefore to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the direction of employment for persons\r\n\r\nadversely affected by the trade boycott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direction of employment is not a normal instrument\r\n\r\nof  policy, but then these are not normal times and,\r\n\r\nwithout some form of direction, the chances are,  if\r\n\r\nconfrontation  is  prolonged,  many  of  the   8,000\r\n\r\nworkers who will eventually be laid off, will remain\r\n\r\nunemployed  for  a very long time  after  they  have\r\n\r\ndrawn  all  the payments under the Economic  Defence\r\n\r\nScheme. I must stress, Sir, that the Bill seeks only\r\n\r\nselective  direction, that the dangers of misuse  of\r\n\r\nauthority have been recognised, and that accordingly\r\n\r\ncertain safeguards have been provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 gives powers to the Minister to make an\r\n\r\norder  to  be published in the Gazette requiring  an\r\n\r\nemployer  who  is subject to such an  order  not  to\r\n\r\nengage  or  re-engage  any  employee  outside  those\r\n\r\nregistered  with  the  Economic Defence  Department,\r\n\r\nwithout   the  written  consent  of  the   Director.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Minister may, before making  such  an\r\n\r\norder,   refer  a  draft  thereof  to  a   Committee\r\n\r\nappointed by him for its advice. In this manner, the\r\n\r\nopinions   of   representatives  of  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees will be taken into consideration before an\r\n\r\norder  is  made.  I intend to avail  myself  of  the\r\n\r\nadvice  and  guidance which trade union leaders  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  leaders are in a position to offer.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid in my Budget Speech, this operation can succeed\r\n\r\nonly  on  the basis of sensible co-operation between\r\n\r\nthe Government, the workers and management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, however, does not compel any employer to\r\n\r\naccept an employee nominated by the Director. He has\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  refuse to employ such person  if  he\r\n\r\nfinds him unacceptable, and he may, with the consent\r\n\r\nof  the  Director, employ any other  person  of  his\r\n\r\nchoice. Another safeguard is that the employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  have recourse to an Appeals Board appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister if the Director refuses  to  give  his\r\n\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that any award made under the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Industrial Relations  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960, in relation to the engagement or re-engagement\r\n\r\nof  employees by employers, both of whom are subject\r\n\r\nto  an  order  made under clause  4,  will  have  no\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final word on Government's policy with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  recommendation of workers on  the  laid-off\r\n\r\nlist to prospective employers. There are two aspects\r\n\r\nto  this policy. The first is to ensure, by suitable\r\n\r\ngrading  of  workers, that those who are recommended\r\n\r\nfor  employment  will have the requisite  skills  to\r\n\r\nperform  the work. The second is to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  these  workers  will  not  prejudice\r\n\r\nindustrial   peace   in  the  establishment   or   a\r\n\r\nprospective employer. To ensure this then,  laid-off\r\n\r\nworkers  who are known to have close connections  or\r\n\r\nto  have  held offices in pro-Communist unions  will\r\n\r\nnot be recommended for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

From the speech\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Minister for Finance, however, we  can\r\n\r\nsee  very clearly that he has brought political bias\r\n\r\ninto  the  field of economic assistance for laid-off\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  Minister for Finance  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement made in this House told this House that he\r\n\r\nwould  give  careful  and  deliberate  consideration\r\n\r\nbefore he exercises his powers under the law.  These\r\n\r\nsoothing  talks and beautiful promises made  by  him\r\n\r\nnot very long ago have now been completely negatived\r\n\r\nby what the Minister has said just now. From this we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that the passing of this Bill will provide\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance and  the  Director  with\r\n\r\nextensive and absolute powers. They can make use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  authority  to  monopolise  the  direction  of\r\n\r\nemployment  for  their political ends.  Workers  who\r\n\r\nhave   not  been  supporting  the  P.A.P. will   he\r\n\r\nprejudiced  against. These words  came  out  of  the\r\n\r\nhorse's own mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the P.A.P. Government are launching\r\n\r\nfull-out  on their mean, low and suppressive  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  is  despicable.  From the  Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  we  thought that he  would  be  behaving\r\n\r\nwell,  but  in  actual fact,  he  has  now  made  us\r\n\r\nunderstand that the P.A.P. are trying to make use of\r\n\r\ntheir  political  power to further  their  political\r\n\r\nends of suppression and monopoly; otherwise how  can\r\n\r\nthey  explain  that the Bill provides  for  them  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate   all  the  powers  and  management   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to direction of employment into the  hands\r\n\r\nof  one person, the Minister for Finance? Is it  not\r\n\r\nvery  dangerous to put all the powers into the hands\r\n\r\nof one person!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to you, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nvarious  improper stipulations in the Bill,  because\r\n\r\nunder this Bill the employer has lost his power  and\r\n\r\ndiscretion  in  the engagement of workers.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect  the  Minister  has  entirely  deprived  the\r\n\r\nemployer of his power. Perhaps they will turn  round\r\n\r\nand   accuse  us  of  speaking  on  behalf  of   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  But  I will say that  in  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s smear, our stand on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabour  and capital relationship is very  clear.  We\r\n\r\nonly  oppose  all  those  suppressive  actions   and\r\n\r\ninjustices  meted  out to the  workers.  As  to  the\r\n\r\nfundamental and legitimate rights of the  employers,\r\n\r\nwe  will respect these rights. But according to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Bill,  the  discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer in regard to his power of engaging workers,\r\n\r\nis  entirely in the hands of the Minister.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, the Bill has enabled the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nto monopolise the power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also stipulates that an Appeals Board\r\n\r\nwill  be established in case the employers concerned\r\n\r\nare  met with a refusal from the Director. They  can\r\n\r\nappeal  against his direction. But I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out that this Appeals Board will be appointed\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Finance himself. Moreover,  the\r\n\r\ndecision  given  by  the  Appeals  Board   may   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be binding and the Minister need not  he\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  it. So what is the use of this  Board?\r\n\r\nThe power given by the Bill to the Minister may very\r\n\r\nlikely  be  used  by  him to further  his  political\r\n\r\nsuppression and persecution, because he may  direct\r\n\r\nany  employer not to employ any worker. But I should\r\n\r\nsay that the Bill should not enable the Minister  to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the legitimate relationship  between\r\n\r\nthe  employer and labour. So from this  we  can  see\r\n\r\nthat   the   P.A.P.   Government  are   resorting   to\r\n\r\nlegislation  to further carry out their  suppression\r\n\r\nand persecution of the workers and to exploit them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that the Bill also provides that\r\n\r\nthe  employer should get the consent of the Director\r\n\r\nin  engaging any laid-off worker, and when he is not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the Director's refusal he can  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the Appeals Board which, after all, is appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister himself. So, how can you say  that\r\n\r\nthis will give the people the impression of fairness\r\n\r\nor  justice  that can be expected from  the  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard?  The  Minister has said that only workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C. will be given the advantage,  whereas\r\n\r\nother  workers who are not in the N.T.U.C. will  be\r\n\r\nexcluded  from all the benefits. Now, in  this  way,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. will be able to recruit more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  into  their camp and,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nintimidate and coerce non-P.A.P. workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we are facing a political crisis\r\n\r\ninitiated  by the P.A.P.; they are trying to  resort\r\n\r\nto legislation to ride over the heads of the workers\r\n\r\nto  further their own political ends. If ours  is  a\r\n\r\ndemocracy, I hope the P.A.P. Government in  drafting\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will pay full attention to the provision\r\n\r\nof  safeguards in the interests and welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, and not try to resort to suppression of non-P.A.P. workers who do not support the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nagree  with the Minister for Finance that the powers\r\n\r\nprovided  in this Bill should not be used to  direct\r\n\r\nthose S.A.T.U. activists to any employment. They are\r\n\r\nthe  persons  who cause hardship and misery  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  by  bringing  about  confrontation  through\r\n\r\ntheir  constant agitation. In fact, they  should  be\r\n\r\npunished  and  I  propose  to  punish  them  by  not\r\n\r\noffering  them  any  facilities of  the  State.  Why\r\n\r\nshould we offer them these facilities? They are  the\r\n\r\nculprits.  They  should be punished and  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  is in full co-operation with the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  in  preparing a  black  list  of  these\r\n\r\nactivists.  Once  the names of these  activists  are\r\n\r\nentered  into this list, I can assure you that  they\r\n\r\nwill have no chance of finding employment elsewhere,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  Jurong  pioneering  industries.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all the workers in these unions will be\r\n\r\naffected.  Only the trouble-makers will be affected,\r\n\r\nand  in  order to give them a chance to  make  their\r\n\r\nliving, I recommend them to become hawkers or  taxi-drivers. But not all will be given hawkers' licences\r\n\r\nor  taxi-drivers' licences. They will be  given  the\r\n\r\nposts of assistant hawkers or assistant taxi-drivers\r\n\r\nwhereby  they can wash the bowls and plates  of  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  or wash the cars of the taxi-drivers.  They\r\n\r\nmay  even  be made to be assistant gaol birds  where\r\n\r\nonly  second-class treatment will  be  provided  for\r\n\r\nthem  in  Changi Gaol. I do not see why the  State's\r\n\r\nfacilities  should be offered to these culprits  and\r\n\r\ntrouble-makers whose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmain purpose in life is to cause misery and hardship\r\n\r\nto the innocent workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance and the Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  very happy when they talk about  their\r\n\r\nintention  to fix those who, they say,  have  harmed\r\n\r\nthe interests of the workers. To those who are power\r\n\r\ncrazy,  one can be sure that these people will  make\r\n\r\nuse  of the privileges of this House and abuse them.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  surprising that people of  this  nature\r\n\r\nshould  make  such utterances. In fact,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for them to make such utterances to  annoy\r\n\r\nthe  Members opposite, because we in the  Opposition\r\n\r\nknow what they are up to. We are, in fact, very glad\r\n\r\nto  have  listened to what they have  said,  because\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are going further and further  into  the\r\n\r\nposition  in  which they want to abuse their  powers\r\n\r\nand  privileges, they are, in fact, one step  nearer\r\n\r\nto  death.  So we must give them our blessings,  for\r\n\r\nthey  are one step nearer to death. But we  want  to\r\n\r\nbless them with the hope that they should not end in\r\n\r\nthe  way that Ngo Dinh Diem has ended. We hope  that\r\n\r\nthe fate of Ngo Dinh Diem will not befall them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can talk about their powers and privileges,\r\n\r\nbut  I  wish to point out one matter in relation  to\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  which gives wide powers to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance. As he has already said in his  speech,\r\n\r\nhe  is  quite prepared to abuse his powers  to  deal\r\n\r\nblows to those so-called Communists. That is his own\r\n\r\nadmission. So he is quite prepared to try to draw  a\r\n\r\ndistinction  between non-P.A.P. workers  and  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nworkers.  As  a  result  of this  distinction,  some\r\n\r\ninnocent  workers will, under these  powers,  suffer\r\n\r\nsome  suppression  and misery. In  fact,  they  will\r\n\r\nsuffer discrimination. Of course, the Ministers  can\r\n\r\ndo  whatever they like according to their whims and\r\n\r\nfancies, but I want to give them a friendly piece of\r\n\r\nadvice.  If  they want to persist in what  they  do,\r\n\r\nthey  are  just digging their own grave.

This, Mr Speaker, to me is\r\n\r\nthe  best way to achieve industrial peace. Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  S.A.T.U. controlled  unions  are  pro-Communist and these people are anti-State as well as\r\n\r\npro-confrontationists. These Communist  leaders  and\r\n\r\ntheir  stalwarts in the S.A.T.U. unions can consider\r\n\r\nthemselves very lucky to be able to enjoy this  two-thirds  salary  benefit, as listed  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister. Mr Speaker, if I had my way, I would  not\r\n\r\nlet them have the two-thirds salary.

This is\r\n\r\nonly the first step. Now let us not forget that this\r\n\r\nis not the final step. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam  tempted,  just  now, to give  a  review  of  the\r\n\r\nhistory of the fight between the traitors in the pro-Communist camp and the P.A.P., but I think you  will\r\n\r\nprobably rule me out of order. All I want to say  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  had  two  decisive engagements  with  them\r\n\r\n- September 1962, and again September 1963. They have\r\n\r\nlost  the battle and now they are going to  pay  the\r\n\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I once\r\n\r\nagain make it clear that we are not going to inflict\r\n\r\nany  punishment  on the workers, as  a  group?  That\r\n\r\nwould  be  quite  wrong. We  know  there  are  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of industrial workers - Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers especially - who are  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. unions. The general body  of  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be given every protection and will be able  to\r\n\r\nenjoy all the privileges under this Bill as well  as\r\n\r\nunder  other  Bills. But in the course of  our  long\r\n\r\nstruggle with the treacherous anti-national elements\r\n\r\nof  the pro-Communist camp in the trade union field,\r\n\r\nthe  cultural field, the educational field  and  the\r\n\r\npolitical  field,  we have identified  a  number  of\r\n\r\nactivists who knowingly - not unconsciously  - support\r\n\r\ntheir cause in the full knowledge that it is a  pro-Communist   anti-national  line.  Well,  they   must\r\n\r\nsuffer.  And I make no apologies at all  that  steps\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  to deal with them. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  says  that by so doing we  bring  ourselves\r\n\r\nnearer  to death. I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  he\r\n\r\nmeans \"nearer to political death\" and not \"nearer to\r\n\r\nphysical  death\" like Mr Ngo Dinh Diem. Because  if\r\n\r\nit  was  the latter interpretation, then, or course,\r\n\r\nhe  is  threatening  an honourable  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, and, quite apart from being out  of  order\r\n\r\nunder the Standing Orders of this Assembly, he would\r\n\r\nmerit  more  severe penalties than just being  ruled\r\n\r\nout of order. Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not Ngo\r\n\r\nDinh Diems, we are not dictators. Why are they here?\r\n\r\nBeing  paid  $500  to criticise the  Government  and\r\n\r\npropagate  their  pernicious and  treacherous  anti-national  views?  Neo Dinh Diem, Mr  Speaker,  Sir?\r\n\r\nUnder  Ngo Dinh Diem they would be whisked off  when\r\n\r\nthey come out of the Assembly into a car, brought to\r\n\r\nChangi  Gaol, at six o'clock tomorrow morning  lined\r\n\r\nup against the wall, and executed. Instead of which,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in a few days' time  just  before\r\n\r\nChristmas  they will certainly be getting $500  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  funds  so that they  can  have  a  Merry\r\n\r\nChristmas.  Now, he says that what we are  going  to\r\n\r\ndo,  our  policy, is to punish the workers who  are\r\n\r\nnon-P.A.P. and to reward the workers who  are  pro-P.A.P.  Now  that is not the distinction,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\ndistinction is between a small group - a small group,\r\n\r\nSir  - of pro-Communist cadres and activists, and the\r\n\r\ngeneral  run of workers.

But  when\r\n\r\nthe  property tax was imposed in 1961, no  provision\r\n\r\nwas made for a refund of tax on unoccupied buildings\r\n\r\nas  the  tax  was  on ownership of  property  as  an\r\n\r\nadditional  source  of general revenue.  Unlike  the\r\n\r\nformer  rates,  it  covered  the  cost  of  services\r\n\r\nprovided by the local authorities. There was also at\r\n\r\nthat  time an acute shortage of housing and  it  was\r\n\r\nintended  to discourage house owners from exploiting\r\n\r\nthe  situation by holding the houses in  vacancy  in\r\n\r\nthe hope of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollecting   higher  rentals  later.  Due   to   the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  efforts of the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard and due to extensive private development,  the\r\n\r\nhousing shortage has eased considerably since  then.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is now possible to allow a house owner,  who\r\n\r\nhas made a genuine effort to let out his house at  a\r\n\r\nfair  rental  but has failed to do so,  to  claim  a\r\n\r\nrefund  of  tax  for any period his house  has  been\r\n\r\nvacant  for  30  days or more continuously.  On  9th\r\n\r\nNovember  last  year I announced that this  decision\r\n\r\nwould  be made effective from the 1st January, 1963.\r\n\r\nThis  was  repeated in my Budget  Statement  of  7th\r\n\r\nJune,  1963.  The object of clause 2 of the  present\r\n\r\nBill is to give effect to that decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present aggrieved property owners may lodge\r\n\r\nobjections  against  valuations with  the  Valuation\r\n\r\nReview  Board. Over the last two years the  majority\r\n\r\nof  objections were minor ones which could have been\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily   settled  by  the   Inland   Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment. The Bill provides in clause 3  for  such\r\n\r\nobjections  to  be  lodged  first  with  the   Chief\r\n\r\nAssessor, while reserving to the property owner  the\r\n\r\nultimate  right  of appeal to the  Valuation  Review\r\n\r\nBoard  against  the Chief Assessor's decision.  This\r\n\r\nwill  make  for  more expeditious decisions  without\r\n\r\njeopardising the right of appeal to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill will also confer on the Chief\r\n\r\nAssessor  the  right to appeal  to  the  High  Court\r\n\r\nagainst  any decision of the Valuation Review  Board\r\n\r\non  any question of law or fact and law.

Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is quite straightforward,\r\n\r\nnamely,  to tighten the provisions of the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  order  to provide  a  more  effective\r\n\r\nmeasure  of control. It has been found in the  light\r\n\r\nof  some  years'  experience  in  administering  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance  that the provisions  have  not\r\n\r\nproved  adequate  in dealing with societies  already\r\n\r\nregistered   or   applying  for  registration.   For\r\n\r\nexample, there is a large number of societies  which\r\n\r\nwere  registered many years ago but whose rules have\r\n\r\nbeen  found  to be defective or inadequate  for  the\r\n\r\nproper running of the society, with the result  that\r\n\r\nsome  of these societies have been either improperly\r\n\r\nrun  or used for purposes other than those fur which\r\n\r\nthey  were originally registered. Under the  present\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance, there is no  power  for\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  to require a society to  change  its\r\n\r\nrules   once  it  has  been  registered  under   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  accordingly clause 4  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\namends  section 17 of the Ordinance  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  require, where circumstances  warrant\r\n\r\nit, any registered society to amend its rules. Where\r\n\r\na  society  has been requested by the  Registrar  to\r\n\r\namend  its  rules and has failed, without reasonable\r\n\r\ncause,  to do so within three months of the request,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister may, where he thinks fit,  order  that\r\n\r\nsuch  society should be dissolved. This is the  only\r\n\r\nchange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposed  to  the provisions of section  17  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provisions, the Ministry already\r\n\r\nhas  powers to order the dissolution of any  society\r\n\r\nwhich  is  being used for unlawful purposes,  or  is\r\n\r\nbeing  used for purposes incompatible with the peace\r\n\r\nor  good  order of the State or with the objects  or\r\n\r\nrules  of  the society. It has also been found  that\r\n\r\nmany  societies are being mismanaged by persons  who\r\n\r\nare  not  fit  to  be office-bearers.  For  example,\r\n\r\npersons  who  while being members of a society  have\r\n\r\nbeen convicted for an offence involving the unlawful\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the funds of a society or  have  been\r\n\r\nconvicted for a criminal offence. Clause  3  of  the\r\n\r\nBill is designed to exclude such persons from acting\r\n\r\nas  office-bearers of any society in cases where the\r\n\r\ncircumstances warrant such exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also amends the Ordinance to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  no registered society shall  use  any\r\n\r\nsymbol  without  the  consent  in  writing  of   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  or an Assistant Registrar.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  that  a  number of societies and associations\r\n\r\nhave  adopted symbols which hear resemblance to  one\r\n\r\nanother  and which have in the past led to no  small\r\n\r\nmeasure of confusion. It is considered desirable  to\r\n\r\nrectify the situation by providing the Registrar  or\r\n\r\nAssistant  Registrar with powers to  ensure  that  a\r\n\r\nsymbol adopted by a registered society is such  that\r\n\r\nits  identity is not likely to be confused with that\r\n\r\nof   another  society  or  association.  When  these\r\n\r\namended provisions become law, the Government  will,\r\n\r\nof   course,  allow  a  sufficient  period  for  all\r\n\r\nregistered  societies  with  symbols  to  apply  for\r\n\r\napproval of their symbols, and will only take action\r\n\r\nagainst  societies which have not complied with  the\r\n\r\namended  provisions  after all registered  societies\r\n\r\nhave been given an adequate opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provisions of section 20 of the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance,  where  a  society  has   been\r\n\r\ndissolved  by the Minister under section 17  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the Official Assignee in  Bankruptcy  or\r\n\r\nany  other officer appointed for the purpose  shall,\r\n\r\nafter satisfying and providing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  all the debts and liabilities of a society  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost of winding up, divide the surplus  assets,\r\n\r\nif any, amongst the members of the society according\r\n\r\nto  their rules; and in cases where such division of\r\n\r\nthe surplus assets is not practicable, according  to\r\n\r\na  scheme  which has to be prepared by the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee or other officer appointed for the  purpose\r\n\r\nand submitted to a Supreme Court Judge for approval.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  found, however, that  the  provisions\r\n\r\nrelating to the preparation of a scheme for division\r\n\r\nof  surplus assets and the submission to  a  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt Judge for approval have, quite apart from  the\r\n\r\ncumbersome   procedure  involved,  not  worked   out\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily   in  practice.   It   is   proposed,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  in  cases where  the  division  of\r\n\r\nsurplus  assets  of  a  dissolved  society  is   not\r\n\r\npracticable  - for  example, in the  case  where  the\r\n\r\nassets  concerned are too unsubstantial  to  warrant\r\n\r\nthe  work  involved  in  distribution  - such  assets\r\n\r\nshould,  where the Minister considers it  desirable,\r\n\r\nbe paid into the Consolidated Fund of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amending subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection  9 of the Ordinance to increase the  penalty\r\n\r\nfrom  $25  to $200 hardly needs any comment.  It  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear that the penalty of $25 which was fixed\r\n\r\nmany years ago is inadequate to serve as a deterrent\r\n\r\nand  it  is  considered desirable to  increase  this\r\n\r\npenalty to the more appropriate sum of $200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nare now debating the Societies (Amendment) Bill. The\r\n\r\ndebate  on  this Bill is similar in  nature  to  the\r\n\r\ndebate  that  we had on the Trade Unions (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  This  Bill gravely infringes  the  rights  of\r\n\r\ncertain organisations. We pointed out yesterday that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  utilising its majority  strength  in\r\n\r\nthis  House and abusing its majority seats  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to amend all the Ordinances. These amendments\r\n\r\nwill  enable  them to deal with certain individuals,\r\n\r\norganisations,  political Parties or  certain  trade\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the clauses in this Bill, we find\r\n\r\nthat these amendments are of a serious nature. These\r\n\r\namendments  in the Societies Ordinance  can  control\r\n\r\nand  influence  all registered societies.  They  can\r\n\r\nalso control any political Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the political system in Singapore is based on the so-called democratic parliamentary system. Political Parties play a very important role in a democratic system. They are part and parcel of the democratic system. After this Societies (Amendment) Bill has been\r\n\r\npassed,  it will be possible for the P.A.P. to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  any  political Party if they  feel  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular   political  Party  will   endanger   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us study closely the clauses in this Bill.\r\n\r\nLet  us  examine them. In clause 3, new section  9B,\r\n\r\nsubsection (1)  provides that two types of people are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to hold office in any organisation  or\r\n\r\npolitical  Party. The first category is as  provided\r\n\r\nunder  (a) .  That  is,  any  person  who  has  \"been\r\n\r\nconvicted  for  an  offence involving  the  unlawful\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the funds of a society; or (b)  he has\r\n\r\nbeen  declared,  in writing, by the Minister  to  be\r\n\r\nunfit to be an officer of a society by reason of any\r\n\r\nconviction   for  a  criminal  offence  other   than\r\n\r\nspecified  in  paragraph  (a)   of  this  subsection,\r\n\r\nunless the written permission of the Minister so  to\r\n\r\nact  is  first obtained.\" These two small paragraphs\r\n\r\ninfringe human rights. These two small sections will\r\n\r\nstigmatise a person if he has committed any offence.\r\n\r\nThey  will  prohibit him from holding any office  in\r\n\r\nany   societies  forever.  He  will  be  stigmatised\r\n\r\nforever. He will be branded as one who has committed\r\n\r\nan  offence. Such provisions are very objectionable.\r\n\r\nThey  are unreasonable. I do not know why the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  to  make such legislation after they  came  to\r\n\r\npower.  They  have helped criminals  who  have  been\r\n\r\nconvicted  in the past by releasing them  from  gaol\r\n\r\nand  finding  jobs  for them. But  why  should  they\r\n\r\npunish a person for his past misdeeds by prohibiting\r\n\r\nhim from holding office in the society? The offences\r\n\r\nmay not be the same. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  he committed under different circumstances  and\r\n\r\nat different times. For example, if a person commits\r\n\r\na  certain offence during a strike; for example,  he\r\n\r\nprevents  the car of his employer from  leaving  the\r\n\r\nfactory,  he  will  commit the  offence  of  traffic\r\n\r\nobstruction.  If he is convicted by  the  Court,  he\r\n\r\nwill  be penalised. He will be deprived of the right\r\n\r\nto  hold  office  in any society  or  any  political\r\n\r\nParty.  Under  a pro-Labour government  this  person\r\n\r\nwill  be declared innocent. But under a pro-employer\r\n\r\ngovernment, this person will be convicted for having\r\n\r\nobstructed  his  employer.  Therefore,  he  will  he\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  his  opportunity  and  right  to  hold\r\n\r\noffice. This is very wrong. If the P.A.P. find  that\r\n\r\ncertain  officials  in a political  Party  are  very\r\n\r\ncapable  and  they are a threat to the P.A.P.,  then\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. can conveniently dub them as  criminals\r\n\r\nand  thus deprive them of their right to work  in  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party. This is another instance  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. want to interfere with the internal\r\n\r\naffairs  of a political Party or society.  The  Bill\r\n\r\ngives  too much power to the Minister to enable  him\r\n\r\nto  interfere  with  those societies  and  political\r\n\r\nParties  which one day may come to power.  It  gives\r\n\r\nthe  Minister power to stop another political  Party\r\n\r\nfrom  being  returned  to  power  by  depriving  the\r\n\r\nofficers  of that political Party of their right  to\r\n\r\nhold  office. The P.A.P. also intend to get  rid  of\r\n\r\nthose union officials who do not support them. It is\r\n\r\neasy to convict such officials of any offence if the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. do not like them on some excuse or pretext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second page of this Bill clause 3 - new\r\n\r\nsection 9C reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No registered society shall use any symbol\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent in writing of the Registrar  or\r\n\r\nan Assistant Registrar.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is,  a  society cannot make use of any  symbol\r\n\r\nwithout the consent of the Registrar. This provision\r\n\r\nis  also unreasonable. For example, if there  is  an\r\n\r\nelection pending and a certain group of people  form\r\n\r\nthemselves into a political Parts in order  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in the election, they must have a Party symbol\r\n\r\nto enable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people to know what party they belong  to.  But\r\n\r\nthe Registrar can abuse his power by withholding his\r\n\r\nconsent  to  prevent  the people  from  knowing  the\r\n\r\nsymbol  of  this political Party. This will  greatly\r\n\r\naffect  the chances of this political Party  in  the\r\n\r\nelection. If the electors do not know the symbol  of\r\n\r\na political Party, how are they going to elect their\r\n\r\ncandidates? This is a serious interference with  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of a political Party. At the  same  time\r\n\r\n- new section 9c (3)  - clause 3 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In any case where a registered society uses a\r\n\r\nsymbol   in  contravention  of  the  provisions   of\r\n\r\nsubsection (1)  of this section- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the president, secretary and all members of\r\n\r\nthe  committee  of such society,  or  if  such\r\n\r\noffices  do  not  exist, all  persons  holding\r\n\r\npositions in such society analogous  to  those\r\n\r\nof  president, secretary and members  of  such\r\n\r\ncommittee; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) all persons managing or assisting in the\r\n\r\nmanagement of such society,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence and shall\r\n\r\nbe  liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars or to imprisonment for a term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  one  year  or  to  both  such  fine   and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extreme penalty. It is unreasonable to\r\n\r\npenalise  all  the office-bearers of a society  that\r\n\r\ncontravenes  this  particular  provision.  This   is\r\n\r\nsomething like the method used by Hitler or  General\r\n\r\nTempler  who  detained a whole  village  because  of\r\n\r\ndisturbances caused by one or two persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, every provision in this Bill\r\n\r\nencroaches  on the basic human rights of the  people \r\n\r\nand the principle of the rule of law.  On  the  second \r\n\r\npage, clause 4 - new subsection  (1)  of section 17 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever it appears to the Minister that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any registered society is being used for\r\n\r\nunlawful purposes; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any registered society is being used for\r\n\r\npurposes incompatible with the peace  or  good\r\n\r\norder  of the State of Singapore, or with  the\r\n\r\nobjects or, rules of the society as entered in\r\n\r\nthe Register of Societies;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>the  Minister may order that such society  shall  be\r\n\r\ndissolved.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What we want to know is what is an unlawful society?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlawful  purposes? The P.A.P. can turn  bad  things\r\n\r\ninto  good things and vice versa. They can  construe\r\n\r\nbad things as good and vice versa. After the passage\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  they can deal with  any  society  or\r\n\r\npolitical Party by alleging that they are illegal or\r\n\r\nunlawful.  The  word \"unlawful\" is  very  vague  and\r\n\r\nequivocal.  The  Minister  can  make  use  of   this\r\n\r\nequivocal term to brand a certain political Party as\r\n\r\nbeing  unlawful or indulging in unlawful activities.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  the words \"peace or good order\" - what  is\r\n\r\n\"peace\",  what  is \"good order\"? They can  interpret\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  own ways. These  are  abstract\r\n\r\nterms.   Different   people   can   have   different\r\n\r\ninterpretations of the words \"peace and good order\".\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  dangerous  to  put  in  such   a\r\n\r\nprovision.  And  then on page 3 of the  Bill  -  new\r\n\r\nsection 17 (1)  (c)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever it appears to the Minister that-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the rules of any registered society are or\r\n\r\nhave  been  inadequate  for  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nproviding   for  its  proper  management   and\r\n\r\ncontrol and such registered society has failed\r\n\r\nwithout  reasonable cause to amend  its  rules\r\n\r\nwithin  three  months of,  and  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith,  a  request from the Registrar to  amend\r\n\r\nits rules for such purpose,\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>the  Minister may order that such society  shall  be\r\n\r\ndissolved.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The P.A.P. have not adhered to the law whenever they\r\n\r\ndo  anything.  The inclusion of such a provision  in\r\n\r\nthe Bill is very dangerous. I would like to make  an\r\n\r\nanalogy to show how this Bill can infringe upon  the\r\n\r\nrights of a society. If such a Bill is to be passed,\r\n\r\nyou  can  say, \"Your nose should be removed  to  the\r\n\r\nback  of  your head.\" Now if that person refuses  to\r\n\r\nobey,  then  the  Minister will take action  against\r\n\r\nhim.  It would be something like that. If this  kind\r\n\r\nof  Bill  is  passed,  then  in  future  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinister can also order a man to put on a cheongsam.\r\n\r\nIf   the  constitutional  rules  of  a  society  are\r\n\r\ninadequate, then the members concerned can amend  or\r\n\r\nchange them provided they do not go beyond the  law.\r\n\r\nThen  why should there be such a provision  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder them to do so? Mr Speaker, numerous laws have\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced and passed by the P.A.P. for  their\r\n\r\nown  benefit, but the consequences will be very  bad\r\n\r\nand parliamentary democracy may in the end become  a\r\n\r\nlaughing  stock  and  perhaps there  may  emerge  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  Fascist political system.  This  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility. This can be brought about by their  way\r\n\r\nof legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhenever the P.A.P. Government introduces a Bill, it\r\n\r\nis  branded as dictatorial, anti-people and Fascist.\r\n\r\nHow can they say so? If there are laws which provide\r\n\r\ncertain  powers,  of course, the  Minister  can  use\r\n\r\nthose  powers. How can you say that the Minister  is\r\n\r\nabusing the powers provided by the law? If there are\r\n\r\nlaws,  you  cannot say that the action  taken  under\r\n\r\nsuch laws is an abuse of power. What can the Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers   do?  They  can  only  level   terms   like\r\n\r\n\"Fascist\",  \"abusing  power\",  etc.  This  Bill,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  gives power to the Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to control societies, to safeguard  their\r\n\r\nmembers  arid to take action against those societies\r\n\r\nand  office-bearers involved in unlawful  acts.  And\r\n\r\nyet  the Barisan brand this Bill as a Fascist  Bill.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Bill it is provided that only when  office-bearers of a society commit unlawful acts, will they\r\n\r\nbe  dealt  with  by  the law. All those  law-abiding\r\n\r\noffice-bearers and members have nothing to fear.  If\r\n\r\nany  member  of  a  society carries  out  subversive\r\n\r\nactivities detrimental to the security of the State,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  abetting  Indonesia in her  confrontation,\r\n\r\nthen   such   activities  are  unlawful.   Any   one\r\n\r\ncollaborating  with  Indonesia  at   a   time   when\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is suppressing and persecuting Malaysians\r\n\r\nand  seizing Malaysian properties is deemed to  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  an  illegal and unlawful act  under  this\r\n\r\nBill.  Of  course, it is the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  enforce laws  to  ensure  that  such\r\n\r\nactivities  can be curbed in order to safeguard  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate rights and interests and welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Assemblymen have been using terms like\r\n\r\n\"Fascist\", \"dictatorial\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  attack is futile because our laws provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the majority,  and  not  for  the\r\n\r\nminority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of\r\n\r\nthis  Societies (Amendment) Bill is to regulate  and\r\n\r\nsuppress   societies  in  Singapore  and   political\r\n\r\nParties. The speech of the Member who sat down  just\r\n\r\nnow  gave us a clear indication of the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe Government. Whoever is against the Government is\r\n\r\ncommitting  an  unlawful  act,  and  therefore   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Societies (Amendment)  Bill  must\r\n\r\nbe applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this Bill is unnecessary. It is undemocratic. First of all, the new section 9c enables the Government to regulate symbols of all societies and political Parties. In the case of non-political societies, symbols are not so important. But in the case of political Parties,\r\n\r\na  symbol  is very important because during  polling\r\n\r\nthe  voter  only  votes  for  the  symbol.  We  have\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the  Government  asking  that  party\r\n\r\nsymbols  be  changed.  So  section  9c  enables  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to refuse party symbols which  have  been\r\n\r\nknown  for some time. There is no proviso to assure\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties that symbols which have  been  in\r\n\r\nuse  will  automatically be approved, and any  party\r\n\r\nhas  to accept the decision of the Registrar and the\r\n\r\nMinister,  without any opportunity of  appealing  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court. Under this new section, if the  Minister\r\n\r\nsays that this party must change its symbol, it  has\r\n\r\nno  right of appeal to anybody; the decision of  the\r\n\r\nMinister shall be final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another undemocratic aspect of the Bill is that\r\n\r\nthe  Government may ask any society  to  change  its\r\n\r\nrules  that have already been approved by them.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we  know that when rules are submitted  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  approval, the  Government  normally\r\n\r\ntake  some time to consider them, and in almost  all\r\n\r\ncases   questions  are  asked  on  the   rules   and\r\n\r\namendments suggested. And now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have a new clause enabling Government to  repeal\r\n\r\nor  amend  rules that have already been approved  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Let  us suppose the constitution  of  a\r\n\r\nparty  or a society has been approved by Government.\r\n\r\nNow  the  Government want power to amend  or  repeal\r\n\r\nthose rules,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this power is very undemocratic.\r\n\r\nThe  Government already have enormous powers to take \r\n\r\naction against societies that come under section  17 \r\n\r\nof  the  Societies  Ordinance.  Clause  4,  amending \r\n\r\nsection 17, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whenever it appears to the Minister that -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any registered society is being used for unlawful purposes; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any registered society is being used for purposes incompatible with the peace or good order of the State of Singapore, or with the objects or rules of the society as entered in the Register of Societies; or'.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, this clause gives the Government almost\r\n\r\nfull  dictatorial powers to close down any  society.\r\n\r\nAnd the Government in addition want not only to have\r\n\r\npowers  to close down a society, but also to manage,\r\n\r\nregulate  and control a society by a new  provision,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the new clause amending section 17 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third undemocratic feature of this Bill is\r\n\r\nclause  5  which enables the Minister to expropriate\r\n\r\nthe  funds of members once he closes down a society.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, the funds of a society belong  to  its\r\n\r\nmembers,  and  even if the Government close  down  a\r\n\r\nsociety they have no right to expropriate the funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this Bill is most undemocratic, and that it, together with the next few Bills to be brought up - one of which is the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Amendment) Bill - is meant, in my opinion, to strangle the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to say a few words on this Bill. I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Opposition why they are scared\r\n\r\nof  this amendment Bill. If the Bill is passed, they\r\n\r\nwill not be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanipulate  societies for their own political  ends.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the practice of the Communists to manipulate\r\n\r\nthe societies for their nefarious designs. Likewise,\r\n\r\nthe Communists carry out their struggle by using the\r\n\r\nsocieties as their tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to them that as long as they\r\n\r\ncarry  out such designs detrimental to the interests\r\n\r\nof   the   people,   then  they  will   suffer   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their actions. So in this House they\r\n\r\nshould  not  pretend to believe that  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  If  we are undemocratic,  surely  the\r\n\r\nopposition Members would not be here in this  House.\r\n\r\nThis  is  unlike the democracy that is obtaining  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in respect of this Bill,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the difference between the Government's  stand\r\n\r\nand  the  Opposition's stand is  this.  We,  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  have  the  right  to  look  after   the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  rights of societies and  their  members.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Opposition Members here are asking  us  to\r\n\r\ngive  latitude to those unlawful members and office-bearers  of  societies to carry out  their  unlawful\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here is the distinction. The Members opposite\r\n\r\nhave asked us: what does \"unlawful\" mean? I will try\r\n\r\nto  enlighten  them as to what the  term  \"unlawful\"\r\n\r\nmeans.  This is a very glaring example. If a society\r\n\r\nis   used   to   carry  out  treacherous  activities\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to the security of the State,  then  we\r\n\r\nsay  that such actions are unlawful. Another example\r\n\r\nof  an  unlawful act is this: the funds of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  without the approval of its members are being\r\n\r\ndoled  out  after  a meeting of  only  some  of  the\r\n\r\nexecutive  members  to  fellow  travellers.  Another\r\n\r\nexample  is  when  the society  is  being  used  for\r\n\r\npurposes  other than in the interests or in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith the rules of the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore there are a great many varieties of\r\n\r\nsocieties, some with aims and objectives  which  are\r\n\r\nnot in actual fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirected  at  the  interests  and  welfare  of   the\r\n\r\nmembers, but for the purpose of making money.  So  I\r\n\r\ndo  not understand why the Barisan Assembly Members,\r\n\r\non  whatever  piece  of  legislation  we  introduce,\r\n\r\nshould  always support unlawful actions  and  always\r\n\r\nspeak  on behalf of such actions. They say  that  we\r\n\r\nhave denied the societies the right to appeal to the\r\n\r\nCourt,  because  the Minister's  decision  is  final\r\n\r\naccording to the Bill. But when there are provisions\r\n\r\nfor  them to appeal to the Court, they will say that\r\n\r\nthe  Court  may  not be a good means  to  meet  this\r\n\r\nsituation. They are very eloquent in their  specious\r\n\r\narguments.  They are trying to obstruct the  passage\r\n\r\nof  whatever  legislation we want to introduce  into\r\n\r\nthis House.

For the Member to accuse us of abusing  our\r\n\r\npower, I think, is a bit of distortion. In fact,  it\r\n\r\nis  people like the Member for Thomson who have been\r\n\r\nabusing the power.

In fact, most  of  the\r\n\r\nO.B.A.s in Singapore have become the political wings\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  During  the  referendum\r\n\r\ncampaign  the O.B.A.s played a prominent part.  They\r\n\r\ncanvassed  among the people against the  Government.\r\n\r\nEven  at  the  last  election the O.B.A.s  came  out\r\n\r\nactively to campaign on behalf of the Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> They do not support the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The O.B.A. is not a political\r\n\r\norganisation.

The  first  amendment\r\n\r\nprovides for the appointment of a Deputy Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Utilities Board  who  is  empowered  to\r\n\r\nexercise the powers of Chairman when the Chairman is\r\n\r\nunable  to  act  or the office of  the  Chairman  is\r\n\r\nvacant.  The  Deputy Chairman will also  preside  at\r\n\r\nmeetings  during  the absence of  the  Chairman.  At\r\n\r\npresent there is provision in the Ordinance only for\r\n\r\na member to be appointed temporary Chairman whenever\r\n\r\nthe Chairman is unable by illness or otherwise to be\r\n\r\npresent,  and this process has to be repeated  every\r\n\r\ntime  the  Chairman is similarly incapacitated.  The\r\n\r\nBill also seeks to amend the Ordinance so as to make\r\n\r\nit  clear  that  only  the  members  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board, its employees and  persons  acting\r\n\r\nunder  the  Board's  direction who  are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nsubject  personally to any action, liability,  claim\r\n\r\nor  demand  whatsoever for any matter or thing  done\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of executing the provisions of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance and that the Board itself is not protected\r\n\r\nfrom any such actions, liabilities, claim or demand.\r\n\r\nAt  present it is possible that section 20 as worded\r\n\r\nmay  be  construed  as extending protection  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  itself  from any liability.

The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  the delay in the completion  of  the  1962\r\n\r\nrevision  of the registers of electors. This revision\r\n\r\nwas  completed  only in June 1963,  and  consequently\r\n\r\nwork  on  the  1963 revision could not  be  commenced\r\n\r\nearly in the year as usual. The second reason for the\r\n\r\ndelay  was  the  holding of the general  election  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1963. The staff who would ordinarily  have\r\n\r\nbeen  engaged  in the revision of the registers  were\r\n\r\nemployed in the preparations for and conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe clauses in this amending Bill are meant to extend\r\n\r\nthe  time for the revision of the electoral registers\r\n\r\nto  April 1964 or to a day appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the Elections Ordinance, the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters should be completed by 15th of September of\r\n\r\nthat  year. Therefore, the revision of the  Registers\r\n\r\nof  Electors should be completed this year.  Why  has\r\n\r\nthere been such a delay? Why has the revision of  the\r\n\r\nregisters not been completed in time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister gave two reasons\r\n\r\nfor the delay. One of the reasons was the election in\r\n\r\nSeptember. If you remember correctly, the ex-Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs has said that the revision  of  the\r\n\r\nregisters  for 1963 commenced in June this  year.  At\r\n\r\nthe same time, he also said that work had started  in\r\n\r\nMarch  this year. The period from March up to now  is\r\n\r\nnine  months. So there were nine months in  which  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the revision of the Registers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Electors.  The Government should have  completed\r\n\r\nthe  revision  of these Registers of  Electors  long\r\n\r\nago. The Registers of Electors were exhibited during\r\n\r\nthe snap elections held recently. Lists A and B were\r\n\r\nexhibited  to  the  public. Those whose  names  were\r\n\r\nstruck  off  from  the registers of  electors  could\r\n\r\napply for the restoration of their names within  two\r\n\r\nweeks.  The registers of electors should  have  been\r\n\r\ncompleted long ago. The work of this revision should\r\n\r\nnot entail any difficulty. In fact, we have a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney and we have enough staff. Since the Government\r\n\r\nhave spent a lot of money and effort on the training\r\n\r\nof  youth  leadership, why did  the  Government  not\r\n\r\nprovide  new  staff and funds for the completion  of\r\n\r\nthe  revision  of the electoral registers?  We  have\r\n\r\nseen  that the revision of these electoral registers\r\n\r\nhas  been  postponed  from  time  to  time.  If  you\r\n\r\nremember correctly, there was a similar amendment in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  There  were similar provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nextension of the revision of the electoral registers\r\n\r\nfor  1962  from 30th September, 1962, to 30th  June,\r\n\r\n1963.  I  would not like to touch on the reason  for\r\n\r\nthe  delay. In extending the time for the completion\r\n\r\nof this work, the P.A.P. intended to exclude certain\r\n\r\nqualified  electors from the registers of  electors.\r\n\r\nThat  is,  those who had attained the age of  21  in\r\n\r\nJuly  1963  were  excluded  from  the  registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors. At that time, the P.A.P. intended to  hold\r\n\r\nthe  general  election in 1964. If the revision  was\r\n\r\ncompleted in June, then those who could vote in  the\r\n\r\nelections  will be those whose names appear  in  the\r\n\r\nregisters  of electors for 1962. Thus 50,000  people\r\n\r\nwho  had  the  right to vote in 1962 will  not  have\r\n\r\ntheir  names included in the Registers of  Electors.\r\n\r\nIn  doing so, the P.A.P. did not give the people who\r\n\r\ndid  not support the P.A.P. a chance to vote in  the\r\n\r\nelections. The Registers of Electors for  1963  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  extended again to  1964.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are playing another game in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nrevision of the Registers of Electors. They  want  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period  of time to enable  them  to  include\r\n\r\nthose people who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  no  right to vote in the general elections.  In\r\n\r\nthe  recent  elections, we heard  that  many  people\r\n\r\ncould  not  find  their names in the  registers.  By\r\n\r\nmanipulating  the  registers,  the  P.A.P. hope  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate their regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another secret which they dare not reveal to the\r\n\r\npublic is this. From the speeches of the P.A.P.,  we\r\n\r\nhave  some  hint that the Member for Moulmein  would\r\n\r\nresign her seat to enable her husband to contest  in\r\n\r\na  by-election, so that he could be elected  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament, if he was elected. But in  order\r\n\r\nto be a candidate, Mr Devan Nair must have his name\r\n\r\nentered in the registers. If the registers had  been\r\n\r\ncompleted in September this year, then the  name  of\r\n\r\nMr  Devan  Nair  would not have appeared  in  them.\r\n\r\nThus,  he  would  not have been able  to  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  next  year. But if the P.A.P. extend  the\r\n\r\ntime of revision to next year say, April or June, or\r\n\r\neven  later, it will facilitate Mr Devan Nair,  who\r\n\r\nhas no qualifications, to stand for election - coming\r\n\r\nin by the back door. If this is so, then they should\r\n\r\nbe ashamed of what they want to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to remind the House that the one-man-one-vote system should be carried out in a fair, impartial and democratic manner. If it is just for the sake of the P.A.P.'s interests, if they can revise the electoral registers according to their whims and fancies, or to extend the time of\r\n\r\nrevision   of   the  registers,  then  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy will have no meaning, and is turned into a\r\n\r\ndictatorship. The one-man-one-vote system  has  been\r\n\r\nabused by the P.A.P., that is to say, they make  use\r\n\r\nof  this  system, through the powers  of  the  State\r\n\r\nmachinery  and propaganda machinery,  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nunreasonable elections. The P.A.P. have been talking\r\n\r\nof  democracy all the time, and so we hope that they\r\n\r\ndo not undermine or destroy democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of\r\n\r\nsection  15  of  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance is to ensure a clean, fair and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonest  election  within the  democratic  framework.\r\n\r\nThis  section  compels the Government  to  have  the\r\n\r\nregister  ready by the 15th of September each  year,\r\n\r\nor,  at  the  latest, the 31st of December  of  that\r\n\r\nparticular year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are having this perennial affair\r\n\r\nappearing  so often of the Government's  attempt  to\r\n\r\ncircumvent section 15 of the Elections Ordinance, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  electoral register of each  year  can  be\r\n\r\ndelayed  for a maximum period of 12 months. If  this\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  (No. 2) Bill is passed, the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  have  the 1963 register ready not  by  15th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember. 1963, but by the 31st of December, 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the amendment Bill enables the\r\n\r\nGovernment to complete the register in whatever  way\r\n\r\nthey  like.

Next year we shall  have  to \r\n\r\npostpone  again and we will postpone every  year.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest   in  that  case,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be bold, come forward and  delete\r\n\r\nsection 15 (1)  of the Elections Ordinance, in  which\r\n\r\ncase  the  Government will have the full liberty  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  electoral register  at  any  time  it\r\n\r\nchooses.  They can have the 1963 register  completed\r\n\r\nby 1965, 1966 or 1967.

The  second \r\n\r\nreason given by the Government  is  not very \r\n\r\nconvincing either,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause   although  the  elections  were   held   in\r\n\r\nSeptember, the Government have completed  its  first\r\n\r\npart of the revision - they have asked for claims and\r\n\r\nobjections  and  returns to be made and  these  have\r\n\r\nbeen done. As far as I know, it will only take a few\r\n\r\nmore months to complete. If the Government is really\r\n\r\nshort  of  staff in the Printing Office  or  in  the\r\n\r\nElections  Office - which I doubt very much  - it  can\r\n\r\nask  for  an  extension of one or  two  months  till\r\n\r\nFebruary  or March, but they should not ask  for  an\r\n\r\nextension until the 31st of December, 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many people give many reasons for the Government's postponement each year. Some people say the Government can juggle with electoral registers by putting in names of people who do not stay in the particular constituencies. Some people say the Government want to postpone certain by-elections,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  by-election  in  Moulmein.   Many\r\n\r\nreasons  are  given, but I do not know  the  genuine\r\n\r\nintentions of the Government in having this type  of\r\n\r\nTemporary Provisions Bill brought up every  year  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I have to\r\n\r\nemphasise that the staff in the Elections Department\r\n\r\nhave  a backlog of work this year. They had not only\r\n\r\nto  revise the registers for 1962, but, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they had to do a similar job for 1963.  Under\r\n\r\nnormal  circumstances,  they  would  probably   have\r\n\r\ncompleted their task. But, as I have stated earlier,\r\n\r\non   account  of  the  general  elections  held   in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  the crucial month of the year,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  staff,  who would normally be engaged  on  this\r\n\r\nwork,   were  turned  towards  running  the  general\r\n\r\nelection itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention that we should\r\n\r\ndeliberately   defer  or  delay  revision   of   the\r\n\r\nregisters. Human capacity is limited and, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to consider this when taking into  account\r\n\r\nwhen  the  revision would be completed. In fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim quoted just now, there was a\r\n\r\nspecific clause which provides for any undue  delays\r\n\r\nthat might occur in revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was talking about Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair  -  I  think  Mrs Devan Nair was  quite  frank\r\n\r\nduring  the general elections about her standing  in\r\n\r\nMoulmein  in  place of her husband.  It  was  not  a\r\n\r\nsecret  at  all. It was publicly stated  that  at  a\r\n\r\nsuitable date in the future, she would give  way  to\r\n\r\nher  husband and when that happens there  would,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be a by-election in Moulmein. There  is  no\r\n\r\nsecret  about that. That fact was made known  during\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections. It is obvious that  if  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair's name is not on the electoral register,\r\n\r\nno  by-election will be held in Moulmein. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why the Member for Jurong is making great play\r\n\r\nover  that,  as  if it were a secret which  we  were\r\n\r\nhiding away from people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Jurong that the system\r\n\r\nof  one-man-one-vote must, as far  as  possible,  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  It  is because we have  maintained  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system of one-man-one-vote, that  is  why\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis lost in the Referendum and  in\r\n\r\nthe general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we give the opportunity to the people\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  to  express  their  support  for   a\r\n\r\ncandidate  or  for  a political Party  by  a  secret\r\n\r\nballot,  I do not believe that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwill ever win at all. From outward appearances, when\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis regimented several hundreds  of\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupporters to attend mass meetings in their campaign\r\n\r\nduring the general elections, one would have thought\r\n\r\nthat they were going to win the general elections. I\r\n\r\nthink   the   people  of  Singapore  now   are   too\r\n\r\nsophisticated   to   be  taken   in   by   such   an\r\n\r\nadvertisement.   Neither  did  their   attempts   at\r\n\r\nbringing in hundreds of their supporters to  certain\r\n\r\nconstituencies  during  the  general  elections   to\r\n\r\ncanvass for their candidates help them at all.  Such\r\n\r\nintimidation will not work as long as the electorate\r\n\r\ncan express their will in secret by the ballot box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just dismiss the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim's  insinuation  that we are  fiddling  with  the\r\n\r\nregisters  so that we can include names  of  people,\r\n\r\nwho  do  not  exist,  in certain constituencies.  He\r\n\r\nshould  have thought better before he uttered  these\r\n\r\nremarks.  There are always petitions  which  can  be\r\n\r\nmade  and  it will be very foolish for a government,\r\n\r\nor,  for that matter, anybody to try to fiddle  with\r\n\r\nthe electoral registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
