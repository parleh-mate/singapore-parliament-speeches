But I think they could have originated from outside Singapore, because I happened to read the New Straits Times of 21st February, 1980, published in Kuala Lumpur, in which it was reported that similar rumours were spread in Johore, both in Batu Pahat and Kota Tinggi. With your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I read the relevant parts of the New Straits Times?

The Deputy OCCI, Encik Jamil Hassan, said Police would take court action against anyone found spreading such rumours. He said there was no truth in the rumours and appealed to the public not to be influenced by them. Encik Jamil said this following a panic among the public, especially here [that is, Johore Bahru] in Batu Pahat and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Kota Tinggi about the head-hunting stories.

In fact, I mentioned that the four awards we have given are for training workers in maintenance and refurbishing of aircraft, communication, electrical and electronic instruments; maintenance of industrial machinery; making of wood and metal patterns. These are all in mechanised industries.

Regrettably, however, they are necessary to reduce congestion on the roads. Although various other measures including possibly import quotas could be considered, pricing is perhaps the most appropriate measure in Singapore's free-economy system. Pricing has proven to be effective in 1975 and 1976 when the car population dropped nearly 5% in 1976 and a further 1% in 1977 following tax increases. The recent measures are minimal considering that real incomes have risen over the years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Feasibility studies)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture whether feasibility studies on all aspects of the proposed Mass Rapid Transit system have been completed and when a decision can be made; what is the total cost of the feasibility studies; how much it will cost to implement the system, and what will be the stages of implementation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, Phases I and II of the engineering and economic feasibility study of the proposed Mass Rapid Transit have been completed. The total cost of these two phases of study was $4.5 million. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third phase of the Mass Transit Study, the primary task of which is to establish the preliminary engineering design criteria of the MRT and to obtain a more accurate cost estimate, is scheduled to be completed in June this year. It will cost about $3.9 million. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I am unable to say exactly when a decision can be taken to build the MRT. It is a complex and expensive project; it will probably run into $4 billion at current prices. Therefore, all aspects including revenue projections and development potential will have to be studied in detail to determine its viability. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can assure the hon. Member that we will take a decision as soon as we are confident of the accuracy of our projections on construction costs, operating costs, and returns on higher property leases over new underground stations, and operating revenue. A Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority is now in the process of being set up to carry out further preliminary works related to MRT. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a firm decision is taken, we will proceed with the detailed engineering design, following which tenders will be called. Once construction begins, it is estimated that the system can be built within 12 years in 11 stages, with the first stage ready for operation within five years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, it seems the public is concerned about the cost of building the MRT.

But because of the nature of the system and the scale of investments involved, it is vital that we have to satisfy ourselves that the route is carefully determined and laid to ensure maximum returns from the system, and that the money is well spent. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in so far as the MRT is concerned, it is meant to serve the people. Therefore, the Government should not always think of getting a dividend from any kind of project.

Member in his argument because public funds are involved. No doubt it will cost more if we delay our decision. But we have to make sure that public funds are not wasted in an unnecessary or foolish way. So we have to study it very carefully before we commit ourselves to such expenditure. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, Phases 1, 11 and Ill of the feasibility studies have entailed public \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> expenditure to the tune of $8.4 million. Would the Hon. Minister for Communications assure this House that not much more will have to be spent with the setting up of the Mass Rapid Transit Authority - he is moving the Bill at a later stage - and that these feasibility studies on all aspects of the system, be it the detailed planning or engineering designs, will not incur extra expenditure before a decision can be made? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The expenditure incurred so far of $8.4 million by the end of the Phase Ill study is a small amount compared to the total investment that we are going to put in the project. Though I do share the anxieties of the Member, we hope that we need not have to spend too much money on the study before a decision can be made. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, there are MRTs in some other parts of the world. Did the Ministry look into those systems as well? If they did, maybe we could have saved a lot of money, bearing in mind that these studies have taken several years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to be exact, the study was officially made about eight years ago on the MRT system. But this is not unusual, as most cities in the world take about the same length of time, or even longer, to decide on the MRT. Hong Kong took 10 years to decide. It is true that there are many cities in the world that have the MRT system operating, and we could learn from them. We are studying the various systems in these cities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being in the tropics, Singapore's climatic conditions are very different from those in the advanced countries in the temperate zone. So different types of problems are involved in the construction of the system that we have in mind. Therefore, we have to study very closely. In this respect we are following very closely the experience that Hong Kong has in their MRT system. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, if $8.4 million is a small percentage of the total investment, according to the Hon.

The chances of shelving the project are as good as any chance. But, as I have mentioned previously, it appears that it would be unavoidable that we will have to have a system of this nature. The question is one of timing and how careful and wisely we spend this public fund. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in his opinion is this MRT a justified project, assuming that the Government can afford to build it? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, it is not a question of whether or not we can afford it. The construction of an MRT, as I have mentioned earlier, even if we can afford and decided to proceed, it has to be carefully phased in with our economic and physical development. Assuming that our economic growth is not going to be as rapid as what we have experienced in the past and the international economic situation is not as rosy as it has been in the past or, worse still, if it is on the decline, then there is no reason why we should proceed with the MRT. It is a question of the travel demand, whether it justifies the provision of such a system. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if it is a question of travel demand, then the success of the Hong Kong MRT system will be greater than that of Singapore because the volume of our commuters in the public transport system is far less than that in Hong Kong, in which case we should not go ahead with the MRT. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, different countries have different expectations from the people. And with growing affluence today we are having different types of problems. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The travel demand is a function of economic activity and the acceptability of the level of mobility in the City depends very much on the expectations of the people. Hong Kong is perhaps a unique situation. It has a high density of housing, with very high economic activity going on. It is a bustling city. We may not reach the same density as that experienced in Hong Kong. Many cities in the world which have lesser intensity of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> economic activity than ours already have MRT systems.

\n  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is now a free market place and it lends itself open to adventurists and entrepreneurs who will invest in the gullibility of a segment of our population. For example, in the past years, we had the Gemini Chit Fund, pyramid selling and sanatronic clinics. Members of the House will recollect that in May 1977 I brought their attention to the existence of sanatronic clinics which were mushrooming in Singapore and which claimed to be able to cure a wide variety of ailments, ranging from rheumatism, migraine, insomnia, mental fatigue, asthma, indigestion and skin diseases. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at present, the Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act which was passed in 1959 but this Act is inadequate for today's situation. It is because of this that today I am moving the Second Reading of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to license the place of practice of physicians and dentists whether they are or are not registered under the Medical Registration Act and the Dentists Registration Act. This Bill therefore covers premises used by physicians practising traditional medicine and acupuncturists. The Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital is a charitable institution performing an admirable service to the community as a nursing home. There is no intention to curb the activities of this hospital. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is necessary that minimum standards must be provided for in private hospitals, nursing homes, maternity homes and in clinics where physicians perform curative services to patients. Some of these standards are already spelt out in the existing Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act and also under regulations relating to the Dentists Registration Act. Likewise, under the Abortion Act, regulations also exist on certain standards required in premises where abortions are performed. All these clauses relating to minimum standards will be transferred to the existing Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two separate registers for these premises as is already the practice for dental premises under the existing system. Dentists who come under Division I have their premises registered separately from the premises of dentists who are registered in Division 11. Likewise, we intend, under this Bill, to keep two separate registers for medical clinics, one for physicians who are registered under the Singapore Medical Registration Act and the other for physicians who are not registered at all. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (1) of the Bill does not apply, and is not intended to apply, to houses of patients which are visited by physicians for the treatment of their patients. Clause 5 of the Bill relates to the minimum standards which I have already spelt out. They are already contained in the Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act, regulations under the Abortion Act and regulations under the Dentists Registration Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 9, an amendment will be made to allow appeals against revoking of licences to be heard by sub-committees of the Singapore Medical Council and the Dental Registration Board, insofar as these appeals relate to premises which are used by practitioners who are registered respectively under the Medical Registration Act and the Dental Registration Board. However, the Minister's decision will be final after he has considered recommendations by these subcommittees. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill permits inspection of premises - (a) in order to ensure that the premises comply with the conditions of the licence which has been given to the practitioner, and (b) for action to be taken against unregistered premises. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill requests data from private hospitals and clinics. This is not an intention to invade the patient's privacy or to be curious about the patient's record. The purpose is to obtain statistical compilation of morbidity data. At present, whatever morbidity statistics we have are available only from the public sector but a large segment of morbidity data available in the private sector is not being collated because of the absence of a machinery for such purpose. Amendment will be made in this clause so that the patient's consent will be required, if it is at all necessary, for any clinic to furnish the particular patient's record. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section II of the Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act relates to unauthorised communication made by officers in the execution of the Act. This provision will be transferred to the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 provides for advisory committees. This will be established to help the drafting of regulations relating to the Act and for such purposes as may be required in its implementation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first congratulate the Minister for the timely move in bringing this Bill before this House. No doubt, in our system of free enterprise, people in any trade or business or profession, including that of medicine and medical care, should be accorded the fullest freedom as is compatible with public interest to conduct their business with the least hindrance from the Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in this case where the practice of the profession or conduct of the business may literally mean the difference between the life \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and death of people receiving medical consultation, treatment, or care, the Government has certain moral obligations to ensure that certain safety standards are maintained, whether in relation to the services provided by or to certain medical paraphernalia used in the private clinics and private hospitals. This is not to suggest that doctors in private practice, by and large, have not been careful with maintaining standards. Private medical practitioners not only have a moral obligation towards their patients' well-being but also their own reputation to protect. There is no doubt that the vast majority of them should find no objection at least to the raison d'etre of the Bill which is to ensure that certain standards of medical consultation, treatment or care of their patients are maintained. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doctors in private practice may view the Bill as a measure to impose unnecessary hardship on them in their practice. Some unkind souls may even deliberately misconstrue this Bill as a desperate measure of the Government to prevent further brain-drain of doctors from the Government service to the private sector. I have no doubt that the Minister has no such \"macabre\" intention. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Minister's intention is honourable, the danger is that some over-zealous Ministry officials may implement the provisions of the Bill, after it has been passed, in such a manner as to make it more difficult than necessary for the doctors in private practice to conduct their business. I understand that this Bill will be committed to a Select Committee. The Minister is certainly wise in committing this Bill to a Select Committee to enable interested parties to voice their fears and/or views on the Bill. Knowing the Minister, who is still very much a democrat at heart, I have no doubt he will give whatever views that will be presented to the Select Committee his utmost consideration before this Bill is read a Third time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the act of licensing private clinics and private hospitals is no more or no less than the act of licensing the private \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> schools which the Education Ministry has been doing all along. The Bill, when seen in this light, should be considered as a logical step for the Minister to introduce in this House, particularly at a time when we see more private clinics and hospitals springing up. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to prohibit the trading in human blood. All right-thinking Singaporeans must surely give the Hon. Minister their wholehearted support in this particular provision. Much has been said and written about the abuses and undesirable consequences of trading in human blood elsewhere. Singapore today can pride itself on its public-spirited citizens who have unfailingly responded to every call for blood donation. This has not only ensured that healthy blood is available for those who need blood transfusion, irrespective of whether they are rich or poor, but it has also served to prevent people donating blood for money even when their health does not permit it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, does not deal with the growing problem that the Government faces arising out of the proliferation of private clinics and private hospitals, i.e. the brain-drain of good Government doctors to the more lucrative pasture of the private sector. I do not know whether the Minister for Trade and Industry, in his recent announcement in this House on 11th December 1979 (Hansard, Vol. 39, col. 521) regarding the Consultation Fees Scheme for doctors in the Government Service, honestly believed that the scheme was going to help at all in slowing down the brain-drain. To me, and more so to the doctors in the Government Service, what the scheme contained was nothing more than peanuts. It was a case of too little being done too late. And to make matters worse, those in the lower rungs of the medical service are not even going to get the peanuts. How is the Health Ministry going to prevent a further brain-drain? Whether the Minister for Trade and Industry or the Professional Services Review Committee likes it or not, the doctors have a greater market value than the administrators. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this point, I am sure I can get you to agree with me. But I am not so sure whether I can get the Minister of Defence, who was once the Head of the Civil Service, to agree with me. If the scheme of service for doctors in the Public Service does not even come anywhere near what an average doctor in private practice gets, then the brain-drain of doctors from the Government service to the private sector is going to be further aggravated. We do not want a situation to arise in future where first-rate medical service is only to be found in private hospitals and clinics, and second-rate medical service in the Government hospitals, and only the rich can seek swift and effective remedies for their sicknesses while the poor, as well as the not-so-poor, have to be content with second-rate treatment or, worse still, depend on prayers to heaven to help them get well. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cases that happened sometime ago in the Government hospitals must surely cause some disquiet among members of the public over the lapses of the Government health services, especially when they have grown accustomed to the high standards of medical services provided by the Government hospitals. One was the case of a patient who died after an appendicitis operation because the doctor removed a lump of fat instead of the affected appendix. The other was the death of a girl patient suffering from concussion after a fall, as she was not given the prompt medical attention she deserved. I believe the reason given in this case was that the equipment in the neuro-surgery department was overworked and the department understaffed. I know it is not fair singling out just these two cases to give the impression that something is amiss in the Government medical services. Two swallows certainly do not make a summer. The numerous successful cases in the Government hospitals that have gone unnoticed certainly more than make up for the few failures. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that under existing circumstances when the standard of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Government medical services is high, such lapses have occurred. I shudder to think what will happen in future when there is a deterioration in the standard of Government medical services as a result of a massive \"desertion\" of Government doctors to take up private practice. Hon. Members must surely agree that with the springing up of more private clinics and hospitals and the dissatisfaction of the Government doctors over their terms and conditions of work, the flow of Government doctors to private practice is likely to quicken. Retaining the services of first-rate doctors in adequate numbers in the Government service is certainly going to be more challenging for the Minister for Health in future. The task of the Hon. Minister is made more difficult sometimes by the niggardly attitude and \"the ostrich with its head in the sand\" kind of outlook adopted, particularly by the Finance Ministry officials, that often frustrate any positive move to remedy the situation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite sympathise with the Minister for Health and his other fellow Ministers in not being able to get what they want for their Ministries from the Finance Ministry. Only the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I am told, get what they want. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps for a start, the Ministry of Health can help to change the attitude of the top Finance Ministry officials by ensuring that if any one of them is admitted to hospital for treatment, he is given the poorest medical attention and services possible, just to give the Finance Ministry official a dose of his own medicine. If that official happens to be the one in charge of the allocation of funds for the building of community centres, then the Minister can even count on the services of the hon. Member for Kim Seng who, as we have all learnt from recent press reports, is on the warpath with the Finance Ministry over unfair allocation of funds to his constituency's community centre building project. In his present \"belligerent\" mood and frustration, he might even be tempted to use his surgical skills to cut him up as mercilessly as the Finance Ministry officials had slashed the financial allocation for his constituency's community centre building. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, the last portion of my speech is made in a lighter vein. I support the Bill before this House. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Bill. However, I surely do not share the sentiments of the Member for Moulmein because he talked about the doctor's remuneration. But I know that the teachers' remuneration is even worse. I hope that when the time comes to the debate on the Ministry of Education's allocation of funds, he will speak louder or as loud as he has at this time. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Moulmein and the Member for Khe Bong for their ostentatious support. I must emphasise that the Bill on which we are discussing relates to the licensing of premises and has no relationship with the emoluments of doctors. I am quite sure, nonetheless, that my medical staff will be very pleased if they could have heard the Member for Moulmein speaking on their behalf and acting as their champion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must add that it was not quite fair for the Member for Moulmein to bring up before the House what was reported in the newspapers on two cases which appeared before the coroner. In the Government hospitals, the Ministry of Health officials, doctors, physicians, dentists and other staff members are publicly accountable and, therefore, there is great scruple over unusual deaths that may occur in a hospital. It is because the peers exercise judgment over themselves that unusual deaths are promptly reported to the coroner and a public inquiry held to ascertain whether the death has been due to negligence or has been due to misadventure. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, we can say that patients who are treated in Government hospitals can be thankful that here we have a system which keeps physicians, surgeons and other hospital staff on their toes, so that standards are maintained and mistakes are not covered up. This is essential to good hospital practice, and it is because of this that we have received adverse publicity. But let us assume that all these things have been covered up, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> then of course, there would not have been coroner's inquiries, there would have been no newspaper reports, and everybody would have believed that the Government medical staff, surgeons and other hospital staff are as capable and as efficient as their counterparts in the private sector. But the Member for Moulmein could probably do an investigation on the quiet to find out what happens in the private sector. I suspect that he will be entering the twilight zone. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, if he is ignorant, I would like to inform him that patients who are high risks are rarely treated by private practitioners. In fact, they are referred to Government hospitals. Patients who have become moribund because of mismanagement by private physicians are also referred to the Government hospitals. So in the end the Government hospitals are the reservoirs or receptacles for very bad risk cases whilst private practitioners take on the low risk cases and gain fame. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a degree of unfairness in the mass media and, if this is reflected by the reaction of the Member for Moulmein, it will be a great help indeed if the mass media could do their own probes. I for one could vouch that letters of complaint about the performance in the private sector have been written to the mass media for publication in the newspapers but have been covered up. The letters, copied to me, were written to the Straits Times but they chose to publish only letters of complaint against public hospitals, never against private hospitals. I think the mass media in this sense is doing a disservice to the public, the consumers. Patients are consumers of health services and it is their right to know what they are consuming, how they are being treated. It is the intention, therefore, of this Bill to uphold the patients' right and to protect patients. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out earlier on, there are segments of the population who are fastidious over health care and are easily gullible to all advertisements relating to cures, fantastic cures, which may well be unfounded. It is to protect them that we have to extend the Nursing Homes and Maternity \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Homes Registration Act to cover clinics run by private physicians. This is a gap which has been in existence over the last 20 years. The situation today warrants that expeditious action be taken because, as Singapore hopes to become a medical centre in this region, we can expect that more and more adventurers will make use of this facility in Singapore to advance their own cause. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that I have touched on the favourite subject of the Minister for Health but I do not intend to prolong the discussion any further. I just want to touch on what the Member for Khe Bong has said - asking me to speak louder for the teachers' cause. If he had read and listened to some of my speeches in the past, he would have noticed that that was precisely what I did. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Deputy Speaker as Chairman and the following Members: \n  <pre>\r\n   Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista)\r\n   Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon)\r\n   Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang), Parliamentary\r\n      Secretary to the Minister for National\r\n      Development\r\n   Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein)\r\n   Encik Sidek bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)\r\n   Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra)\r\n   Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore), Minister for Health\r\n   Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten).\r\n\r\n- [Dr Toh Chin Chye]\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>DEFAMATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.52 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the time or the place for me to deliver a lecture on the law of defamation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> But I think it would be appropriate for me to point out to Members what is libel and what is slander under the law. Simply put, libel is defamation in a permanent form, for example, in writing or in print. Slander is defamation not in a permanent form; the best example being defamation by way of spoken words. The question arises: is broadcasting libel or slander? This moot point has been settled by statute elsewhere and here. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the Defamation Act provides that for the purpose of the law of libel and slander, the broadcasting of words by means of radiocommunication shall be treated as publication in a permanent form. The term \"broadcasting by means of radiocommunication\" is defined in the existing section 2 of the Act to mean publication for general reception by means of a telecommunication within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act, 1965. This definition has to be up-dated because the Telecommunications Act, 1965, has been repealed and new systems have also been invented for the transmission of signals. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to repeal the existing definition and to insert new definitions which will take into account new developments in the field of telecommunications. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes a consequential amendment to section 3 of the Act arising out of the insertion of the new definitions in section 2. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act to give to a broadcasting station, which is authorized by law to provide broadcasting services for general reception, the defences which are presently available to a defendant in a libel action in respect of reports and matters published in newspapers. The present subsection (3) of section 13 gives such defences to licensed broadcasting stations only. The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation which was established by the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation Act, 1979, is exempted from obtaining such a licence. The amendments made to section 13 will make these defences available to the Corporation in a libel action in respect of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> reports and matters broadcast by the Corporation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

This part of the Local Government Integration Act has become inadequate for a modern fire brigade which has to cope with new dangers and new problems resulting from rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. The Fire Service Bill before this House will replace it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill is to have better provisions for an efficient fire service. The prevention of fires in high-rise buildings has also been taken into consideration. The Bill allows fire officers to enter and inspect buildings and the fire-fighting facilities in them. Modern high-rise buildings are equipped with built-in fire-fighting devices such as dry and wet rising mains, automatic sprinklers and heat detectors. For firemen to fight fires effectively, they have to- know what facilities exist and where they are located. The Bill will allow the Fire Brigade to conduct fire-fighting and evacuation drills in buildings. The Bill will also provide for an emergency ambulance service, an auxiliary fire brigade, a fire service welfare fund and penalties for miscellaneous offences such as raising false alarms and unauthorised use of water from hydrants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill deals with preliminary matters. Clause 2 defines terms used in the Bill. The Chief Fire Officer will be known as the Director of Fire Service while the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Singapore Fire Brigade itself will be renamed the Singapore Fire Service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill deals with the constitution and administration of the Fire Service. Under clause 3, the Minister will appoint the Director of Fire Service whereas under the Local Government Integration Act, the President appoints the Chief Fire Officer. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III sets out the duties and powers of the Fire Service. When there is a fire, fire officers may enter, break into or demolish premises or things to get at the fire. They may shut off or turn on water, gas, fuel oil and electricity supplies. They may also close nearby streets, remove vehicles and persons obstructing fire-fighting operations. They will have the power to control all operations. Clause 8 gives fire officers the right to enter premises for preventive work. Preventive work includes obtaining information that could help in fighting fires, conducting fire drills, ascertaining fire hazards and checking and testing fire-fighting facilities and installations. Clauses 9, 10 and 11 give other powers to the Fire Service - to remove obstructions that will render fire escape difficult, to fix plates to buildings indicating the location of water supply and to place fire alarms and hydrants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part IV of the Bill, a welfare fund for fire officers will be established. The fund may be used to help needy fire officers and their families especially those who are injured or who die in the line of duty. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V deals with the Auxiliary Fire Service. In the past few years, National Servicemen, both full-time and part-time, have been assigned to the Fire Service. It is necessary to organise into an auxiliary brigade all those National Servicemen who have completed full-time service and have gone into the reserves and all those serving part time National Service. Once they have been formed into a capable auxiliary brigade, these National Servicemen could be mobilised for effective service, if necessary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill provides general and formal matters necessary for carrying out the Act. It provides penalties for offences such as \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the unauthorised use of water from fire hydrants and giving of false alarms to the Fire Service. It also provides the Director of Fire Service with the power to make fire service orders to regulate fire brigade duties and to control the staff members of the Service. Finally, it empowers the Minister to make regulations on matters necessary for the Fire Service to be efficient in the discharge of its duties and for carrying out the purpose of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>4.20 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, with fire wastage running at an all-time high figure, I believe, of over $70 million in 1979, the introduction of the Bill before the House is timely. To ensure the continued high standard of our fire service, it is important that we should constantly review and update the organisation and the facilities for fire-fighting. What I find disappointing about the Bill is that whilst part of the announced object of the Bill is to make better provisions under the law for the prevention of fire, there is no specific reference to this important aspect under Part Ill of the Bill, which sets out the duties and powers of the Fire Service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Director is well-placed to co-ordinate efforts directed at research into fire prevention in all aspects. He is also in a good position to undertake the responsibility to inform and to educate the public on developments in the techniques of fire prevention. Perhaps the Hon. Acting Minister for Social Affairs would consider a suitable extension of Part Ill of the Bill to spotlight rather more clearly the duties of the Fire Service on fire prevention in the broader sense. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, it is quite true, as pointed out by the Member for Jalan Kayu, that there is no specific mention of fire prevention in the Bill. However, as we all know, the Singapore Fire Brigade has, in the past, been educating members of the public on fire prevention through its regular fire \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> prevention campaigns and exhibitions. For the information of Members of this House, a Fire Prevention Campaign will be organised by the Brigade at Lucky Plaza this Friday, 29th February. This effort of the Singapore Fire Brigade in educating members of the public on fire prevention will be continued by the Singapore Fire Service, when formed as a result of this Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's suggestion that the Director of Fire Service co-ordinate efforts in research and education, I am of the opinion that instead of enlarging Part Ill of the Bill I feel that this provision is adequately covered by clause 4 in Part 11 of the Bill. I would certainly take up his suggestion. Clause 4 of the Bill says that the Director shall be charged with the direction and administration of the Fire Service. So I think the suggestion by the Member to include research and education in fire prevention can be part and parcel of the administration of the Fire Service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1979\" to \"1980\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 33 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.25 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Singapore Polytechnic Act, 1954, by changing some of the existing provisions and introducing new ones. The reason for proposing the amendments is that certain provisions of the Act have become obsolete or inadequate, considering the fact that the Polytechnic was established more than a quarter of a century ago. Since its establishment, the Polytechnic has grown into a major institution for the training of technical manpower in Singapore. Right now, there are some 4,600 full-time students and 3,000 part-time students. The campus itself has shifted to new premises at Dover Road, recently completed at a cost of $42 million. The Act governing the operation of this institution has to be brought up-to-date to reflect its development. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main areas of the Polytechnic's operations which the amendments in the Bill are intended to cover. These are the Polytechnic's Board of Governors, its Students' Union and the authority to make regulations under the Act. I shall deal with each of these subjects in turn. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the Board of Governors, the Bill seeks to amend section 4 of the Act concerning the composition of the Board. The existing section 4 is somewhat restrictive. It specifies certain Government ministries and non-Government organisations from which the Minister must select representatives to be members of the Board. The proposed amendment will make the Board consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, the Principal of the Polytechnic and from 9 to 15 other members to be appointed by the Minister. In this way, while the Board could still have representatives from Government ministries and other organisations, the Minister will also be able to appoint suitable outside experts in technical education to be members. It may be noted that under the amendment, the Principal of the Polytechnic will be a member of the Board. His previous place as Secretary to the Board will be taken by the Registrar. Also, the term of office of the members of the Board will be three years instead of four years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 4A is introduced by the Bill. It will spell out the circumstances under which a member of the Board is considered to have vacated office, empower the Minister to revoke the appointment of any member except the Principal and allow any member to resign by giving written notice to the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the subject of the Students' Union. Sections 13 and 14 are introduced under the Bill to provide for the establishment of a Singapore Polytechnic Students' Union. The Union will be constituted through regulations to be made under the Act. The proposed provisions are necessary because of the problems which the Polytechnic Authorities have faced with the Students' Union in the past. Firstly, the Students' Union has been dominated in the past by small groups of students who have, from time to time, manipulated their position for their own personal or ideological benefit. In order to get more students to be involved in the Union's affairs and to expand the Union's scope of activities, the Students' Union will be made up of a number of clubs representing the academic and extracurricular interests of the students. Every student will belong to at least one club but not more than three. Each club will have a management committee elected by its members. Each management committee will in turn elect representatives to the Union Council which will also have Executive Council members elected from each of the clubs by their ordinary members. In this way, the Students' Union structure will be more democratic. No small group of students will be able to dominate the Union Council. There will be a fairer representation of students in the Council. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem concerning the Students' Union of the Singapore Polytechnic lies with the management of its funds. The Union collects a large sum of money in union fees from the students. Based on the existing enrolment, the union fees come up to more than $100,000 a year. This money has to be spent responsibly for the benefit of the greatest number of students. It has to be properly accounted for. Unfortunately, the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> officials of the Students' Union over the years have demonstrated that they could not do so. We have received complaints from the external auditors of the Polytechnic Students' Union. For example, in 1977 the sum written off was $4,330 and in 1979 it was $5,624. Hence, under the Bill, the responsibility for collecting union fees and seeing that they are properly spent and accounted for will be borne by the Polytechnic's administration. This is an unavoidable responsibility since the only alternative is that the sum is managed by the Students' Union officials who come and go year by year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Students' Union and its constituent clubs will come under the ambit of the Societies Act. A transitional provision will be made for the existing Students' Union to continue functioning until the new Union is constituted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that if the Students' Union of the Polytechnic carries out their activities within the law and for the benefit of the students, they will have nothing to worry about. In fact, the new amendment will strengthen their hands as the composition of the Council provides for wider representation and, therefore, for a wider scope of activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill seeks an amendment concerning the authority to make Regulations under the Act. This authority is at present held by the Minister and the Regulations have to be approved by Parliament before they come into force. It is proposed that the authority to make Regulations be entrusted to the Board of Governors who would seek the approval of the Minister. The Regulations made under the Act relate to such matters as the conduct and disciplinary control of staff and students of the Polytechnic. The Board of Governors would be the appropriate body to make such regulations. It would also mean that Regulations could be made more expeditiously. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>4.35 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make some comments on the Amendment Bill before the House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Amendment Bill introduces nine new sections, 13 to 21. Of these new provisions, section 13 subsections (1), (2) and (3), and section 21 subsections 1 (e) and 1 (f) have caused great apprehension among a certain section of the students in the Singapore Polytechnic. They feel that these provisions encroach upon their basic rights to organise student activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the students should now have their fear allayed by the speech of the Hon. Minister which clearly shows that it is not really his intention to suppress legitimate and healthy student activities which are so much an integral part of the educational process of students in an institution of higher learning. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that neither in the Singapore Polytechnic Act (Chapter 180 of the Revised Edition) nor in the Singapore Polytechnic (Amendment) Bill before the House is there provision for a Guild of Graduates of the Polytechnic, nor is there provision for the Polytechnic Graduates to be represented on the Board of Governors. As the Minister is aware, he being an academic besides wearing his many different hats, there is a Guild of Graduates of the University of Singapore and that the Guild elects four members to the University Council which can have a maximum membership of 18. Through this provision in the University of Singapore Act, these elected members from the Guild have over the years contributed in no small measure to the development of the University of Singapore into an esteemed place of higher learning. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Hon. Minister will consider introducing a provision in the Singapore Polytechnic (Amendment) Bill for a similar organisation in some future date. In the meantime, he may wish to consider appointing some Polytechnic graduates, who have distinguished themselves in the various professions, as members of the Board of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Governors under clause 2 of the Amendment Bill when it comes into force. I am confident that such members will render valuable service to their Alma Mater \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. the hon. Member's concern that past graduates of the Polytechnic, especially those who have excelled themselves are not given the opportunity to serve the Polytechnic Board of Governors, is quite unfounded. Though not explicitly mentioned in the present Act or the Amendment Bill, past graduates of the Polytechnic have served on the Board of Governors in the past. In fact, the Amendment Bill before the House will give the Minister this flexibility to appoint people on the Board as he deems fit. I would suggest that if the hon. Member for Buona Vista has some suitable names to recommend, please do so because I am in the process of appointing the next Board of Governors for the Singapore Polytechnic. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause I - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1979\" to \"1980\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year in page 4, line 8, has also to be altered from \"1979\" to \"1980\".

Most of the proposed amendments or new provisions are similar to the ones proposed under the Singapore Polytechnic (Amendment) Bill for the Singapore Polytechnic Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, section 7 of the Act is to be amended to allow flexibility in the appointment of members to the Council of the College. The amendment, however, will not affect the present position of the Ngee Ann Kongsi which will continue to have three representatives on the Council. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to delete paragraph (e) of section 8, subsection (2) of the Act. This paragraph made it a part of the functions of the Council to provide residences for the staff and students of the College. Since there is now neither the need nor the intention to provide residences, this paragraph has become obsolete and ought to be deleted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to alter the composition of the College Senate slightly by including the Vice-Principal of the College as a member of the Senate. He will serve as the Deputy Chairman of the Senate to assist the Principal who is the Chairman. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 7 of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the Ngee Ann Technical College Students' Union. The mechanism for constituting the Students' Union will be the same as in the case of the Singapore Polytechnic Students' Union, that is to say, it will be constituted by Regulations to be made under the Act. The intention is likewise similar - to ensure fair and wide representation of the students' interests and proper management of the Union funds. The \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Union and its constituent clubs will come under the ambit of the Societies Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to empower the Council of the College to draw up rules on the appointment, promotion and termination of service of the staff and on the conduct and disciplinary control of staff and students. The Council will also assume responsibility for the proper control over the assets and expenditure of the College and for the preparation of financial statements for auditing. These are at present the Principal's responsibilities but it is felt that, more appropriately, the Council should have charge of these matters. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Bill is passed by this House and brought into operation, the current College Council will continue in office. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in the Bill will bring the Ngee Ann Technical College and the Singapore Polytechnic more in line with each other, since, after all, both are tertiary institutions for technical training and should be governed by similar laws. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1979\" to \"1980\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year in page 4, line 34, has also to be altered from \"1979\" to \"1980\".
