National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I respond to Dr Amy Khor's specific questions, allow me to explain the rationale for the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government introduced the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) in 1989 to ensure a balanced mix of the various ethnic groups within HDB estates.&nbsp; At that time, a discernible trend was observed of racial <p align=left>Column: 2266</p>enclaves starting to form in our HDB estates, which would have serious implications for our multi-racial society.&nbsp; The vast majority of Singaporeans live in HDB estates.&nbsp; By providing HDB residents of different races with more opportunities to interact as neighbours, the EIP fosters ethnic tolerance and understanding, and strengthens our social cohesion and national unity.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EIP has been effective in maintaining ethnic balance in our HDB estates.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the years, it has helped to lower ethnic concentrations in towns with a high concentration of a particular race. For example, the percentage of Chinese in Sengkang has been lowered from 90% in 1989 to 80% today, Malays in Bedok from 23% to 19%, and Indians in Woodlands from 12% to 9%.&nbsp; When the EIP was implemented in 1989, 35 HDB neighbourhoods, or 28% of the&nbsp;total number of&nbsp;neighbourhoods, had hit the EIP limits, ie, the maximum allowable proportion for each of the&nbsp;ethnic groups.&nbsp; Today, 41 or 25% of the 162 HDB neighbourhoods have hit the EIP limits.&nbsp; Without the EIP to place a cap on ethnic proportions, the ethnic concentrations in the affected neighbourhoods would have been higher.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the specific queries raised by Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last five years, about 300 applications for sale and purchase of resale flats were rejected each year due to the EIP. This is less than 1% of the total number of&nbsp;resale transactions received by HDB each year.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve its objective, the EIP is implemented strictly by the HDB. Waiver is considered only for cases where there are very exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last five years, HDB has granted EIP waiver to an average of less than 20 appeals a year.&nbsp; However, HDB does exercise flexibility under certain circumstances, for example, by allowing households of mixed marriages/parentage <p align=left>Column: 2267</p>to be reclassified to meet the ethnic criteria.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB's data shows that most flat-owners who wish to sell their flats are able to do so without any difficulties, despite the EIP. &nbsp; With the large number of resale flats transacted annually, sellers who are realistic in their asking price should be able to find buyers from the eligible ethnic groups.&nbsp; For those who have bought another flat and need more time to sell their existing flats, HDB can assist them by granting a time extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 2002 and 2005, HDB granted approval to 50 cases that requested for more time to sell their flats due to EIP restrictions.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB also has various financial assistance measures to help lessees who are facing financial hardship and have problems meeting the HDB mortgage loan repayments, so that they are not compelled to sell their flats as a first option.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, HDB will continue to actively develop and promote the various HDB towns to make them attractive for all races, for example, by planning adequate places of worship, eating houses, schools and other facilities that are important to the different ethnic groups.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recognises that there are households which are inconvenienced and may need more time to find a suitable buyer for their flat because of the EIP.&nbsp; But this is a sacrifice that Singaporeans must be prepared to make to safeguard racial harmony in our society.&nbsp; Racial riots in other countries have shown how easily inter-ethnic tensions can be stirred if racial enclaves are allowed to develop and fester.&nbsp; Abolishing the EIP would be a dangerous step in this direction.&nbsp; It will lead to our housing estates, schools, neighbourhood shops, markets, social and <p align=left>Column: 2268</p>recreational amenities, and ultimately our politics being developed along ethnic lines.&nbsp; The EIP is an important pillar of social stability in Singapore, which we should preserve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to state that I firmly believe that the ethnic quota remain in place as it would be naive to suggest doing away with the quota, especially at times like this where world events have shown that race and religion are very delicate and deep-seated matters that cannot be taken for granted.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask four supplementary questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry does regularly review the quota to see if it remains appropriate in the light of our evolving immigration and procreation patterns and, if not, whether the Ministry could do so to ensure the appropriateness of the quota as the percentage of, say, Indians relative to other races, could have changed in view of changing immigration patterns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry could exercise more flexibility when the market is weak, not just in terms of time exemption but in terms of even extending interest-free loans to sellers of such flats who are adversely affected by the ethnic quota if they have to take possession of a resale flat.&nbsp; This is because in a weak market there are very few buyers for a single property and the probability of being affected adversely by this ethnic quota actually goes up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry can consider <p align=left>Column: 2269</p>casting the quota as a band rather than as a fixed and inviolate number for each race in each estate and in each block as this will then allow the policy to have some in-built flexibility and help minimise the number of flat sellers that could be adversely affected by the policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to ask the Minister, in the light of the Workers' Party's manifesto which seems to suggest that they are proposing to dismantle the ethnic integration quota because they feel that we have already achieved a certain level of social integration, in his opinion, if we ever can dismantle this ethnic quota, that we can ever achieve a level of social integration where racial enclaves will not re-emerge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, as far as the review of the EIP is concerned, like all HDB housing policies, we do conduct regular policy reviews from time to time.&nbsp; In the case of ethnic limits for the EIP, these limits were derived in 1989 based, firstly, on the proportion of the different races in the general population, and, secondly, on the projected demand for HDB resale flats from each of these races.&nbsp; Over time, as the situation changes, we will review these limits, keeping in mind the objective of the scheme.&nbsp; I must say, Sir, that we have been reviewing the limits regularly and, so far, we have not seen it necessary to change them.&nbsp; However, having said that, we will continue to keep an eye on the numbers and we will, as in other policy matters, conduct a review of the EIP as well.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of flexibility in times of a slow economy, I have to point out, as I explained in my answer, that the number of people who are affected by the EIP is not very large.&nbsp; In fact, in terms of percentages, the total number of EIP appeals that we receive every year is less than 1%.&nbsp; We have about 300 appeals and total annual resale transactions for HDB is <p align=left>Column: 2270</p>about 30,000 to 35,000.&nbsp; We find that in most cases the people who are affected by the EIP, after a while, would not have a problem selling their flat.&nbsp; It is a function, first of all, of the asking price of the flat.&nbsp; It is a function of the economy.&nbsp; In a weak market, most flat sellers would find greater difficulty in selling their flat, not just those affected by the EIP.&nbsp; It is also a function of the size of the flat, the location and condition of the flat, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many factors that determine whether a flat is easy to sell or not.&nbsp; In a slow market, everybody is affected.&nbsp; It is not possible for the HDB to specifically target just the EIP sellers for assistance.&nbsp; We do exercise flexibility across-the-board, for everybody.&nbsp; Recognising that in a slow market, there would be more difficulties in selling their flats and, on a case-by-case basis, we have allowed them to extend the time taken to sell their flat and we have given them financial assistance so that they do not have to sell their flat in the first place.&nbsp; Most of the time these measures have been able to relieve the pressure on the sellers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question was whether we should have the quota as a band instead of a specific number.&nbsp; When we set the numbers in 1989, we specifically set each of the limits for both the neighbourhood as well as the block much higher than the corresponding proportion of the ethnic groups in the general population.&nbsp; For example, the Chinese proportion in the population was 77%, the neighbourhood limit was set at 84% and the block limit at 87%.&nbsp; For the Malays, the proportion was 14%, the neighbourhood limit was 22% and the block limit was 25%.&nbsp; There is a margin to allow us to be more flexible in terms of facilitating the buying and selling of flats.&nbsp; I am not sure that a band will help because, at the end of the day,&nbsp; when you reach the limits of the band, what do you do?&nbsp; What we will do is to go back to what she asked in the first <p align=left>Column: 2271</p>place, ie, review the quota from time to time, exercise flexibility as and when we can, but bearing in mind the overriding objective of the scheme, which is to make sure that our housing estates remain mixed and that we do not allow the races to start to congregate again.&nbsp; Bearing that very important objective in mind, we will conduct our policy reviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last question she asked is about the Workers' Party's manifesto.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I think it would have been a question better answered by him.&nbsp; When the Workers' Party proposed in their manifesto that we dismantled the Ethnic Integration Policy among other policies, I was not sure whether they thought that it is no longer necessary for us to have this Ethnic Integration Policy because Singaporeans have matured or whether they do not, in the first place, believe that it is necessary for us to have this policy, ie, that it is all right to have racial enclaves, that there is nothing wrong with it.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think it is very important for us to remind ourselves in this House that racial harmony is not a given for Singapore.&nbsp; It is not a given for any multi-racial society.&nbsp; Certainly, for Singapore,&nbsp;we have had experience with&nbsp; racial riots in the sixties.&nbsp; And if you trace the history of public housing in Singapore, you will understand the role that public housing has played in helping to create a much more integrated and tolerant Singapore.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp; In the fifties and sixties, if you recall, Singaporeans were living in segregated communities, according to race, and even according to dialect groups.&nbsp; So, you had Malays in Geylang Serai and Jalan Eunos; Indians in Serangoon Road and Naval Base; and the Chinese were not just concentrating in one area - they were concentrated according to dialect groups.&nbsp; So you had <p align=left>Column: 2272</p>Cantonese in Kreta Ayer; Teochews in Boat Quay and Hougang (as some of them are still today); Hokkiens were in Telok Ayer;&nbsp;Hainanese were in Beach Road and also Middle Road areas.&nbsp; So, each of these communities was either monolingual or mono-dialect and their approach to things was also along those lines.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early sixties when we had our public housing programme, the Government took the opportunity to mix the population.&nbsp; As a result of that, not only do we have multi-racial HDB estates but we have multi-racial constituencies as well.&nbsp; So each constituency in a way is like a mini-Singapore, and it is for this reason that our MPs understand the concerns and&nbsp;problems faced by the different races.&nbsp; And it is also for this reason that our own residents of different races understand the problems of other races.&nbsp; I think this is something that we must continue to maintain. Having a multi-racial housing estate has allowed us to build&nbsp; this very tolerant and harmonious society where for over-40 years, we have had no problems with racial riots, none of the problems that we see in many other multi-racial societies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we did in the sixties was for new flats.&nbsp; Then we realised that with the flats becoming available for resale, people were starting to regroup again.&nbsp; And, hence, when the trend was very clear in the early eighties, in 1989 the EIP was put in place.&nbsp; So for us in Singapore, this is a lesson that we have to learn.&nbsp; We have to be proactive in our policies.&nbsp; We have to make sure that people live together as neighbours so that they learn, their children learn that different races have different customs, different taboos, that we eat different foods, listen to different music, we worship different Gods, and yet, at the same time, despite these differences, we have the opportunity to mix together - to go to the same hawker centre, to go to the same market, to go to <p align=left>Column: 2273</p>the same school, to take the same lift, same bus/MRT to work, and so on.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is a very important aspect of Singapore life that we need to preserve.&nbsp; So when the Workers' Party suggests that we dismantle all this, I am not sure whether they understand what they are suggesting.&nbsp; Therefore, it is very important for us to point out the consequences of what they are suggesting, and why we think that they are wrong.&nbsp; And it is important for us to get an opinion from the Workers' Party.&nbsp; Mr Low is not in this House but, perhaps, I would be able to get an answer from him at the next opportunity.&nbsp; It is better for him to answer Dr Amy Khor than for me to do so.&nbsp; But whatever the motivation behind its manifesto, the consequences of following that path are really very dangerous and very disastrous - it is like playing with fire.&nbsp; It is important for us to point this out so that people can understand why is it that we think it is wrong. And to point this out vigorously.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the next time we meet in Parliament - or even before that -&nbsp; this matter will be clarified, so that at least we get the fundamentals right and the basic understanding correct&nbsp;- is this necessary or not?&nbsp; Then we can start talking about the mechanics of it.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor has stated her position very clearly.&nbsp; She says she supports the policy, she understands why it is necessary, but she asks certain questions about the workings of the policy.&nbsp; I think those are very fair questions and we will certainly take them into consideration.&nbsp; But let us get the fundamentals correct - is this necessary, is it important for us to have integration policies in Singapore?&nbsp; The answer is definitely yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Eleven were prosecuted&nbsp;in 2001, two&nbsp; in 2002, three in 2003, one in 2004 and&nbsp;three in 2005.&nbsp; Nineteen of these offenders received imprisonment terms of between two weeks and three months.&nbsp; One was jailed for three months and fined $250.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As flat lessor and landlord, HDB has also taken action against the convicted killer litter offenders.&nbsp; HDB has the obligation to ensure that HDB estates are safe, and residents and passers-by are not exposed to the threat of killer litter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 20 cases, seven offenders who had committed serious offences and were jailed for two months or more were required to sell their flats.&nbsp; For 11 cases where the offences were less severe and the offenders were jailed for less than two months, HDB issued stern warnings to them.&nbsp; The&nbsp;remaining two&nbsp;offenders were issued a final written warning instead of being required to sell their flats, as their flats were already on the lowest floor.&nbsp; In other words, they committed the&nbsp;offences elsewhere.&nbsp; HDB's actions vary depending <p align=left>Column: 2276</p>on the severity of the offences committed, so that the offenders' families are not unnecessarily penalised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides acting against killer litter offenders, HDB also works closely with Town Councils to proactively educate residents not to place objects in precarious positions that could result in their falling off and posing a threat to public safety.&nbsp; Where necessary, residents are warned to remove these objects.&nbsp; Taking summons action against recalcitrant offenders is also a measure and it is taken as the last resort.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB and Town Councils will continue to educate residents and take stern enforcement actions against offenders.&nbsp; There are no plans to impose heavier penalties for killer litter offences, as HDB can already compulsorily acquire a flat in very serious or recalcitrant killer litter cases.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, HDB and Town Councils can only do so much to keep our HDB estates safe.&nbsp; Ultimately, HDB residents themselves must want to act responsibly and ensure that they do not endanger the lives of others by placing objects in a manner that could result in their falling off and hurting others.&nbsp; Also, if they spot potential killer litter, residents can help&nbsp;by advising the households concerned to take them down or by notifying the Town Council or&nbsp;HDB.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:DENGUE SITUATION--><p align=left>Column: 2276<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform Members that the dengue situation in Singapore has improved and is now under control. Since October 2005, there has been a decrease in the weekly incidence of dengue cases. From a peak of 713 in September 2005, this has fallen to an average weekly number of 99 cases for the month of December 2005. This compares very well with 292 cases in the similar period of December 2004.&nbsp; The numbers have continued to fall to an average weekly number of 61 for January 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, like the rest of the region, experienced a resurgence of dengue fever over the past few years. NEA has acted proactively in dengue surveillance and control in response to the rising dengue numbers. Since dengue is spread by the Aedes mosquito, the key to fighting dengue is to reduce mosquito breeding. Thus, when a dengue case is reported, NEA moves in immediately to search for all mosquito-breeding sources and destroy the mosquito larvae in the vicinity of the patient's home. To further enhance our efforts at mosquito surveillance and control, NEA has also increased its manpower for dengue operations since the beginning of 2005, in order to maintain immediate response to reported dengue cases and carry out more inspections.&nbsp; In all, NEA has deployed a total of about 510 staff on dengue operations as compared to 110 in early 2005, more than a four-fold increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the same time, NEA is working intensively with the grassroots organisations to spread the anti-dengue message across to all our residents by extending the Mozzie Attack programme.&nbsp; This programme was launched in April 2004 in 10 constituencies. By June&nbsp;2005, the programme had been extended to all 84 constituencies. Correspondingly, the total number of dengue prevention <p align=left>Column: 2278</p>volunteers doubled from 2,000 in the previous year to 4,000 in 2005. Through these collective efforts, the total number of breeding sites found in NEA inspections fell from an average of 1,600 a month in 2004 to an average of 1,100 a month for 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the continued rise of dengue cases throughout South-East Asia, my Ministry adopted a more aggressive strategy to further reduce mosquito breeding. I have circulated a factsheet with more details of these measures to Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased that our combined efforts have since led to the sharp reduction in the number of dengue</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>cases. Measures, such as the six-week island-wide carpet-combing exercise, increased flushing and inspection of drains, and a coordinated system of regular checks by Government agencies, have reduced mosquito breeding in common areas of residential estates and public areas. Through the \"Campaign against Dengue\", households and workers have played their part by incorporating dengue prevention measures as part of their daily routine.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have also improved our systems to better prepare us to prevent and tackle any future outbreaks of dengue. As&nbsp;at end December 2005, 15 out of 16 Town Councils have appointed dedicated pest control operators to ensure that there are regular checks in the common areas of HDB estates. The CDCs have also actively helped in promoting dengue prevention and will continue to do so. We are engaging in more research to better understand mosquitoes and the dengue virus and to further improve on our dengue surveillance and control system.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government is committed to the fight against dengue, it has been through the effort of all Singaporeans that we have kept dengue low. All of us <p align=left>Column: 2279</p>Singaporeans must remain vigilant and diligent in preventing mosquito breeding. Dengue prevention begins at home and I would encourage everyone to continue to practise the&nbsp;five steps of the \"Ten-Minute Mozzie Wipeout\" routine to get rid of stagnant water, for example, by covering bamboo pole holders. I would also like to urge all households to help in getting rid of potential breeding sites in immediate surrounding areas, such as common corridors and walkways.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we all can play a part by acting responsibly and put litter in its right place. During the carpet combing blitz, litter and discarded receptacles, such as drinking cans, were found to be among the top three sources of mosquito breeding. Litter also clogs up our drains,&nbsp;causing water to stagnate.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we maintain our regime of regular inspections, the public can continue to be our eyes and ears for possible mosquito breeding sites. I would like to encourage the public to continue using the dengue hotlines to alert us to stagnant water, choked drains or other potential mosquito breeding sites.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The partnership between the Government and the people has helped bring down dengue significantly, and I would like to reiterate my sincere thanks to everyone who participated in the fight against dengue. With the collective efforts of everyone, we can continue to maintain a low incidence of dengue and enjoy a high standard of public health in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXERCISE NORTHSTAR V--><p align=left>Column: 2279<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXERCISE NORTHSTAR V</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Assessment--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Assessment)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob -</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2280</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; To&nbsp;ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether in his assessment Exercise Northstar V has met its objectives in (i) helping Singaporeans to be better prepared in the event of a terrorist attack; (ii) ensuring that our emergency response system works; and (b) whether such an exercise will be conducted regularly.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B>&nbsp; Question No. 5.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

The exercise successfully met this key objective.&nbsp; It was the first time an emergency exercise was conducted on such a scale involving our public transport system.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective coordination was achieved amongst the emergency responders, the public transport operators, the hospitals, and other home-front agencies. For instance, officers from the SCDF and Singapore Police Force were able to swiftly respond to mock casualties, set up cordons and first-aid stations at the affected MRT stations and bus interchange, and manage the crowd. For the first time, we tested the setting up of a Family Assistance Centre, to assist family members of victims or those who have gone missing and believed to have been affected by the incident.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An additional objective was to familiarise Singaporeans on the steps to take should they be affected by such an attack. That Sunday, more than 3,000 commuters who were onboard the MRT trains when the simulated blasts went off, were guided by MRT staff through the <p align=left>Column: 2281</p>evacuation drill. In all, about 10,000 commuters were affected by the disruption to the MRT system and had first-hand experience which would come in useful in the event of a terrorist attack occurring under such a scenario.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, public feedback on the exercise has been generally positive. Indeed, the public support the need for more of such emergency exercises.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, even though the 22 participating agencies did well there are still many areas for improvement. Agencies will now conduct smaller-scale exercises, either on their own or involving a smaller group of relevant agencies to stress-test their responses as part of a larger emergency response system. When ready, we may conduct another large-scale exercise. When we do this, we will remain mindful of the impact and inconvenience to the public and will take these into consideration when planning the exercise.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are mindful that it is unrealistic to expect Singaporeans to become better prepared for a terrorist attack after one or two large-scale emergency exercises.&nbsp;For this reason, SCDF will continue to work with grassroots and business groups to hold regular emergency exercises to enable the public and employees to familiarise themselves with essential emergency drills. I take this opportunity to urge all Singaporeans to be involved in these exercises. Better still, treat emergency preparedness as a way of life so that not only are we physically prepared, but also mentally prepared as well.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CONTRACT WORKERS--><p align=left>Column: 2281<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CONTRACT WORKERS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Complaint of non-payment of CPF and non-compliance with Employment Act--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Complaint of non-payment of CPF and non-compliance with Employment Act)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Halimah Yacob&nbsp;-</p><p align=left>Column: 2282</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; To ask the Minister for Manpower over the last three years (a) how many contract workers complained about (i) non-payment of CPF; (ii) non-compliance with the Employment Act; (b) how were the contract workers assisted; and (c) what proactive measures will the Ministry put in place to better protect the interest of these workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B>:&nbsp; Question No. 6.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong) (for the Minister for Manpower):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Board investigated and positively determined 1,420 cases of non-payment or underpayment of CPF contributions in 2003, 1,060 cases in 2004, and 1,019 cases in 2005.

This needed to be articulated explicitly.&nbsp; Because Workfare aims to ensure that all who can work will find meaningful jobs,&nbsp;earn adequate wages&nbsp;and support themselves and their children.&nbsp; And through Workfare, we hope that they will&nbsp;gain self-reliance, through their own efforts own their homes, educate their children, and put aside enough for their medical and retirement needs.

She inadvertently picked the cumulative April and May 2004 collections to submit to IRAS.&nbsp; It was a \"data translation\" error.&nbsp; Thus, she reported the collection for May 2004 as $419 million instead of the correct figure of $211 million, an overstatement of $208 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRAS and MOF did not immediately detect the over-reporting in May 2004, as <p align=left>Column: 2292</p>that month's collection did not show any extraordinary increase over the same period in 2003.&nbsp; The total GST collections by IRAS and Singapore Customs amounted to $938.5 million for May 2004.&nbsp; Although this figure was 28.5% higher than the May 2003 collection of $730.5 million, the increase was within expectations due to the increase in GST rate from 4% to 5% on 1st January 2004.&nbsp; Furthermore, import GST is only a part of the total GST collection, which varies widely from month to month due to its cyclical nature.&nbsp; The error was only picked up during an audit in April 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When IRAS was informed of the mistake, IRAS took immediate action to amend the error.&nbsp;&nbsp;The IRAS officer simply reduced the March 2005 figure by the sum of $208 million, instead of reporting the correct March 2005 figure and amending the May 2004 figure.&nbsp; He thought what was critical was to ensure that the overall collection figure for the whole of the financial year would be correct, not realising the importance of correct monthly figures too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the sequence of events, it is plain that the corrections had been done immediately in April 2005, but in the wrong way.&nbsp; I would like to assure Singaporeans that the GST collection in the Government accounts for the financial year 2004/2005 has been audited and correctly accounted for.&nbsp; The reporting errors did not arise from a data system failure but from human errors.&nbsp; The first error by Singapore Customs was a straight mistake of picking the wrong figure from the computer spreadsheet.&nbsp; The second error by IRAS was an error of judgment in the course of trying to correct the mistake by Singapore Customs.&nbsp; While the errors gave wrong figures for the months of May 2004 and March 2005, the errors completely offset each other.&nbsp; The total figure for financial year 2004/2005 was correct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2293</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no question of Singapore Customs or IRAS trying to fudge or cover up their mistakes. &nbsp;In particular, there is no reason for the IRAS officer to try to conceal the error, as the error was neither his nor IRAS'.&nbsp;

Few are actually affected, since 80% of deaths each year do not go through the probate or estate duty process and, for the 20% which go through the probate process, the majority are non-dutiable and take between two and six months to complete the probate process.&nbsp; Only 3% of deaths actually pay estate duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person can invest in a few residential properties up to the aggregate <p align=left>Column: 2295</p>$9 million exemption limit for residential properties, but his rental income could eventually still form part of his other assets, which are subject to the $600,000 limit. &nbsp;Mr Png alludes to the point that the $9 million limit is perhaps too high, while the $600,000 exemption limit is relatively low, and this biases investment choices. &nbsp;We will take note of his concern, but it is also not a simple matter to equalise the two since we must look for a solution that is equitable and does not drastically impact revenues at the same time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Trustee has been administering the estates of deceased persons not exceeding $50,000 in value, as provided for under the Probate and Administration Act for a number of years.&nbsp; The Ministry of Law, which supervises the Public Trustee's office, is currently reviewing the ceiling of $50,000 to assess if the sum of $50,000 is still a relevant sum in today's context or whether it should be raised to a higher sum.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The answer is yes.&nbsp; Indeed, that is the objective of the exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current Medisave withdrawal rules were set with Class B2/C patients in mind and this should remain the primary objective of Medisave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, incrementally, for the middle-income group who have larger Medisave balances and would normally use Class A/B1 wards or private hospitals, we should&nbsp;allow them to use more of their <p align=left>Column: 2297</p>Medisave balances to pay for their hospital bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be done in various ways.&nbsp; We can raise the daily limit by $X and increase the surgical table claim limits at the same time.&nbsp; Or we can allow a larger $X daily limit but&nbsp;keeping the surgical table claim limits unchanged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another alternative is to have multiple daily claim limits, allowing higher claims for the first few days of hospitalisation, as suggested by Dr Tan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to go for a simple solution by simply raising the daily withdrawal limit substantially from $300 to $400.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact will be significant. On average, a Class B1 hospitalisation bill would be covered up to 76%, ie, more than three-quarters&nbsp;by Medisave, therefore, reducing co-payment in cash to 24%, while a Class A bill would be covered up to 62%, thus reducing&nbsp;the cash co-payment to 38%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients will save hundreds of dollars in their out-of-pocket expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Class B2 and C patients, the change will enable practically all of them to have their hospital bills fully covered by Medisave, without their having to dip into their pockets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next task is to see how Medisave can be used for costly outpatient care, especially for those with chronic illnesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even as we liberalise the use of Medisave, I must remind our patients to remain prudent in their choice of hospitalisation class and use of medical services.&nbsp; Medisave is for a rainy day when one is old and no longer employed.&nbsp; So better not deplete it prematurely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for the clarification to my question.&nbsp; I would like <p align=left>Column: 2298</p>to pose a supplementary question.&nbsp;In view of the fact that&nbsp;Medisave will be raised in terms of daily withdrawal limits as well as the utilisation and outpatient selected use, will the Minister consider raising the ceiling on the balances on&nbsp;Medisave as well. This is because the Medisave balance that is in each person's Medisave account will probably be higher for those who could contribute more,&nbsp;and because of the fact that the utilisation amount is going to rise over time.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; I think the Member is referring to the Medisave contribution ceiling (MCC).&nbsp; Once you hit this ceiling, and if you continue to contribute, the&nbsp;excess&nbsp;will then go to the Special&nbsp;Account.&nbsp; I remember Mdm Halimah, on several occasions, had also argued for the lifting of this ceiling.&nbsp; It is something that we can take a look.&nbsp; But&nbsp;if the worker continues to work&nbsp;and therefore builds up his contributions, once we change the flow rate,&nbsp;and&nbsp;allow greater withdrawals for higher classes, then his balance will come down, below the ceiling. When&nbsp;they work, they will continue to build up their balance again. So it is quite a dynamic situation.

According to the latest <p align=left>Column: 2299</p>survey in 2004, the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes among Singaporeans aged 18-69 years was 7.8%.&nbsp; This is significantly lower than 9.5% in 1998 and 10% in 1992.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to methodological constraints, it is an internationally accepted practice to measure the burden of diabetes in terms of 'prevalence' rather than 'incidence'. However, based on local studies and mathematical modelling, the incidence of diabetes, in population aged 18-69 years, has been estimated to be 7 per 1,000 population in 1992, 8 per 1,000 in 1998 and 6 per 1,000 in 2004. This translates to about 12,000 new cases every year, for the past few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diabetes is the most common cause of renal failure in Singapore, accounting for more than half of the new cases.&nbsp; A similar trend is seen in many other countries such as the United States of America,&nbsp;New Zealand and Malaysia.&nbsp; However, most people with diabetes do not develop kidney disease that is severe enough to cause renal failure.&nbsp; Based on local data, only 0.1% or 1 in 1,000 diabetics will develop renal failure in a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burden of diabetes is a reflection of our lifestyle, ethnic and genetic pre-disposition and an aging population.&nbsp; Diabetes, if not managed well, can lead to many serious complications including blindness, heart disease and renal failure.&nbsp; But we can prevent and reduce the risk of diabetes by adopting a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; For those with diabetes, good blood sugar and blood pressure control is vital for avoiding complications.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply.&nbsp; Although the figures showed that we seem to be keeping the incidence and prevalence of diabetes under control&nbsp;-&nbsp;at least&nbsp;it has not been increasing in the last few years -&nbsp;this is still a very big problem for Singapore and&nbsp;the region.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2300</p>And we have all the risk factors - urbanisation, affluence and the fact that we are in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Senior&nbsp;Minister of State if we can do even more in the prevention by having a more upstream approach,&nbsp;perhaps,&nbsp;a bigger budget for research, education and public awareness as opposed to dealing with the problem mainly downstream, and whether we could have a more integrated and coordinated approach between, say, the Government and voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). For instance, it seems to be that a lot of the voluntary welfare organisations may be better equipped to deal with the problem upstream in terms of community education, rather than provide facilities like NKF has been doing for patients who have become end-stage diabetic cases.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Dr Geh Min, could you&nbsp;make your question brief, please?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Geh Min</B>:&nbsp; I am just expanding on my question.

The first level is trying to prevent the onset of diabetes itself.&nbsp; And here, diet and a healthy lifestyle are important considerations. And then, at the second level, it is trying to prevent the complications of diabetes.&nbsp; This is through better management of the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these&nbsp;are multi-factorial diseases. The cause is complex, partly genetic, <p align=left>Column: 2301</p>partly environmental.&nbsp; And so, it is the interplay of these factors that gives rise to this disease.&nbsp; Unlike lung cancer, where smoking is a major factor involved and, therefore, a simple advertisement by the Health Promotion Board's \"Stop Smoking\" is a good advertisement. With diabetes, it is a little more complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no major&nbsp;single&nbsp;factor that we can advertise and promote as a means of stopping the onset of the disease.&nbsp; It is multi-factorial, similar to heart disease and stroke, and so the message is&nbsp;more about healthy living which the Health Promotion Board is&nbsp;promoting.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that there&nbsp;are 12,000 new cases a year.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether these new cases actually occurred in&nbsp;certain age groups and whether the Ministry of Health has some focused programmes to help these people who&nbsp;suffer such illnesses because I understand that about a few years ago, there was another survey by MOH which showed that a majority of those that have been diagnosed with diabetes actually did nothing about their follow-up and their condition&nbsp;deteriorated.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan</B>:&nbsp; The incidence or prevalence of diabetes is higher in an older population as compared to a younger population.&nbsp; But prevention measures have to cover the entire population because the current thinking is that it takes many years of living a particular lifestyle that contributes to the development of diabetes.

As such, some of these carriers may prefer to continue to use Changi's main terminals as it fits in better with their&nbsp; business model, despite the fact that they will have <p align=left>Column: 2304</p>to incur higher operating costs.&nbsp; For example, some carriers currently have arrangements to transfer passengers to other airlines at the main terminals, unlike the typical low cost carrier which focuses on end-to-end traffic.&nbsp; For such carriers, operating out of the main terminals will allow transfers to be done expeditiously and with minimum inconvenience to travellers.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a new concept, it is understandable that most potential users of the Budget Terminal would want to wait and watch the reaction of travellers to this new facility. If travellers give the new Terminal the thumbs up, we are then likely to see increased interest from other budget airlines. Although the facility has been sized to meet the needs of Tiger Airways for the next few years, it can be expanded modularly to cater for other airlines should they decide to operate at the Terminal.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> Sir, for the low-cost carriers concerned, other than cost, what are the benefits of operating out of the Budget Terminal instead of the main terminals, and whether these benefits are sufficient to justify the inconvenience and the lower-quality service that it offers to the passengers?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question: is Tiger Airways' commitment to operate out of the Budget Terminal firm binding and, if so, for how long?&nbsp; In other words, can&nbsp;they change their decision on short notice and move back to the main terminals?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B>&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong asked about the benefits of operating out of the Budget Terminal.&nbsp; There are both direct and indirect benefits.&nbsp; In terms of the direct benefits, as I mentioned earlier on, it is the doing away of the use of the aerobridges at the Budget Terminal which is the main cost savings.&nbsp; The other cost savings would come in the form of lower <p align=left>Column: 2305</p>aircraft towing cost and also ground handling charges.&nbsp; The simple and no-frills design will enable users to save on overheads, like the office rentals and check-in counter charges.&nbsp;Our estimate is that users can actually save as much as 50% of the cost that they would otherwise incur at the main terminals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other indirect benefit would, of&nbsp;course, be the shorter waiting times for aircraft push-back for take off as well as disembarkation.&nbsp; Here, passengers would also benefit from the lower passenger service charge of $7 as opposed to $15 at the main terminals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong's second question about whether Tiger Airways' commitment is firm and binding on&nbsp;the Budget Terminal,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;say that both Tiger Airways and CAAS are committed to making the Terminal a success.&nbsp; There is no minimum tenure but, given the cost considerations, we trust that Tiger Airways would continue to operate out of the Budget Terminal for as long as it is commercially viable.&nbsp; At the same time, other airlines are also welcome to use the Budget Terminal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the Minister of State has said that the concept of the budget air travel is still an evolving one and the other airports&nbsp;are just observing how this business is going to evolve.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (for the Minister for Transport):</B> Sir, the periodic vehicle inspection regime was introduced in the early 1980s to ensure that vehicles on our roads meet roadworthiness standards, thus minimising vehicle breakdowns and road accidents.&nbsp; Vehicles which are not roadworthy can be a potential hazard to road users.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our inspection standards and frequency of inspection are generally comparable with practices adopted in&nbsp;Japan and Europe.&nbsp; For a private car, the first inspection is required when the car reaches three years.&nbsp; Subsequently, it is to be inspected once every two years until the tenth year, after which it must be inspected once a year.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2307</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our well-maintained roads and general improvement in the quality of vehicles and their maintenance, our inspection statistics showed that there are still cars which fail the first inspection.&nbsp; From <st1:date Month=\"1\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2004\">1st January 2004</st1:date> to <st1:date Month=\"12\" Day=\"31\" Year=\"2005\">31st December 2005</st1:date>, 7,202 (or more than 6%) of three-year-old cars failed their periodic inspection at the first attempt.&nbsp; These cars mostly fail the wheel alignment and brake tests.&nbsp; This means that they may need more steering effort or longer braking distances, which in turn increases the risk of accidents.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some vehicle parts, such as tyres and brake pads, are also subject to frequent wear and tear and may be worn out within three years.&nbsp; They could be crucial to vehicle roadworthiness if not checked and replaced.&nbsp; Hence, it is still necessary to inspect cars that are less than&nbsp;five years old.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As such, I am just wondering whether the existing policy will indeed be relevant.&nbsp; Also, taking into consideration that the prices of motor vehicles are coming down drastically, there will be more possibility of car owners actually renewing their cars even before five years are up.&nbsp;

As for the trend of cars being replaced on a shorter scale, again, these are personal and commercial decisions made by both the consumers and the dealers.&nbsp; Government's duty again remains that of ensuring that cars are roadworthy.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That Act provides for various forms of assistance to foreign countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This law was enacted before the events of September 11, 2001. Post-911, it has become increasingly urgent for countries to cooperate closely, especially in the combatting of&nbsp;terrorism.&nbsp; In the light of our experience and also in the light of this changing international climate after 911, we have concluded that we need to make some amendments to the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present Act can be said to have an element of rigidity. For example, certain forms of assistance which involve coercive measures, such as search warrants in aid of a criminal prosecution in a foreign country, can only be provided if there already exists a mutual legal assistance treaty between us and the requesting country. In practice, however,&nbsp;it is desirable to have some flexibility. The purpose of this Bill, therefore,&nbsp;is to amend the Act to allow us to render such assistance, on a case-by-case basis, to countries where there is no such mutual legal assistance treaty.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is provided for in clause 3 of the Bill, which provides for discretionary assistance in the absence of a treaty, but only if the requesting country gives an undertaking&nbsp;of reciprocity,&nbsp;ie, that it will comply&nbsp;with a future request by Singapore for similar assistance involving a similar offence.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2312</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill makes consequential amendments to the definition section of the Act to allow Singapore to enforce a foreign confiscation order from a country with which we do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty. This will be at our discretion, and it will not be applied retrospectively to confiscation orders made before the changes are brought into force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me hasten to assure the House, Sir, that this does not mean that we will not in future&nbsp;enter into&nbsp;mutual legal assistance treaties with other countries. We will still do so in specific cases, for example, where a bilateral treaty will give both sides greater assurance of mutual assistance. However, what this amendment seeks to achieve&nbsp;is to avoid a situation where we cannot give timely assistance to a non-treaty country which needs our assistance to prosecute a terrorist or a major international criminal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present approach can also be a disadvantage for us when we seek assistance from a country with whom we do not have a treaty, if they invoke the reciprocity principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Safeguards</I>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to&nbsp;assure the House that there are many safeguards in the Act&nbsp;to prevent abuse and to prevent unnecessary intrusion by foreign authorities into the privacy of our businesses and individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the current safeguards which are in the Act will continue to apply. For example, there is a general power to decline a request if it is not in the public interest to provide the assistance. Our own investigations will take priority and no assistance will be rendered if it could prejudice a local investigation or local&nbsp;criminal proceeding. Assistance will also be declined if a&nbsp; foreign authority is&nbsp; merely \"fishing\" for information that <p align=left>Column: 2313</p>might be of use against a person or a corporation. The Act has many safeguards against such \"fishing expeditions\". For example, section 22 of the Act, on production orders, requires that a foreign request must be made for a particular item or document. Assistance will also be declined if there are substantial grounds to believe that the accused is being targeted by the foreign country on account of his race, religion, sex, ethnic origin, nationality or political opinions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In April last year, the Government announced its decision to invite proposals to develop two Integrated Resorts with casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; This was debated over four days in Parliament during which many Members&nbsp;shared their concerns on gambling, stated their positions and made suggestions concerning casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; The Integrated Resorts was also a subject of vigorous public debate for over a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2314</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many Singaporeans who supported the proposal for the Integrated Resorts as they will enhance Singapore's tourism appeal vis-a-vis other popular tourist destinations that are also reinventing themselves.&nbsp; The Integrated Resorts would provide a strong boost to our economy and create many new jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; At the same time, having casinos could mean more people gambling and getting themselves - and their families - into trouble.&nbsp; Concerns were expressed that crimes, such as loan sharking, money laundering and prostitution, could increase and tarnish Singapore's reputation as a clean, safe and secure place and that casino gambling could also erode values such as thrift and hard work that have underpinned Singapore's success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after much debate and deliberation, we decided to act in favour of what would bring more benefit to Singapore and Singaporeans, and to allow the Integrated Resorts to be built.&nbsp; At the same time, we will also take measures to minimise the undesirable effects of casino gambling, and put in appropriate safeguards to deter vulnerable persons from the casino.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Casino Control Bill that I have introduced in Parliament is an important milestone in the process of bringing the Integrated Resorts project to fruition.&nbsp; The Bill seeks to put in place a legislative and regulatory framework that will help provide an environment where the Integrated Resorts can succeed and thrive, while enabling us to keep social and law and order problems under control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Learning from other leading jurisdictions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April last year, my Ministry has been studying the regulatory practices of well-known casino jurisdictions in other parts of the world.&nbsp; We studied multi-casino jurisdictions, such as Nevada and <p align=left>Column: 2315</p>New Jersey in the United States; and single-casino jurisdictions, such as New South Wales and Victoria in Australia and Macau.&nbsp; I visited casinos and regulators in Las Vegas and Macau to appreciate first hand the challenges and issues of regulating an industry as complex and dynamic as casinos.&nbsp; Apart from Las Vegas and Macau, my officials also visited casino regulators and operators in New Jersey in the US and New South Wales and Victoria in Australia to learn from their experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues and concerns across the various jurisdictions are not very different from ours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each jurisdiction has chosen a slightly different approach to tackle specific issues, depending on its historical and legislative context, as well as the resources available.&nbsp; For instance, in the United States, the general practice is to divide the regulatory powers into a Commission, which sets the policies and collects licensing fees, and a separate Casino Control Board, to enforce the policies and conduct investigations.&nbsp; This reflects their preference for checks and balances.&nbsp; In Australia, however, the regulatory powers are centralised in a single agency for effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having studied more about the best practices across these jurisdictions, we have adapted the best practices and sound policies appropriate to our unique requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; We aim to position our Integrated Resorts with the best in the world.&nbsp; Our regulatory standards, therefore,&nbsp;must necessarily be on par with theirs too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public consultation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry put up the draft Casino Control Bill for public consultation from 17th October to 11th November last year.&nbsp; Members of the public were invited to <p align=left>Column: 2316</p>give their comments on the Bill.&nbsp; Potential investors of our integrated resorts were also invited to provide feedback on the Bill.&nbsp; We also sent the draft to regulators in the United&nbsp;States and Australia for comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public feedback</I><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise has generated useful feedback from Singaporeans.&nbsp; Most of it pertained to specific social safeguards, such as the entry levy and exclusion orders, and&nbsp;not on crime, corruption or other law and order concerns traditionally associated with casinos.&nbsp; This suggests that there is public confidence in the Government's ability to manage the potential law and order issues associated with casinos.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that while some members of the public suggested that we should remove or lower the entry levy, there were others who supported the entry levy, and even suggested raising it higher and incorporating more entry criteria!&nbsp; On balance, we decided to keep the entry levy fees at $100 per 24 hours and $2,000 per year, as we felt that it should be adequate to discourage Singaporeans from picking up the gambling habit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response to the public feedback was posted on the Feedback Unit's e-Consultation portal on 13th&nbsp;December last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Investors' feedback</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the investors' concerns were whether the various requirements were overly stringent and could affect their ability to raise funds or run their businesses effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took into account the investors' feedback and suggestions, and decided to relax a number of operational controls on the casino operator that may interfere with their day-to-day operations.&nbsp; They <p align=left>Column: 2317</p>include the requirement for the casino operator to seek the regulator's approval for the casino layout, and the powers to stipulate a minimum number or a maximum number of a particular type of game in the casino.&nbsp; The Casino Regulatory Authority's&nbsp; power to limit the number of hours that a casino can operate has also been</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In response to feedback, the Government also decided to enact the Casino Control Bill early so that potential investors will have a better idea of our regulatory regime and what they can&nbsp;and cannot do.&nbsp; In addition, through this Casino Control Bill, the Government is committed to a number of measures to provide greater certainty and support to investors of our Integrated Resorts.&nbsp; This is because the Integrated Resorts require heavy investments.&nbsp; We want them to succeed after the investors have committed to spend billions of dollars on the projects.&nbsp; For instance, the casino tax rates will remain unchanged for 15 years.&nbsp; The two casino operators will also enjoy an exclusivity period of 10 years.&nbsp; During this period, no new casinos will be allowed.&nbsp; The lease of the land on which the Integrated Resorts will be sited will be for 60 years and they will be allowed to operate a casino for 30 years, subject to the suitability of the casino operator to run them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that all these measures will provide greater certainty and enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of our Integrated Resorts and the investors' ability to raise funds for the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Foreign regulators' feedback</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to seeking comments from the public and the investors, we also <p align=left>Column: 2318</p>sought comments from casino regulators in other jurisdictions.&nbsp; The objective was to tap their experience and expertise as established casino regulators, to help address our own lack of experience in managing the casino industry.&nbsp; I am happy to say that their feedback has been very encouraging.&nbsp; Many cited the Bill as a thorough and sound legal basis to launch a comprehensive regulatory framework.&nbsp; Here, I would like to commend all the officers who have put in a great deal of effort in coming up with the provisions of this Bill.&nbsp; I note that&nbsp;they have covered practically all bases and provided enough provisions in the law to allow for flexibility as well as to allow for regulations to be made so that, as we implement these regulations, we will be able to adapt from our own experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Casino Control Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Casino Control Bill will provide the legislative and regulatory framework to help to ensure that criminal activities associated with casino operation do not take root in Singapore, and to mitigate the potential negative consequences of the casinos on our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill comprises 13 Parts and deals with the key aspects of regulating casinos in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has three broad objectives.&nbsp; First, the Bill will provide for the setting up of the casino regulator with the necessary powers to enforce the regulatory regime.&nbsp; Second, the Bill will set out a regulatory regime for the casino operator and related business parties.&nbsp; Third, the Bill will provide for a number of social safeguards to protect vulnerable persons from casino gaming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now describe the key aspects of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2319</p><p><I>Casino Regulatory Authority</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The Statutory Board</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 5 to 17 of the Bill will establish a new statutory board called the Casino Regulatory Authority, or CRA for short.&nbsp; The CRA will be supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a statutory board, the CRA shall be subject to the same governance standards as other statutory boards of the Government.&nbsp; In particular, the CRA shall submit to the Minister for Home Affairs its annual report and audited financial statements, which will&nbsp;be presented to Parliament.&nbsp; The Board of the CRA shall comprise a Chairman and 4&nbsp;to 16 members, approved by the Minister for Home Affairs.&nbsp; For transparency and accountability, board members are also required by law to declare their interest in any particular project or transaction concerning the CRA or the casino operator.&nbsp; These are provided for under clauses 18 to 39 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CRA will be formed 12 to 18 months before the first casino starts operation.&nbsp; The casino operator can take this lead time to seek approval from CRA and apply for the licences for various aspects of the casino that are required under the Casino Control Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Regulatory powers of the CRA</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now touch on the regulatory powers of the CRA.&nbsp; The CRA will be responsible for enforcing the provisions&nbsp;in the Casino Control Bill and regulating the casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; This is inconsistent with overseas practices, where dedicated bodies are set up to regulate casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the CRA shall have powers to investigate and probe into the casino <p align=left>Column: 2320</p>operator's background, accounts and business links (under clauses 10, 15, 46, 63 and 85).&nbsp; The investigations, which are very thorough and often involve the key directors and management, are standard practice in many well-known overseas casino or gaming jurisdictions.&nbsp; Such comprehensive investigations are also being conducted for the bidders of our Integrated Resorts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I visited the Nevada Gaming Commission in November last year, the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission and members of the Nevada Gaming Control Board advised me to carefully&nbsp;scrutinise the potential casino operators, as it is only through the selection of suitable casino operators with the right people to manage its operations would we be able to keep criminals and fraudsters away from our casinos.&nbsp; This is the reason why we, like other leading gaming jurisdictions, conduct probity investigations on potential investors and operators of our Integrated Resorts.&nbsp; Such checks will ensure that only suitable persons are given the licence to operate casinos in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been exposed to similar investigations in other casino jurisdictions, foreign bidders of our Integrated Resorts project have cooperated fully with us in the process.&nbsp; However, such comprehensive investigations are new to Singapore companies taking part in the Request for Proposal for the Integrated Resort.&nbsp; Their management may not be used to disclosing so much information about themselves and their companies.&nbsp; These practices are nonetheless necessary to ensure that our probity checks measure up to the standards of respected casino jurisdictions in other parts of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any company that wants to be involved in the casino industry in Singapore is expected to cooperate with the CRA and be subject to probity investigation.&nbsp; This principle of having the <p align=left>Column: 2321</p>industry demonstrate that they can meet the regulatory objectives before being allowed to operate a casino is succinctly captured by the phrase \"Compliance first, Commerce later\", a policy adopted by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the CRA is empowered to deal with offences typically committed in casinos.&nbsp; Cheating, forgery, tampering with gaming equipment or attempting to exploit the casino chips as an alternative currency are regarded as attempts to undermine the integrity of the casinos' operations, which will lead to fines or imprisonment or both.&nbsp; These are covered under clauses 171 to 188.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from investigative and enforcement powers, CRA is also the approving authority for the various aspects of casino operations.&nbsp; It will oversee the casinos' system of internal controls and accounting procedures, such as those listed&nbsp;in&nbsp;clause 139.&nbsp; It can also receive and investigate complaints from the casino patrons about unfair gaming.&nbsp; Clauses 111 to 114 of the Bill empower the CRA to adjudicate disputes between the casino operators and their patrons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, various clauses of the Bill empower the CRA to collect licensing fees and to take disciplinary action against casino operators, key employees and other parties licensed under the Casino Control Bill for any regulatory breaches.&nbsp; Disciplinary actions include fines or the variation, suspension and even termination of their licences.&nbsp; The Authority shall also work closely with the Police to manage the law and order situation in and around the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Casino operator, related parties and its operations</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the regulatory requirements of the Bill and explain their policy intent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2322</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many crimes in the casinos are committed by persons who collude with casino employees.&nbsp; They range from less sophisticated crimes, such as cheating at tables, to high-level schemes between the casino and criminal syndicates to, say, launder money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the integrity of our casinos is not compromised from within, clauses 43 to 56 and clauses 79 to 98 of the Bill will require the casino operators and their key employees to be licensed by the CRA.&nbsp; No one shall be allowed to work or hold key positions within the casino without a licence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only suitable persons will be licensed to operate the casino or to work in positions of influence in the casino.&nbsp; The considerations of&nbsp; \"suitability\" include whether the applicant is of good repute with regard to character, honesty and integrity, and has the ability to work in the capacity that he or she has applied for.&nbsp; For applicants who wish to operate the casino, the applicant must also demonstrate that he has a sound and stable financial background.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having obtained the licence, the licensee must remain suitable throughout the validity period of the licence.&nbsp; Where there are material changes to the licensee's situation that could affect his suitability, the licensee is required to report these changes promptly to the CRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organising junkets is a specialised and highly lucrative business that is important to the casinos' viability.&nbsp; Junket promoters, or junket operators,&nbsp;bring in high-rollers to the casinos and provide them with VIP treatment in return for a commission.&nbsp; Junket promoters function as the middle man between the casinos and the high-rollers, buying and encashing chips on behalf of the high rollers.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2323</p>Because of the large sums of money transacted between the junket promoters, their clients and the casinos, it is important that junket promoters are well-regulated to ensure that the junkets do not provide a cover for crime syndicates to engage in criminal activities, such as money laundering.&nbsp; For this reason,&nbsp;clause 110 of the Bill shall require junket operators to be licensed before they can work with our casinos.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Shareholders and Business Associates</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the casino operators and their employees, shareholders and business associates can also be possible avenues that criminals can exploit to infiltrate casino operations.&nbsp; Hence, in Nevada,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;share transfers of any amount would require approval from the regulators if the casino is privately held.&nbsp; For publicly listed casinos, regulators are to be kept informed of shareholders who become 5% stakeholders and approval is required for stakes of 10% or more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, under the Casino Control Bill, the regulator will be empowered&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>to exercise control over such relationships.&nbsp; Shareholders taking a 5%, 12% or 20% stake in the casino operator shall be required under clauses 64 to 71 of the Bill to seek approval from the Minister for Home Affairs.&nbsp; Such shareholder controls are to ensure that persons owning significant stakes in the casino operators are suitable persons to be associated with our casinos, and to ensure that there is no undesirable influence over the casino operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The casino operator's relationship with other business partners will also be closely monitored.&nbsp; Under clauses 72 to 78 of the Bill, the casino operator shall be required to seek approval for contracts of significant monetary value or that provide <p align=left>Column: 2324</p>critical services to the casino, such as security and surveillance.&nbsp; Such contracts are called \"controlled contracts\".&nbsp; The objective is to ensure that there is no undesirable influence on the integrity of the casino operations through these contracts.&nbsp; Details of the controlled contract regime, such as the exact value or the specific types of services that will render a contract as controlled, will be prescribed in the subsidiary legislation to be enacted under the Casino Control Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Operations of the casinos and its internal controls</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, casinos are highly complex operations.&nbsp; The gaming devices that a casino employs, such as jackpot machines, are highly technical and specialised, and are increasing in sophistication.&nbsp; Clauses 57 and 99 to 105 of the Bill will enable the CRA to supervise casino operations, including requiring the casino operators to seek approval before a game can be conducted in the casino.&nbsp; CRA will study the game rules closely to ensure that the odds are not overly skewed in the casino operator's favour and the integrity of the game is not easily compromised.&nbsp; Jackpot machines shall also be closely regulated for the same reason.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prostitution and illegal money lending are often associated with casinos.&nbsp; Clause 129 of the Bill will also require the casino operator to take all appropriate steps to ensure that such activities do not take place within its premises.&nbsp; The police and the CRA will work closely with the operators to keep the casinos clean from such undesirable activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge amounts of cash and chips are constantly flowing within and through the casinos.&nbsp; Strict internal controls and procedures are therefore needed to protect the integrity of the games and the financial transactions against cheats and other criminals.&nbsp; We shall require the <p align=left>Column: 2325</p>casino operator to put in place a robust anti-money laundering programme which shall include know-your-customer due-diligence, mandatory reporting for transactions above $10,000, record keeping for transactions above $5,000, mandatory&nbsp;reporting of suspicious transactions, and anti-money laundering training for the employees.&nbsp; These measures, which will be prescribed in the subsidiary legislation under the&nbsp;Act, are in line with international anti-money laundering standards set by the Financial Action Task Force and other leading gaming jurisdictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 138 to 145 of the Bill will also require the casino operator to seek approval for its system of internal controls and administrative and accounting procedures.&nbsp; Of importance would be a comprehensive surveillance system throughout the casino to facilitate the monitoring of operations and the gathering of evidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Social safeguards</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have described thus&nbsp;far are measures to deal with the law and order aspects of the casino operations.&nbsp; Another key objective of the Casino Control Bill is to minimise the potential for casinos to cause harm to minors, vulnerable persons and society at large.&nbsp; The Bill shall enact the social safeguards that the Government had announced in Parliament in April last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Problem gambling</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding the appropriate social safeguards, we also need to understand how casual and recreational gambling can lead to problem gambling.&nbsp; In a study conducted by the Commercial Affairs Department on prison inmates who had committed commercial crimes, the interviewees revealed that they got hooked on gambling after experiencing the <p align=left>Column: 2326</p>euphoric feeling when they won.&nbsp; Others gambled to escape stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they develop into problem gamblers, they get so consumed by it that they lose interest in everything else, and their family and work lives are affected.&nbsp; They also lie habitually about their gambling habits and conceal their losses.&nbsp; When they lose, they tend to chase after the losses and end up in deeper trouble.&nbsp; Many eventually turn to crime to finance their habits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this study, there seems to be a point beyond which some casual and recreational gamblers&nbsp;begin to slide down the slippery slope to become compulsive and pathological gamblers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, vital that those who choose to gamble are aware of the vital signs, so that they can seek help before their habits get out of control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Entry levy</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To discourage locals from developing into problem gamblers, clause 116 of the Bill shall require the casino operator to collect an entry levy from Singapore citizens and permanent residents for every consecutive 24 hours in the casinos or $2,000 for an annual membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy will also underscore the message that gambling is an expense and not a means to get rich.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Credit and loss limits</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem gamblers have a tendency to gamble beyond what they can afford.&nbsp; As a safeguard, clause 106 of the Bill shall require casino operators to provide information about games to patrons as well as a loss limit system that casino patrons may choose to use.&nbsp; This will give patrons an option to commit upfront to a loss amount that they can afford in their gaming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2327</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 108 of the Bill shall prohibit casino and junket operators from extending credit to Singapore citizens and permanent residents, unless they maintain a credit balance of at least $100,000 with the casino operator at the start of their gaming which would qualify them as premium players.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automated teller machines (ATMs) shall be prohibited within the casinos under clause 109 of the Bill so that patrons will not have easy access to their savings accounts to gamble continuously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Minors</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minors are also another potentially vulnerable group who may fall prey to the glamour of the casino, without realising the possible dangers of gambling.&nbsp; Clauses 130 to 137 of the Bill will prohibit persons below the age of 21 years from entering the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Exclusion orders</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Casino Control Bill, various bodies shall be empowered to impose exclusion orders.&nbsp; These are statutory orders that will prohibit a member of the public from entering the casino.&nbsp; The objective is to ensure that certain persons who may be more vulnerable or are undesirable from stepping into the casino.&nbsp; Clauses 121 and 122 of the Bill will empower the CRA to impose exclusion orders in general.&nbsp; In addition, the Commissioner of Police can also impose exclusion orders on criminals or suspected criminals, to deny them the use of casinos as a place to perpetrate their illegal activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members may be aware, the National Council on Problem Gambling was launched on 31st August 2005 and&nbsp;has started its public awareness campaigns on problem gambling as well <p align=left>Column: 2328</p>as specific initiatives to help problem gamblers.&nbsp; The Council will also be empowered under clauses 155 to 168 of the Bill to issue exclusion orders to stop problem gamblers from entering the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family members of the problem gamblers can also apply to the Council for exclusion orders to be imposed on their loved ones.&nbsp; The Council may also issue the order on persons who have poor credit records or are on social assistance programmes.&nbsp; This process will help prevent problem gamblers from getting deeper into trouble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who have a gambling problem can also make a personal application to be excluded. &nbsp;These voluntary exclusion orders can be lodged with the casino operators under clause 120 or with the National Council on Problem Gambling under clause 165.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an additional service to help those who know that they are vulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CRA will work closely with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to ensure that the social safeguards, such as entry levy collection and the exclusion orders, are effectively implemented in the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Casino tax and enforceability of gaming contracts</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the casino tax and enforceability of the gaming contracts.&nbsp; Clauses 146 to 152 of the Bill shall provide for tax rates of 5% and 15% to be levied on the gross gaming revenue from premium players and non-premium players respectively.&nbsp; This is on top of the existing corporate and goods and services taxes that the casino operators shall have to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the tax rates will remain unchanged for 15 years as part of our commitment to the Integrated Resorts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2329</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 202 of the Bill shall also make a related amendment to the Income Tax Act to impose a withholding tax of 3% of the commissions earned by the junket promoters.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately,&nbsp;clause 40 of the Bill will allow gambling contracts made in casinos enforceable in courts.&nbsp; To put it simply, the winner can take the loser to court, if the loser does not pay his dues.&nbsp; Similarly, credit extended by the casino and licensed junket promoters to patrons for the purpose of casino gaming in a manner that complies with the Casino Control Bill&nbsp;is also enforceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is needed to provide assurance to our casino operators that they will have legal recourse to recover their earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For consistency, clause 201 of the Bill will make a related amendment to the Civil Law Act to also make enforceable, gambling contracts between patrons and other legal gambling operators in Singapore, such as the Singapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club.&nbsp; However, unlike the casino and junket operators, gambling contracts issued by the other legal operators, ie,&nbsp;Pools and&nbsp;Turf Club,&nbsp;that are based on credit shall continue to be unenforceable.&nbsp; This means that if Pools or Turf Club decides to take bets based on credit and if the patron subsequently defaults in payment, Pools or Turf Club will not be able to take the patron to court to reclaim the payment.&nbsp; This is to ensure that the local gambling operators do not promote gambling to</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The probity&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2331</p>and integrity of an establishment, such as a casino, are the sum total of the people who run it and who are employed in it.&nbsp; The provisions in this Bill which deal with the licensing of employees, in particular, are comprehensive and I would commend and support those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to focus on some of the other provisions that the Bill is directed at.&nbsp; It would not have escaped notice that right in the middle of the word \"casino\", are the three little alphabets, \"sin\", and it is symptomatic&nbsp;of casino operations that embedded in the heart of it is the potential for social ills or social risk.&nbsp; Clearly, the draft Bill is aimed at dealing with some of these potential social ills.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ones that I wanted to focus on are prostitution and illegal money-lending, the provisions dealing with the barring of entry of minors, the casino and money-laundering. Where there are casinos, there is money. Where there is the lure of money, certain types of activities tend to gravitate towards it, and solicitation for prostitution and illegal money-laundering are such potential problems. This is dealt with under clause 129 of the Bill which provides that the casino operator shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that there is no solicitation for prostitution or any other immoral purpose or unlicensed money-lending by its employees, patrons or other persons within the casino.&nbsp; My question is whether these provisions go far enough and whether they are sufficient because casino operators, the very nature of their business is to make money from the casino activities. They have a commercial purpose and objective.&nbsp; Law enforcement and law and order is not their primary function nor is it their primary focus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at the Bill, this is the only provision that deals with that. And right in the heart of more than over 100 <p align=left>Column: 2332</p>provisions, it is just this one clause that deals with solicitation for prostitution and illegal money-lending.&nbsp; And the words are that \"the casino operator is to take appropriate steps\" which sound somewhat vague. What does it mean that they have to take appropriate steps?&nbsp; If the legislative framework is being supplemented by a holistic framework outside of the legislation, in other words, working with various social agencies or working with the Police outside of a legislative context, then perhaps that would help to address the problem.&nbsp; But if everything hinges purely on clause 129, then it does not appear to me that that is sufficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect that I wanted to touch is&nbsp;that of minors.&nbsp; Minors are obviously vulnerable persons.&nbsp; Being exposed to casino activities is a source of concern.&nbsp; This potential problem has been recognised in the Bill and is dealt with in clauses&nbsp;130 to 137 of the Bill.&nbsp; I would be interested to know though how this&nbsp;would actually work in practice and whether the provisions are sufficient to keep the minors out.&nbsp; I notice that what the Bill requires the casino operator to do is to obtain acceptable proof of age from the minors.&nbsp; At the moment, acceptable proof of age does not have a specific definition.&nbsp; I am curious to know why it&nbsp; is not specified that the proof that is required would be proof of identification with photograph, such as identity cards (ICs) for Singaporeans or passport in the case of foreigners.&nbsp; The way the provision is structured is that it is a defence to disciplinary action if it is shown that the minor was 16 and above and produced acceptable proof of age.&nbsp; If&nbsp;proof of age was an ID document which has a birth date, then he or she should not have been let in at all unless the ID was forged or tampered with.&nbsp; If&nbsp;it was forged or tampered with,&nbsp;then of course, I can understand&nbsp;that would constitute a defence. But the way the Bill is drafted suggests that the acceptable proof of age that is required may not be definitive or <p align=left>Column: 2333</p>conclusive which then leaves room for the casino operator to have to make a judgment call on the age of the young person and they may possibly make the wrong judgment call and let the minor in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point relates to clause&nbsp;133(4) of the Bill which provides that the minors can be removed from the casino premises by the person in charge of the casino, an agent of the casino operator or a casino employee by using no more&nbsp;force than is reasonably necessary.&nbsp; When dealing with minors and young people, the question is whether this should be left to the casino operator and its agents or whether this is something on which the Police's assistance should be enlisted to help remove the minor. Dealing with minors is an emotive issue and I can see here that there will be potential for allegations of assault and battery, ruffling up the minors and bearing in mind that the minors in question may not just be Singaporean young people, but also foreigners and there is also the PR aspect of it.&nbsp; The question is whether it may not be better to have official enforcement agency to deal with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that any minor who enters or remains on a casino premises will be guilty of an offence.&nbsp; I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether this would be a seizable offence, bearing in mind that some of the minors who contravene the \"no entry\" rule might be foreigners. We should ensure that our enforcement process is quick and relatively painless.&nbsp; I am not, in any way, suggesting that Singaporean minors should be treated differently from foreigners but it is just that when you are dealing with minors, and particularly having regard to the fact that the Integrated Resorts are intended to be a tourist attraction, the potential for a negative PR when dealing with minors is there and is something that we should be mindful of when we do our enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2334</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point on which I would like some further clarifications from the Minister is whether the provisions of the draft Bill really have sufficient safeguards against money-laundering or at least enabling the authorities to detect money-laundering activities.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.

Member who spoke before me that the Casino Control Bill is a very comprehensive one.&nbsp; Singaporeans would appreciate the effort put into drafting this Bill but&nbsp;there are still some points worth reconsidering.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 2(2) of the Bill empowers the Minister to designate a parcel of land as&nbsp;a casino site&nbsp;for a specified period.&nbsp; In clause 4(1), the Minister may revoke the order for the designated site or cancel the casino licence in the public interest but only after consultation with the CRA.&nbsp; I suggest that to be consistent, the Minister ought to exercise his power under clause 2(2), ie, when designating the casino site and determining the licence period, he should do so after consultation with the CRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill does not spell out the qualifications of the CRA's Chairman and <p align=left>Column: 2335</p>members.&nbsp; However, looking at its functions and responsibilities, one would expect them to be highly respected members of society with special knowledge, experience and concern for matters relating to casino operations.&nbsp; Members of similar authorities in other jurisdictions are highly eminent persons, such as senior lawyers, ex-senior police officers and senior public servants.&nbsp; There is no doubt that their counsel will help the Minister decide to revoke the order for the designated site or cancel a casino licence, and all the more their counsel will assist the Minister to decide on designating a casino site and the period of licence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the CRA cannot now be consulted for the first proposed casino site since the site has already been designated, although there is no CRA as yet.&nbsp; As such, we cannot have a clause in the Bill which compels the Minister to do something which is impossible to do. However, I urge&nbsp;that in future cases, the Minister would so designate a casino site or decide on the period of licence only after consultation with the CRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under clause 51(2), the CRA may redefine the boundaries of the casino premises within the casino site from time to time.&nbsp; I appreciate that this empowerment to the CRA is necessary for operational expediency.&nbsp; However, I wish to urge the Minister to ensure that the redefined premises do conform to the guidelines laid down by this Parliament. &nbsp;In the case of the Integrated Resort, to the best of my recollection, the floor area of the casino shall not exceed 5% of the total floor area of the IR&nbsp; -&nbsp; I stand corrected on this.&nbsp; Another consideration was that the location of the casino shall not make it overwhelm the whole character of the IR.&nbsp; I recall these assurances were made in Parliament and therefore should be reminded to the CRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2336</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;clause 116(1) provides that for any Singapore citizen or permanent resident to enter into the casino, he or she shall pay a $100 levy for every period of 24 hours or $2,000 for a valid annual membership.&nbsp; $2,000 annual fee translates into less than $7 a day.&nbsp; While we do not expect more than a very rare few to stay at the casino for every day of the year, the annual membership may be abused if it is transferable, because it would be so cheap and thus undermines the purpose of this provision.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether the annual membership is transferable?&nbsp; If it is intended to be transferable, then I suggest that it is a loophole to be plugged.&nbsp; If it is not transferable, then may I ask the Minister to have this clearly stated so as to remove all doubts?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on exclusion orders, clause 120 provides that the casino operator may issue an exclusion order.&nbsp; Clause 121 provides that the CRA may issue&nbsp;exclusion orders.&nbsp; Clause 122 provides that the Commissioner of Police may make an exclusion order.&nbsp; Under clauses 157 to 168, the proposed National Council on Problem Gambling can issue family exclusion orders via its Committee of Assessors.&nbsp; The concept of the family exclusion order is to enable a family member who is affected by a person's gambling to apply to the Council for an exclusion order against that person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the idea underlying exclusion orders seems to be either to protect the casino operator or to minimise&nbsp;worsening of a problem gambling situation on the affected person or to reduce adverse effects on his family members, or a combination of any of them.&nbsp; This is laudable and, where possible, should be enhanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this light, may I suggest that the courts too be given powers to issue exclusion orders.&nbsp; It is quite possible that in family or maintenance cases, the courts <p align=left>Column: 2337</p>are furnished with sufficient evidence to suggest that certain persons, usually an income provider,&nbsp;ought to be issued with an exclusion order.&nbsp; Further, the court in criminal cases too may be furnished with such evidence to suggest that an exclusion order is appropriate for rehabilitative purposes as part of a sentence package.&nbsp; Such powers, if given to the courts, would save the need for a separate inquiry to be taken either by the Commissioner of Police, the CRA or the Council.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand this proposal may call for a fairly substantial amount of review of the current powers of our courts, but I believe it is worth the effort and if we need more time to do it, so be it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I now touch on the&nbsp;National Council of Problem Gambling (NCPG) and the provision on the Bill relating to the NCPG.&nbsp; The idea of having this council is good.&nbsp; It shows concern and foresight.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Bill provides for a Council with very limited scope.&nbsp; Only to hear applications for and issue family exclusion orders, to the extent that the other parts of the Bill are very comprehensive, this is somewhat of a let-down.&nbsp; I believe the Council should also have funding and, amongst its functions, to conduct educational programmes to prevent problem gambling and treatment programmes for problem gambling cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research done in Indiana, USA, shows that \"young children, adolescents and senior citizens are especially vulnerable to the glamourising of gambling and should be educated about potential problem gambling.\"&nbsp; It also noted that Indiana was not confronting the early stages of problem gambling behaviour development among its citizens.&nbsp; It also noted that as gambling activities have become more available, the number of people developing a problem gambling behaviour has increased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2338</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that the Government has done at least some research on problem gambling before deciding to go on with the IR project.&nbsp; The nature of problem gambling has to be well understood, how&nbsp; best to prevent it and how best to treat those afflicted with it.&nbsp; We have already debated at length on the possible havoc that problem gambling can cause to individuals and their families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not think we should wait for the first victim before we start preventive education or establish treatment facilities.&nbsp; The research on problem gambling should continue and intensify.&nbsp; Suitable educational campaigns aimed at vulnerable sectors of society, as identified by our research, can begin.&nbsp; In other words, while the Bill says a lot about keeping vulnerable persons such as adolescents out, not much is said about how not to lure them in.&nbsp; So I think this is an area which we all should look at.&nbsp; We should start to set up treatment facilities and train counsellors to treat problem and pathological gamblers, as such counsellors require much time to be trained.&nbsp; Sir, the Bill is silent on these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 155 which is supposed to spell out the functions of the Council does not actually spell it out.&nbsp; Instead it says that the function of the Council is to do all things as required in that part of the Bill which deals mainly, if not solely, with family exclusion orders.&nbsp; I urge the Minister to widen the scope of the Council to include research, preventive education and treatment.&nbsp; If this can be done immediately without legislative amendment, let it be done as such for it should not wait.&nbsp; We owe it to Singaporeans to ensure that the ill effects of having a casino in our midst stay at the very minimum, and we must also clearly state our resolve to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I also take this opportunity to ask the Minister on the casino tax?&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to confirm that the casino tax is above and beyond the usual corporate tax imposed on all businesses?&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2339</p>I believe that many Singaporeans will want to know to what extent the Government allows or gives incentives, if at all, to casino operators.&nbsp; To ensure its success, Sir, much resources will have to be allocated to the CRA including its Committee, inspectors, staff, auditors, assets and operations.&nbsp; Similar resources are also needed for the National Council and even more if it is to include the expanded scope that I have proposed, and this does not include additional resources such as extra law enforcement officers to patrol the casino vicinity and to enforce the provisions of the Bill.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether he can assure this House that such extra resources shall be funded by the revenue from the IR and not result in the net depletion of our resources elsewhere?&nbsp; Can the Minister also assure this House that he will keep a close watch and not allow a situation where the State has to sustain the casino control operations to the detriment of its other obligations elsewhere?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.26 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, during the debate in April 2005, I spoke to convey the Workers' Party's position opposing the setting up of casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; The position has not changed.&nbsp; However, given the decision to go ahead has been made, we have looked at the provisions of the Bill with a view to seeing how it can perhaps be tightened to ensure that our casinos do not become&nbsp;magnets&nbsp;of vice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We note that our suggestions that the Bill should contain provisions to establish an oversight agency to&nbsp;investigate into the background of the casino operators and staff and ensure fair play in the gaming process are found in the present Bill.&nbsp; However, Sir, there are still some gaps which, we believe, need to be tightened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2340</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the independence of the regulatory body&nbsp;from the casino operators.&nbsp; We note that the Bill establishes the Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore to regulate the casino operators.&nbsp; As mentioned in my speech last year, this Authority must be absolutely independent of the casino operators.&nbsp; The members chosen to sit on the Casino Regulatory Authority should have no dealings whatsoever with the casino business, whether as suppliers, contracting partners or others.&nbsp; Therefore, we are most concerned with the Schedule to the Bill which lays down the procedure for the Casino Regulatory Authority to meet and make decisions.&nbsp; In particular, paragraph 12 of the Schedule actually contemplates a situation that when a member of the Casino Regulatory Authority has had an interest in a contract which a casino operator intends to enter, it requires him to disclose his interest to the meeting and then not take part in the deliberations.&nbsp; But it seems from paragraph 12, sub-paragraph 3, that he will be recorded as being present in the meeting even if he cannot vote or has withdrawn from that meeting.&nbsp; Our objection is that we should ensure that no person appointed to the Casino Regulatory Authority should ever be in that sort of position.&nbsp; And if&nbsp;it were to emerge later, that person should step down from the Casino Regulatory Authority altogether.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Can the Minister not appoint persons who have no possibility of transacting with the casino operator?&nbsp; Or is our pool of possible appointees so limited?&nbsp; Even if the interested member does not vote, the issue is his influence over the regulatory authority, by virtue of the working relationship built up over time.&nbsp; Surely, we cannot undermine the independence of the Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore as the watchdog for the casino industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related note, Sir, the composition of the National Council on Problem Gambling should similarly not have <p align=left>Column: 2341</p>persons connected with the casino business. As we know, problem gambling is a collateral damage from having casinos, and the persons dealing with problem gambling should face problem gambling honestly and robustly and not be concerned about preserving the casino's reputation or gaming revenues.&nbsp; We would suggest that the Bill incorporate provisions to specify that persons connected in any way with transacting with the casino operators should not be eligible&nbsp; to be members of the Casino Regulatory Authority or National Council on Problem Gambling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, I would like to look at Part VI on Casino Operations.&nbsp; Clauses 51 and 99 provide that the boundary and layout of the casino will be determined by the regulatory authority.&nbsp; However, the Minister's promise that the floor space of a casino would not exceed 5% of the area of the Integrated Resort is not legislated.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; By legislating this, it will ensure that any deviations would have to come to Parliament for scrutiny to ensure that the non-gaming component of an IR is maintained.&nbsp;Similarly, clause 103 states that the regulatory authority will stipulate the maximum number of gaming machines in the casino.&nbsp; Why is the number also not legislated for Parliament to monitor?&nbsp; Under clause 106's&nbsp;caption, \"Assistance to Patrons\", where information on gaming rules, etc, is&nbsp;stated, should we not also assist patrons to get help if they are problem gamblers? The casino operator should be required to train casino employees to identify potential problem gamblers who&nbsp;should&nbsp;have access to on site&nbsp;counselling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the entry levy collected, Sir, clause 116(2) provides that all entry levies be handed to the Singapore Totalisator Board to be used for public, social or charitable purposes.&nbsp; Why does the Minister not consider it appropriate to direct all levies collected to the National Council on Problem Gambling for <p align=left>Column: 2342</p>expenditure on its programmes and case management?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;in respect of Part X,&nbsp;National Council on Problem Gambling, under clause 165, NCPG can by itself decide to exclude from casinos those who are on social assistance or under bankruptcy proceedings or have poor credit records.&nbsp; It appears that these exclusion orders will be made on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; I would like to clarify with&nbsp;the Minister why he does not consider automatic exclusions, eg, for those who are bankrupts.&nbsp; Would this not be administratively easier and more objective?&nbsp; Or is the Minister contemplating that some bankrupts will be barred but some can be allowed to gamble?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 182 provides that any inspector under the Bill is to have police powers for investigations.&nbsp; Therefore, these inspectors are not police officers but they will be given these police powers.&nbsp; If so, who are these inspectors and will they undergo the necessary police training to ensure that they know how to exercise these powers?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I wonder if the Minister is not going to amend the Common Gaming Houses Act.&nbsp; I understand that, currently, under section 4 of the Act, it&nbsp;makes running a common gaming house an offence.&nbsp; Section 21 of the Act even allows the Minister to banish from Singapore any foreigner who is a professional gambler.&nbsp; But now, Sir, we want these professional gamblers here to patronise the casinos!</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.35 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, if the thickness of this voluminous 153-page document is any indication, the control measures and social safeguards promulgated in the Casino Control Bill must be detailed and comprehensive.&nbsp; As the Minister has noted, they have been <p align=left>Column: 2343</p>drafted after extensive studies of relevant legislation from many other countries.&nbsp; In fact, as testimony of the immense effort that has been put into the drafting of the Bill, the Bill is unique as it even has cross-references of some of&nbsp;its clauses to the relevant sections in the Victoria Casino Control Act 1991, the Nevada Statutes, the New South Wales Act 1992 and the South Australian Problem Gambling Family Protection Orders Act 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, until the casinos are up and running in three to four years' time, it would be difficult to determine if these measures fit our own social circumstances, and are enough to serve their purpose of, firstly, minimising the social ills that may arise; and, secondly, keeping out criminal infiltration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am of the view that both the Government and the public should keep an open mind, and the Government will no doubt closely monitor the effectiveness and consequences of these control measures with a view to refining them based on the experience gleaned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three particular control measures that I would like to highlight,&nbsp; balancing between the need for toughness to minimise social ills and allowing the casino to operate profitably.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the&nbsp;entry levy.&nbsp; Clause 116(1) imposes an entry levy of $100 per day or $2,000 per annum on local patrons of the casinos.&nbsp; Clause 116(3) further states that a casino operator shall not refund, remit or reimburse, directly or indirectly, any entry levy paid or payable.&nbsp; This is to safeguard against any operators who may try to circumvent this rule by, say, returning the equivalent of the levy in the form of perks or chips.&nbsp; The Government has explained that the purpose of the entry levy is to discourage Singaporeans from casual gambling&nbsp; and to remind them <p align=left>Column: 2344</p>that gambling is an expense - not a means to earn a living, much less a way to get rich.&nbsp; This levy, which I understand to be unique to Singapore, has attracted much debate and controversy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-casino camp has called for an increase of this levy to ensure that it is high enough to discourage the poor and vulnerable from frequent visits of the casinos.&nbsp;Yet, others have called for the levy to be scrapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; One argument against the levy - a moral hazard one - stems&nbsp; from the belief that&nbsp; it could lead to perverse selection where the gambling addicts who ought to be kept out do not mind paying the \"small\" sum of $100 a day or $2,000 a year, which is equivalent to about&nbsp;$5.50 a day,&nbsp; in the hope of winning big.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in their desire to satisfy their addiction, they forget the principle that the house always ultimately wins. Yet others feel that the entry fee will simply encourage some gamblers to go overseas or simply stay longer to recoup their upfront \"investment\", defeating the very purpose of the levy in the first place.&nbsp; There are also those who questioned why Singaporean gamblers should be discriminated against.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this respect, &nbsp;I support such discrimination, since it will conceivably narrow the road to perdition for Singaporeans whose gambling habits may ruin their families.&nbsp; But, ultimately, only time will tell what effects the entry levy will produce.&nbsp; However, on balance, it would seem that the current proposed levy would help to discourage the casual and impulse gamblers and/or prevent them from becoming habitual gamblers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an illustration - and I would like to clarify that I learn this strictly from my grassroots -&nbsp;presently there are operators who bring Singaporeans to a casino operating on a cruise ship stationed some 20 minutes by ferry from Batam.&nbsp; To <p align=left>Column: 2345</p>patronise this casino, you take a&nbsp; 45-minute ferry to Batam and another 20-minute ferry from Batam to the casino.&nbsp; The cost of the ferry to and from Batam is $41.50 and those aged 55 years and above get a discount of $20 when they visit the casino.&nbsp; I am told that many elderly Singaporeans regularly visit this casino, despite the inconvenience of getting there as they are enticed by the prospect of making some money with a very low upfront initial investment and also as a means of passing their time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $20 discount on the cost of the ferry offered by this casino is clear evidence that the elderly make up a sizeable number of the casino's clientele.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This implies that any financial deterrent to keep out casual gamblers will have to be fairly substantial in order to work.&nbsp; It will have to be more than, say, the cost of the ferry which is $41.50 or $21.50 with the discount, coupled with the inconvenience caused by the casino's relative inaccessibility.&nbsp; One can well&nbsp;imagine that without the $100 entry levy, many elderly and even housewives with time on their hands may be tempted to frequent the upcoming casinos which are easily accessible.&nbsp; Hence, to me, doing away with the levy is certainly not an option that we can afford to take.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is imperative that the Government closely monitors the impact of the entry levy on local gamblers as against Singaporeans who travel to other places in the region to gamble.&nbsp; Also, for the entry levy to be effective, it is crucial that the Government keeps a close tab to ensure that this is not circumvented by the casino operators.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, I would like to ask the Minister what disciplinary action would the casino operator be liable for under clause 116(6) if he contravenes clause 116(3) by devising some ingenious way to circumvent the levy, as this has not been explicitly stipulated in the Bill. I <p align=left>Column: 2346</p>would urge for strong penalties if this law is flouted as we should adopt an uncompromising stance against the casino operators to ensure the effectiveness of the social safeguards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, clause 116(4) stipulates that the levy may be varied by the Minister after 10 years from the date of gazette.&nbsp; While I appreciate that this fixing of the duration for the amount helps the operator in their budgeting and assessment of the potential catchment, there could be policy weakness issues downstream.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if subsequently it is found that the current proposed levy does not achieve the purpose for which it was intended, whether the levy can be varied before the expiration of the stipulated 10 years.&nbsp; If not, would we be tying our own hands with regard to the effectiveness of the social safeguards imposed by this clause?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, there has also&nbsp;been speculation in the press that with only four potential bidders for the Marina IR site, these bidders would have stronger bargaining power and may push for the scrapping of the $100 a day or $2,000 a year levy on local gamblers. I would like to ask the Minister to comment on this possibility to assure Singaporeans that it does not succumb to economic pressure and thereby compromise on the social safeguards.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on&nbsp;exclusion orders.&nbsp; In addition to third party exclusion orders, which bar those on state-funded social assistance programmes, bankrupts and those who have bankruptcy petitions filed against them as well as people with poor credit records, the Bill also provides for family exclusion orders. I understand that apart from South Australia, we are the only jurisdiction to have such a family exclusion clause which prevents family members from entering the casinos.&nbsp; Whilst I support this move to minimise the&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2347</p>untold distress and harm that a gambling addict may bring upon his family members, like many others, I am wary of the possible violence against family members that may be perpetuated by the member against which the exclusion order applies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst clause 163(2)(a) states that the Committee of Assessors under the National Council on Problem Gambling may refer the respondent for counselling or rehabilitation, it does not necessarily follow that the respondent would oblige.&nbsp; If the respondent does not oblige, what recourse, if any, does the Council have?&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if the family ties with the respondent become acrimonious because of the family exclusion order and the respondent turns violent, what protection and assistance would the family members have?&nbsp;&nbsp; How can the police effectively and speedily render assistance to such cases?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister how effective has this family exclusion order been in South Australia which provided the model for our own family exclusion orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did this exclusion order lead to a discernible increase in family violence in their case and how were family members who suffered from such resulting violence protected and assisted?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on&nbsp;loan shark and vice activities.&nbsp; There is also considerable concern from the public on the potential increase in loan shark and vice activities.&nbsp; Clause 129 of the Bill requires the casino operator to take the appropriate steps to ensure that criminal activities, such as soliciting with a view towards prostitution and loan sharking, do not take place within the casino premises.&nbsp; Presumably, this is in accordance with international standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am told that there are always loan sharks hanging around even <p align=left>Column: 2348</p>at the children's playgrounds at Genting and that</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>there are many prostitutes milling around even in high-end casinos in Las Vegas.&nbsp; Whilst the Government has enacted tougher laws against loan sharks, I would like to ask the Minister what added measures would be taken to minimise criminal and vice activities that may arise due to the existence of these casinos.&nbsp; For instance, how would it ensure that we do not have similar situations of loan sharks and prostitutes milling in the areas around the casinos and control the increase of such criminal activities?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp; I note that the Government has carried out thorough studies and sought extensive consultation before finalising this Bill.&nbsp; Rightly so, because as we embark on this journey, fraught with economic opportunity but also with social ills, we need the experience of other countries to guide us in our own formulation. But there are still many concerns about the effectiveness of the control measures&nbsp;and,&nbsp;in reality, we can never be sure that these controls, no matter how stringent, would do the trick.&nbsp;In this regard, I urge the Government to monitor the situation carefully and remain open to fine-tuning the safeguards and policies where it is warranted.&nbsp; Of course, this should also take into account the fact that they must not be too onerous and unfair to the casino operators who have embarked on the project with a given understanding and set of parameters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.48 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Casino Control Bill.&nbsp; Sir, this is an important Bill as it sets out regulations to ensure that casinos in the Singapore Integrated Resorts will function in an acceptable manner and in accordance with the law, thereby, main<p align=left>Column: 2349</p>taining the transparent and well-regulated environment of Singapore and thus Singapore's credibility.&nbsp; This Bill will also stipulate requirements to lessen the harm to minors, vulnerable persons and society at large.&nbsp; I especially welcome the safeguards provided in this Bill to tackle gambling addiction.&nbsp; This reinforces the Government's assurance to address such recognised social ills of casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I applaud the Government in taking the most conservative stand, in&nbsp;comparison to other countries,&nbsp;for&nbsp;pegging&nbsp;the minimum age&nbsp;for gambling at 21, and for imposing entry charges for locals at $100 for 24-hour access and $2,000 for one-year membership, as well as for disallowing operators to reimburse or remit any of such fees.&nbsp; Sir, this will send a clear signal that entering a casino is not as casual as entering any other resort but is a consciously deliberated choice.&nbsp; This will address the issue concerning introduction of gambling to unintended groups who may attribute and even blame the IRs for their exposure to gambling as a result of a chance visit.&nbsp; Furthermore, in view of the IRs being in near proximity&nbsp;to residential and business areas here, these measures may minimise the social ills and low work productivity by deterring housewives, workers and business executives from gambling in these places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research indicates that youths are at a greater risk to become pathological gamblers.&nbsp; Research also hints that genetic or role model factors may play a role in predisposing&nbsp;youths to pathological gambling and the earlier a person begins to gamble, the more likely he or she is to become a pathological gambler.&nbsp; Sir, youths are not only more vulnerable to gambling problems, they can also suffer the harshest consequences of pathological gambling.&nbsp; The US Commission relates many cases of child abuse and neglect that include cases of children locked in cars for extended periods of time while <p align=left>Column: 2350</p>their parents gambled as a result of pathological gambling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill provides for the establishment of the Casino Regulatory Authority, or CRA.&nbsp; The question is whether CRA will ensure strict scrutiny by casino operators to screen entry and identity of minors.&nbsp; Spot checks should be conducted by the CRA within and at the entrances of casinos to prevent the entry of minors.&nbsp; Parents should be educated on the prohibition of minors into casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is no mention of the opening hours of casinos in this Bill.&nbsp; According to the Deputy Prime Minister who spoke earlier,&nbsp;this part of opening hours was removed from the original draft.&nbsp; But the 24-hour operation is detrimental to gamblers.&nbsp; The longer a gambler is engaged in continuous gambling, the more likely he will lose due to wrong decisions as a result of fatigue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will CRA require casinos here to have distinct sections for local punters and foreigners and the local sections should observe restricted hours of operation similar to what is being done in some casinos overseas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to minimise the risks of a gambler losing more money than he can afford, thereby&nbsp;leading to desperate situations, will CRA consider setting gaming &nbsp;table limits in the section for locals?&nbsp; Should CRA also consider restricting certain age quota to certain games and differentiating games of chance and games of skill (as games of skill may disadvantage the unskilled players) and should CRA also require casinos to educate patrons on the two classifications of games so as to create awareness to the aptitude required and the win-loss probability of certain games?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some casinos train their staff to detect and refer clients showing signs of problem gambling.&nbsp; Should CRA recom<p align=left>Column: 2351</p>mend this to casino operators here and disseminate information about problem and pathological gambling on their premises?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Singapore, about 2.1% or 55,000 gamblers are at risk of being addicts and another 2% are probable problem gamblers, meaning they are also starting to show problems.&nbsp; Problem gambling is a progressive behavioural disorder in which an individual has a psychological uncontrollable preoccupation and urge to gamble.&nbsp; The&nbsp;principal features are emotional dependence on gambling, loss of control and interference with normal functions.&nbsp; The first step&nbsp;to finding a solution is to recognise the problem.&nbsp; Surprisingly, problem gamblers are very often the last ones to realise what is happening to them in spite of mounting consequences and increasing emotional impact.&nbsp; The longer the gambling problem continues, the more severe the impact will be.&nbsp; For this reason, problem gamblers need professional counselling as early as possible to address the many negative consequences of the gambling&nbsp;behaviour.&nbsp; The challenge is to identify the problem gamblers before they become desperate.&nbsp; Co-workers are often the first line of defence as gambling and gambling-related activities are frequently carried out during work hours; the workplace may be used as a shield to hide.&nbsp; May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the National Council on Problem Gambling, or NCPG, will accept referrals for exclusion orders, apart from family members, from people, such as co-workers, doctors and social workers?&nbsp; NCPG can then appoint Committees of Assessors to determine the merits of each referral and to determine whether to classify the referred cases&nbsp;as problem gamblers or potential problem gamblers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will NCPG provide for not only the problem gamblers but also&nbsp;the preventive <p align=left>Column: 2352</p>measures to detect the 2% probable problem gamblers?&nbsp; NCPG may recommend limited hours of entry instead of a complete ban for those identified potential problem gamblers.&nbsp; Identification may be through win-loss records collated by electronic identification process.&nbsp; Those in this list whose win-loss ratios are at dangerous levels may be either refused entry or recommended for counselling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is necessary to make the availability of counselling&nbsp;and specialised treatment services widely known and these establishments must be comprehensive and conveniently accessible and attainable.&nbsp; Can NCPG provide help processes and systems to be made to problem gamblers through workplaces on application of self-exclusion, greater media exposure, Internet website and advertisements?&nbsp; Sir, it is worth noting that help centres are also best set up within casinos so that immediate help can be administered.&nbsp; Administration of help avenues should be made simple and under one umbrella so as to prevent confusion as to which agency to approach when in need.&nbsp; Will the Deputy Prime Minister consider providing gambling counselling free of charge?&nbsp; Will he allow the levy collected for casino entry to provide for such service and treatment for problem gamblers?&nbsp; The therapists and other professionals in this field agree that problem or pathological gambling, because of its novelty and the lack of information about its root cause, is a difficult disorder to treat.&nbsp; Its treatment is costly and time-consuming; there is no quick fix and there is a high degree of recurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister how would the Casino Regulatory Authority, or CRA, enforce the non-entry rule for excluders?&nbsp; How would the casino identify those in the self-exclusion list?&nbsp; Will CRA also require gaming operators to remove self-excluders from all mailing lists?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2353</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the importance of public education on gambling cannot be over-emphasised.&nbsp; This should also include information about the actual odds of winning.&nbsp; Providing objective, reliable public information about gambling addiction can help problem gamblers and their families see the problem as a mental health disorder rather than a financial problem or a character weakness.&nbsp; Recognising their behaviours as warning signs, and discovering that they are not alone, can go a long way towards helping them&nbsp;break through the denial and fear that have kept them from reaching out for help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 102 of this Bill deals with the approval of gaming equipment but it does not stipulate the frequency of the checks on gaming equipment in casinos.&nbsp; Will random checks be conducted regularly by CRA on the approved machines?&nbsp; Will CRA require casinos to make known gaming rules to all patrons and to be transparent about dealing in games of skill and chance?&nbsp; In Nevada's Audit Division for Gaming Control Board, electronic engineers and computer programmers look into the source code for slot machines to ensure randomness of results and machine's \"returns\" are in line with payback limits of the casino control Act. Nevada has a 75% payback limit for slot machines.&nbsp; Will there be any stipulation on this area by CRA?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, enforcing the honesty and integrity of legalised casino gambling games requires an ability to prosecute those&nbsp;who engage in activities that constitute illegal offences, for example, cheating at games.&nbsp; Cheating can involve the patrons of a casino as well as individuals involved in operations, such as dealers.&nbsp; Attention must be paid to assuring that appropriate and clearly enforceable criminal statutes exist to prosecute gambling cheaters.&nbsp; Public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, practices, associations and activities <p align=left>Column: 2354</p>related to the operation of licensed gambling establishments.&nbsp; Codes of conduct and ethical issues should be spelt out, for example,</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Mr Ong Kian Min</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the bids for the two integrated resorts have presented us with an enticing array of goodies.&nbsp; We have been offered the expertise of leading convention marketeers to bring in more tourists for meetings, incentive tours, conventions and trade exhibitions, star celebrity chefs for the ultimate dining experience, and exciting international shows and entertainment.&nbsp; Not forgetting that the soul of every memorable city is nourished not by fine food alone but&nbsp;its appreciation of art and history, there has also been a mention of world-famous museums, such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Pompidou Centre, being housed in the Marina IR.&nbsp; With the rosy prospects of job creation, a steady growth in the construction and tourism industries, all expected to stem from the construction and operation of integrated resorts of this scale, we have some very exciting times ahead of us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow us to take full advantage of the benefits that these integrated resorts bring and yet at the same time minimise the negative consequences of gambling, it is important that we have a legislative and <p align=left>Column: 2355</p>regulatory framework that provides a means for the Government to ensure that the casinos that come with these resorts are regulated in accordance with the values of our Singaporean culture and lend an international appeal to the integrated resorts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have visited a number of such casino resorts in other countries,&nbsp;not to participate in gambling but merely to look-see&nbsp;whatever attractions they have to offer and to enjoy the fine dining restaurants and entertainment outlets that are available there.&nbsp; Much has been said, both inside and outside this House, but I would&nbsp;like to raise just a few points in relation to the operation and consequences of casinos, some of them based on my observation of what went on in other cities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I think the image of casino gambling will change as time goes by.&nbsp; Way back in the 1950s and much of the 60s, buying 4-D was a clandestine and illegal activity conducted in whispers behind closed doors.&nbsp; People who engaged in 4-D did so secretly through illegal runners, bookies and underground betting syndicates.&nbsp; Since the legalisation of lottery in 1968 when Singapore Pools was set up and, later, in the 1980s, with the setting up of legal 4-D outlets in every part of Singapore, our citizens have gradually come to accept lottery games&nbsp;and, now, even football betting games, as part of everyday life.&nbsp; Over time, the stigma once associated with lottery games has disappeared.&nbsp; Many people have no qualms about being seen standing in long queues.&nbsp; In fact, the $10-million <I>Hong Bao</I> Draw last Friday saw week-long queues at all betting outlets.&nbsp; At weddings and birthdays, enthusiastic guests can be seen circulating among the tables, openly offering to buy numbers for their friends and relatives, and people buy numbers for fun and for luck.&nbsp; I am sure, with the <p align=left>Column: 2356</p>legalisation of casinos, casino gambling will gradually gain more acceptance in time to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, perception can influence and determine a person's habits in a big way, especially of the young.&nbsp; Let us take smoking as an example.&nbsp; In spite of our high duties imposed on cigarettes in Singapore which make smoking an expensive habit, we can still see many fashionably-dressed young people walking down Orchard Road or hanging out at the latest nightspots with a cigarette resting between their fingers.&nbsp; From their point of view, it is hip to smoke.&nbsp; I wonder if the high cost of smoking in Singapore has given an elitist edge to smoking.&nbsp; Compared with Thailand, where cigarettes are much cheaper,&nbsp;one sees a different picture.&nbsp; My brother-in-law, ie, my&nbsp;wife's brother,&nbsp;works as a general manager in Thailand in an environment with 50 blue-collar workers.&nbsp; I was very surprised when he told me that he was the only one who smokes.&nbsp; The local Thai workers, although blue-collar, have no interest in smoking, partly because they do not view it as a glamorous activity.&nbsp; What is \"cool\",&nbsp;what is \"hip\" and what is&nbsp;\"<I>lame</I>\"&nbsp;is really a matter of perception among our peers.&nbsp; In an effort to restrict access to the casino by imposing a levy on Singapore citizens and permanent residents, are we inadvertently elevating the public perception of the casino, making it appear even more exclusive and tempting than it is?&nbsp; We must take extra care to strike the right balance between cautioning our people against the ills of gambling addiction on the one hand, and promoting the casino as an attraction on the other.&nbsp; The solution would be to educate the public on the dangers of gambling addiction.&nbsp; Where the young are concerned, we should learn and know their ways of thinking, ie, what is \"cool\" and what is \"<I>lame</I>\" in their eyes, so that we can reach across to them at the right level in their formative years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2357</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Sir, relates to foreigners who are here to pursue their education.&nbsp; During a recent holiday to Melbourne, Australia, my family and I stayed at the Crown Entertainment Complex for the wide array of facilities they have there.&nbsp; We walked through the thriving casino in the complex and were perturbed at the number of young male Asian students taking their chances at the gaming tables, while their bored girl friends hung on listlessly by their sides.&nbsp; I immediately commented to my wife that we should think twice about sending our children on their own to study in any city with a casino.&nbsp; I am, therefore, concerned that having two casinos will affect or be contradictory to our quest to be an international education hub.&nbsp; Singapore is being promoted as a global education centre offering a diverse range of educational choices that include tertiary education, corporate training, private commercial and specialty schools.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, we are building new casinos where adults can try a hand at their luck in glitzy surroundings.&nbsp; I am concerned that these casinos will spell a dangerous distraction and addiction to our foreign students and damage our image.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the situation that foreign students are in.&nbsp; A good number will be over 21 years of age and, therefore, eligible for entry into the casino.&nbsp; They are in possession of substantial sums of money for their education and living expenses.&nbsp; As many overseas graduates know, the heady combination of having money and being away from parental guidance or, to many students, interference, is one that requires responsibility and discipline on the part of the students.&nbsp; Some of these students may lose their control when they step into the casino.&nbsp; How can we ensure that foreign students who come here to study do not fritter away their time in the casino and gamble away the funds that their well-meaning parents have given to them for their education?&nbsp; Can parents of foreign <p align=left>Column: 2358</p>students apply to exclude their children from entering the casino?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Sir, relates to the proximity and connectivity of the casino premises to the other areas of the integrated resort.&nbsp; Will the IR design render it necessary or more convenient to walk through the casino premises to gain access to the other areas of the resort?&nbsp; In some resorts in Las Vegas, visitors to other parts of the resort, such as restaurants, shops or even the washrooms, have to walk through the jackpot machines and gaming tables to access these outlets.&nbsp; For some restaurants, patrons waiting for their tables have to stand in line at the fringe of the gaming area, having full view of the excitement and activities that go on in there.&nbsp; Even if there are alternative routes available to avoid the casino premises, artful planning can ensure that the easiest access brings one close to or into the attractions of the casino.&nbsp; What is our planning policy?&nbsp; Will it be mandatory for the casino and gaming activities to be separated and distanced from the main thoroughfares?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, Sir, I am concerned about illegal or immoral activities that may take place just outside the casino premises.&nbsp; The Bill stipulates certain proper and regulated conduct within the casino premises.&nbsp; For example, there must be no soliciting for the purpose of prostitution.&nbsp; However, even as we control the casino operators and compel them to take appropriate steps, we must be mindful of the goings-on that can take place right at the doorstep of the casino.&nbsp; On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I found some stretches of the main streets of Las Vegas lined with pushy touts dishing out calling cards with scantily-dressed women offering escort services, striptease acts and so on.&nbsp; Every available space along the main thoroughfares, eg,&nbsp;on telephone booths, junction boxes, lamp-posts, etc, was stuck with colourful stickers and cards offering sexual and other personal <p align=left>Column: 2359</p>services.&nbsp; Even though many Las Vegas hotels hold themselves out to be family resorts that cater to all, the sleaze in some parts of the main streets of Las Vegas shouts a different message, and a message to the contrary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know what measures will be taken to prevent such a troubling scenario from developing just outside the casino premises.&nbsp; I believe the Government's response will be that such a situation can be controlled in Singapore.&nbsp; We just have to look at the stickers that are plastered on the walls of our HDB lifts by&nbsp;contractors, such as window&nbsp;and aluminium contractors, and the junk mail in our letter boxes to see that it is not easy to contain these exuberant touts and their advertising and marketing efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, Sir, is on illegal money-lending, eg, loan sharks, and the methods they use to enforce repayment of their loans.&nbsp; We have all come across cases where the loansharks supposedly lent money to a former occupier of a flat and then harassing the new owner to repay the money that he never borrowed, or the borrower might have used someone else's identity card and gave the loan shark the wrong address.&nbsp; These loan sharks seek to embarrass and damage the property of whoever is occupying the flat since they cannot locate the actual borrower.&nbsp; I think this is tantamount to extortion, where one demands money from an innocent person who has no previous dealings with the lender.&nbsp; I hope the police will classify and treat such loan shark activities accordingly as serious criminal offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, Sir, I would like to touch on clause 109 of the Bill which provides that ATM machines are not allowed within the casino premises.&nbsp; But if we look at our existing private clubs that have a jackpot room, chances are that we will find an ATM machine just a few steps away <p align=left>Column: 2360</p>outside the jackpot room.&nbsp; Similarly, I will not be surprised to find ATM machines within a chip's throw of the casino premises.&nbsp; This makes a mockery of the proposed clause 109.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now move on to my final point, ie, how to play and win at roulette, baccarat and blackjack.&nbsp; Will these become the subject of <I>kopitiam</I> conversations once the casino gets going?&nbsp; In some hotels I have come across abroad, gaming lessons form part of the free in-house entertainment on TV, available in the privacy of one's room at the lightest touch of the remote control button.&nbsp; The entry of casinos in Singapore will bring with it a natural curiosity and desire on the part of our people to learn more about gaming.&nbsp; In addition to the TV programmes I mentioned, we may also be inundated with tips and gaming instructions from the Internet, newspapers, magazines and advertisements brought right into the comforts of our home.&nbsp; Should there be control over such publicity that teaches the rules of the casino games and how to play them?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a difficult question to answer.&nbsp; On the one hand, such instruction is educational.&nbsp; So, if one is going to gamble, one better know the rules of the game and learn how to play it.&nbsp; On the other hand, knowledge can be tempting and entice people who would otherwise not have been interested to give it a try and to actually try their hand in a casino.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Dr Geh Min</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, my first point is on the entry levy.&nbsp; We have heard from the Minister that this has excited a lot of comments and public feedback and&nbsp;we have&nbsp;also heard a lot from other&nbsp;Members of the House.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2361</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I agree with Members and&nbsp;the members of the public who feel that it is difficult to finetune the sum of the levy, I support the purpose of the levy, which is to discourage Singaporeans from gambling and to emphasise the fact that gambling is an expense and not an easy way to get rich.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to query clause 116(1)(b).&nbsp; If the purpose of the levy is really to deter Singaporeans from gambling, how does the $2,000 for a valid annual membership work?&nbsp; Does that give 20 times the protection that a $100 levy gives, or does it protect you for the whole year?&nbsp; I would argue that, in fact, that is the opposite.&nbsp; It is equivalent to a \"jumble discount package\". &nbsp;In fact, anyone&nbsp;who does simple sums will find that if you have already put down $2,000 downpayment, to make your money worthwhile, you have to gamble at least 20 times, or at least 20 days.&nbsp; And if you do more than that, you get a bargain.&nbsp; It is like these club or hotel memberships for a year&nbsp;where you pay a membership fee and&nbsp;you get discounts&nbsp;at all the hotel and F&amp;B outlets.&nbsp; So you have a captive clientele.&nbsp; I would therefore ask the Minister to delete this $2,000 annual membership because&nbsp;it is working in contradiction to the whole purpose of the levy, as stated by the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also like to comment on clause 116(4).&nbsp; As has been recognised, the levy and the sum that have been fixed&nbsp;are an experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain it for 10 years without any possibility of varying it is, I believe, an unnecessarily inflexible mechanism. I think we could finetune it.&nbsp; I do not think we should be lowering it, but&nbsp;we should have a provision to be able to increase it, if necessary, within 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should now like to move on to the casino tax under&nbsp;Part IX,&nbsp;clause 146.&nbsp; My question here is: why is there a tax differential between premium players and other players and why is the tax differential so high?&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have not travelled around the world and studied <p align=left>Column: 2362</p>casinos,&nbsp;I gathered that most casino operators would prefer premium players if they can get them because they are better value for their investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it seems to me that it would be a rational practice for a casino operator to target premium players. So why do we have to offer a tax incentive and such a large differential -&nbsp;a 10% differential - to get them to do what they might or would do under ordinary business practices?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we have other measures in place, like the $100 levy and&nbsp;the restriction on casino floor space.&nbsp; These would again reinforce the preference for premium players. We are also giving these two IRs,&nbsp;prime or premier locations,&nbsp;which would therefore attract premium players.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that some other countries do give tax incentives to premium players, but only tax incentives to premium players coming from Asian countries. We are part of Asia, so we are geographically already advantaged.&nbsp; I do not think, like the US or Australia, we have to give a tax incentive to get premium players to come here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern again for this differential between premium players and other players is that not only might this be unnecessary, but it might&nbsp;even be a subsidy to the casino operators for something that they would do under normal business practices.&nbsp; So it&nbsp;might actually be a dangerous thing to have this tax differential.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distinction between premium players and other players is quite clearly stated in the Bill, but the distinction in real life is not so clear.&nbsp; Not everyone who can have a deposit of $100,000 can necessarily afford to lose that sum of money.&nbsp; I think there is a grey scale.&nbsp; And if we give such a big tax differential, might we not be giving an incentive to casino operators to create more premium players than actually exist?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2363</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would, of course, lead them down the slippery slope to problem gambling because, as we know, problem gamblers start off small. They not only start frequenting the casinos more often, but they also start putting larger and larger sums of money.&nbsp; And if the casino has a tax incentive to push them into putting larger sums of money, this is&nbsp;potentially a very dangerous practice that might result in this tax differential.&nbsp; So I would therefore urge that there should be no distinction. The tax should be 15% for both premium and other players.&nbsp; If for some reason or other, a tax differential is required, can I suggest that we should consider one between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans?&nbsp; This would give the necessary incentives for casino operators to encourage tourists rather than locals and, therefore, boost the tourist sector which is, after all, what was cited as one of the main reasons for having Integrated Resorts with casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; This seems to me, therefore, to be a far more logical way of having a tax differential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the tender documents have stated that the main weightage (40%) of the selection process would be based on whether an Integrated Resort can attract tourists.&nbsp; But how can you design an Integrated Resort that will attract tourists rather than locals?&nbsp; How can you make the distinction?&nbsp; If I were on the judging panel, I think I would be hard-pressed to make a distinction because Singaporeans are tourists too. They will be visitors to the casino. This is something new for those who have not gone abroad to a casino.&nbsp; And anything that is attractive enough to bring tourists here will certainly be attractive enough to attract Singaporeans who do not have, for example, to pay the additional airfare.&nbsp; Even if you have more hotels in the Integrated Resorts - where existing hotels in Singapore have already been giving special packages -&nbsp;a lot of their <p align=left>Column: 2364</p>clientele are Singaporeans, particularly in the F&amp;B outlets. So although I applaud this 40% weightage in the tenders, I do not think this will succeed in making the Integrated Resorts attract more tourists than Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to do that is to have a tax differential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you may argue that it seems discriminatory and why should we treat our visitors so badly.&nbsp; The answer to that is that Singaporeans, because they live here, are \"sitting ducks\", whereas tourists, who come&nbsp;for a short period, will be moving targets. Therefore, unless there is a tax differential, I, as a casino operator, will be tempted to target a \"sitting duck\", ie,&nbsp;a Singaporean.&nbsp; It is easier to get Singaporeans&nbsp;to the casino.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I share the concerns of the Member - Mr Ong Kian&nbsp;Min - who spoke before me about foreign students and other long-term visitors.&nbsp; May I say that&nbsp;they&nbsp;-&nbsp;anyone who comes to Singapore for some other reason, particularly students -&nbsp;should be in the category that is not a tourist category.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to move on to clause&nbsp;146(3).&nbsp; It says here that, \"The rates of tax specified in subsection (2) shall not be increased for a period of 15 years.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, \"increase\" means it could be unchanged or decreased, but I gather from what the Minister said that it will be unchanged.&nbsp; He did not say anything about decrease. Can I therefore suggest that \"unchanged\" should be substituted with \"shall be unchanged for a period of 15 years\", if that is what is intended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, still on the casino tax,&nbsp;clause 146(6), the formula for taxation, ie, \"gaming revenue\", is A minus B minus C.&nbsp;&nbsp;B is defined as the amount paid out as winnings on all games by the casino operator.&nbsp; I am told that casino operators can have a very creative definition&nbsp;for the amount paid out&nbsp;as winnings. They could include commitments,&nbsp;rebates or other <p align=left>Column: 2365</p>incentives.&nbsp;Could this be spelt out more clearly?&nbsp; I cannot find a definition of it in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to move on to the casino tax and use of the levy&nbsp;to benefit society.&nbsp; Let me commend the Bill here for stating that the levy will go to the Singapore Totalisator Board.&nbsp; However, it does not mention anything about where the casino tax will go or, at least, whether a portion of the casino tax will be used for social and charitable causes.&nbsp; I think that we should have a percentage of the casino tax, with perhaps a specified minimum sum, that also goes to benefit society directly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the levy may go to the Singapore Totalisator Board, I believe that on the principle of \"polluter pays\",&nbsp;a section of the levy, or the casino tax or both, should fund problem gambling, and the expenses of the National Council on Problem Gambling and the Casino Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; These have been touched on by other Members, so I will not go into details on these except to support them in this proposal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also, in conclusion, like to talk on the National Council on Problem Gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other Members before me, I am very disturbed to see that most of it, if not all, deal with the family exclusion order and there is really nothing in this Bill that seems to provide for an overall integrated strategy to deal with the problem of pathological gambling. The Minister has said that the National Council has done research and has already started on public education.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very commendable, but it would be good if we knew that they would sustain this, that the Bill provides for this, and that there is an organisation which will research, track, prevent and, if possible, remedy problem gambling.&nbsp; Above all, we need an integrated approach to the social problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, may I say that I know that having casinos here in Singapore is a&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2366</p>new development.&nbsp; We are learning as we go along.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Bill serves many purposes,</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann</B>:&nbsp; Sir, at the onset, I should declare my interest in the debate on the Casino Control Bill as I am currently advising a client on the tender for the Integrated Resort project.&nbsp; With your indulgence, Sir, I seek permission to proceed, as what I am about to say relates to the wider concerns of Singaporeans on the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Bill before us broadly reflects the general policy enunciated earlier by the Government on the establishment and operation of casinos in Singapore; one where we try to strike a balance between the social excesses of licensed gambling in our society and the need to develop Singapore as a world-class attraction for tourism and conventions.&nbsp; By and large, I should add that the Bill faithfully represents the broad compass that Parliament has debated and agreed to last year on the setting up of casinos here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill, therefore, represents the nuts and bolts of the policy and the framework by which Government's intent is carried out.&nbsp; It would not serve any purpose for us now to revisit the merits of having casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; Rather, we should look at the particular details in the Bill.&nbsp; In this regard, I have three specific comments to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the potential insidious expansion of casino activities under the Bill.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2367</p>Currently, the Bill provides specifically that there should only be two casinos in Singapore.&nbsp; The number of casinos, it seems, is specifically limited by a statute of Parliament rather than by administrative <I>fiat</I> through an exercise of executive power.&nbsp; This seems rather unusual, as in many countries, the decision of whether or not to license the setting up of a casino is left very much to the regulator rather than to the legislators.&nbsp; In our case, clause 41 of the Bill specifically provides that the regulator shall not allow more than two casinos in Singapore&nbsp;within a specified period of time.&nbsp; This provision, one would suppose, is to give much assurance to the rather apprehensive Singaporeans of our serious intent in not allowing casinos to proliferate in our country as a soft option of bringing in more of the tourist dollars.&nbsp; Under the present arrangement, the Government will have to come back to Parliament for permission if it wants to have more than two casinos than is currently provided for.&nbsp; This is indeed quite assuring for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am not sure if this assurance of limiting the number of casinos to two is somewhat negated by the provision in the Bill which allows for the expansion of the space&nbsp;of the casino within the Integrated Resort.&nbsp; In this regard, I share the concerns of my fellow colleague, Mr Ahmad Khalis, who earlier expressed some reservations on the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 51(2) of the proposed Bill provides that the Authority may, from time to time, redefine the boundaries of the casino premises within the designated site for which the casino licence is granted as it thinks fit, on its own motion or on the application of the casino operator.&nbsp; This provision seems to suggest that the area to be occupied by the casino operator, ie, the size of the facility, may be expanded at the absolute discretion of <p align=left>Column: 2368</p>the Authority to take in more crowd.&nbsp; While it is the current intention of the Government not to allow the size of the casino operation to exceed, I believe, 3% of the total area of the resort, it is technically possible for the Authority to designate the entire resort as one big casino by an administrative decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it does seem odd to me that while we took pains to ensure that Parliament decides on the number of casinos that are allowed to operate in Singapore, we are quite prepared to allow the Authority the complete discretion to decide on the expansion of the size of the facility which, at the end of the day, may have the effect of providing more opportunities for the people to gamble.&nbsp; This approach to policy would seem rather inconsistent with our stated policy of limiting the number of casinos here to two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it not be forgotten that while we may have allowed the establishment of casinos in this country, we do not and should not allow the issue of further expansion of gambling facility to be dealt with lightly here.&nbsp; Certainly, I do not think that the matter of the expansion of the casino facility should be left in the hands of civil servants alone.&nbsp; Any expansion of the gambling facility of the resort should be a matter of concern to the public and should be carried out only after due consultation with the stakeholders who have an interest in the process.&nbsp; This would include not only the operators but also the National Council on Problem Gambling and the other voluntary welfare organisations that are concerned with the problem of gambling in Singapore.&nbsp; We are not calling for Parliament to interfere in the process, as this would prove too cumbersome.&nbsp; Rather, we should at least go through the process of consultation to ensure that any decision taken to expand the facilities of the casino would be taken only after due consideration is given to all who may be directly or indirectly&nbsp;affected.&nbsp; And this should be written into our <p align=left>Column: 2369</p>statute books to ensure compliance.&nbsp; For this reason, Sir, I am not too happy with the existing clause 51 of the Bill and would ask that the Government consider amending it to include a formal process of consultation with all interested parties if further expansion is required for the existing casino operation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the artificial nature of the restriction to entry.&nbsp; Currently, the proposed restriction of access and entry into the casino is limited, amongst others, by age and levy.&nbsp; The underlying principle of this restriction lies in the protection of minors and a certain segment of our society who are not able to look after themselves financially.&nbsp; I do have some difficulty with these suggested barriers to entry as there is&nbsp;an element of arbitrariness about them.&nbsp; Under the proposed provision, minors are not allowed to enter&nbsp;a casino.&nbsp; Minors in the Bill are defined as those under the age of 21.&nbsp; Now, Sir, I find this rather odd, especially in the context of Singaporean males.&nbsp; I say this is rather odd because, in the context of Singapore, our boys, who enlist at the age of 18 and who are considered old enough to bear arms and to kill in defence of our country, are not considered old enough to enter a casino.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;it an irony?&nbsp; I would suggest that, to streamline this anomaly, we should consider allowing those who are 18 the right of entry into casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, it also seems inconsistent to me that while we prevent people who cannot afford the $100 per entry levy or $2,000&nbsp;annual membership&nbsp;fee from blowing their hard-earned money or savings in a casino, we make no effort at preventing Singaporeans from spending a fortune on buying Toto, patronising jackpot rooms at the various clubs, going on cruise ships that have floating casinos or even making a visit to the Singapore Turf Club which, to my mind, is another form of legitimised gambling.&nbsp; Why should this be so?&nbsp; Sir, the issue is not about <p align=left>Column: 2370</p>whether we should not allow poor Singaporeans the right of entry, but rather&nbsp;about problem gambling.&nbsp; It would be presumptuous to think that poor Singaporeans have limited or no self-control.&nbsp; Poor Singaporeans who are minded to gamble are not discouraged by the $100 levy, which the authorities intend to impose.&nbsp; Serious gamblers, no matter how poor they are, will be able to meet the obstacle easily.&nbsp; And even if they are prevented from patronising the casino by the levy, they will have other means to feed their habit.&nbsp; There are many Singaporeans, especially the poorer ones, who have limited or no opportunity to travel overseas but who would like to visit the casino for the experience.&nbsp; The integrated resort should be seen as an asset for all Singaporeans to visit and to enjoy, including the casino.&nbsp; Nobody is going to have a serious problem with someone who visits the casino as part of an outing&nbsp;and punts the odd dollar at the gaming machine.&nbsp; Imposing a levy on entry coupled with an openly stated policy of protecting the low-income from the snares of gambling as a justification for the levy puts us in an unwarranted position of being seen to be engaging in class discrimination.&nbsp; Sir, there is absolutely, to my mind, no basis for assuming that those who can afford the entry levy are better able to exercise self control and look after themselves than those who could not; or that those who can afford the levy will not end up losing their pants at the gambling table as with those who could hardly afford to enter the casino.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way to deal with it is not to restrict entry but to place the burden on the operator to rely on&nbsp;their software to fish out those who run the risk of problem gambling.&nbsp; The operator would be in a position to pick this out very easily by tracking the patrons on a daily basis and the amount they spend.&nbsp; Such information can be channelled to the Council who would then be in a position to seek out those at risk.&nbsp; Alternatively, an upper limit <p align=left>Column: 2371</p>on gambling could also be imposed on those who choose not to furnish information on their financial standing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the Bill has also taken pains also to ensure that those who could ill afford it are prevented from entering the casino, I believe more could be done to prevent those who enter the premises with the sole purpose of perpetrating evil.&nbsp; I am referring to the loan sharks and&nbsp;those who are intent on prostitution and other forms of illegal activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the pillars of concern in relation to&nbsp;casino activity has to do with loan sharking and illegal prostitution.&nbsp; In fact, all prostitutions are illegal, to begin with.&nbsp; And for all our concerns, I am surprised that the present Bill only confines such restriction to just one particular section, and that is to be found in clause 129 of the Bill.&nbsp; In the way that it is drafted, clause 129 leaves very much to the imagination of how one can take all appropriate steps to ensure that these illegal activities are not carried out in the premises.&nbsp; I am concerned that the Bill itself did not do more to set out the standards and the measures by which a casino operator can take appropriate steps.&nbsp; And I would hope that, at some future point of time, the regulator and the authorities can provide further guidance on what is considered to be adequate or appropriate steps that they can take to minimise or to prevent such activities from taking place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, greater clarity and guidance for the National Council on Problem Gambling.&nbsp; It is laudable that the Government has taken the proactive measure of setting up a National Council on Problem Gambling.&nbsp; This is done in recognition of the potential harm that gambling may bring not just to the individual, but also to his family and his loved ones.&nbsp; In as much as living with a <p align=left>Column: 2372</p>casino in our front yard and may be new to us, the Council, in its initial stages, will be left very much to finding its own compass in virgin territory.&nbsp; This Bill has attempted to chart some directions by clarifying some provisions.&nbsp; These relate, for instance, to clarifications within the legislation on the nature of serious harm to the family and the circumstances under which the Council should have reasonable apprehension.&nbsp; While such efforts should be lauded, it is unfortunately insufficient.&nbsp; I can, for instance, think of situations where the Council will no doubt have to formulate its own guidelines as a compass.&nbsp; For instance, would a spouse under the Bill include a common law husband or wife?&nbsp; Under clause 162(2), what would the needs and welfare of the respondent's family members be?&nbsp; I can understand the application of this policy in the context of a family that can hardly afford to make ends meet.&nbsp; Does the same also apply to the family where the man is blowing 20% of his $20 million net worth to gambling?&nbsp; Can his wife and children come before the Council to ask for an exclusion order on the grounds that their needs and welfare are being substantially reduced because of his gambling habit?&nbsp; It would help if the Ministry could provide clearer guidelines on these matters as it serves to, firstly, guide the Council in coming to a decision and, secondly, to provide better guidance to members of the public on the circumstances where help from the Council may be sought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a very comprehensive Bill on casino control and I applaud those who had a hand in drafting this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Bill&nbsp; which I support.&nbsp; From the debate that we have had in this House, it is clear that our concerns, as Singaporeans, go much wider than the nuts and bolts of the policy that this Bill has come to represent.&nbsp; Of necessity, we accept that we have to take this route with Vice for company.&nbsp; While we may be fellow partners in this journey and do all we can to prevent an over intrusion of Vice into our&nbsp;lives, we <p align=left>Column: 2373</p>must never forget that this Vice can be evil and will not hesitate to consume us if we are not careful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

How is the Government going to ensure that it will be able to track every Singaporean who is on social assistance?&nbsp; There are 1,700 charities in Singapore.&nbsp; Not every underprivileged Singaporean turns to the CDCs when they need help.&nbsp; Is there a way the Government can spread its feelers to all charitable organisations so that Singaporeans who ought to be excluded will come to the attention of the authorities?&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask whether the current steps to beef up the Government's regulatory oversight of the charity sector will include efforts in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the exclusion stipulation in the Bill raises some questions and scenarios.&nbsp; What happens to families who have just stopped relying on social assistance?&nbsp; How will the National Council on Problem Gambling approach and handle families such as</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Or will it be that families are to be taken out of the exclusion list the moment they stop accepting social assistance?&nbsp; Or is there an evaluation period?&nbsp; And how is the Council going to monitor all the families either on social assistance or once on social assistance?&nbsp; In fact, it raises the question of how many families currently are receiving social <p align=left>Column: 2374</p>assistance.&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification on this and what guideposts the Council intends to use when it acts with regard to the exclusion list.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second issue that comes to mind is that there is definitely scope for another layer of protection to be added if we are to look out for the interests of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I read with interest the plans that Harrah's has to establish a responsible gambling education programme.&nbsp; What struck me the most was that it was a voluntary proposition.&nbsp; Why is it allowed to be voluntary?&nbsp; Should it not be a requirement?&nbsp; Or are such programmes stipulated for under the Request for Proposals?&nbsp; If it is not, I would be very worried.&nbsp; In any case, I believe that the provision of gambling education and rehabilitation programmes is so important that it should be mandated for any would-be casino operator under the Casino Control Bill.&nbsp; It should not be left optional.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, let us get to the heart of the problem when it comes to gambling.&nbsp; It is not gambling per se, but getting into debt that causes so many problems for families and society.&nbsp; For all the measures that are in place under the Bill, as it stands, I am sure that it cannot paper over every crack and stop every Singaporean from gambling more than his or her family can afford.&nbsp; The Government's aim is to have its cake and eat it - that is, to derive all the benefits of an integrated resort for Singapore but none of the documented detriments seen in other countries.&nbsp; If this turns out to be the case, well and good.&nbsp; But if, indeed, our worst fears come true, and if families suffer because of the heavy losses of one family member at the casino, then I would like to ask if the Government would consider the legislative option of setting limits on how much a person can lose at the casino either in one sitting or on a monthly basis, for example.&nbsp; After all, if the Government can impose levies of $100 and $2,000 in order to deter <p align=left>Column: 2375</p>Singaporeans from gambling at the casino, then it can impose a ceiling on how much non-premium players can lose to the house.&nbsp; If a few years after the IRs have been in operation, and it is apparent that there is a problem of families incurring casino gambling debts, I would think that mere symbolism like the entrance levy and concerns about micro-managing ought to take a back seat to the very real need to nip the problem in the bud, so that more families will not be affected.&nbsp; Even if this is not added to the Bill now, I would like the Government to give an assurance that it will consider the option of capping losses through legislation should the need ever arise.&nbsp; If we are truly sincere about being prepared to deal with the problems that casinos might cause, I think we should consider this.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column: 2376<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We would like to reassure Mr Low that manufacturing continues to be strong in Singapore. Manufacturing has been consistently accounting for more than 20% of GDP since 1972. More importantly, the value-add of manufacturing (which is the direct contribution of manufacturing to GDP) grew at an average rate of 6.1% per annum from 1990 to 2004, close to the average annual growth rate of GDP of 6.3% during the same period.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center\" align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 2385</p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Manufacturing sector--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Manufacturing sector)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Low Thia Khiang </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the amount of foreign investment committed to the manufacturing sector, by industry, on an annual basis from 1990 to date and what is the net foreign investment amount committed to the sector during the same period.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main performance indicator that EDB tracks for the manufacturing sector is the level of manufacturing fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments from investor companies.

The number of such students is generally on a declining trend among all ethnic groups.&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to schools, the numbers are on a declining trend in the ITE. In 2005, the proportion of students who left ITE's full-time courses without an ITE qualification was about 12.0% of ITE's full-time enrolment, compared to 17% in 2000.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key reasons cited by students for dropping out of schools include loss of interest in studies and family/personal problems.&nbsp; The same reasons apply for those who leave the ITE. However attrition from the ITE is also higher because the students are older and have more options open to them, including working or pursuing private courses. Some of these students pursue part-time studies in private educational institutions, including re-taking their 'O' levels as private candidates.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools and ITE adopt both proactive and intervention measures to ensure that students stay enrolled. These include pastoral care, life-skills and career guidance programmes which are aimed at helping students build up confidence in school or ITE and develop purposefulness in life, and to take responsibility for their actions. The intervention measures include counselling of potential dropouts by both teachers as well as professional counsellors. Schools work closely with parents in the education of their children and encourage them to provide the necessary home support to sustain the student's interest in school. In addition, ITE's Guidance and Motivation Programme provides motivational talks and orientation programmes to facilitate a smooth transition for fresh school leavers enrolled into ITE.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools also work with external agencies such as self-help groups, family services centres and&nbsp;SANA to reach out to \"at-risk\" students and to help counsel them. They also encourage those who leave school prematurely to return to schools.</p><p align=left>Column: 2389</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the impact of intervention programmes is difficult to identify with any precision, the decline in dropout rates over the years suggests that they have had a positive impact.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are doing more. Schools and ITE will continue to work with other agencies to do so. We will reach out to each individual student in a customised way, as each potential dropout is unique.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 56.7pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, we believe that a more engaging curriculum and providing more educational options to meet the different needs of students will help to reduce the number of dropouts. MOE has thus introduced Elective Modules (EMs) on subjects like Science and Elements of Office Administrations for&nbsp;Normal course students to make lessons more relevant and engaging. MOE will also be introducing a customised N(T) curriculum from 2007 that is more practice-oriented to better match the learning profile of the students and provide them with meaningful learning experiences in school. MOE is also working to enhance the Vocational Training Centres to make it a more viable option for students who do not find the mainstream curriculum suitable.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;
