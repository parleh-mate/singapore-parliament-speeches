This was the  provision\r\n\r\nof electricity supply to 58 houses at an estimated cost\r\n\r\nof  $37,720. The monthly revenue from these houses  was\r\n\r\nestimated  at $22,620 for a five-year period - in  fact,\r\n\r\namounting  to a subsidy of $15,100 or $260  per  house.\r\n\r\nThe  Urban  and  Rural Services Consultative  Committee\r\n\r\nreceived  requests for the provision of such  amenities\r\n\r\nfrom  all  over the island.

This scheme was not included\r\n\r\nin   the  immediate  programme  for  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  supply to kampongs because  of  the  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of houses involved and the high rate of subsidy\r\n\r\nper house.

For\r\n\r\nexample, in the case of a fire a traffic lane must\r\n\r\nbe  available for the police and the fire  brigade\r\n\r\nto reach the afflicted area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) in certain areas whole streets are used by\r\n\r\nhawkers as markets for specified hours because  of\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of  sites for markets  in  congested\r\n\r\nareas.

For example, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  food  hawkers - vegetable hawkers, meat  hawkers  and\r\n\r\nfish  hawkers - they will be separately  grouped  in  the\r\n\r\nsame   street,  and  all  non-food  hawkers   will   be\r\n\r\nseparately  grouped together in the same  street.

But what\r\n\r\nexercises my mind, Sir, is the difficulty of the estate\r\n\r\nof  the  deceased to defend an action in respect  of  a\r\n\r\ntort which may be four or five or six years old, at the\r\n\r\ntime they receive notice of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware, Sir - it may well be because I have not\r\n\r\nassiduously perused the newspapers - that there had  been\r\n\r\nany important number of cases where there is indication\r\n\r\nof injustice in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the  estate  of  a  dead  man   against\r\n\r\nproceedings  not in contract, Sir, as has been  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  but  in tort for misconduct alleged to have  been\r\n\r\ncommitted more than six months before his death.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Minister and all of us certainly  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  when  a  man is alive, he can defend  himself  in\r\n\r\nrespect of these matters to a degree that possibly  his\r\n\r\nrepresentatives cannot. And I would ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nindicate, apart from the perfectly legitimate desire to\r\n\r\nkeep in line with the Federation and the United Kingdom -have there, in fact, been any cases of hardship  and,\r\n\r\nif  so,  to  what extent have they been caused  by  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law?  And  whether the  Minister  has  really\r\n\r\ndirected  his mind to the dangers which would arise  to\r\n\r\nthe  dead  man's estate if his name could be  maligned?\r\n\r\nThe  point  is, it is impossible to prevent  fraudulent\r\n\r\nand  false claims being made. It is extremely difficult\r\n\r\nfor  his estate to defend him if the allegation is five\r\n\r\nor  six years ago he did something in respect of  which\r\n\r\nno  action  has been taken until six months  after  his\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters of some importance on which I would\r\n\r\nappreciate clarification from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes to\r\n\r\nspeak?

Where the insurer\r\n\r\nadmits the liability, there is no problem, as then  the\r\n\r\nmoney is paid to the Public Trustee who will administer\r\n\r\nit  for  the  benefit of the persons entitled  thereto.\r\n\r\nWhenever,   however,  the  insurer   does   not   admit\r\n\r\nliability,  it  is necessary to sue the insurer.  Under\r\n\r\nthe present provisions, the proper person to sue is the\r\n\r\nPublic Trustee, but the Public Trustee is unwilling  to\r\n\r\nrun  the risk of losing the action and therefore having\r\n\r\nto pay the cost. The persons entitled to the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  award would naturally want to bring action against\r\n\r\nthe  insurer but they have to do so in the name of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Trustee. The Public Trustee has, however, to ask\r\n\r\nfor  indemnity  for  costs and it  may  not  always  be\r\n\r\npossible  for the parties to give this undertaking  and\r\n\r\nit  is  doubtful whether the solicitors for the parties\r\n\r\ncan  give such an undertaking. It is therefore proposed\r\n\r\nto  amend the Ordinance to provide that notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of subsection (1) of section 8  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the right of action under the judgment shall\r\n\r\nvest  with the persons entitled to the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\njudgment. This will enable the persons entitled to take\r\n\r\naction  without  joining  the  Public  Trustee  in  the\r\n\r\naction.

I beg to move,  \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our entrepot trade has brought prosperity to\r\n\r\nSingapore and will continue to do so. But the expansion\r\n\r\nof  this  sector of the economy is not expected  to  be\r\n\r\nlarge enough to give jobs for all our unemployed. There\r\n\r\narises, therefore, an urgent need for industrialisation\r\n\r\nin Singapore to create employment opportunities for our\r\n\r\nrapidly  growing  population. This  need  is  generally\r\n\r\naccepted. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to industrialise, sufficient incentives have  to\r\n\r\nbe  made available to induce local and overseas capital\r\n\r\nto  flow  into manufacturing industries. The Government\r\n\r\nhave  done much to provide these incentives: first,  in\r\n\r\nthe development of adequate public utilities, roads and\r\n\r\nother  facilities  to  make possible  rapid  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion; second, in the establishment of the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board   which  will  actively   encourage\r\n\r\nindustries   and  assist  businessmen  with  technical,\r\n\r\nindustrial   and   financial  assistance;   third,   in\r\n\r\nproviding industrial estates and sites for factories to\r\n\r\nbe  constructed  and purchased on an  extended  payment\r\n\r\nbasis  and at reasonable rates of interest; fourth,  in\r\n\r\nproviding  tax exemption on profit for five  years  for\r\n\r\nnew   industries   through   the   Pioneer   Industries\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1959; fifth, through technical  advice  and\r\n\r\nassistance;  sixth,  through  an  expanded   vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  in the Polytechnic, trade schools,  secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools  to  create  sufficient  numbers  of\r\n\r\nskilled workmen needed in industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one other field which has not up\r\n\r\ntill now been fully exploited. This is the levelling of\r\n\r\ntariff duties on a selective basis on imported goods to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  local industries in order  to  allow  for\r\n\r\ntheir  expansion and to encourage the establishment  of\r\n\r\nnew  ones  in  Singapore. The reason for the  agitation\r\n\r\nagainst the use of tariff protection is mainly that  of\r\n\r\nthe  possible  unfavourable effects they  have  on  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade.  However,  our  brief  experience   in\r\n\r\nprotective tariff has shown that the effects  could  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to a minimum or even be eliminated  if  tariff\r\n\r\nduties  are  imposed  with due  care  on  selected  com\r\n\r\nmodities only. There should not be an indiscriminate or\r\n\r\ngeneral imposition of tariff duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Government have accorded tariff protection\r\n\r\nto  two imported articles, namely, soap and paint,  and\r\n\r\nthis  action has not caused any unfavourable effect  on\r\n\r\nour   commercial  interest,  nor  has  it  reduced   or\r\n\r\nadversely affected our entrepot trade, The decision  to\r\n\r\nimpose  tariff duties on soap and paint was made  after\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  reports of the respective  committees\r\n\r\nappointed  under  section 11 of the Customs  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth  committees encountered difficulties in  obtaining\r\n\r\ninformation,  and  it was clear that the  machinery  as\r\n\r\nprovided   in   the  Customs  Ordinance   has   serious\r\n\r\nweaknesses.  One  over-riding difficulty  was  that  of\r\n\r\nobtaining   accurate  and  reliable  information.   The\r\n\r\ncommittee  did not have the power to compel  interested\r\n\r\nparties  to  divulge  such information.  The  delay  in\r\n\r\nsubmitting  their findings has been  due,  in  a  large\r\n\r\nmeasure,  to this, and in particular to the  difficulty\r\n\r\nencountered  in  ascertaining specific  information  on\r\n\r\nprices of imported goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, if the development of manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries  is  not to be delayed, for a proper  Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Commission to be set up  with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nauthority  to obtain whatever information it  needs  to\r\n\r\nassess  whether any particular industry requires tariff\r\n\r\nprotection. Without this authority, the Commission will\r\n\r\nnot be able to function quickly and effectively and the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not have the necessary data on which to\r\n\r\nreach  a  proper evaluation. The purpose of the  Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Commission Bill now before the  House  is  to\r\n\r\novercome  the  weaknesses that now exist  in  operating\r\n\r\nsection  11 of the Customs Ordinance, and to  vest  the\r\n\r\nrequired  statutory  powers  to  obtain  the  necessary\r\n\r\ninformation  in  the Tariff Advisory Commission  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished  under this Bill. When such information  is\r\n\r\navailable,  the  Government  would  be  able  to   make\r\n\r\ndecisions on the basis of properly ascertained facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Tariff Advisory Commission Bill\r\n\r\nare  mainly  procedural and can be  briefly  stated  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Tariff Advisory Commission will consist of a\r\n\r\nChairman  and  between two and four other members.  The\r\n\r\nCommission  can also co-opt on an ad hoc basis  one  or\r\n\r\nmore persons with special knowledge of the matter under\r\n\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

Members</b> will note that the intention of the Bill\r\n\r\ngoes   beyond  merely  the  imposition  of   protective\r\n\r\ntariffs.  The Bill empowers the Government to  initiate\r\n\r\ninquiries   on  protected  industries  &  should,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,   any  of  these  take  undue  advantage   of\r\n\r\nprotection by failing to reduce costs and prices  where\r\n\r\nthey can do so. It is not the purpose of protection  to\r\n\r\nbring  about high costs and inefficient producers,  and\r\n\r\nthe Tariff Advisory Commission will be charged with the\r\n\r\nduty  of  keeping constant surveillance on the workings\r\n\r\nof protected industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Bill affects the interests one way or\r\n\r\nanother  of many sections of our economy, I  intend  to\r\n\r\ncommit  this  Bill  to  Select Committee  so  that  all\r\n\r\nconcerned  may have an opportunity of submitting  their\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nsupport the principle of the Bill, but we must point\r\n\r\nout to the Government that while it is a good thing to\r\n\r\nconsider the imposition of a protective tariff to help\r\n\r\nthe industrialisation programme of the Government, they\r\n\r\nmust not lose sight of the fact that the biggest factor\r\n\r\nto encourage the inflow of foreign capital for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is the political climate and the\r\n\r\nindustrial atmosphere. The political climate in\r\n\r\nSingapore today is most unhealthy.

I\r\n\r\nwas  just  trying  to  point out to  him  that  he  had\r\n\r\noverlooked one most important factor, and that  is  the\r\n\r\npolitical climate and the industrial relations climate,\r\n\r\nboth of which are most unhealthy and very discouraging,\r\n\r\nso much so that no matter what plans the Government may\r\n\r\nhave  to encourage the inflow of foreign capital,  they\r\n\r\nhave failed miserably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point on which I would like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Government. For the first  time  since\r\n\r\nthey  came to power in 1959, they have come to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the members of a board or a commission shall  not\r\n\r\nbe  Members of the Assembly. Previously, when they  had 43 Members on their side, they insisted that Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly should have a right to sit on a board  or\r\n\r\ncommission,  and every time it was a P.A.P. Assemblyman\r\n\r\nand  nobody else. While it is a good thing,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Assembly are now not permitted  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed to the Tariff Advisory Commission, may I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to remember this too; that they  should\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue   with   their   evil  practice   of   loading\r\n\r\ncommissions  with  men who will only  play  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngame?  In order to make this Tariff Advisory Commission\r\n\r\na  success,  I  hope the Minister will appoint  men  of\r\n\r\nintegrity, men who will work with the interests of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  at heart, and not men who will only  work  for\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 6, the Commission has powers to co-opt\r\n\r\none or more members who possesses special knowledge  of\r\n\r\nany matter relevant to any inquiry. But if a person  is\r\n\r\nso  appointed because of his special knowledge, he will\r\n\r\ncome  up against clause 8. He will have either a direct\r\n\r\nor an indirect pecuniary interest. How is that going to\r\n\r\noperate?  To  appoint on an ad hoc basis a person  with\r\n\r\nspecial  knowledge of a particular subject and  yet  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  he  has  a direct or indirect  pecuniary\r\n\r\ninterest  he should not be present - perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\ncan  explain that. Perhaps the Government will, in full\r\n\r\nrealisation  of their past mistakes and the  folly  of\r\n\r\ntheir industrialisation programme, come to an awakening\r\n\r\nthat the only way to solve the unemployment problem  is\r\n\r\nto  see that their industrialisation plan succeed;  and\r\n\r\nthe  only  way  to make it succeed is to see  that  the\r\n\r\npolitical  climate is healthy and that  the  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  field is conducive to the inflow of  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is\r\n\r\na  Bill  to  assist in nibbling away at the  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus  of  Singapore. If we can accept  the  principle\r\n\r\nthat individual Ministers can have vast powers to place\r\n\r\ntariffs  on articles, then, of course, we can say  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill is helpful in that they have the assistance of\r\n\r\na Commission, though itself appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I rise to sound a note of warning on, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat there does not seem to be adequate appreciation of\r\n\r\nthe  long-term danger of nibbling away at our free port\r\n\r\ntraditions. The Minister for Finance has told you  that\r\n\r\nfor the past few months, we have had a duty on soap and\r\n\r\na  duty on paint. The one on soap, Sir, I think,  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of one month,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  he  says there has been no adverse effect  on  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  He shows very little regard, Sir, either  for\r\n\r\nthe  intelligence of this House or he himself has  very\r\n\r\nlittle understanding of the factors to imagine that one\r\n\r\nor  two'  duties  over an extremely limited  period  of\r\n\r\nweeks   could   affect  the  picture  sufficiently   to\r\n\r\nprejudice  more  than a, century of tradition  of  free\r\n\r\nport  for Singapore. But the matter of these individual\r\n\r\ntariffs  is cumulative in effect, Sir, and  as  we  add\r\n\r\ntariffs, then the information will seep through and the\r\n\r\nknowledge  will expand that Singapore is  no  longer  a\r\n\r\nfree  port.  It  is that, Sir, that can  and  seriously\r\n\r\nadversely  affect  our entrepot economy.  The  Minister\r\n\r\npays passing tribute to our entrepot economy, but seems\r\n\r\nto  think  of  it  as  no more than  secondary  to  his\r\n\r\nindustrialisation baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I accept that industrialisation can become an\r\n\r\nimportant element in this State's economy. But I do say\r\n\r\nthat  it cannot replace our entrepot economy which must\r\n\r\nat  all  times  be  the cornerstone  of  any  financial\r\n\r\npolicy. An economy so little understood by the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  he  seeks with derision to inquire  what  purpose\r\n\r\nthere  could be in an exploratory mission to such  vast\r\n\r\nareas  of  potential commercial activity as  India  and\r\n\r\nChina. With that attitude, Sir, one can destroy, not in\r\n\r\nthe  next two years, but one can lay the basis for  the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  our economy. I am not unaware  of  the\r\n\r\npossible importance of what the Minister calls selected\r\n\r\ncases  of tariffs. Those selected cases must  be  of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  which really bring in a considerable  amount\r\n\r\nof    employment    and   have   little   international\r\n\r\nrepercussions   or  at  least  repercussions   on   our\r\n\r\ninternational  trade. I would be far happier,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe   provisions  which  seek  to  amend  the   Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance, which are coming after this Bill, were of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  which  would  permit  this  House  to   pass\r\n\r\njudgment  on  the  tariffs recommended  by  the  Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory Commission. But that is not to be, and I  rise\r\n\r\nin opposition to the general principle of nibbling away\r\n\r\nby  individual Ministers at the free port reputation of\r\n\r\nthis island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> No one from our side,\r\n\r\nSir,  can  quarrel with the intention of  the  Bill  to\r\n\r\nprovide an edifice for an industrial complex unless  he\r\n\r\nbelieves  that Singapore can survive on entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nalone.  The  need for necessary tariff  protection  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  industries is obvious.  Industries  cannot\r\n\r\ngrow  in  the  teeth  of  formidable  competition  with\r\n\r\nforeign  goods  that  come into  the  Singapore  market\r\n\r\nthrough  the free port and across the Johore  Causeway.\r\n\r\nWhat  appears  to be undesirable in this  Bill  is  the\r\n\r\nabsence of any provision that makes it incumbent on the\r\n\r\nproposed Tariff Advisory Commission to keep the  people\r\n\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (2) of the Bill confers on the Commission\r\n\r\nunwarrantable  powers of secrecy  with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Commission. Furthermore, there is no\r\n\r\nprovision to publish the reports of the Commission upon\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government's  decision  of  protection  for\r\n\r\nindustry is based. The people therefore are deprived of\r\n\r\nthe  right  of access to the necessary information  and\r\n\r\ndocuments  without  which sound  judgment  may  not  be\r\n\r\npossible.  We do not like to see a repetition  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened  recently when the Government took a  decision\r\n\r\nto  give protection to the paint manufacturing industry\r\n\r\nin Singapore. The Government did not publish the report\r\n\r\nof the Advisory Committee although action was taken. We\r\n\r\nare not unaware of the necessity for the maintenance of\r\n\r\ntrading  secrets in individual firms in  the  industry,\r\n\r\nbut  we  are  of the view that the proceedings  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission should, as far as possible, be open  to  the\r\n\r\npublic   unless   and  until  the  Commission   decides\r\n\r\notherwise. We would like the people to have free access\r\n\r\nto the findings and recommendations of the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also puzzled, Sir, over the timing of this\r\n\r\nBill.  It is common knowledge that an early realisation\r\n\r\nof  the  common commodity market is out of the question\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  Outcome of the political  schemings  and\r\n\r\nmachinations as regards Malaysia and the P.A.P. merger.\r\n\r\nThe last time we heard about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommon   commodity  market  was  the  joint  communique\r\n\r\nannouncing  the plan to appoint a team of international\r\n\r\nexperts  to  study  the  problem.  We  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  inform  the people of  Singapore  whether\r\n\r\nsuch  a  team has been appointed.

What we cannot understand is, how does the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment reconcile its contention that Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to survive without a larger economic  unit\r\n\r\nwith  what  is implied in the present Bill  which  pre-supposes   the  viability  of  Singapore's   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment?  We believe that the economy of  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  viable  and,  as such, any measure that  Government\r\n\r\nwants  to  take  to strengthen this viability  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, three Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition from three different Parties have given\r\n\r\nthree different versions of the intention .of this Bill\r\n\r\nand of what it hopes to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, of course, their criticisms have cancelled\r\n\r\nout  one another, as I will shortly explain. First, the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill says that the political climate is\r\n\r\nunhealthy  and  that industrial relations  are  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment not conducive to investment of  capital\r\n\r\nin  industries. Now, Sir, I would agree with the second\r\n\r\nproposition, but certainly not with the first. I  would\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that the political climate is  eminently\r\n\r\nhealthy  to attract capital. The Government is carrying\r\n\r\non with its long-term plans for merger and Malaysia. We\r\n\r\nsee the Barisan Sosialis, who only a year ago predicted\r\n\r\nthe  October Revolution, now in despair sending  troops\r\n\r\nof  little  kids down the desolate streets of Singapore\r\n\r\neach  Sunday.  I would have thought that the  political\r\n\r\nsituation  is extremely healthy other than, of  course,\r\n\r\nfor  the  Communists and their stooges in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  We  have  debated the matter  of  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations in this Assembly, and I do not think  I  want\r\n\r\nto  say  much  more about it except that this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintended  as  a long-term measure and we  must  not  be\r\n\r\ndissuaded by temporary inconveniences. We are certainly\r\n\r\nnot  going  to wait until the industrial  scene  is  as\r\n\r\npeaceful  as  it can be. I suggest, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat will come about after merger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now one nagging criticism which the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill always brings up in this Assembly is that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. always appoint P.A.P. men to P.A.P. Boards,  as\r\n\r\nif  this is a thoroughly reprehensible practice. May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  this practice is carried  out  in  every\r\n\r\ndemocratic  country? When Mr Churchill was  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  Conservative  Government  was   the\r\n\r\ngovernment of the day, they appointed Conservatives  to\r\n\r\nimportant  posts in the Boards. There is nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  that. The Member for Cairnhill can hardly  expect\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. to  appoint  `his  cronies  to  important\r\n\r\npositions. May I suggest, Sir, that the persons that we\r\n\r\nhave  appointed to important positions are doing a very\r\n\r\ngood job of work? For example, Mr Lim Kim San, who  is\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Housing Board, has really  done  a\r\n\r\nmagnificent piece of work, building low-cost houses at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall-time  record in Singapore.

He\r\n\r\nis not taking any money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is he P.A.P.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is not P.A.P. But unlike the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson, he can see a good Party and  he  can\r\n\r\nrespect good men when he sees them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I will dwell at length on what the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill says on the conflict between a man\r\n\r\nwith special knowledge and the same man having a direct\r\n\r\ninterest in the industry concerned. The sort of special\r\n\r\nknowledge  which  the Tariff Advisory Commission  might\r\n\r\nwant  would be purely on account of technical knowledge\r\n\r\nof   some   kind  or  other.  For  instance,   in   the\r\n\r\ninvestigation into qualities of toothpaste and  so  on,\r\n\r\nthey  may find that they need the services of a chemist\r\n\r\nor  they  may  want the services of a special  type  of\r\n\r\naccountant  for analysing the import prices of  certain\r\n\r\nthings.   Insofar  as  a  general  knowledge   of   any\r\n\r\nparticular  industry is concerned, the Tariff  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommission  will  have men who have some  knowledge  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an  industry.  But  as I say,  in  assessing  and\r\n\r\nevaluating data, they often do require experts  of  one\r\n\r\nsort - chemists,   physicists,   accountants   or    even\r\n\r\nmathematicians, for all I know. That is the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  particular clause. The reason is  that  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is making the initial appointment, he  cannot\r\n\r\nforesee the types of problems which the Tariff Advisory\r\n\r\nCommission may encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that the Member for Anson started\r\n\r\nhis  ministerial career as Singapore's  first  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Trade. Therefore, one would have thought  that  he\r\n\r\nhad   benefited  from  his  experience  in  his   first\r\n\r\nministerial post. But his speech has given me  quite  a\r\n\r\ncontrary  impression. He says that one of the  damaging\r\n\r\nlong-term  effects  of the Bill would  be  that  people\r\n\r\nwould  know - that knowledge would seep through,  in  his\r\n\r\nown  words - that Singapore is no longer a free port, and\r\n\r\nthat  this would eventually, if not immediately, affect\r\n\r\nour entrepot trade adversely. With due respect, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest   that  it  is  utter  and  complete  nonsense.\r\n\r\nSingapore's entrepot trade is done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby businessmen. There is no mystic about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better explain the simple economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals of this so-called entrepot trade. It looks\r\n\r\nvery   nice  if  you  talk  about  entrepot  trade   or\r\n\r\ninternational  trade, but the basic  element  is  quite\r\n\r\nsimple. Singapore is in the centre of South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nIt has sea communications with hundreds of little ports\r\n\r\nalong  the coast of central and south Sumatra,  Borneo,\r\n\r\nthe  east  coast of the Malay Peninsula, good rail  and\r\n\r\nroad communications with southern Malaya. It is because\r\n\r\nof  these  excellent sea, road and rail  communications\r\n\r\nthat  we are best equipped to supply these people  with\r\n\r\ngoods  that  they  want  at the lowest  possible  cost.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  because of a highly developed transportation\r\n\r\nsystem, we are best equipped to buy from them the goods\r\n\r\nthat they produce. It is as simple as that. It does not\r\n\r\ndepend  on  subjective or psychological attitudes..  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not depend on whether knowledge seeps upwards  or\r\n\r\ndownwards  or  backwards.  So  long  as  our  port   is\r\n\r\nsufficient and so long as steamship lines and  railways\r\n\r\noperate  sufficiently, it will continue to serve  as  a\r\n\r\nsupply  base  and  as  a  market for  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must congratulate the Member for Queenstown on\r\n\r\nsome  of  his  words. He shows a spark of understanding\r\n\r\nwhich  I  never suspected existed in his mind. He  puts\r\n\r\nthe  position very, nicely when he says this:  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  support tariffs unless we believe that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  live  on  trade  alone. The Member  for  Anson  is\r\n\r\nopposed to tariffs because he thinks it will damage the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade. Quite unlike the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nhe  believes that we can live on tirade alone. Any  man\r\n\r\nwho  can  believe  in such an absurd  proposition.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is beyond convincing by rational methods,\r\n\r\nso I will not attempt that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown says the secrecy provisions\r\n\r\nof  this Bill are regrettable, although he acknowledges\r\n\r\nthat there are instances where trade secrets have to be\r\n\r\npreserved.  But  he  thinks that the  sittings  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  should be in public, unless the  Commission\r\n\r\ndecides  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise. Sir, clause 15 (2) of the  Bill  says\r\n\r\nthat the sittings of the Commission shall be in private\r\n\r\nunless  the Commission decides otherwise. So I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee  any  real issue between the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  myself. There may be a subtle difference, but  it\r\n\r\nis beyond my mind to comprehend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Queenstown winds up with a\r\n\r\ndiscourse  on the viability of Singapore's  economy  to\r\n\r\nflourish  in isolation. I have no doubt that in  saying\r\n\r\nthese words he has in mind what Tunku Abdul Rahman said\r\n\r\nrecently about closing the Causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You encouraged the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I encouraged the Tunku, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir?

No, Sir. These people have been doing\r\n\r\nthings  and  frightening everybody. They do  not  know.\r\n\r\nThey  may  not  know it.

Then  they  will\r\n\r\nbring upon themselves far greater misfortunes which  we\r\n\r\nwill not dwell upon at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> False hopes of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, they always accuse us of\r\n\r\nhoping  that retribution or disaster will befall  them,\r\n\r\nand  we keep on saying that our only purpose in drawing\r\n\r\ntheir  attention to a future disaster is to tell  them,\r\n\r\n\"Please  don't do these foolish things. You only  bring\r\n\r\ndisaster  upon  yourselves.\" Sir, all  our  admonitions\r\n\r\nhave always been greeted with scepticism perhaps, but I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that inwardly they are becoming more and  more\r\n\r\nconvinced  that what we say will happen  and  is  truer\r\n\r\nthan they would like to admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, viability of Singapore's economy in\r\n\r\nisolation - to me this question is a purely academic one,\r\n\r\nbecause if you were to deliver a lecture on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubject to, say, a group of professional economists you\r\n\r\nmust  define  various  things:  what  do  you  mean  by\r\n\r\nisolation?  Do  you mean that the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\n(1,700,000 of them) should live in isolation  as,  say,\r\n\r\nRobinson  Crusoe  did  in  the  past?  That   sort   of\r\n\r\nisolation,  I say, is not possible because  you  cannot\r\n\r\ngrow  enough food to feed 1,700,000 people.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhat   degree  of  isolation  do  you  mean?  And  this\r\n\r\npresupposes  all  kinds of political relationship  with\r\n\r\nour  neighbours.  A  friendly Federation  would  be  of\r\n\r\nimmense  economic benefit to Singapore. They  can  even\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to  bring  about  a common  commodity  market\r\n\r\nwithout  any  further trouble. On  the  other  hand,  a\r\n\r\nhostile  Federation can not only cause acute discomfort\r\n\r\nto  Singapore but tremendous loss. This proposition  is\r\n\r\nso obvious that I do not think any sane main will argue\r\n\r\nthe  case out. But I raise this point because  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  an impression among some Members  that\r\n\r\nwith  merger and Malaysia, why have this?  Will  it  no\r\n\r\nlonger  be  necessary? When you have a common commodity\r\n\r\nmarket,  why  do  you want a separate  Tariff  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommission? I would say that whether there is a  common\r\n\r\ncommodity market or not, there is need for this  Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Commission. If there is no  common  commodity\r\n\r\nmarket,  then we have, of course, a tariff against  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the world, including the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Federation are not prepared  to  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  us  and have a joint industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\nThen  we  go  it  alone and must  impose  a  tariff  on\r\n\r\nproducts  manufactured in the Federation of Malaya  and\r\n\r\nexported to Singapore. But even if there were a  common\r\n\r\ncommodity  market, obviously from time  to  time  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  instances when the Government would consider\r\n\r\nwhether this industry should be established and, if so,\r\n\r\nwould  the  imposition of a protective duty assist  the\r\n\r\nposition of the industry? If you have a tariff duty and\r\n\r\nyou  have this industry, how do you gauge the value  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  industry  and  employment  against  consumers\r\n\r\nhaving  to pay slightly higher prices? As I have  said,\r\n\r\nthe  same problem will confront the Government  whether\r\n\r\nwe have a common\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommodity  market  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  or\r\n\r\nwithin Greater Malaysia or whether we go it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is a basic\r\n\r\ndeparture  from the laissez-faire policy of the  State.\r\n\r\nIt  is for this reason that we are committing this Bill\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee so that all interested  parties\r\n\r\ncan   ventilate  their  opinions  before   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker as Chairman and five Members to be nominated by\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Selection.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it convenient to suspend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting.

The\r\n\r\ncurious  thing  is that Chaucer never  recognised  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  the greatest bar to recognition of  logic  and\r\n\r\nreason is personal malice. I sought, in speaking on the\r\n\r\nprevious Bill, to draw attention to the fact that there\r\n\r\nwas  a  danger  in  these  tariffs  nibbling  away  and\r\n\r\nnullifying  our tradition as an entrepot port,  a  free\r\n\r\nport.  I  made the point, Sir, that I recognised  there\r\n\r\nwould  be cases where individual industries could  have\r\n\r\nthe  potential for employment of a considerable  number\r\n\r\nof  people,  and in those individual cases  it  may  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  to grant tariff protection; but  that  any\r\n\r\nsuch  breach  in  the tradition of  the  free  port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should be made by this Assembly  after  full\r\n\r\ndebate.  I  was  represented by the Minister  as  being against  all tariffs. I also pointed out, Mr  Speaker, Sir, that an entrepot port does live on its reputation. There  is  mystique  in  reputation.  The  point,   Mr Speaker,  is  that where a country needs  supplies,  it comes  to Singapore now because it knows it can  obtain\r\n\r\nits supplies duty free. But if the time comes when some\r\n\r\nof  the goods will be duty free and some will not,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  a  question  of differentiation  and  different\r\n\r\nordering,  then such countries may find  it  much  more\r\n\r\nconvenient to go to an alternative port. There  is  one\r\n\r\nvery  handy  as a centre of supply, and  that  is  Hong\r\n\r\nKong. Sir, my point is this. I do not like the idea  of\r\n\r\nan  individual  having the power to bring  about  grave\r\n\r\nbreaches  in our tradition as a free port,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nthat aspect of the Bill to which I take exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Gob, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Anson considers,\r\n\r\nthat   before  import  duties  are  to  be  levied   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, they must be approved by the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, the decision to impose an  import\r\n\r\nduty  has  many  and serious implications.  First,  the\r\n\r\ntiming.  Second,  the  amount of  such  duties.  It  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that  if  you want to have  duties  levied  on\r\n\r\ngoods,  it  must  be done quickly and with  the  utmost\r\n\r\nsecrecy.  Otherwise,  before  duties  are  raised,  the\r\n\r\nmarket  will  be  brought to disorder  by  hoarding  by\r\n\r\nspeculators  and  by  all sorts of  malpractices.  This\r\n\r\npoint should be obvious to the Member for Anson. And  I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand  how  so obvious  a  point  has  not\r\n\r\noccurred to him. When you want to impose a duty, it  is\r\n\r\nnot possible to have a debate in the Assembly. You have\r\n\r\nto give notice of such debate, by which time there will\r\n\r\nbe  hoarding.  Goods  will have  disappeared  from  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  and the entrepot trade which the Member  seeks\r\n\r\nto  safeguard will be reduced to utter chaos the moment\r\n\r\npeople know that Government is contemplating imposing a\r\n\r\ntariff  On  a  particular day. If this is left  to  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the Government to do so,  the  scope  for\r\n\r\nspeculative  activity and manipulation  in  the  market\r\n\r\nwill be considerably reduced, although I grant that  it\r\n\r\ncannot be eliminated in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the change, the amendment to delegate the\r\n\r\npowers  which are now exercised by the Cabinet  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister, I do not know why this should cause  so  much\r\n\r\nconcern to the Member for Anson.

Hon. Members will\r\n\r\nrecall  that this Bill seeks to amend section 2 of  the\r\n\r\nRubber  Dealers Ordinance by providing a definition  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"purchase\",  for  the  purpose  of  removing\r\n\r\nuncertainty prevailing in the rubber market as  to  the\r\n\r\nvalidity  of  rubber contracts. This uncertainty  arose\r\n\r\nfrom the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of\r\n\r\nMizrahie versus Stanton Nelson Company Ltd., details of\r\n\r\nwhich were given in the speech of the Second Reading of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  The  Government considers it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nrestore  this clause in view of a recent Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya appeal allowed by the Judicial Committee of  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council on the ground that the currency was  not\r\n\r\nlicensed under the Rubber Dealers Ordinance to purchase\r\n\r\nrubber. Singapore's economy is largely founded  on  the\r\n\r\nrubber  trade. Today she is the world's largest  rubber\r\n\r\nmarket.  Forward dealings are carried out in all  major\r\n\r\ncommodity  markets of the world. It is  absurd  in  the\r\n\r\nworld's  largest rubber market that there should  be  a\r\n\r\nlegal  ambiguity whether or not forward  contracts  are\r\n\r\nenforceable  in  law. Yet this is  the  effect  of  the\r\n\r\nRubber  Dealers Ordinance as it stands, and the  effect\r\n\r\nis  clearly  not the intention. The proposed definition\r\n\r\nmakes  it clear that only purchases of specific  rubber\r\n\r\ncompleted by delivery need be covered by a licence  and\r\n\r\nthat  all contracts in purchase of unascertained rubber\r\n\r\nby  description do not require a licence on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  purchaser.  Thus it would ensure  that  legitimate\r\n\r\nhedging  operations could be carried out  without  fear\r\n\r\nthat  such  contracts would be declared  void  and  the\r\n\r\ngambling - reckless speculation - would be  curbed  as  the\r\n\r\ncontract  becomes  enforceable  in  law.

Sir, what is  a  hedging\r\n\r\noperation?  A  genuine dealer in rubber  undertakes  to\r\n\r\ndeliver,  let  us say, a hundred tons of  rubber  to  a\r\n\r\nconsignee in Germany. The delivery is in June. Then  he\r\n\r\ngoes round purchasing that physical rubber and projects\r\n\r\nhimself  against a fall by making some  purchases  now,\r\n\r\nsome  purchases in May and the final purchases in  time\r\n\r\nfor  delivery in Germany. These are the genuine dealers\r\n\r\nin  rubber. These are the backbone of the rubber trade.\r\n\r\nThese  are the people who, irrespective of whether  the\r\n\r\namendment is passed or not, must take out licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the obnoxious part of this Bill is that it seeks\r\n\r\nnot  to  protect hedging as is alleged, but to  protect\r\n\r\npure   gamblers - those  who  have  not  the   slightest\r\n\r\nintention   or  interest  in  receiving  or   supplying\r\n\r\nphysical rubber. The Minister himself in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe 15th of January spoke of paper rubber dealings.  He\r\n\r\nwants  to  legalise paper rubber dealings  without  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  a licence. It is not the  question  of\r\n\r\nhedging  purchases or hedging sales. Those  people  who\r\n\r\nmake deliveries must take out licences under the Rubber\r\n\r\nDealers  Ordinance. It is not they  whom  he  seeks  to\r\n\r\nprotect.  What is sought, in the words of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, is to legalise dealings in paper  rubber.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, these are gambling deals. I  say  to\r\n\r\nyou  the  approach  of this House  should  be  that  we\r\n\r\ndeplore  gambling.  We recognise  that  stock  exchange\r\n\r\ngambling is one of the diseases which seem inherent  in\r\n\r\na  free  economy and we will interfere  insofar  as  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  minimise  the vicious  effects  of  such\r\n\r\ngambling upon the small man. In this case, a ruling  of\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeal has indicated that in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngamble  in rubber, the person who makes those purchases\r\n\r\nshould  take out a licence. It is no more serious  than\r\n\r\nthat, Sir. All you have to do is to take out a licence.\r\n\r\nThe Minister must admit that there is not the slightest\r\n\r\nimpediment  to  anybody  taking  out  a  licence.   His\r\n\r\ncharacter  is  not investigated. He is  not  asked  his\r\n\r\npolitical affiliations. There is no enquiry as to  what\r\n\r\npublications he has been associated with. You put  down\r\n\r\n$600 a year; you put down a deposit of $1,000; you take\r\n\r\nout  your  licence to deal in rubber; you go ahead  and\r\n\r\ngamble to your heart's content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is alleged that this amendment is vital to the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore. But, Mr  Speaker,  have  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  deal in a manner that is material  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore in matters of rubber not got $600\r\n\r\na  year  for a licence or a $1,000 refundable  deposit?\r\n\r\nThat  is  all.  What I say is that anyone  whom  it  is\r\n\r\nsought  to inveigle into buying or selling paper rubber\r\n\r\nshould be sufficiently conscious of the gravity of  his\r\n\r\naction  and that this mild impediment of a $600 licence\r\n\r\nplus a deposit would be at least some deterrent. It  is\r\n\r\nno more than that. I ask this House to consider what is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  this very minimal protection that  is  now\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you are not unconscious that there is in times of boom or depression a large flux in prices of commodities like tin and rubber in this island when hopes of golden fortunes are held out to small men if they would come in and gamble on the stock exchange. It is to this silent voice of temptation to large-scale and ruinous gambling that I urge we leave the existing protection which says that if you, Mr Clerk, who earns\r\n\r\nonly  $400 a month, are going to lend yourself to  this\r\n\r\nplan  to  make vast fortunes or incur great losses,  at\r\n\r\nleast  you  must  first of all  put  down  $600  for  a\r\n\r\nlicence.  In  Monte  Carlo  you  need  no  licence.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore we do not ban large-scale gambling.  We  only\r\n\r\nban  gambling for the small man. The Chee Fah  and  the\r\n\r\nFantan participants are criminals. The gentlemen of the\r\n\r\nrubber  exchange who gamble in vast sums are  essential\r\n\r\nfor our economy. But all we ask is that they pay $600 a\r\n\r\nmonth  for  a  licence.

The  anxiety  indicated  by  this  Government\r\n\r\nbehind this move is a recognition by the rubber brokers\r\n\r\nthat the small man in Singapore and in Malaya who has a\r\n\r\nlittle  money  and  who is beginning  to  understand  a\r\n\r\nlittle about investing can be tempted to participate in\r\n\r\na gamble to buy and sell future paper rubber - to indulge\r\n\r\nin paper transactions in which he can make money, it is\r\n\r\ntrue, and he can also lose sums beyond his capacity  to\r\n\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a licence that exists today checks these\r\n\r\nsmall investors from entering too freely and too rashly\r\n\r\non  the  road to ruin. I ask, Sir, why in the  name  of\r\n\r\nsanity, if not of decency, do we have to encourage  the\r\n\r\nlittle  man  with little money to lend himself - and  his\r\n\r\nfamily  - to being a victim of rubber brokers and  paper\r\n\r\nrubber gambling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is our interest? Is it the protection of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, or is it the protection  of  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and  the  greater  glory  of  the   rubber\r\n\r\nbrokers?  What  is  this  P.A.P. Government - a  gambling\r\n\r\nsociety?  Or  has the Minister so much imbibed  of  the\r\n\r\nheavy  wine of capitalist hospitality that  he  has  no\r\n\r\nmore  feeling  for the little man and the little  man's\r\n\r\nneeds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is stated in the Explanatory Note to this Bill that we will be losing $39,000 a year in licence fees. That means $39,000 from persons who should be taking out licences today to gamble in paper rubber. But these are definitely persons who do not engage in the honest sale or honest purchase of physical rubber because, if they did, they would still have to obtain licences. There are therefore these\r\n\r\ngamblers  who even now take out licences.  But  if  you\r\n\r\ndivide  $39,000  by  600, Mr Speaker,  you  will  find\r\n\r\nfortunately that the number today of those  who  gamble\r\n\r\nin  paper rubber is not great, not great enough to meet\r\n\r\nthe  insatiate greed of the capitalist friends of  this\r\n\r\ncapitalist  Government.  I  do  plead  for  a  rational\r\n\r\nanswer.  What  is the objection to the existing  system\r\n\r\nwhereby  those who want to indulge in this roulette  in\r\n\r\nthe  golden  El Dorado should be required to  pay  $600\r\n\r\nentrance fee a year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson speaking on this particular section, it seems\r\n\r\nto  me that if the point to his objection is one  of  a\r\n\r\npermit  to  gamble,  then he has missed  the  boat.  He\r\n\r\nshould  have taken objection when the amendment to  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Law  Ordinance was moved and that was  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen the objection should have been taken. As far as  I\r\n\r\ncan  remember, the Member for Anson was present in  the\r\n\r\nHouse on that occasion when the amendment was moved  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Law  Ordinance which at that  time  forbade\r\n\r\ngambling  contracts to be entered into. But  subsequent\r\n\r\nto  that amendment, gambling contracts which have  been\r\n\r\ndeclared  illegal or unenforceable under the Civil  Law\r\n\r\nOrdinance  now can be enforced in a court  of  law.  If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the correct position and if it was the  Civil\r\n\r\nLaw  Ordinance that dealt with the gambling  aspect  of\r\n\r\nany  particular  contract, why then is the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson raising that particular problem which should have\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed on that particular amendment in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  Rubber Dealers Ordinance, which does not  deal\r\n\r\nwith the gambling side of a rubber transaction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far as I am concerned, this\r\n\r\nclause  which  seeks to define the word \"purchase\"  has\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary as a result of the amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nCivil Law Ordinance. We on this side of the House voted\r\n\r\nfor  the  amendment to the Civil Law Ordinance  and  we\r\n\r\nwould  have voted with the Government on this.  I  will\r\n\r\nnow  inform  the  Minister for  Finance  why  we  voted\r\n\r\nagainst  it.  On  that  occasion,  when  a  number   of\r\n\r\nquestions were being asked by Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the operation of this clause, they were\r\n\r\ntreated  cavalierly; no proper answers were  given.  It\r\n\r\nwas  for  that  reason that we did not  vote  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  that occasion. I mention this  because,\r\n\r\nhaving  voted  with the Government  on  the  Civil  Law\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  we  could not object to this  amendment  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we voted against the Government on that occasion\r\n\r\nto show our displeasure at the manner in which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment was treating the Opposition when it was\r\n\r\nraising what we thought were legitimate queries on how\r\n\r\nthis particular section would operate. Now if the\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to give all the proper\r\n\r\nexplanations on this particular section in a manner\r\n\r\nwhich it did not think fit to give on the last\r\n\r\noccasion, we will certainly vote for the Bill on this\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one would have\r\n\r\nthought that the subject of a rubber market is a\r\n\r\nserious one. It is not a subject which one can embark\r\n\r\non with wild fanciful oratory. Yet we have been treated\r\n\r\nby the Member for Anson to another prima donna\r\n\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained to Members that Singapore is the\r\n\r\nworld's largest rubber market. It has achieved its\r\n\r\nunique position not by the gambling propensities of\r\n\r\nrubber brokers. A rubber market of such eminence takes\r\n\r\nmany decades to build up, and to dismiss all dealings\r\n\r\nin paper rubber as sheer gambling, roulette gambling,\r\n\r\nis fantastic nonsense which I do not think any sane man\r\n\r\nwith knowledge of affairs would waste time to rebut.\r\n\r\nBut to give the Member for Anson his fair chance, I am\r\n\r\nunable to swallow the logic of his submission. First he\r\n\r\nsays, \"It is all right if they pay $600 a year.\" That\r\n\r\nis the admission charge to the \"casino\", as he calls\r\n\r\nthe rubber market. But he wants to protect the class of\r\n\r\nsmall men who he thinks go in the rubber market for an\r\n\r\noccasional flutter. Then he castigates the group of\r\n\r\npeople who would be contributing some $39,000 a year to\r\n\r\nGovernment revenue by taking up licences for dealings\r\n\r\nin paper rubber. I cannot reconcile his two objections\r\n\r\nand I will not try to swallow his arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only want to say something about the purposes for\r\n\r\nwhich the Rubber Dealers Ordinance was introduced in\r\n\r\nthis country and in the Federation. The Bill goes back\r\n\r\nto 1910, soon after the development of the rubber\r\n\r\nindustry. In its original form, it was just for the\r\n\r\npurposes of administration. But after the First World\r\n\r\nWar, in 1921, the Federation of Malaya and Singapore\r\n\r\nconsidered it necessary to restrict the production of\r\n\r\nrubber in order to raise its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprice. This was the first scheme. Then after the  great\r\n\r\ndepression in 1930, an international restriction scheme\r\n\r\nwas   established  between  the  Governments   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore, the then  Netherlands  East\r\n\r\nIndies,   Thailand,  Ceylon  and  other  major   rubber\r\n\r\nproducing  countries. Therefore,  this  Rubber  Dealers\r\n\r\nOrdinance  provides in the Federation and in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor various administrative measures which are necessary\r\n\r\nto  operate  a  restriction scheme to provide  for  the\r\n\r\ninspection of licensed places, the proper and  accurate\r\n\r\naccounting of purchases, dealers' stocks, and so on. We\r\n\r\nhad  no connection whatsoever with the operation of the\r\n\r\nrubber  market as such. If it is the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that stock exchange hedging operations\r\n\r\nare  legitimate  provided a fee is  paid,  then  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that he has missed the point? He  himself  has\r\n\r\nadmitted  that under the existing Ordinance anyone  can\r\n\r\nget  a  licence by paying a $1,000 deposit and  a  $600\r\n\r\nannual  fee.  That is no way to ensure that  those  who\r\n\r\noperate  the  rubber market are men of  some  financial\r\n\r\nworth.   To   ensure  that  the  market   consists   of\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  of repute, the Stock Exchange itself  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  rules  regulating the  conduct  of  its\r\n\r\nmembers. This is what is being done by the rubber trade\r\n\r\nassociations  and  the Singapore Chamber  of  Commerce.\r\n\r\nThey  are  there to ensure that a certain  standard  of\r\n\r\nintegrity is maintained in the rubber industry  without\r\n\r\nwhich it would not have been possible for Singapore  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  distinction of being the world's  largest\r\n\r\nrubber market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained at some length, one handicap which\r\n\r\nthe rubber business suffers from today is the ambiguity\r\n\r\nof the law in regard to the enforceability of contracts\r\n\r\nand  it  is  this ambiguity which the Bill  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse seeks to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, can I speak again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, we are in Committee. The Member can\r\n\r\nspeak as many times as he wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nhe  has not told you that the ambiguity is nothing more\r\n\r\nserious than should you have a licence or need you have\r\n\r\na licence? That is all the ambiguity which he considers\r\n\r\nso  vital  to remove for the enforcement of  contracts.\r\n\r\nBut  a  much  easier way and a healthier  way  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  is  that  the ambiguity should be  resolved  by\r\n\r\nsaying that all purchases whether in paper rubber or in\r\n\r\nphysical  rubber require a licence, and  let  them  pay\r\n\r\ntheir  $600  a  month. What is the  difficulty  of  the\r\n\r\nambiguity that exists today? The people who are  paying\r\n\r\n$39,000  a  year  are people who have  resolved  it  by\r\n\r\nmaking sure and taking out licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park has made a speech that does him least credit of all the speeches I have ever heard from him. It was based on inaccuracies to justify a change of stand - awkward and embarrassing! I would not wish to turn the knife in the wound. He is sufficiently sensitive to know what he is doing. But I must draw attention to two major inaccuracies. His whole thesis is, \"I do not like\r\n\r\nyou  as  I am on the Opposition side. We voted  against\r\n\r\nyou  because  you  were rude to the Opposition  in  the\r\n\r\nquestions  that  were  asked  about  this  Bill.\"   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  earlier,  I  expressed appreciation  of  your\r\n\r\nforesight  in making available to Members the unrevised\r\n\r\ntranscript  of  the proceedings of 15th January,  1962,\r\n\r\nwhich  dealt with this Bill and nowhere were there  any\r\n\r\nquestions   at   all.  There  were  speeches   by   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, followed by me,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary. That  was\r\n\r\nall  in  Committee. I spoke and nobody  even  cared  to\r\n\r\nreply;  and  a  division was called.  Though  I  am  in\r\n\r\ncomplete  accord with the Member for Farrer  Park  that\r\n\r\nthe  arrogance  of the Government side  is  of  such  a\r\n\r\ncharacter that it will sometimes provoke the Opposition\r\n\r\nto  deal out of fashion with their proposals, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we should accept that in fact the S.P.A. negated\r\n\r\na  provision  which they considered essential  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  this country because they  considered  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was rude about mythical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestions which did not exist in respect o rude answers\r\n\r\nthat for a change had not materialised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other inaccuracy is: the Member is wrong in\r\n\r\nthinking  that  I was in the Chamber at  the  time  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Law  Ordinance  was  passed.  But  that  is  not\r\n\r\nmaterial as I trust I can point out to him. My interest\r\n\r\nis  this. I have sought, I thought in my speech on  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading,  to point out that we  must  recognise\r\n\r\nthat in a free economy a certain amount of gambling  of\r\n\r\na   large-scale   character  by   big   financiers   is\r\n\r\ninevitable. It was not gambling contracts in rubber  as\r\n\r\na whole that I sought to make illegal. My desire is the\r\n\r\nprotection not of the large financier but of the  small\r\n\r\nman.  The  Civil  Law  Ordinance  made  these  gambling\r\n\r\ncontracts  legal. That is so. I feel, Sir,  much  as  I\r\n\r\ndislike that provision. I am not sufficiently satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  to  make  those contracts illegal would  not,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  in some measure prejudice the rubber trade which\r\n\r\nwe  have.  What I sought and what I seek  in  resisting\r\n\r\nthis  present proposal is to leave the mild  impediment\r\n\r\nthat exists today in requiring the small man to take  a\r\n\r\nvery  big  hurdle  in that $600 licence.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nsimple  logic. The Minister says I castigate those  who\r\n\r\npay  that  revenue to the State. Not at all.  They  are\r\n\r\ngamblers and those who pay that $600 are gamblers  too.\r\n\r\nThe transaction is legitimate. I know it is legitimate.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  like  it, Mr Speaker. I am  not,  however,\r\n\r\nadequately satisfied that one can safely eliminate  all\r\n\r\nthat  gambling, but I am satisfied that it is essential\r\n\r\none should protect the small man from gambling and that\r\n\r\nthe  existing  law which requires him to  take  a  $600\r\n\r\nlicence   before  he  can  indulge  in   paper   rubber\r\n\r\ntransactions  is  some  impediment,  some   protection,\r\n\r\nthought not complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not so naive that I can believe speeches in this House in the context of today have any material effect in changing minds. I am somewhat reminded of a biblical passage, \"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh.\" It is so true these days. But I do ask the S.P.A., who valiantly supported a reasonable resistance to the removal of a mild protection of the small man from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindulging in paper gambling, to reconsider their stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, I was almost prophetic\r\n\r\nwhen  I  rose on the motion to commit this Bill  for  a\r\n\r\nThird Reading earlier this afternoon and suggested that\r\n\r\nobviously  the  Government had  behind  the  scenes  so\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred  that  it was now satisfied  that  it  could\r\n\r\nobtain a majority. I did not know then what we know now\r\n\r\nof  the arrangement for voting which has transpired  in\r\n\r\nthe  speech of the Member for Farrer Park. But I  would\r\n\r\nurge  that  the reason and the justice of the  position\r\n\r\nshould  prevail  against  any political  consideration,\r\n\r\nassociation and undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I fully realise, Mr Speaker, that on that\r\n\r\nlast  occasion when there was an equality of votes and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, the provision was negatived, the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  was  the only speaker. So far as the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Front Bench of the Opposition were concerned, they\r\n\r\ndid  not  partake  in that opposition.  Then  when  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson was getting such a rough time from the\r\n\r\nGovernment Benches, and he was not given proper replies\r\n\r\nto  what  we  thought  were  legitimate  questions,  we\r\n\r\ndecided   to  vote  against  the  Government   because,\r\n\r\nalthough  it was the Member for Anson who  was  at  the\r\n\r\nwrong  end  of the stick, we thought that the questions\r\n\r\nraised  by  him  were  legitimate  questions  to  which\r\n\r\nreasonable answers should have been given. But as  they\r\n\r\nwere  not  provided and as from the Assembly  point  of\r\n\r\nview  satisfactory  answers were not  given,  we  voted\r\n\r\nagainst the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question I raised on this matter was this.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson made his speech on  this  clause\r\n\r\nwhich he should have made on the amendment to the Civil\r\n\r\nLaw  Ordinance.  The main part of his  speech  on  this\r\n\r\nparticular  section  of this clause  was  that  it  had\r\n\r\nsomething to do with gambling. Now, if it was  gambling\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Anson was against, then he  should\r\n\r\nhave  opposed  it  on the amendment to  the  Civil  Law\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  It was the Civil Law Ordinance that  opened\r\n\r\nthe  gates  to  gambling.

There the Ordinance was never\r\n\r\nintended to apply to rubber brokers and those who dealt\r\n\r\nin paper rubber. It was only after this case before the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal that rubber brokers thought they should\r\n\r\nattempt to regularise the position by taking out  these\r\n\r\nlicences.  That is the position. It is absurd  to  fall\r\n\r\nback  on an unintended levy on the rubber market  in  a\r\n\r\nstate  which  the  Member for  Anson  thinks  would  be\r\n\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all produce markets have some sections on paper\r\n\r\ncommodities. There is not a single commodity market  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  vast  majority of  such  sections  are  not\r\n\r\ncovered  by the physical product. That is so in rubber,\r\n\r\ncopper,  tin,  or any other commodity.  And  before  we\r\n\r\nstart fiddling around and imposing restrictions on  the\r\n\r\ncommodity  exchange,  particularly  on  one  in   which\r\n\r\nSingapore is the world's largest, i would say we have a\r\n\r\nduty  to make a proper and thorough examination of  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of produce marketing. I suggest that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has  made no such study.  He  is  blatantly\r\n\r\ntrying  to  appeal  to  people's  emotions  on  a  very\r\n\r\ntechnical  matter.

Although at times our efforts seem to be like water that disappears from the earth leaving no trace, nevertheless, Sir, that water has\r\n\r\nirrigated the subsoil and there is to those of  us  who\r\n\r\nseek to keep in touch with the common man of Singapore.\r\n\r\nof the different communities, the realisation of a very\r\n\r\nreal  feeling by the people that there is  strength  in\r\n\r\nthe  democratic process and in the power to  appoint  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  and  to reject a Party.  It  is  true  that\r\n\r\nrecently our citizens have been increasingly puzzled by\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  of the democratic process to  produce  a\r\n\r\ndictatorship  government between general elections.  It\r\n\r\nis  true that there is at the moment, Sir, an incipient\r\n\r\nsense  of  frustration and fear that the  people's  own\r\n\r\nrepresentatives whom the people trusted and  whom  they\r\n\r\nelected  will seek to destroy it. It is principally  to\r\n\r\nallay  this fear, a genuine fear in many circles,  that\r\n\r\nthis motion is brought in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Mr Speaker, that there is no need\r\n\r\nfor this motion, that the Prime Minister and the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, in their addresses to this Assembly  on\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum  Bill, have given assurances  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  be consulted before the proposals  for  a\r\n\r\ncloser  relationship  with the Federation,  which  they\r\n\r\ncall  a merger, are put into effect. I would draw  your\r\n\r\nattention,  Mr Speaker, to the unhappy nature  of  the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Prime Minister which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitself gave impetus to the misgivings of our people.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know, Mr Speaker, whether your memory can  go\r\n\r\nthat   far  to  the  16th  of  March - it  is  only  last\r\n\r\nmonth - when  the  Prime Minister in his address  on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  said.  \"The question  of  winning  or\r\n\r\nlosing  a referendum does not arise. If there  was  the\r\n\r\nslightest  risk  of  merger being  frustrated  and  the\r\n\r\ncountry plunged into disaster by the activities of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, let me say that it would be criminal  folly\r\n\r\non  the part of Government to hold a referendum and  to\r\n\r\nallow   the  future  of  Malaya  and  Malaysia  to   be\r\n\r\nimperilled.  If  that  were the  position, if  a  risk\r\n\r\nexisted;  then it is the duty of the Government  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough with it to ensure that the peace, security  and\r\n\r\nhappiness  of the people not just of Singapore  but  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and Malaysia are not jeopardised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of its frills, this statement of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  means  two things. One;  all  those  who  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  White Paper proposals  are,  by  official\r\n\r\ndefinition, Communists. Two, if there is any risk  that\r\n\r\nthose  against the White Paper proposals could negative\r\n\r\na  referendum, no referendum will be held. That is  the\r\n\r\ndemocracy   of  the  Prime  Minister:  \"I  believe   in\r\n\r\ndemocracy as long as it is advantageous to me. But when\r\n\r\ndemocracy  does  not support me, then  democracy  is  a\r\n\r\ncriminal  activity,  a criminal  folly  which  must  be\r\n\r\nsuppressed. My will is the will of the people,  but  if\r\n\r\nthe will of the people differs from my will, the people\r\n\r\nare  criminals and I shall do what I think is good  for\r\n\r\nthem, not what they think is good for them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is a couplet by Matthew Arnold:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Thoughts in hours of insight willed,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he in hours of gloom fulfilled,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Those of us who seek to pursue, not only for ourselves,\r\n\r\nthe  road of democracy, but to help others not only  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  it  and appreciate it  but  to  make  it  a\r\n\r\nreality  for  this  country and other  countries  which\r\n\r\ntoday suffer the rule of Communist dictatorship, we say\r\n\r\nthat there is a need to go back to first principles and\r\n\r\nto give a solemn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassurance to the people from the Assembly. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhatever  the ultimate result, the ultimate  action  on\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  proposals, an important  segment  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be  deeply  embittered  and   it   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that the `division created should be  healed\r\n\r\nas quickly as possible. If a referendum is held, giving\r\n\r\nan  honest opportunity to the `people to express  their\r\n\r\nviews,  however  strongly the minority may  feel,  they\r\n\r\nmust  accept  the will of the majority. It  is  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of this democratic principle of acceptance of the\r\n\r\nwill  of  .the  majority that  we  can  call  upon  the\r\n\r\nminority to accept with good grace and without  lasting\r\n\r\nbitterness the decision o, the majority. It is in  this\r\n\r\nway  that I hope and I believe we can avoid a permanent\r\n\r\nand  very  dangerous cleavage within our own  citizens,\r\n\r\nwhichever way the decision goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, apart from the normal obvious reasons for a referendum in a matter of such gravity, I ask this House to note that the people of the Federation would themselves wish to be quite certain that despite the opposition indicated in Singapore, if there is to be .a closer relationship in pursuance of the White Paper agreement, such closer relationship is in fact voluntarily entered into by Singapore with the express\r\n\r\napproval of the majority of its adult citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed, as very many others have been, by\r\n\r\nrecent  unfriendly  pronouncements  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and these, to my mind ill-timed threats,\r\n\r\nare causing a feeling of anxiety and suspicion that the\r\n\r\nFederation has decided to annex Singapore whether  with\r\n\r\nor without our permission. This is imperialism whatever\r\n\r\nthe  excuse. The pages of English colonial history  are\r\n\r\nfull  of  annexations  on  the  excuse  of  expediency.\r\n\r\nWhatever  may  be the truth about the attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, Sir, I am  convinced  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  Federation as a whole would  feel  far\r\n\r\nhappier if there is a referendum whereby the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore could have an `honest opportunity to  express\r\n\r\ntheir views so that no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion could possibly arise of domination imposed  in\r\n\r\nimperialist fashion against the will of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is these considerations which impel me to\r\n\r\nurge  this  House-I plead by a unanimous vote-to  allay\r\n\r\nthe  fears  `oth  of  the people of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\npeople of Federation in giving this assurance in solemn\r\n\r\nform:  that  on  a matter of gravity, the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of Singapore, the will of the people  will\r\n\r\nbe  ascertained by process of direct democracy and will\r\n\r\nbe complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all of us, I trust, in different ways sought\r\n\r\nto  bring  about an appreciation of the  value  of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process. I ask that through this  motion  we\r\n\r\nreaffirm not only our faith in what we preach  but  our\r\n\r\nintention to abide by what we preach. I would ask.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the bitterness of the different reactions\r\n\r\nand  views in respect of the merits and demerits of the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper be not introduced into the debate on  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  I  would urge that the principle it  seeks  to\r\n\r\nenunciate  should  be the one that  should  engage  the\r\n\r\nexclusive attention of the House during the debate.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is any amendment which can better bring out  the\r\n\r\nspirit  that I seek to enunciate, I would only  be  too\r\n\r\nhappy to consider it and to accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Members  of  this House will  recollect  that\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on merger between Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya which lasted from  the  20th  of\r\n\r\nNovember  to  the 6th of December, 1961,  everybody  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  accepted the desirability  of  merger  and\r\n\r\nnobody denied that merger was inevitable. At the end of\r\n\r\nthat   debate  on  the  6th  of  December,  this  House\r\n\r\nresolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That as an immediate practical step towards the ideal\r\n\r\ngoal of complete merger this House accepts the heads of\r\n\r\nagreement  set out in the White Paper Cmd. 33  of  1961\r\n\r\nagreed  to  between the Governments  of  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation of Malaya  as  a  working\r\n\r\nbasis for a reunification of the two territories.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although the Government had the mandate in the\r\n\r\n1959 general elections to settle the question of merger\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation, nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nfelt  it desirable that the electorate should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to express their views on the mode and\r\n\r\nmanner  of  the  reunification  of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Accordingly, on the 27th of November  last\r\n\r\nyear,  the  Minister  for Home Affairs  introduced  the\r\n\r\nSingapore National Referendum Bill. This Bill is now in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee and at some future date after the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  passed  through its Third Reading, the  referendum\r\n\r\nwill  be  held.  The responsibility for executing  this\r\n\r\nreferendum   will   be   the  responsibility   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The administration of the referendum  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  accordance  with the clauses of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill. In the Bill itself, provision\r\n\r\nis   made  for  political  Parties  to  be  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to inform the electorate of the  terms  of\r\n\r\nthe referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not like to interrupt the\r\n\r\nHon, the  Deputy Prime Minister, but he has  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill  is  now  before  a  Select  Committee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he must not assume that the clauses  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  will  be accepted. As far as possible, we  should\r\n\r\navoid referring to the details of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am just touching upon the Bill in\r\n\r\npassing,  Mr Speaker. I have no intention  to  specify\r\n\r\nany particular clause of the Bill itself. Although this\r\n\r\nBill  is still in Select Committee and has not yet been\r\n\r\nreported  to  the  House,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nalready  jumped  the  gun, and,  as  far  as  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  campaign for  referendum  has  already\r\n\r\nstarted.  The  Barisan Sosialis, in fact,  began  their\r\n\r\ncampaign  against merger and Malaysia on 1st of  April.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan Sosialis have sought to represent that the\r\n\r\nproposals  as contained in Cmd. Paper 33 are  proposals\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been put forward only by the P.A.P.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, Members of this House are aware  that\r\n\r\nCmd. Paper 33 also contains\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nletters  exchanged between the Prime Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and the Singapore Governments. These  state\r\n\r\nquite clearly that these proposals have been arrived at\r\n\r\nafter  discussion between the two Governments, in other\r\n\r\nwords, these proposals are not merely P.A.P. proposals,\r\n\r\nbut also proposals of the Federation Government. It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  utterly  absurd of the Barisan  Sosialis  to\r\n\r\npropagate    the   view   that   the   proposals    for\r\n\r\nSingapore/Federation merger, which include autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation  and labour for Singapore, are simply  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals.  In fact, this House on the 6th of  December\r\n\r\naccepted  Cmd.  Paper  33, which  had  been  agreed  to\r\n\r\nbetween the Singapore and Federation Governments, as  a\r\n\r\nworking   basis  for  the  reunification  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories.  This exposes the deceit  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the Barisan Sosialis have already\r\n\r\nstarted  their  referendum campaign. For this  purpose,\r\n\r\nthey   have  issued  a  pamphlet  against  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. About Malaysia, it has this to say -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Deputy Prime Minister will be\r\n\r\nperfectly  in  order if he mentions  this  campaign  in\r\n\r\npassing.  But  if he goes into details,  I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that those details might take him far away from\r\n\r\nthe motion itself, unless, of course, he can satisfy me\r\n\r\nthat  they will not do so. We are now debating a motion\r\n\r\nwhich  ask for an assurance that this matter of merger - I  am paraphrasing, of course - be referred to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore by way of a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, since I have already\r\n\r\nstated that the Barisan Sosialis have already started a\r\n\r\nreferendum  campaign, it is necessary that  this  House\r\n\r\nshould also be acquainted with the propaganda that they\r\n\r\nhave  put  out in the campaign. On previous  occasions,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and I had given assurances that this\r\n\r\nreferendum would be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions for the holding of this referendum are\r\n\r\ncontained in the National Referendum Bill, which itself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis in Select Committee. Therefore, while the Bill is in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, for the Barisan Sosialis to  go  out\r\n\r\nand  start  a  referendum campaign is just jumping  the\r\n\r\ngun. Hence I would like to be given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the House what the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nstated in their campaign on the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmust  satisfy himself, satisfy me and satisfy the House\r\n\r\nthat  what the Barisan Sosialis are now doing has  some\r\n\r\nreference to the motion we are now discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will refer to\r\n\r\nthe  motion  put forward by the Member for  Anson,  you\r\n\r\nwill see a sentence there which is pertinent to what  I\r\n\r\nwould like to bring out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a\r\n\r\ncloser  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request\r\n\r\nis  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British\r\n\r\nGovernment for transfer of territorial sovereignty over\r\n\r\nSingapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be  ascertained\r\n\r\nby referendum...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is assumed in this motion that there will be a\r\n\r\ncloser  relationship between the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Borneo  territories.  This  motion\r\n\r\nimplicitly states so. In the campaign which the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have conducted, a contrary attitude has  been\r\n\r\nassumed. In fact, the stand they take in their campaign\r\n\r\nis against a closer relationship between Singapore, the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya and the `Borneo territories,  and\r\n\r\nit  is precisely this point which I would like to  deal\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this pamphlet which they have issued entitled\r\n\r\n\"Everyone  must know the whole truth about  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia\",  there are two versions of  the  propaganda.\r\n\r\nOne version is printed in Chinese and the other version\r\n\r\nis  printed in' English.

We are now debating a motion  and\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister must indicate whether he  is\r\n\r\nin  favour  of or against the motion. What the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have  done has got nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nmotion at the moment.

I do not think the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is entitled to do that.

Paper No. 33. I think it would indeed\r\n\r\nelevate the standing of the Member for Anson if he  had\r\n\r\nalso appealed to the House that no Member in this House\r\n\r\nshould  use  the  opportunity of  this  debate  or  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  the  referendum  campaign  to   incite\r\n\r\nfeelings   of  race  against  race.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nAnson - better   known  now  as   the   Pied   Piper   of\r\n\r\nAnson - himself  is fully aware that as a result  of  the\r\n\r\npropaganda  put forward by the Barisan Sosialis,  there\r\n\r\nis  indeed  a  rising  tension  between  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis  started\r\n\r\ntheir  referendum campaign on 1st April, which is  also\r\n\r\nknown  as April Fool's Day. There may be fools  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  but  we do not  think  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are going to fool the people of Singapore with\r\n\r\ntheir childish and stupid propaganda nor are they going\r\n\r\nto   fool  the  Tunku,  the  Prime  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  with  their mystery  letter  delivered  at\r\n\r\nFederation House. I do not know whether there was a tea\r\n\r\nparty  at  Federation  House, or whether  there  was  a\r\n\r\nsecret tea party which the Barisan bosses had with  the\r\n\r\nBritish imperialists at Eden Hall: but nonetheless  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of  the Federation  gave  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  a  very  courteous  reply  indeed.  That  was\r\n\r\nadmitted  by  the  Secretary-General  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong himself,  in  a  Press\r\n\r\ninterview.  In  return for that courtesy,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have referred to the Tunku, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why is Malaysia a British plot? Why do the British\r\n\r\nchoose the Tunku?'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The answer given in this pamphlet is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This will allow the Tunku to look after the British\r\n\r\ninterests both economically -'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, to the dangers  which  would\r\n\r\narise  if  any Member in this Chamber were to  use  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  campaign or the opportunity  of  debate  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  to play up communal feelings. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in their propaganda have said that there would\r\n\r\nbe different classes of Singapore citizenship according\r\n\r\nto  whether  a  person was born in  Singapore, in  the\r\n\r\nFederation, in China, in India and whether a person  is\r\n\r\na  Malay.  It  is  a  tragedy indeed that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in their desperation should seek to divide the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  and  thereby  hope  that  enough\r\n\r\nsuspicion   and  distrust  be  whipped  up  among   the\r\n\r\ndifferent communities in Singapore so that merger would\r\n\r\nnot  be  brought  about.

It  was  with  a\r\n\r\nsincere  desire  to  conduct the  referendum  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs introduced this Bill. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  he  has even agreed with  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition that this Bill should be discussed in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee so that the views on how the referendum would\r\n\r\nbe conducted could also be considered. Therefore, as  I\r\n\r\nhave previously said, since the responsibility for  the\r\n\r\nadministration of this referendum is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  Government,  I  would  like  to  introduce  an\r\n\r\namendment  to the motion put forward by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out, after the word \"That\", the words \"this\r\n\r\nAssembly  solemnly  assures the citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  before  arrangements are finalised for  a  closer\r\n\r\nrelationship with the Federation of Malaya  and/or  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories,\", and insert \"in view of the Govern\r\n\r\nment's clearly stated stand on the question `of merger,\r\n\r\nthis  House  welcomes the Government's introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore National Referendum Bill in order to hold\r\n\r\na  referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people  on\r\n\r\nthe mode and manner of the inevitable reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   the  Federation  of   Malaya   before\r\n\r\narrangements are finalised\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out after the words \"Federation of Malaya or\r\n\r\nMalaysia\",\",the wishes of the voters of Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe  ascertained  by referendum and the Government  will\r\n\r\nact  in  accordance with the views of our  citizens  so\r\n\r\nexpressed\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>the amended motion will read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That in view of the Government's clearly stated stand\r\n\r\non  the  question  of merger, this House  welcomes  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and\r\n\r\nmanner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are\r\n\r\nfinalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore to the British Government  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya or Malaysia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have a copy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment in substance is in order,\r\n\r\nbut the format should be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from \"That\" in line 1 to the end, and\r\n\r\ninsert  \"in  view  of the Government's  clearly  stated\r\n\r\nstand  on  the question of merger, this House  welcomes\r\n\r\nthe Government's introduction of the Singapore National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and\r\n\r\nmanner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are\r\n\r\nfinalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore to the British Government  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya or Malaysia\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That covers the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> indicated assent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I draw your attention to the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  motion  seeks  an assurance?

No wonder the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said it would be criminal folly if there was a\r\n\r\nrisk  of  losing the referendum.

The White\r\n\r\nPaper  has  been presented by the P.A.P. Government  to the House. The P.A.P. Government have taken great pains to explain their merger proposals to the people through Radio   P.A.P.,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  pamphlets, Malaysia  Week,  Malaysia  racing  vehicles - the   Grand Prix - and, of course, the newspapers. They have spent  a lot  of money on it. They have also sent touring  teams over to the Borneo territories and to the Federation in\r\n\r\nthe  guise of playing football, basketball, and  table\r\n\r\ntennis  matches to publicise the P.A.P. type of  merger\r\n\r\nto the people. The P.A.P. merger proposals are concrete\r\n\r\nproposals which have been suggested and accepted by the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments. They had spent considerable  time  to\r\n\r\nget  the  White Paper ready so that they could  present\r\n\r\nthe  heads of agreement as embodied in the White  Paper\r\n\r\n(Command Paper 33) to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, Sir, the P.A.P. should be\r\n\r\nvery proud of those proposals. They should have nothing\r\n\r\nto  worry about and nothing to fear. They should  under\r\n\r\nno  circumstances be ashamed of putting those proposals\r\n\r\nbefore  the  people. If the proposals are so  good,  as\r\n\r\nthey  have all the time claimed them to be, then  there\r\n\r\nis  no  reason why the P.A.P. Government should now  be\r\n\r\nafraid  to put them before the people as the real  test\r\n\r\nas to whether or not they are acceptable to the people.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, they should be very happy to ask for a simple\r\n\r\nyes  or no to the proposals which they have taken  such\r\n\r\ngreat  pains to get ready. It had been the Government's\r\n\r\nintention to bring these White Paper proposals  to  the\r\n\r\npeople for endorsement. But, Sir, it is generally known\r\n\r\noutside that these proposals of the P.A.P. are not such\r\n\r\ngood things as they are made out to be. The P.A.P. too\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  White Paper proposals  are  completely\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> To you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If, as the Member for Tampines\r\n\r\nthinks, it is only unacceptable to me, then here  is  a\r\n\r\nclear chance for the Government to put them before  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what they should do.\r\n\r\nTherefore, under those circumstances, we see no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy the Government Benches cannot accept our amendment.\r\n\r\nSince  the grand old man of this House and of the Party\r\n\r\nhas  given the word, I hope the Front Benches, as  they\r\n\r\nare  much  younger will listen to his  wisdom  and  put\r\n\r\nthese  proposals  before the people.

Is  there  any\r\n\r\nother point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the amendment is\r\n\r\nnegatived, it may well be that Members do not  want  to\r\n\r\ndelete   the   additional  line  which   involves   the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya. Surely. Sir, then the other amendment should be\r\n\r\nput as to the deletion of the first six lines \"mode and\r\n\r\nmanner  of  the inevitable\", to ascertain  whether  the\r\n\r\nrest  would  be acceptable. As I understand the  normal\r\n\r\nprocedure, an amendment to an amendment is taken first.\r\n\r\nIt  has  priority. Then the amendment  itself,  if  the\r\n\r\namendment to it is defeated, is put to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Anson then suggests that\r\n\r\nMembers  might  wish to retain the words \"reunification\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya\" as well as  the\r\n\r\nother  words proposed by the Member for Anson  himself.\r\n\r\nWell, in that case, the first Question which I will put\r\n\r\nthen  is,  \"That the words `reunification of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Federation of Malaya' proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, on the amendments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, I presume I am\r\n\r\ntalking  on  the  amendment to  the  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, personally I do not think there is\r\n\r\nmuch difference in intent between the amendment by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson and the amendment by the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  because  during the three-quarters  of  an\r\n\r\nhour  recess  that we had, obviously  there  have  been\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts on the amendment moved by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. So as far as intention is concerned,  there\r\n\r\nis  really no basic difference except that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have gone further and revealed their hand. One\r\n\r\nof  the omissions is the word \"reunification\" which  is\r\n\r\nobviously  a retrogression from the amendment  made  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson who at least makes a semblance  of\r\n\r\nbelieving  in  merger.  But the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nobviously come to the conclusion that what they  really\r\n\r\nwant  is an independent Singapore. Now they want a  way\r\n\r\nout  to prepare the ground for the next phase of  their\r\n\r\npropaganda,   that  what  they  really   want   is   an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an indication of the deliberate attempt on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Barisan Sosialis, to mislead  the  House,\r\n\r\npart  of  their technique is to accuse other people  of\r\n\r\ndistortion:  of  falsehoods. As regards  the  statement\r\n\r\nmade  just  a  few  minutes  ago  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown wherein he denied that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhad ever suggested that they wanted merger on the basis\r\n\r\nof  Penang and Malacca, that was one of the slips  they\r\n\r\nmade. Those of us who read their publications know that\r\n\r\nthey are now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrying to wriggle out of it by saying, never said these\r\n\r\nthings. That is a complete distortion of our stand  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.\" Sir, by a stroke of  good  luck,  we\r\n\r\nhave  here  copies  of  the letters  sent  by  all  the\r\n\r\npolitical Parties to the Deputy Prime Minister when  he\r\n\r\nasked them to state their stand on merger. There is one\r\n\r\nfrom  the S.P.A., one from the Workers' Party  and  one\r\n\r\nfrom the Barisan Sosialis. A few minutes ago, Sir,  for\r\n\r\nthe record the Member for Queenstown said that that was\r\n\r\na complete distortion. I want to say that it is just as\r\n\r\nwell  for  us to bear in mind that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  now  come to a point where they are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ntell  falsehoods  in  the belief that  they  cannot  be\r\n\r\nchallenged.  One  of  the reasons why  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and his friends avoid coming  to  a  debate\r\n\r\nover  the radio is that they can be challenged. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  here a copy of the letter which their Party  sent\r\n\r\nofficially  to  the Deputy Prime Minister  stating  the\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of their merger. This is what they\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for reunification of our country and\r\n\r\nour  people  is  in one of two directions - an  immediate\r\n\r\nfull  and  complete merger with Singapore  joining  the\r\n\r\nFederation  as  a  constituent state  like  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

I think it is now necessary for\r\n\r\nus  and for the people of Singapore to take the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  not  as  a  body of men whose  words  can  be\r\n\r\ntrusted  hut as men who are prepared to twist and  turn\r\n\r\nand  even prepared to spit at their own words. Take the\r\n\r\ndocument that they sent officially to the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister who asked them to state their stand on merger.\r\n\r\nThey  are prepared to spit on what they themselves have\r\n\r\nwritten  in black and white, just as they are  prepared\r\n\r\nto spit on their undertaking that if they were expelled\r\n\r\nfrom the Party they would resign. They have now come to\r\n\r\nbe  real  full-fledged Communists who, as  one  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  tenets  says, must be prepared  to  lie  and\r\n\r\ndistort  facts so as to serve the cause for which  they\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the amendment, apart from the careful\r\n\r\nprecaution  of  leaving out \"reunification\",  it  means\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are now taking the next step - which  we\r\n\r\nhave   predicted - of   fighting   for   an   independent\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is what they want. As their logic  has\r\n\r\ndriven them to spout communal and racial propaganda, so\r\n\r\nthey  must  now  take the next step  to  fight  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore, and that, Sir, is one reason why\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary  for  them  to  leave  out  the  word\r\n\r\n\"reunification\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the latter part of the amendment, it is\r\n\r\nquite  clear that it has nothing to do with the  spirit\r\n\r\nand  intent of the motion, which is to get an assurance\r\n\r\nfrom the Government that a referendum will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On what basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But this amendment goes a bit further\r\n\r\nthan  that. They are now trying to commit the House  to\r\n\r\nstate beforehand the terms of the referendum. That is a\r\n\r\nmatter  outside the scope of the motion. What they  are\r\n\r\nsaying  is  that now the Government should state,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nthis  is  how  we  should set the question.\"  When  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill is before this House, then it  will  be\r\n\r\ndecided as to who sets the question and how it will  be\r\n\r\nset.  Therefore, this amendment is an attempt - obviously\r\n\r\nduring the three-quarters of an hour break some of  the\r\n\r\nbright boys thought it out - to commit the House to state\r\n\r\nbeforehand the terms of the referendum. By the deletion\r\n\r\nof   the  words  \"mode  and  manner\",  they  are  again\r\n\r\nsubstantiating our contention that they are  no  longer\r\n\r\ninterested in merger. The words \"mode and manner\"  were\r\n\r\nintroduced because all of us - the Barisan Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party,  the United People's Party - believe  in\r\n\r\nmerger.  We believe in merger in principle. We  believe\r\n\r\nin the concept of merger in the abstract. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nsay,  \"That  is  right. Everybody believes  in  merger.\r\n\r\nNobody disagrees with merger.\" So what we want to  find\r\n\r\nout is the \"mode and manner\": what kind of merger do we\r\n\r\nwant?  That is a matter which will be decided when  the\r\n\r\nreferendum is framed. Therefore, this amendment to  the\r\n\r\namendment  to the amendment is an attempt to go  beyond\r\n\r\nthe original spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  intent of the motion to commit the House to decide\r\n\r\nbeforehand on how the referendum should be framed. That\r\n\r\nis  not the purpose. The purpose is to get an assurance\r\n\r\nfrom  this  House  and  from  the  Government  that   a\r\n\r\nreferendum will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown quoted the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson - I am always very intrigued to note how they quote\r\n\r\neach  other.  The  Member for Anson uses  phrases  like\r\n\r\n\"majority  dictatorship\".  Obviously  he  believes   in\r\n\r\nminority  dictatorship. The Member  for  Queenstown  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  tenderfoot in this business.  He  talks  about\r\n\r\nparliamentary dictatorship. Sin, I have never seen such\r\n\r\na term as \"parliamentary dictatorship\" in any political\r\n\r\nscience   textbook.   I   would   have   thought   that\r\n\r\n\"parliamentary\"  was a negation of \"dictatorship\",  but\r\n\r\nobviously in the logic of the Barisan Sosialis, two and\r\n\r\ntwo  make  five: black is white; you put out a  written\r\n\r\nstatement saying that you believe in merger like Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca, and three months later you say  that  you\r\n\r\nnever  said  such a thing; and when copies  of  such  a\r\n\r\nstatement  are presented to them, they say.  \"Oh,  read\r\n\r\nthe  whole text - 12 pages of text.\" Therefore, when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown says, \"Oh, the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nhas  said  that the Government is going  to  frame  the\r\n\r\nquestion  for referendum asking whether one would  like\r\n\r\nto  die by drowning or by hanging,\" I can give him  the\r\n\r\nassurance  here  and now that such a  question  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be   submitted for the consideration  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. If there  is  going  to  be  any\r\n\r\nhanging,  the  hanging  will be  done  by  the  Members\r\n\r\nconcerned; but as far as we are concerned, I  can  give\r\n\r\nthe  same  assurance to the Member  for  Anson  who  is\r\n\r\nalways caught in his own metaphors. He starts off  with\r\n\r\na  metaphor, which, for him, becomes a fact, so much so\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Queenstown gets also worked up  and\r\n\r\nsays, \"Oh, the people want to live. They do not want to\r\n\r\ndie.\" But I can assure him that that is not going to be\r\n\r\none  of the questions. The people are not going  to  be\r\n\r\nasked  whether  they  want to  die  by  hanging  or  by\r\n\r\ndrowning or by any other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans.  The questions are going to be far more  serious\r\n\r\nthan  that  though it might result in  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  who  have  already  started  on   a\r\n\r\nsuicidal course, probably being driven to that  extreme\r\n\r\nas a way out of their difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore submit that this amendment is,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  an  attempt to go beyond  the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal motion - and even of the amended motion  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - to  more  or less commit  this  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nframing  the questions for the referendum. I can  quite\r\n\r\nunderstand  the anxiety that the Barisan Sosialis  feel\r\n\r\nabout the type of questions that are going to be put to\r\n\r\nthe   people.  Because  of  their  own  blunders,  they\r\n\r\ncommitted  themselves first to merger on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca. They then committed themselves  to\r\n\r\nmerger   as  a  concept;  and  they  finally  committed\r\n\r\nthemselves  to internal self-government for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,    they   cannot   reconcile    all    these\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  The  fate and future  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and of the Communists who direct them  is  now\r\n\r\ndependent  on  one, or two, or three, or  five  or  ten\r\n\r\ncrosses  that are going to be put on the ballot  paper.\r\n\r\nThat  will seal the fate of the Malayan Communist Party\r\n\r\nwho for 30 years have struggled for something which  is\r\n\r\nnow  going to be  lost as a result of the voting on  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. All the work of 30 years has now to  go  by\r\n\r\nthe board. Therefore, it is a life and death battle for\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Communists who are directing the gentlemen\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan Sosialis. During a war, if you want  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  whether there is a land mine, you  send  the\r\n\r\nsheep  first; and that is the role the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare playing. They are now in the minefield. A sheep  is\r\n\r\nin  the  minefield. They know that the mines are  there\r\n\r\nand  that they will be detonated and exploded  the  day\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore go and vote on  the  question\r\n\r\nthat  will be put to them by the Government. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to digress,, but it is necessary for me to explain\r\n\r\nwhy  it  is  important to frame the questions  for  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  in such a way as to ensure that the  people\r\n\r\nunderstand  what, they  are voting  for,  because  the\r\n\r\nBarisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis  have  twisted  and turned  this  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger  so  much  so that today everybody  is  confused\r\n\r\nabout  it.  Today  they have come back  to  their  last\r\n\r\nweapon - \"This is a Chinese versus Malays  issue.\"  They\r\n\r\nhave made such a `statement and they have now descended\r\n\r\nto   using  the  lowliest  weapon.  Therefore,  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to see that, when the questions  for\r\n\r\nthe referendum are framed, they will not be put in such\r\n\r\na way as to confuse the people but that it will be made\r\n\r\nquite clear to the people what the real issues involved\r\n\r\nin  merger are, so that they will be able to vote in an\r\n\r\nintelligent  fashion,  because the  questions  will  be\r\n\r\nposed in an intelligent way and not in the way that the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis want. They want them to be put in such\r\n\r\na way that they can go round telling the people, \"There\r\n\r\nyou  are. The Malays will come and rule this place, it\r\n\r\nis  a  sell-out  to the Malays.\" That  is  a  dangerous\r\n\r\nweapon.  Let me tell them, Sir, that in India also  the\r\n\r\nCommunists tried it. In Ceylon too they tried  it.  And\r\n\r\nthe  ones  who were destroyed were the Communist  Party\r\n\r\nelements, and not the non-Communist elements. So  those\r\n\r\nwho  take  up the communal weapon will be destroyed  by\r\n\r\nthe  communal weapon. We are not afraid of  that,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThey  are  afraid. That is why they are now  trying  to\r\n\r\noppose  this  motion so that they can ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions for the referendum are framed in the way they\r\n\r\nwant  them to be framed. We are not such saps. For nine\r\n\r\nmonths  we have struggled not with the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nbut  with  the boys behind them. They know  that  today\r\n\r\nthey have come to a dead end. They see a blank wall and\r\n\r\nnow have no choice but either to climb it or retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First,\r\n\r\nit  is an attempt to inveigle the House into voting for\r\n\r\nsomething which has nothing to do with the real  intent\r\n\r\nand purpose of this motion. Second, it is an indication\r\n\r\nof  the  thinking of the Barisan Sosialis.  Today  they\r\n\r\nhave come to point that what they really want to start,\r\n\r\nas  the next phase of their battle, is the fight for an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite well known, Sir, that at the last meeting\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore General Employees'  Union,  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  did  say openly at this  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\ncadres  that  they  should  fight  for  an  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore. I think the Member for Anson would  be  very\r\n\r\nrelieved  to  hear that, because that was what  he  had\r\n\r\nbeen pressing for. We are passing him a tip so that  he\r\n\r\nmay enter into negotiations with Mr Lim Ching Siong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where was this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Then, Sir, at the annual meeting of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore General Employees' Union at the Victoria\r\n\r\nMemorial Hall, Mr Lim Ching Siong said, \"We must fight\r\n\r\nfor  an  independent  Singapore.  The  masses  are  now\r\n\r\nfighting  a desperate battle.\" When they say  \"masses\",\r\n\r\nwe know it means the Barisan Sosialis. We are passing a\r\n\r\nfriendly tip to the Member for Anson who has been  more\r\n\r\nor  less  running them down, saying that  while  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared  for  an  independent  Singapore  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   want   only  an  internally   self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The only way left for it is  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  successfully its White Paper  proposals  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  and,  as  we have said in  the  last  Assembly\r\n\r\ndebate, to put out an alternative, as what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas said just now, a Penang and Malacca type of merger,\r\n\r\nwhich  the Opposition Parties in this Assembly did  not\r\n\r\nvote for, at least not we in the U.P.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 12th October, 1961, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister wrote to the leaders of the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly.  The  Workers'  Party,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, and the U.P.P. asked the Leader of the  House\r\n\r\nto  convene  an  emergency sitting of the  Assembly  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the P.A.P.'s merger proposals. The contents  of\r\n\r\nthe  letter  addressed to the leaders of the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  were  released to the Straits  Times  on  15th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1961. I shall quote extracts from the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of 15th October, 1961. The Prime Minister wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"Not only you as Members of the Opposition but also\r\n\r\nthe  whole of the people of Singapore should  be  fully\r\n\r\ninformed  of the agreement in principle that  has  been\r\n\r\nreached between the two Governments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added: \"Every step forward made should be\r\n\r\ncommunicated  to you as Members of the  Opposition  and\r\n\r\nalso to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government when all the\r\n\r\ndetails  have been worked out to publish  a  paper  and\r\n\r\ntable  it  in the Legislative Assembly for debate.

But there  is  this  last\r\n\r\nsentence which the Prime Minister wrote to the  leaders\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition Parties. \"The people can accept  or\r\n\r\nreject them.\" That means that a referendum will be held\r\n\r\nand  the  people can accept or reject the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, not only is the Government committed\r\n\r\nto  a  referendum in this letter of 12th October, 1961,\r\n\r\naddressed to all leaders of the Opposition  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParties, but it is further committed in that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  posed in the referendum will be  whether  the\r\n\r\npeople accept or reject the White Paper proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last referendum held in the\r\n\r\nworld   was   the  one  held  in  France  on   Algerian\r\n\r\nindependence.  The people of France were  asked  either\r\n\r\n\"oui\"  or \"non\" (yes or no) to whether they agree  (yes\r\n\r\nor  no)  to  giving Algeria independence. I shall  also\r\n\r\nquote a book which shows the referendum process held in\r\n\r\nAustralia  in 1951. The book is entitled Communism  and\r\n\r\nDemocracy  in Australia, and is written by  Webb.  Page\r\n\r\n50:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The form of the ballot paper for a referendum is set\r\n\r\nout  in  a  schedule  to  the Referendum  (Constitution\r\n\r\nAlteration) Act, and the ballot paper itself gives  the\r\n\r\nfollowing instructions on how to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If you approve of the proposed law, place the number\r\n\r\n1 in the square opposite the word \"Yes\", and the number\r\n\r\n2  in the square opposite the word \"No\". If you do  not\r\n\r\napprove of the proposed law, place the number 1 in  the\r\n\r\nsquare opposite the word \"No\", and the number 2 in  the\r\n\r\nsquare opposite the word \"Yes\".\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, it is described in this book that in\r\n\r\nthe  Australian  Referendum Act,  the  wording  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  contained in the  Act  itself,  and  no\r\n\r\ngovernment  in power can play the fool in a referendum.\r\n\r\nIn  the  1951 referendum, the question asked was this - I\r\n\r\nshall quote page 51:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the 1951 referendum the question asked on the\r\n\r\nballot  paper  was: Do you approve of the proposed  law\r\n\r\nfor   the   alteration  of  the  Constitution  entitled\r\n\r\nConstitution   (A  Iteration  Powers)  to   deal   with\r\n\r\nCommunists and Communism, 1951?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, in all referendum processes in  the\r\n\r\nworld, the question posed before the voters always asks\r\n\r\nthe  voter  yes  or no'. If we accept  this  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess  practised  in other countries  and  which  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has promised Members of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nthen the question which the Government should pose  is:\r\n\r\n\"Do  you approve of the White Paper proposals or  not?\"\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, it will not be fair and it  will  be\r\n\r\nundemocratic  if  the workers are  asked  whether  they\r\n\r\nprefer  which  manner  and mode  of  merger - the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger proposals as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontained  in Paper Cmd. 33, or the Penang and  Malacca\r\n\r\ntype of merger which none of the Opposition Parties  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly has supported. The Opposition Parties  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly never voted for a Penang/Malacca type  of\r\n\r\nmerger. If the worst comes to the worst and the  people\r\n\r\nwere  asked what type of merger they would prefer, then\r\n\r\nthe   ballot   paper  should  put   forward   the   two\r\n\r\nalternatives  which the two groups of Parties  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly have supported. One alternative was the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger  proposals, and  the  other  is  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  with automatic Federal citizenship  rights  for\r\n\r\nall Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, whenever the\r\n\r\nquestion of merger or a form of close association  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation is considered, we always reach a  stage\r\n\r\nwhere we break records in this Assembly! The last  time\r\n\r\nwe  debated merger, I think the debate went on  for  12\r\n\r\ndays.  This  time  when it comes  close  to  merger  or\r\n\r\nsomething  related to merger, we have three  amendments\r\n\r\non  an  original motion. To my knowledge, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat has never happened in the history of this Assembly\r\n\r\nor   of   any  other  Assembly  since  elections   were\r\n\r\nintroduced into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position seems to be a very curious one. Whenever\r\n\r\nmerger  or  anything connected with it is discussed  in\r\n\r\nthis august Chamber, everybody is agreed on merger. Not\r\n\r\na  soul dissents from it. The Member for Anson possibly\r\n\r\nhad some doubts whether any form of merger was the best\r\n\r\nthing  and whether it might not be better for Singapore\r\n\r\nto  be independent. He certainly voiced that doubt. But\r\n\r\nother  than  him, every single Member  in  this  House,\r\n\r\nwhether he belonged to a Party or not, supported merger\r\n\r\nand  supported  a closer form of association  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. So that when we had completed the  previous\r\n\r\ndebate on merger, two clear issues seemed to emerge  at\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion of that debate. The first one  was  the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals as set out in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  which the House eventually approved.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  was  the  merger proposal as  set  out  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, which was, at least in so far as  the\r\n\r\ndebate  related  itself to the motion,  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  come  in  as the twelfth State  (thirteenth  or\r\n\r\nfourteenth,  as  the  case may be),  and  exactly  like\r\n\r\nJohore or any other State. That was the way it was put.\r\n\r\nMalacca  and Penang were studiously avoided  from  that\r\n\r\ndebate, as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, Mr Speaker, as far as I can make out, the\r\n\r\nposition  today is this: all the political Parties  are\r\n\r\nagreed on merger. But each of them has different  views\r\n\r\nas  to  what merger should be, or how merger should  be\r\n\r\neffected,  or  the  complete  ramification  which  must\r\n\r\nlogically  ensue  on such a merger,  whatever  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  it  may  be. On that, there are differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is difficult for me to understand\r\n\r\nwhy  we are arguing more about a referendum than  about\r\n\r\nthe  positions taken up by the various Parties  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on merger. As far as I can make out - I hope I  am\r\n\r\nnot  dumb  in  this - the Government  have  accepted  the\r\n\r\nposition that before any form of association or merger,\r\n\r\nas  the  case  may  be, is accepted in the  Federation,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  consultation  with  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment have expressly said so, and in this debate,\r\n\r\nat  least from the statements made by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  and the Deputy Prime Minister, that  seems  to\r\n\r\nemerge  quite  clearly.  So  far  as  the  Alliance  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there must be a merger. We accept that.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  have committed themselves to  it  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  carry it out. Why then did the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nmove  this  motion? I myself find it very difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why he moved it. If he had  any  doubts  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter, he could have easily written to the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and told him this. \"Look,  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  I  hear in town. Is this correct or not?\"  And  a\r\n\r\nsuitable reply from the Prime Minister would have saved\r\n\r\nus  all this trouble. This is a complete waste of  time\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse   and,   to  some  extent,  the  Government   are\r\n\r\nencouraging it, if I may put it that way. A  short  and\r\n\r\nsimple  answer to the Member for Anson could well  have\r\n\r\nbeen,  \"Of  course, we are going to have a referendum.\"\r\n\r\nThat  might  well have been the end of the matter.  But\r\n\r\nno. There are undertones and overtones to this which it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult to understand and  appreciate.  The\r\n\r\nundertones  and  the overtones are  getting  even  more\r\n\r\nsubtle than they were at the time of the merger debate.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows there must be a referendum. I think the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  know  there  is  going  to   be   a\r\n\r\nreferendum. The Workers' Party know there is  going  to\r\n\r\nbe   a  referendum.  The  Alliance  know  it  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment know it. What then are we arguing about, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker? I will tell you what the argument is about. It\r\n\r\nis  about whether it is going to be in the form of  one\r\n\r\nquestion or two questions or three questions.  That  is\r\n\r\nreally  what  is  agitating the minds  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  the Workers' Party. From  the  amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Queenstown, we can see the fear\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party emerging\r\n\r\nquite clearly and basically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind, a referendum is a device\r\n\r\nused   by   a   parliamentary  democracy   for   direct\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the people. Normally a parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  does not consult the people. But this  is  a\r\n\r\ndevice which Australia and Canada, and America for that\r\n\r\nmatter,  have  adopted from the continental  countries.\r\n\r\nBut  as  far  as I know, the English type of  democracy\r\n\r\ndoes not favour a direct referendum to the people. This\r\n\r\nis  practised in Australia particularly and in  Canada,\r\n\r\nand  in the younger democracies it is certainly a  very\r\n\r\nuseful device to consult the wishes of the people.  The\r\n\r\ngoverning words, Mr Speaker, Sir, are \"to consult  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the people to ascertain what  is  in  their\r\n\r\nminds.\" Now if all of us then are agreed on merger, but\r\n\r\nif  all  of  us  are not agreed on the  exact  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger, what then should be the form of the referendum?\r\n\r\nHow should the consultation with the people take place?\r\n\r\nIf the consultation is going to be a genuine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsultation, the question must be framed in such a way\r\n\r\nthat the people can, as nearly as possible through this\r\n\r\nadvice,   express  their  views  in  order   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Assembly might be guided  by  their\r\n\r\nviews. Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be an absolute  waste\r\n\r\nof  time  to  go to a referendum if the whole  Assembly\r\n\r\nknew  exactly  what was in the minds of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  A referendum is only justified if  we  have\r\n\r\nsome doubts on the matter on which we are going to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  on  a  referendum. What is  the  doubt  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved? The doubt to be resolved, Mr Speaker, is not\r\n\r\nwhether  there should be a merger. There  is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout  that. We are all agreed on it. But  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of doubt as to what type of merger  should\r\n\r\nbe,  how  merger should be effected and  possibly  when\r\n\r\nmerger  should  be effected. Those are the  matters  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we are not agreed, and on which some of  us  are\r\n\r\ndoubtful. I know what I want, but it could well be that\r\n\r\nI  may be wrong. And therefore it becomes imperative to\r\n\r\nconsult the people on that issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is a correct\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  the  situation,  how  then   can   we\r\n\r\ndetermine - by just putting one question to  the  people?\r\n\r\n\"Do  you  accept  the  White Paper proposals  or  not?\"\r\n\r\nRight.  Supposing that was the only question  posed  to\r\n\r\nthe  electorate and the answer was a no, shall we  say.\r\n\r\nWhere  is the Assembly? Does the Assembly know  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  is  in the minds of the people? We are  not  very\r\n\r\nmuch  forrader,  Mr Speaker. The people  might  be  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of the proposal of the Barisan Sosialis. Should\r\n\r\nthey not be given an opportunity to express their views\r\n\r\non it? I think, in fairness, they should. Or they might\r\n\r\nbe in favour of the original proposal of the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson,  that  we  should  be an independent  territory,\r\n\r\ncompletely  divorced  from the Commonwealth  maybe,  or\r\n\r\nworking  within the Commonwealth or within the Security\r\n\r\nCouncil. These are matters on which some advice  should\r\n\r\nbe  sought  from  the people. And if advice  is  to  be\r\n\r\nsought from the people along `those lines, how are  you\r\n\r\ngoing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieve it? By acceding to the amendment of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown? It would be a practical impossibility.\r\n\r\nSo,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we are not really interested - at\r\n\r\nleast some of us are not really interested - in seeking a\r\n\r\nsolution to this problem. I think we are interested  in\r\n\r\njamming up the works. The amendment moved by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown is done in that spirit  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\nsupport it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, Members of the Opposition have moved  an\r\n\r\namendment which I think should not have been brought up\r\n\r\nat  all.  The real fact is that the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party are opposed\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia  and  merger.  Let  us  take  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, it is a Party which is opposed to merger. The\r\n\r\nmotive  of  this  Party is to come forward  and  oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia  by way of opposing merger. So this  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich they have moved is actually unnecessary. But they\r\n\r\ncome  to  this House to bring up all sorts of questions\r\n\r\nand excuses to confuse the vision of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nsaying just now that the P.A.P. is a dictatorial Party.\r\n\r\nI  will  tell  the Member for Anson this.  If  we  were\r\n\r\ndictatorial, then he would have been in the gas chamber\r\n\r\ninstead  of  in  the  Legislative Assembly  Chamber.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat,  he would have been in the gas chamber  instead\r\n\r\nof in the Legislative Assembly Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, also says that we are dictatorial. He further accuses us of making full use of the facilities of Radio Singapore and the table-tennis team and all sorts of travelling missions to propagate our Malaysia concept. What I do not understand is this. If we are prepared to explain our stand to the people, then how can we be called dictatorial? If we are dictatorial,\r\n\r\nwhy should we go and explain to the people? We can very\r\n\r\nwell tell them that we want this and they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  follow. So I was quite surprised that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown should, have brought up  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nunreasonable  argument to convince the people  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for him to do. The people will  not  be\r\n\r\nconvinced of his argument. Although this may be  beside\r\n\r\nthe  point,  I will explain why many Party branches  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have sent out basket-ball and table-tennis\r\n\r\nteams to places connected with Malaysia. The reason  is\r\n\r\nvery simple. In the past, there were some narrow-minded\r\n\r\npeople  in  our Party who were pro-Communist  and  who'\r\n\r\nmonopolised  the work of the Party, thereby undermining\r\n\r\nthe  Party in the eyes of the people. Now we have taken\r\n\r\na  new  step in order to extend the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also says that a lot of\r\n\r\nrumours have been flying about in Singapore. But in the\r\n\r\npast  he  never  said  anything about  rumours.  So  1\r\n\r\nbelieve  they started their rumour campaign on the  1st\r\n\r\nof  April,  which is April Fool's Day, on  a  house-to-house  visit.  That is how the rumours started.  I  can\r\n\r\ntell this House of their visits to the people. Actually\r\n\r\nthey  did  not go and explain to the people. When  they\r\n\r\nvisited  the  people at their houses, they wished  them\r\n\r\ngood-morning  or  called them uncles,  and  before  the\r\n\r\npeople  could  ask them any question, they  would  tell\r\n\r\nthem that they should not accept merger or Malaysia. If\r\n\r\nthey did, then the Chinese would be sold to the Malays.\r\n\r\nIf  they  visited Malay family, they would say Malaysia\r\n\r\nwas  bad. If they visited an Indian family, they  would\r\n\r\nsay   that  after  merger  Singapore's  economy   would\r\n\r\ndeteriorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have brought up all sorts of questions and\r\n\r\nexcuses just to whip up racial emotions to confuse  the\r\n\r\nvision   of   the   people   and   to   undermine   the\r\n\r\nmaterialisation  of Malaysia. So after  their  campaign\r\n\r\nand  house-to-house visits, starting from  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nApril,  they  come and tell us that there  are  rumours\r\n\r\nflying  about in Singapore about Malaysia  and  merger.\r\n\r\nActually these rumours have been started by them.  They\r\n\r\nhave  been started as a result of what they have  told\r\n\r\nthe people. So the rumours which they have started are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nringing in their own ears. Then they come and tell  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the whole of Singapore is full of rumours. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that as Chairman of the Party, the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  who  is unable to reflect  the  views  and\r\n\r\nopinions  of the people, should not come to this  House\r\n\r\nand  say that there are a lot of rumours in town.  They\r\n\r\nalso  say  that the Barisan do not want the  people  to\r\n\r\ndie. The P.A.P.'s Malaysia plan and the merger plan  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  the people to die. Instead these  two  plans\r\n\r\nwant  the people to live, because we know that  if  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia   plan   materialises,   then,   territorially\r\n\r\nspeaking,   we   become   bigger.   We   can    expand.\r\n\r\nEconomically,  we can provide more jobs for  our  young\r\n\r\npeople. So in all respects, Malaysia will bring  a  new\r\n\r\nand better life to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is now going into too\r\n\r\nmany details. In fact, he is debating Malaysia. He  can\r\n\r\njust  mention  Malaysia in passing, but he  should  not\r\n\r\ndebate Malaysia now.

What I am trying\r\n\r\nto  say  is  that, as Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown should not have said what  he\r\n\r\nhas said. That is why I stand up to reply. He says that\r\n\r\nif  the people accept the Malaysia plan, then they will\r\n\r\nbe confronted with death. Now, we do not have to bother\r\n\r\nwith  which  Party is able to bring about Malaysia.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  look ahead and ask this: With the success  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  will there be a greater nation? This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  question.  Now, if we  can  have  a  greater\r\n\r\nnation with a larger piece of land, then there will  be\r\n\r\ngreater opportunities for jobs for the people. So,  for\r\n\r\na  Party Chairman to advance such arguments is very bad\r\n\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will now dispose of the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Question was,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a\r\n\r\ncloser  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request\r\n\r\nis  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British\r\n\r\nGovernment for transfer of territorial sovereignty over\r\n\r\nSingapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained\r\n\r\nby referendum and the Government will act in accordance\r\n\r\nwith the views of our citizens so expressed.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to leave out from \"That\" in line  1  to\r\n\r\nthe   end  and  there  to  insert  \"in  view   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  clearly stated stand on the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger,    this   House   welcomes   the   Government's\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Singapore National Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nin  order to hold a referendum to ascertain the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable\r\n\r\nreunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nbefore  arrangements  are  finalised  and  before   any\r\n\r\nrequest is made by the Government of Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish   Government   for  transfer   of   territorial\r\n\r\nsovereignty over Singapore to the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nor Malaysia\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson to the amendment, to leave out from the very\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  the word \"reunification\"  and  there  to\r\n\r\ninsert  \"this  House  welcomes the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to\r\n\r\nascertain the wishes of the people on the\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which the Member for Queenstown has moved an\r\n\r\namendment to the amendment to the amendment,  to  leave\r\n\r\nout  from  the beginning of the Deputy Prime Minister's\r\n\r\namendment  to  `the  words, \"before  arrangements\"  and\r\n\r\nthere  to  insert  \"this House welcomes  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum\r\n\r\nto  ascertain the wishes of the people as to whether or\r\n\r\nnot  they  are  prepared  to accept  the  proposals  as\r\n\r\nembodied in the White Paper on Merger (Command Paper 33)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question I put is a Question which is necessitated\r\n\r\nby  reason  of the fact that the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  the  Member  for Anson are desirous  that  certain\r\n\r\nwords  in  the  Deputy  Prime Minister's  amendment  be\r\n\r\nomitted.

Sir, I am speaking now\r\n\r\non the amendment to the amendment. The Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  accused the S.P.A. of forming an alliance with the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  It  is indeed a matter which I can  only  laugh\r\n\r\noff, because if the record of the debates in this House\r\n\r\nwere  to show correctly - as I am sure Hansard will show\r\n\r\nit  correctly - it  was  first the  S.P.A. and  now  the\r\n\r\nAlliance   that  have  provided  the  most  responsible\r\n\r\nopposition to the P.A.P. Government. We do not  believe\r\n\r\nin   irresponsible  opposition.

Paper\r\n\r\nNo.  33  of  1961), it was very clear that the  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in this Assembly, apart from the Alliance,\r\n\r\nwere  playing party politics. Although each  and  every\r\n\r\nParty did say that they were for a closer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelationship,  for reunification of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, there were different views as  to\r\n\r\nthe  manner  in  which this reunification  should  take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the referendum, I think everyone\r\n\r\nhas  agreed  that  it  will have to  be  conducted,  to\r\n\r\nconsult  the electorate on the constitutional proposals\r\n\r\nvis  a  vis  the  reunification of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.

From the Government's intention  of\r\n\r\ndeleting  the words from the motion of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson,  we  can  clearly  see  their  motive.  In   the\r\n\r\nGovernment amendment, there is a word which has  caught\r\n\r\nmy  attention.  This  word is  \"reunification\"  in  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"reunification of Singapore and the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya\". In this amendment of the Government,  they\r\n\r\nhave  not used the word \"merger\", which means that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  clearly  understand  that  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore have already seen through the P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  Therefore, they do not dare  mention  now  the\r\n\r\nword  merger\".  Now  they  use  another  word,  namely,\r\n\r\n\"reunification\" in its stead, in order to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. It was because of this  that  we\r\n\r\nmoved    our    amendment   to   delete    that    word\r\n\r\n\"reunification\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr JOHN MAMMEN) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Government's amendment, we see that they\r\n\r\nintend  to delete the last part of the motion  proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  Anson - that  is,  the  words  \"the\r\n\r\nGovernment will act in accordance with the views of our\r\n\r\ncitizens so expressed\". Why should the Government  want\r\n\r\nto  delete  such a phrase? This is because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment are not prepared to accept the views of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It also goes to show that they are  now  under\r\n\r\npressure   to   hold   such   a   national   referendum\r\n\r\nunwillingly.  The  Government's intention  of  deleting\r\n\r\nsuch a phrase shows that they have no confidence in the\r\n\r\nresult of the coming national referendum. From this, it\r\n\r\ncan   also   be  seen  what  purpose  is  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum if the Government are not sincere about  the\r\n\r\nso-called  national referendum. They want to  play  the\r\n\r\npolitical game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this question of a national referendum is one which touches on merger and which affects our people. The original motion of the Member for Anson states \"That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of Singapore...\". This wording clearly shows that the mover of this motion is taking this issue above party politics. But the Government have another attitude towards it. From the amendment moved by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, we can see that the holding of  a  nationa1\r\n\r\nreferendum  is to play party politics and  it  will  be\r\n\r\nconducted  on  that  line. If the  Government  are  not\r\n\r\ntrying  to play party politics, why cannot they  accept\r\n\r\nthe  original  motion,  that  is  to  say,  \"That  this\r\n\r\nAssembly solemnly assures the citizens of Singapore\" of\r\n\r\ncertain things?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, another reason why we cannot\r\n\r\naccept  the amendment by the Government is that  before \r\n\r\nthe  National Referendum Bill is passed we must get  an \r\n\r\nassurance  that  it  will  accept  the  views  of   the \r\n\r\nOpposition   Parties  to  delete  certain  unreasonable \r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed): On a point of order, Sir.\r\n\r\n(In Malay): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  translation system is out of  order.

This is  the  type  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  relationship  envisaged  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper. They now dare not use the word \"merger\", because\r\n\r\nthe  word \"merger\" has already been seen through by the\r\n\r\npeople  for  what  it means. Can the proposals  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, which outlines the plan for merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaya,  be  truly  called  a  kind  of\r\n\r\nreunification?  Can the proposals in  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nachieve  a reunification or merger? The answer  is  no.\r\n\r\nTunku   Abdul  Rahman,  the  Prime  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  also  did  not  use  the  word\r\n\r\n\"reunification\" to describe the proposals in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  What he said was a type of closer relationship.\r\n\r\nOnly  this and nothing more. From this, it can be  seen\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.  Government are  now  trying  to  use\r\n\r\nanother  term to deceive the people so that an  unequal\r\n\r\ntype of merger, as in the White Paper, can be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the amendment moved by the Government, there is another term used. That is, the \"mode and manner,\" which refers to the mode and manner of merger. Why do the Government not dare to express clearly, by their wording in the White Paper, the merger proposed by them? Why should they use this new term in its stead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Hong Lim, in the course of his\r\n\r\nspeech,  also  correctly pointed  out  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  on the 12th of October  last  year.  In\r\n\r\nanswer to the leaders of all the political Parties,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  in his letter that the people would' be consulted\r\n\r\non  whether  they accepted or rejected the White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  on  merger. But from the  amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we can see that they intend to  eat  their\r\n\r\nown words. The Government have the intention of evading\r\n\r\nwhat  the Prime Minister promised or guaranteed to  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of the political Parties represented  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. From the terms of the Government's amendment,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  that  not  only have  the  Government  no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the national referendum, but  they  have\r\n\r\nalso  no  confidence in their own merger  proposals  as\r\n\r\ncontained in the White Paper. The Government have  also\r\n\r\nno confidence in the parliamentary system of consulting\r\n\r\nthe people for their opinions. If the Government do not\r\n\r\nlike  the people to freely express their views; if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not allow the people to fully  express\r\n\r\ntheir views; and if also the Government want the people\r\n\r\nto accept their type of merger as outlined in the White\r\n\r\nPaper,  then  it  would be better that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould not waste so many thousands of dollars to  carry\r\n\r\nout this type of national referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that if the Government are\r\n\r\ndetermined not to abide by the opinions of the  people;\r\n\r\nif  they are not prepared to act according to the  will\r\n\r\nof  the  people; if they will not allow the  people  to\r\n\r\nexpress  freely and correctly their own views;  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  like  to  use deceiving methods to carry  through\r\n\r\ntheir  type of merger, then it will cause very  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences  to  our State. If this misfortune  should\r\n\r\nhappen,   the   Government   should   bear   all    the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, there are times when democracy\r\n\r\ncannot be practised.

This is necessary\r\n\r\nwhen  the  lives of the people are in difficulties,  or\r\n\r\nwhen the machinations of irresponsible leaders who have\r\n\r\nno  sense of responsibility to their country, or  of  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of men who have no real interest in the  country\r\n\r\nin which they are staying, have to be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we consider a referendum to be a good device\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of consulting the people.  But, as  has been \r\n\r\nexplained by my colleague, the Member  for Farrer  Park,\r\n\r\nthis  issue which we are  discussing  is being played about \r\n\r\nin some irresponsible quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have followed the debate on merger in this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I believe the people of Singapore,  who  did\r\n\r\nnot  understand the debate, could see clearly the  good\r\n\r\nand  the bad points about the matters discussed in this\r\n\r\nAssembly. But there are some quarters in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwho  carry out irresponsible activities. They  are  not\r\n\r\nresponsible  to this country and they do not  wish  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  have a prosperous and peaceful  country.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  type  of  merger  they  demand  today  is\r\n\r\nsomething  in  which they themselves  do  not  believe,\r\n\r\nbecause what they really want is that there should  not\r\n\r\nbe any merger. However, they are not disposed to; state\r\n\r\nclearly  that they do not want merger. They  only  hide\r\n\r\nbehind the issue of the referendum and so on. Some have\r\n\r\nraised  this issue as a matter of party politics.  What\r\n\r\nthey really want, in my view, if they can achieve it is\r\n\r\na large field wherein they can gather all the people in\r\n\r\norder to arrive at a decision on an issue. What we  are\r\n\r\nnow  discussing  seems to be producing no  results.  In\r\n\r\nthis respect, it appears that the Barisan Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nactively  carrying out a dangerous line  of  propaganda\r\n\r\nwhich  has given rise to communalism.

We have hoped\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  a  merger. But  now,  the  means  of\r\n\r\nachieving  merger is through a referendum, and  we  see\r\n\r\nthis  issue  being  played about. As emphasised  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  we on our part will not take  part  in  the\r\n\r\nvoting because we regard this matter as a part of party\r\n\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this motion which the Member for Anson is\r\n\r\nraising,  and  which affects our future generation  and\r\n\r\ntheir future, seeks to -  [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy  Speaker (Mr Mammen): </b>I  can  hear  quite\r\n\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am afraid for the last minute or two I\r\n\r\nhave not heard anything, but I will continue, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  did not quite hear what the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nsaid just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that the\r\n\r\nintention  of the motion brought forward by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  is  to assure that the people  can  express\r\n\r\ntheir  views on the question of merger and the question\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia.

My point is that since we all eat rice,  if\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government put some poison in the rice  and\r\n\r\nif  they  want us to eat it, then, of course,  we  will\r\n\r\nrefuse to eat it. When the Government put forward their\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  merger proposals, some of  them  are  not\r\n\r\nacceptable to the Opposition. We support the concept of\r\n\r\nmerger.  We  do  not  want to give the  Government  the\r\n\r\nexcuse  to  say that we are opposed to merger  and  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of Malaysia. This has been our stand. But  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  the P.A.P. reminds me  of  the  Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation   in  Singapore.  During  that  period   the\r\n\r\nJapanese  troops committed atrocities in  this  country\r\n\r\nwhich  were very similar to what the P.A.P. are  doing\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point in opposing a national referendum.\r\n\r\nLet  me  quote  some  incidents.  During  the  Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation, the atrocities and barbarities committed by\r\n\r\nthe Japanese troops could be likened to what the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  doing today. At that time there were many gambling\r\n\r\ndens in Singapore. There was a kind of gambling by  the\r\n\r\nChinese known as \"fan tan\".

At  one\r\n\r\ntime the Japanese Army went to gamble in these gambling\r\n\r\ndens.  The  result was that they lost all their  money.\r\n\r\nThe  next  day  they thought of a scheme and  went  and\r\n\r\ngambled  again. They used only chips on the  table,  no\r\n\r\nactual money. Then the chips would be counted in fours,\r\n\r\nand  if  there was only one chip remaining at the  end,\r\n\r\nthat would be No. 1; if there were two chips remaining,\r\n\r\nthat would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  No. 2; if there were three chips remaining, then it\r\n\r\nwould be No. 3; and if there were four remaining at the\r\n\r\nend,  it  would  be  No.  4. But the  unreasonable  and\r\n\r\nbarbaric  Japanese  soldiers  on  this  particular  day\r\n\r\nforcibly asked the gambling den operators not to  count\r\n\r\nin fours but in twos, so that they could stake on No. 1\r\n\r\nand No. 2, because then the result would be either 1 or\r\n\r\n2.  So they were in a very advantageous position to win\r\n\r\nthe  game.  The  method  of  referendum  gives  me  the\r\n\r\nimpression that it is quite similar to how the Japanese\r\n\r\nsoldiers behaved in the gambling dens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of the debate arising\r\n\r\nout of the question of merger, the friendship which has\r\n\r\nexisted between Singapore and the Federation for a long\r\n\r\ntime  has now become very unstable. This is regrettable\r\n\r\nbecause  we  in the Opposition and the Government  both\r\n\r\nare  quite  unanimous  in  supporting  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nmerger. But because we do not agree with the Government\r\n\r\non the method and form of merger, there is the question\r\n\r\nof  closing down the causeway, which has given rise  to\r\n\r\nfear  among  the people of Singapore. So we would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  if they do believe  in  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  to do this simple thing - let the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  choose either of these two alternatives - one,\r\n\r\nwhether the people of Singapore are prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  merger proposals as contained in the White  Paper,\r\n\r\nor  whether they are opposed to those proposals. It  is\r\n\r\nas simple as that. There is no need for any argument or\r\n\r\ndebate. Now, if the P.A.P. do not do this, then, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, they do not dare to face the people.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they  are  thinking of the  method  which  I  have\r\n\r\nalready described, and which the Japanese soldiers used\r\n\r\nin  the gambling dens. This behaviour of the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\ngiven me the opportunity to recollect that incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, today the Government has moved  an\r\n\r\namendment to the motion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntabled by the Member for Anson. We can see clearly that\r\n\r\nthe  present  P.A.P.  Government is  quite  similar  to\r\n\r\nHitler's  Government in the past. There  is  only  this\r\n\r\ndifference  between them. Hitler was able  to  mobilise\r\n\r\nall  his  military forces to suppress  nearly  all  the\r\n\r\npeople of the world whereas the P.A.P. cannot do so. If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. were to have such military forces  at  its\r\n\r\ndisposal, I believe that it would not hesitate to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  them  to  force the people of  Singapore  into\r\n\r\naccepting      the     retrogressive     constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements; but because it does not have the military\r\n\r\nforces  that Hitler had, it has attempted to  introduce\r\n\r\nall   sorts   of   devices  to  achieve  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements  which  are not in  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, some Government Members have\r\n\r\ncontradicted  their own statements.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture, when touching on the  amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Member for Queenstown,  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot put only one question - the question of\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper on merger - in the referendum  because,\r\n\r\nif the Government should do so, then the Assembly would\r\n\r\nbe  involved  and  committed  to  the  framing  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion in the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on the merger\r\n\r\nproposals  was  debated  in  a  motion  moved  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in this House. Since then, the Ministers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  have stressed in  the  newspapers,  at\r\n\r\nPress  interviews  and radio forums,  and  through  all\r\n\r\nforms  of  publicity  facilities, the  point  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture constitutional arrangements would be referred to\r\n\r\nthe  people for a final decision. In other words,  Cmd.\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  33 of 1961 would be referred to the  people\r\n\r\nfor  a  decision as to whether they accept  the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  agreed between the P.A.P, and the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. So we can clearly see today in  this  House\r\n\r\nthat there is a very simple question to be answered  by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. This question is one where  a\r\n\r\nyes  or no is required to the White Paper proposals  on\r\n\r\nmerger. It is not a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter of putting various questions to the people for a\r\n\r\ndecision.  The  P.A.P. knows this very  well.  It  also\r\n\r\nknows  that,  as  far as the people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, the White Paper proposals on merger are  not\r\n\r\nacceptable. That is why the Government has not got  the\r\n\r\nguts to put down the White Paper proposals on merger in\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  paper.  If the Government  is  sincere  in\r\n\r\nwanting to refer this issue in a referendum -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

The House has discussed this  question  of\r\n\r\nthe  \"mode and manner\" as contained in the White Paper.\r\n\r\nWhere  is  the other \"mode and manner\" for the decision\r\n\r\nof  the people?

The\r\n\r\namendment of the Government has indicated to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore that more than one question will be put in\r\n\r\nthe  national  referendum for a decision,  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. knows  that the people of Singapore  treat  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper like poison. If the P.A.P. were to ask  the\r\n\r\npeople whether they wanted to drink poison - that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  whether they wanted the White Paper proposals  on\r\n\r\nmerger - I am quite sure that 100 per cent of the  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore would reject them; but because the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  on many occasions has promised to refer  this\r\n\r\nmatter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the people for a decision, the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  make  use  of  a democratic  device  and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  democratic  forms  to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  into believing  that  their\r\n\r\nfuture  is to be decided by themselves and not  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. The P.A.P. is cunningly trying to make\r\n\r\nuse  of  more than one question for a decision  by\r\n\r\nthe  people.  If the P.A.P. has the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and if it has given publicity  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantages  of  the  White  Paper  on  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  then I believe the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwho  are  reasonable and rational,  will  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully the speeches and arguments of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. has said that the White Paper on merger\r\n\r\nis   good  and  advantageous  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is tantamount to saying that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has confidence in the people. If  that  is\r\n\r\nso, then there is every reason to believe that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P, should put one question to the people in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, and that is whether the White Paper on\r\n\r\nmerger is acceptable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill says the Alliance has never indulged  in\r\n\r\nparty  politics.  He  claims  that  his  Party  is\r\n\r\nlooking  after the interests of the whole country.\r\n\r\nI do not understand what he means by \"the interest\r\n\r\nof  the country\". I do not know whether he has  in\r\n\r\nmind  the  interest of the people. By the interest\r\n\r\nof  the country, does he mean the interest of  the\r\n\r\nminority leadership of the P.A.P. and the  leaders\r\n\r\nof the Alliance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. and the\r\n\r\nAlliance  held different political  views  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  but  now  they seem to have  come  to  some\r\n\r\nagreement.

I  want  to  speak to you  tonight  of  14\r\n\r\npeople,  whom I have never met, whose names  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know and whom I do not know personally in any\r\n\r\nway  whatsoever, who languish in prison  and  have\r\n\r\nlanguished in prison for five to six years without\r\n\r\ntrial  by  executive order renewed  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the year 1955, the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance was passed against P.A.P. opposition in this Assembly, and vicious and malicious P.A.P. propaganda out side this Assembly was led by the present Prime Minister and his henchmen, Mr Lim Ching Siong and Mr Devan Nair. At that time, the present Minister for Health condemned what he called the\r\n\r\nundemocratic   Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  no  uncertain terms.  During  1955,\r\n\r\ndespite   considerable   teething   troubles    in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the provisions of this Ordinance  were\r\n\r\nso  sparingly and so fairly used - all the detainees\r\n\r\nwere   released   as   soon  as   conditions   had\r\n\r\nsettled - that no criticism was levelled against its\r\n\r\nuse in that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came 1956 and 1957 when there was unrest,\r\n\r\nand   the   provisions  of  the   Ordinance   were\r\n\r\nextensively  used  and a large number  of  persons\r\n\r\nwere  detained.  It  is not the  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseek  to  reopen either the issue of the need  for  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance today or  the\r\n\r\npropriety  or otherwise of the detentions of  1956  and\r\n\r\n1957.  The purpose of this motion, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  to  draw  the  attention of hon.  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  the fact that human beings who  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  found guilty by any Court are imprisoned for five\r\n\r\nand six years during a period when there is no question\r\n\r\nof  an emergency. Even serious offences under our Penal\r\n\r\nCode  are very rarely met with such extensive terms  of\r\n\r\nactual   imprisonment,  for  it  is   recognised   that\r\n\r\nimprisonment  has  a deleterious effect  upon  a  human\r\n\r\nbeing,  and  unless  a  man  is  beyond  the  hope   of\r\n\r\nredemption  the Courts will not impose sentences  which\r\n\r\nwill  destroy  his personality completely.  How  do  we\r\n\r\njustify the continued detention of these forgotten  men\r\n\r\nof 1956 and 1957?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is interesting to note that on the\r\n\r\nnight of 20th/2lst July last year - that unhappy all-night \r\n\r\nsitting which started a curious P.A.P. circus - the Deputy \r\n\r\nPrime Minister said, and I quote from col. 1682:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There were altogether 61 persons detained on 2nd June,\r\n\r\n1959.  From  the day the P.A.P, assumed office  on  3rd\r\n\r\nJune, 1959, to date. 35 persons have been released.  Of\r\n\r\nthose  who were detained by the previous Government  in\r\n\r\nthe two purges of 1956 and 1957, there are now only  18\r\n\r\npersons still under detention.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Those are the persons of whom I am speaking, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is vital that the continued detention of these 18\r\n\r\ndetainees  should  not be allowed to obscure  the  main\r\n\r\nissue  in  the  minds of the people, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\npolitical future of Singapore - whether we are to  attain\r\n\r\nindependence through merger with the Federation in 1963\r\n\r\neither  with  or  without  the Borneo  territories,  or\r\n\r\nwhether, as has been suggested by Mr Lim Ching Siong's\r\n\r\ngroup,  the  next  step should not  be  merger  hut  an\r\n\r\ninternally   self-governing   Singapore   without   the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to lay on the Table the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Paper  to the Internal  Security  Council\r\n\r\ndated  12th  August, 1959, for the information  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  a  later  stage, Mr Deputy Speaker, he said  [col.1683]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... in the light of recent developments which have\r\n\r\nbeen  outlined by the Prime Minister to the  House,  to\r\n\r\nremove  all  doubts and any vestige of suspicion  about\r\n\r\nthe  sincerity of the P.A.P.

In doing so, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  clarify  that it is not  the  desire  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government to precipitate  any  conflict  or\r\n\r\ncrisis with the Federation Government with whom it  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  our  policy  to  maintain  amicable   and\r\n\r\nbrotherly relationship in the interest of the people of\r\n\r\nboth territories.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that is an unequivocal assurance that having\r\n\r\nconsidered  fully  the interest of the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nhaving  considered fully the opposition of the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment, the P.A.P. Government was going to  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  its firm intention to release the detainees  whom\r\n\r\nit  had wanted to release from 12th August, 1959.  This\r\n\r\nwas  said two years after 1959. We are today in  1962 -\r\n\r\nnine months after those words were said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, despite this formal assurance of\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister, I have to inform you that on \r\n\r\n2nd  April,  1962,  I received an intimation  from  the \r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat only four of these 18 persons detained during  the\r\n\r\n1956/1957  purges were released between 20th  July  and\r\n\r\n2nd  April. I am not guaranteeing the accuracy  of  the\r\n\r\nfigure  given by the Ministry, but I will be  happy  to\r\n\r\ntable  the letter itself, Sir. I shall table it at  the\r\n\r\nend of my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that I sought this information by a\r\n\r\nWritten Question. Maybe the Minister misunderstood  its\r\n\r\npurport,  but let us give him the benefit of the  doubt\r\n\r\nand  assume he did. In any event, he was not ready  and\r\n\r\nso  I had to write him a fairly lengthy letter spelling\r\n\r\nout  what I required. And after two weeks, I did get  a\r\n\r\nreply - unequivocal  for  a change - stating  categorically\r\n\r\nthat four persons of these 18 whom they had promised to\r\n\r\nrelease nine months ago have now been released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot see how persons who have\r\n\r\nspent  more  than five to six years in gaol can  really \r\n\r\ncontinue   to   be  effective  agents   of   subversive \r\n\r\norganisations  if,  in  fact,  they  belong   to   such \r\n\r\norganisations.  After being five to six  years  out  of \r\n\r\ncirculation,  it is not unreasonable to assume,  unless \r\n\r\nthey  are  particularly prominent  personalities,  that \r\n\r\ntheir  release  cannot materially affect  the  security\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am heartened in this view - not\r\n\r\nthat  I  need any support from the P.A.P. but  just  in \r\n\r\ncase  they  wish  to indulge in arguments  which  belie \r\n\r\ntheir  own  documents - let me remind  them, Mr  Deputy Speaker,  of the paper which they tabled in \r\n\r\nthis  House on  the night of 20th July, 1961, being their \r\n\r\nISC.59 of 12th August, 1959, Secret, and this is what it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Once he is released [that is, Mr Lim Ching Siong is\r\n\r\nreleased],  it  makes very little difference  from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of view of subversion whether the remaining  40-odd  \r\n\r\ndetainees are released or not, because they cannot\r\n\r\nmaterially affect the security position.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was  written in 1959 - almost three  years  ago - in\r\n\r\nrespect of these persons who had then been two to three\r\n\r\nyears in gaol and who are still today in gaol. Why  are\r\n\r\nthey still detained? Is it because since 20th July  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  suddenly awakened to the fact  that  these\r\n\r\nformer P.A.P. members would not return\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. fold?

Why this additional broken promise? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the bitter lessons I have learned and\r\n\r\nrelearned in the nine months I have been here  is  that\r\n\r\nan  appeal  to the Government on the grounds of  reason\r\n\r\nand on the grounds of humanity will more often than not\r\n\r\nbe  met  with  raucous laughter more appropriate  to  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  institution. The only  logic  to  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is open is the logic of power. But  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  the P.A.P. and those who sleep  behind  the\r\n\r\nFront Bench: what of these comrades of theirs who  five\r\n\r\nto  six years ago were detained and whose release  they\r\n\r\npromised  to obtain when they took office? How  do  you\r\n\r\njustify,  Mr Deputy Speaker, these 14 human beings  in\r\n\r\nprison  for five to six years by executive order  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  of  peace in the face of Government's own promise\r\n\r\nto   release   them   and  the  Government's   official\r\n\r\nrecognition  that  their release - in the  words  of  the\r\n\r\nletter  of 12th August, 1959 - \"cannot materially  affect\r\n\r\nthe  security  position\"?  How  do  you  justify  their\r\n\r\ncontinued detention?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.15 a.m. (18th April, 1962)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, before I go on to show  for  whom  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is acting as proxy, let me dispose  of\r\n\r\nhis  allegation  that  the Government  has  broken  its\r\n\r\npromise made on its behalf by the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\non  20th  July, 1961. It is necessary to get our  facts\r\n\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those who have followed recent correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Member  for Anson and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  and  Law in the Chinese Press will  appreciate,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson is strong on fiction and weak  on\r\n\r\nfacts.  What  was the promise made by the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  on 20th July in this Assembly? Let  me  quote\r\n\r\nthe relevant portions in Hansard, Vol. 14, No. 23, col.\r\n\r\n1683:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the stand of the British Government\r\n\r\nin   the   Internal  Security  Council, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will issue orders for the  release  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees  in  batches from time to time in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the original proposal of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nto the Internal Security Council.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  was no pledge of unconditional release within  a\r\n\r\nspecified  time. We could not have done so for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons.  This  was  made clear in  the  sentence  that\r\n\r\nimmediately  followed the quotation I have  just  made.\r\n\r\nThis reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In doing so, I would like to clarify that it is not\r\n\r\nthe  desire  of the Singapore Government to precipitate\r\n\r\nany  conflict or crisis with the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nwith  whom  it has always been our policy  to  maintain\r\n\r\namicable and brotherly relationship in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe people of both territories.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, since the Federation is a member of the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council, it is necessary to convince\r\n\r\nthe  Federation representative that the  release  of  a\r\n\r\ndetainee does not constitute a security risk.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  may I quote an authority whom  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  can  disregard only at his own  peril?  The\r\n\r\nauthority  is  none  other than the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon.   He   made  this  pronouncement   on   21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1960, when the Member for Hong Lim brought a\r\n\r\nmotion   asking  for  the  unconditional   release   of\r\n\r\ndetainees. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 13, No.  9,  col.\r\n\r\n707. This is what the Member for Upper Serangoon said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But, if among those who are now detained there are\r\n\r\nsome  who  do  not  believe in peaceful  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle  and  who harbour the design of replacing  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   parliamentary  system  with  a   Communist\r\n\r\nregime, then the P.A.P. has no obligation to fight  for\r\n\r\ntheir release and their freedom.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Needless  to say, the Member for Upper Serangoon  voted\r\n\r\nagainst   the   unconditional  release   of   political\r\n\r\ndetainees. The strictures that the Member for Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nmade  on  the  Member  for Hong Lim  for  bringing  the\r\n\r\ndetainee issue were so spirited that the Speaker had to\r\n\r\ncall  upon  him  to  withdraw some  telling  nouns  and\r\n\r\nadjectives  directed against the Member for  Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nBut  one sentence which was not ruled out of order  may\r\n\r\nbe  of  some interest to the Member for Anson. I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 9, col. 716:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Running through this motion, we are able to read in\r\n\r\nand between the lines the false premises messed-up with\r\n\r\nparanoic tendencies of a persecution complex.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  in col. 717, the Member for Nee Soon also had this\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I [that is the Member for Nee Soon] might add, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the original motion was worded to make it  appear\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government had never fought for  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of the detainees. Nothing can be further  from\r\n\r\nthe truth. Even before the P.A.P. formed Government the\r\n\r\nwheels  were set in motion for the release of political\r\n\r\ndetainees by the collective leadership of the Party.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Since then we have unrelentingly fought for the\r\n\r\nrelease of the remaining political detainees, and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to fight for their release.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And in col. 718, he continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If he [that is, the Member for Hong Lim] agrees that\r\n\r\nthe  creation of a democratic, socialist, non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  in the best interest of this country,  then\r\n\r\nsurely  he  must agree with us, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nany  power  that  seeks  to overthrow  this  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  by subversion and by violence must be  squarely\r\n\r\nmet and boldly dealt with.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock was no less hard on the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim for bringing this motion. He thought that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim brought the motion  to  revive\r\n\r\nhis  fading  political prestige. In the  end,  all  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members approved the  amended  motion\r\n\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Government to continue\r\n\r\nto  fight  in  the  Internal Security Council  for  the\r\n\r\nrelease of all political detainees who were detained by\r\n\r\nthe  Lim Yew Hock Government and this Assembly endorses\r\n\r\nthe  Government's view that the detainees should assist\r\n\r\nthe  Government in its efforts to secure their  release\r\n\r\nby  sincerely  repudiating  the  methods  and  aims  of\r\n\r\npolitical  forces  dedicated to the  overthrow  of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system by subversion and violence.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the  context  of the debate, what  this  meant  was\r\n\r\nclear.  These  detainees  can help  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nsecure  their  release by categorically and  decisively\r\n\r\nrepudiating  Communism  and  allegiance  to   Communist\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Upper Serangoon observed, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas   no  obligation  to  fight  for  the  release   of\r\n\r\nCommunists or their willing henchmen. The Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's statement of July 1961 was not a promise  of\r\n\r\nunconditional release of the 17 persons still detained,\r\n\r\n14 of whom were detained during the 1956/57 purges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Since the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister made his speech in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nin  July  1961, 9 further detainees have been released,\r\n\r\nand  out  of these nine, 4 were from the 1956 and  1957\r\n\r\npurges. So there arc 17 left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.

The  P.A.P. made  a\r\n\r\npledge of unconditional release only in regard to the 8\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members who were intimately connected with  the\r\n\r\nleadership of the Party. These included Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan and  Mr  Woodhull  among\r\n\r\nothers.  We  secured  their release  as  promised  just\r\n\r\nbefore  we assumed office on 5th June, 1959. As regards\r\n\r\nthe others who were members of the Party, we agreed  to\r\n\r\npress for their release to the best of our ability  and\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to the tripartite nature of the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council.  Of the 61 persons  under  detention\r\n\r\nwhen the P.A.P. assumed office, only 17 are still under\r\n\r\ndetention.  The Government would like to  secure  their\r\n\r\nrelease,  as it has secured the release of the  others.\r\n\r\nTo  do this, we must convince the Federation Government\r\n\r\nthat these persons are not security risks, and the best\r\n\r\nway to do this is - as was stated in the resolutions  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  1960  and  approved by those  who  now  call\r\n\r\nthemselves  the Barisan Sosialis - for the  detainees  to\r\n\r\ncategorically and sincerely repudiate Communism.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  the Member for  Anson,  unlike  the\r\n\r\nMember for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper Serangoon,\r\n\r\nis  suggesting that we should press for the release  of\r\n\r\ndetainees  who  are  not prepared to disavow  Communist\r\n\r\nambitions as he has admitted in this Assembly that  his\r\n\r\nParty has been captured by the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> But if he himself has not been\r\n\r\ncaptured by the Communists who run his Party,  then  he\r\n\r\nwill do better to exhort the detainees to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncategorically  repudiate Communism  and  thus  make  it\r\n\r\neasier  to secure their release. To ask for the release\r\n\r\nof  those  who are not prepared to repudiate  Communism\r\n\r\nwould  be  to act as proxy for Communist designs  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  Communists are not  only  looking  for\r\n\r\nstooges but also for much needed cadres for the  coming\r\n\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, time is\r\n\r\nvery  short  and I will not be long about  this.
