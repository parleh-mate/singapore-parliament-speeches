It takes the form of\r\n\r\na letter addressed to me, and is dated the 2nd of\r\n\r\nAugust, 1955. Here is the message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On the 25th July you delivered to me a\r\n\r\ncertified  copy of the Resolution passed  by  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly on that date and, in a reply\r\n\r\nwhich  I  handed to you on the same afternoon,  I\r\n\r\nexplained that I would require time to study  the\r\n\r\nimplications of the Resolution before I could put\r\n\r\nyou  in  a  position to convey  a  reply  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I communicated the terms of the Resolution to\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's Principal Secretary of  State  for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies,  and, during his recent  visit  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he  took the opportunity  to  discuss\r\n\r\nboth with the Chief Minister and with myself, the\r\n\r\nvarious issues raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussions are to be continued when the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State returns to Singapore  on  the\r\n\r\n15th August, I am not yet in a position to send a\r\n\r\nfull reply. I would, however, be grateful if  you\r\n\r\nwould  convey the following observations  to  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point raised in the Resolution, I\r\n\r\nam  very  glad  to  be able to inform  Honourable\r\n\r\nMembers that the Secretary of State has asked  me\r\n\r\nto  assure  them  of  the continuing  sympathetic\r\n\r\ninterest which Her Majesty's Government takes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  problems and  of  the  sincerity  of\r\n\r\ntheir policy to assist Singapore to achieve self-government within the British Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised, I gladly repeat my\r\n\r\nformer  affirmation of my sympathetic  desire  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  Government all possible  help  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution of its policies. In so doing I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to exercise my discretionary powers in  a\r\n\r\ndidactic   or  harsh  manner,  or  in   any   way\r\n\r\ncalculated   to   frustrate  the  Government   in\r\n\r\ndischarging  the responsibilities  which  it  has\r\n\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third and fourth points in the\r\n\r\nResolution,  valuable  and  friendly  talks  have\r\n\r\ntaken  place between the Secretary of State,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, and myself, and  examination  of\r\n\r\nthese important points has been carried as far as\r\n\r\nit  could  be  at  present.  As  I  have  already\r\n\r\nindicated,  it is proposed to resume these  talks\r\n\r\non  the  return  of  the Secretary  of  State  to\r\n\r\nSingapore on the 15th of August and I hope to  be\r\n\r\nable  to send a substantive reply to the Assembly\r\n\r\non the 18th August.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Members, in so  far  as  I\r\n\r\ncan, and very briefly, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconversations  that took place on the  Resolution\r\n\r\nof   this  House  which  was  presented  to   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor. Several  conversations\r\n\r\ntook   place   yesterday,  and  His   Excellency,\r\n\r\nalthough   naturally  maintaining   what   I   am\r\n\r\nconvinced  is his sincere view of the correctness\r\n\r\nof  his interpretation, went out of his way to be\r\n\r\nof every assistance he could to me in putting the\r\n\r\nposition, not only of the interpretation but  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  this House, and I would  be  churlish,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  I did not recognise the genuineness  of\r\n\r\nhis  efforts for an honourable solution  and  his\r\n\r\ndesire   to   meet  the  legitimate   aspirations\r\n\r\nindicated by this House. The Secretary of  State,\r\n\r\nwho  had just arrived after a tiring journey, was\r\n\r\nmost friendly, but there are implications, in his\r\n\r\nview,  of  a  character,  which  require  further\r\n\r\nclarification, consultation and consideration. In\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances, Sir, I did not feel it proper\r\n\r\nto  press - not  that I might have been  successful\r\n\r\nhad  I  pressed - when he suggested that he  would\r\n\r\nprefer  to  give a final decision  after  further\r\n\r\nconsideration and consultation on his return.  He\r\n\r\nwill  be  returning to Singapore on the  15th  of\r\n\r\nAugust,  and  the suggested date  is  the  l8th - a\r\n\r\nmatter of 16 days hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues involved are of a vital character,\r\n\r\nand  I think they do merit the full consideration\r\n\r\nthat  the Secretary of State seeks to give  them.\r\n\r\nThe   delay  is  not  a  long  one,  nor  is   it\r\n\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, for myself, that I am indebted to His\r\n\r\nExcellency  for the assurances indicated  in  his\r\n\r\nmessage,  and that for the time being perhaps  we\r\n\r\nshould  rest  there and proceed with  the  normal\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  the country. I am aware  that  many\r\n\r\nMembers  on  both sides of the House take  strong\r\n\r\nopposite  views, but, as I have always indicated,\r\n\r\nI am prepared to be guided by the feelings of the\r\n\r\nHouse  on the matter. I am ready to proceed  with\r\n\r\nthe business of the day, Sir, if the House should\r\n\r\nbe  inclined to accede to my suggestion that that\r\n\r\nshould  be  so.  But  if - and  I  think  there  is\r\n\r\nconsiderable validity in that view - they feel that\r\n\r\nthe  issues  may to some extent be  clouded,  and\r\n\r\nthat   they  must  be  now  maintained  in  their\r\n\r\npristine vigour, and perhaps pursued outside this\r\n\r\nChamber, I cannot see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat any damage would ensue by a postponement for 16 days of the immediate business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say this: that at its worst, it is my\r\n\r\nintention that there should be a further  sitting\r\n\r\nof  this House in order to enable the legislation\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House  to  be  passed  and   to   be\r\n\r\neffective. The social legislation we have  before\r\n\r\nus  is  of  a  vital character,  and  I  have  no\r\n\r\nintention, in so far as it lies in my  power,  to\r\n\r\ntake  action, which would prejudice its  becoming\r\n\r\nlaw. I am entirely subject to the guidance of the\r\n\r\nHouse in the suggestion I have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nit  is  my  anomalous position today to  be  more\r\n\r\nfierce than the Hon. the Chief Minister. He is  a\r\n\r\nterribly   sincere   man,  and   I   accept   the\r\n\r\nexplanation he has given why he wishes the  House\r\n\r\nto  carry on with the normal business of the day.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  in this Assembly we are  not  just\r\n\r\nexpressing our personal view of what is right  or\r\n\r\nwrong.  We  are the representatives through  whom\r\n\r\nthe  people  can put their somewhat  inarticulate\r\n\r\nbut,  nevertheless, very real  feelings  on  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of self-government, and the  very  real\r\n\r\nfeelings  that  have  been  aroused - as   I   said\r\n\r\naccidentally - on    this    question    of     the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  a section  of  the  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there is nothing in this reply,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  received this morning  from  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor, which  has  materially\r\n\r\naltered the position from what it was on the 26th\r\n\r\nof  July, except that on that day we had  a  much\r\n\r\nfiercer Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Chief Minister has said\r\n\r\nthat  he  would wish to be guided by the feelings\r\n\r\nof  this House. We did not have the advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  personal consultations and discussions  with\r\n\r\nHer   Majesty's  Secretary  of  State   for   the\r\n\r\nColonies.  We are therefore unable to fathom  the\r\n\r\ndepths  of  Her  Majesty's Secretary  of  State's\r\n\r\nsincerity. We, like the other people in Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaya, must judge him by his actions, by his\r\n\r\npublic conduct, his public declarations, and  not\r\n\r\nhis private assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this message, which has\r\n\r\ntaken us further than where we were when we  last\r\n\r\nadjourned on a matter of grave public importance.\r\n\r\nWe felt then that an issue had arisen, which must\r\n\r\nfirst be resolved before we could go on with  the\r\n\r\nday-to-day  business  of a  legislative  chamber.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing  in this  message,  which  can\r\n\r\nproperly influence us away from that stand. If we\r\n\r\ngo  on  with the normal business of the  day,  my\r\n\r\nview,  and the view of my Party, is that we  have\r\n\r\npublicly  indicated  to the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat   we,   as   their   representatives,    are\r\n\r\nsufficiently  satisfied  with  this  message,  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  from the very definite stand  which  we\r\n\r\ntook  at  the  last sitting. In my view,  if  all\r\n\r\nMembers  are agreed that they are satisfied  with\r\n\r\nthis  reply,  regardless of what happens  on  the\r\n\r\n18th  of  August, then we can go on.  If  we  are\r\n\r\nnot - that, in fact, the future course  of  events\r\n\r\nwill  be  determined by what His  Excellency  has\r\n\r\nbeen  pleased enough to call a substantive  reply\r\n\r\non  the  18th  of August, and it is a substantive\r\n\r\nreply  that will decide the course of events - then\r\n\r\nthe  view  of  my Party is that we  should  leave\r\n\r\nthings  as they are. We should give Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State for the Colonies  sufficient\r\n\r\ntime  to  consider  the  matter,  and  give   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor  sufficient   time   to\r\n\r\nconvince  the Secretary of State for the Colonies\r\n\r\nof  the  very  real  feelings of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  this matter. Not  necessarily  the\r\n\r\nfeelings expressed in the English language  Press\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  somewhat unkind  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  lately, but the feelings of  those  who\r\n\r\nare not sufficiently educated to write letters to\r\n\r\nthe  \"Man  in  the  Street\" or  \"We  the  People\"\r\n\r\ncolumns  in commercial newspapers whose interests\r\n\r\nmust  necessarily be reflected in the  policy  of\r\n\r\ntheir paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, by the time Mr Lennox-Boyd and Lady\r\n\r\nPatricia Boyd return from their sojourn in Borneo\r\n\r\nand   other  parts  of  the  British  Empire   in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia,  we  should  be  able  to   give\r\n\r\nsufficient articulation to the inchoate desire of\r\n\r\na  large mass of the people to be done away  with\r\n\r\nwhat  is  now  considered  a  term  of  abuse - the\r\n\r\ncolonial  system.

However, on going through the  message,\r\n\r\nI  find  that  there are other  matters  involved\r\n\r\nwhich  should be considered by the Assembly.  One\r\n\r\nof  them  is the wording of the Resolution  which\r\n\r\nthis Assembly approved a few days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-government and independence, as we all\r\n\r\nknow,  are vital principles, and we, the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers, who have pledged ourselves to carry  out\r\n\r\nour  duties  and responsibilities  to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople  cannot be satisfied with a reply of  this\r\n\r\nnature.

I  am  here  by the  nomination  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor to the appointment of a Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also in an anomalous position because I am\r\n\r\nnot only British by nationality, but also British\r\n\r\nby  birth - in fact, more British than many people,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  real British are the Welsh!  It  is\r\n\r\nworth  noting,  of course, that  the  British  in\r\n\r\nWales were the first subject race to be conquered\r\n\r\nby  the English! They have not yet achieved self-government either!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my position as a Nominated Member and\r\n\r\nas  a Britisher by race may perhaps make my voice\r\n\r\nworth  listening to since I can reasonably  claim\r\n\r\nto  speak with some impartiality. I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer, in a spirit of impartiality, to some words\r\n\r\nin   this  message  at  the  end  of  the  fourth\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the sincerity of their (Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment's)  policy  to  assist  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nachieve self-government within the British Commonwealth\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To achieve self-government within the British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth\". Now, when I spoke earlier on  this\r\n\r\nsame matter at our last sitting when we discussed\r\n\r\nthis crisis, I indicated that I thought that this\r\n\r\nterritory  would  necessarily have  to  associate\r\n\r\nitself with one of the great world groupings, and\r\n\r\nthat  I personally and emphatically preferred  to\r\n\r\nassociate  Singapore  with  the  Commonwealth  of\r\n\r\nNations.  However, I feel that if we  are  to  do\r\n\r\nthat, we must do it of our own free wish, by  our\r\n\r\nown  choice,  and not as the fruit  of  a  policy\r\n\r\ndecided  for  us elsewhere. I have throughout  my\r\n\r\nlife  felt  that  freedom  of  will,  freedom  of\r\n\r\nchoice, and freedom of action are basic to  human\r\n\r\ndignity,  and if we take any political decisions,\r\n\r\nwe  must take them for ourselves - right or  wrong.\r\n\r\nFreedom  has  no  meaning unless you  can  choose\r\n\r\nfully  and  freely for yourselves, and  it  means\r\n\r\nfreedom  to make a mistake as much as to do  what\r\n\r\nis  right. There must be nothing lacking  in  our\r\n\r\ndetermination  to  stand  by  that  principle  of\r\n\r\nfreedom and to demonstrate it in every way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not feel personally that it is of very\r\n\r\ngreat  significance whether we push  through  the\r\n\r\nlegislation today, or whether we delay it for  16\r\n\r\ndays.  I  was inclined at first to feel  that  we\r\n\r\nmight  as well go on with our legislation  today.\r\n\r\nbut  on further thought I see that if we do that,\r\n\r\nit  may be taken as a sign that we are not really\r\n\r\ngoing  to go ahead with our firm demand  for  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  freedom. I therefore  support  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar in his urging  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  suspend  public business  until  we  have\r\n\r\nreceived  a  fuller reply. I would  like  to  add\r\n\r\nthis, in answer to arguments that have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised  in  the Press and elsewhere.

I refer again to the  principle  of\r\n\r\nfreedom and say that if we appear to be hastening\r\n\r\nfaster  than the policy here indicated, the  need\r\n\r\nfor  speed  on  our part is not because  we  have\r\n\r\ndelayed  in  the  past, but  it  is  because  the\r\n\r\npredecessors  of  the  Secretary  of  State  have\r\n\r\ndelayed in the past: that no proper movement  was\r\n\r\ngiven   to  this  country  towards  freedom   and\r\n\r\ndemocracy until the post-war years, and that  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the past was to hope that nobody  would\r\n\r\nask, and then nothing would have to be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is in this country a danger of\r\n\r\nCommunist  subversion, of violence and terrorism,\r\n\r\nof  unrest and labour difficulties, they can  all\r\n\r\nbe  traced back, in my opinion, to the  delay  in\r\n\r\nmoving  this country forward towards freedom.  It\r\n\r\nis  impossible  for me to accept  the  view  that\r\n\r\nfurther  delay  will do anything except  increase\r\n\r\nthe  danger  and  promote in  every  way  further\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and damage to the welfare  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those thoughts in my mind, I do support\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar that in this  small\r\n\r\nmatter  of delaying public business for  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod,  we  are giving a clear demonstration  of\r\n\r\nour  feelings,  and  we  should  therefore  delay\r\n\r\npublic business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, the reply we received this morning from  His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Governor is more or less the  same\r\n\r\nas the one we received on the 26th of July, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full support of all the points raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew),\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.

If  it\r\n\r\nshould be necessary on the 18th of this month  to\r\n\r\ntake any step, which, in his view, would mean the\r\n\r\ndissolution  of  his Government, he  should  feel\r\n\r\nconfident of this: that this House will be prepared to sit with  him\r\n\r\nright  through  all  the  stages  of  the  social\r\n\r\nlegislation which he has tabled, and when it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  pushed  through  in a  proper  and  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner, then we can go and face the country. That\r\n\r\nis  an  assurance which I thought was so  obvious\r\n\r\nthat I had not given it before But if he feels in\r\n\r\nthe  least bit unhappy at the prospect of leaving\r\n\r\nhis   legislation,  which  is  almost   finished,\r\n\r\nunfinished, then I think he should remember  that\r\n\r\nno  one  would  quarrel with going on  with  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  until  all  the  legislation  has  been\r\n\r\npushed through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say - and I realise I am saying\r\n\r\nthis publicly - that I share his confidence that  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  solution will be worked  out.  But  I\r\n\r\ncannot share his confidence to such an extent  as\r\n\r\nto  abandon  my  stand and  to  go  on  with  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  the day. To do so would,  I  think,\r\n\r\nsuggest that we had acted rashly and foolishly on\r\n\r\nthe  26th  of July. For myself I do not think  we\r\n\r\ndid. We weighed the odds before we decided to  do\r\n\r\nwhat  we did. I believe we were right then,  that\r\n\r\nthere  was no other step for us to take  than  to\r\n\r\nstand  firm until we had resolved this  issue  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Chief Minister had clashed  with  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor. If we had  that  issue\r\n\r\nresolved  today,  then we would be  justified  in\r\n\r\naltering  our  stand.  But  there  has  been   no\r\n\r\nalteration whatsoever in the overall position. So\r\n\r\nif  there  is any other reason which  deters  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister from adopting the view that I have\r\n\r\nexpressed,  perhaps he would be  good  enough  to\r\n\r\nenlighten us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The  main reason is that the Land  Titles\r\n\r\nBill,  for example, is one of a complex character\r\n\r\nwhich  I should have liked to see referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  in order  to  enable  the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee,  which is particularly  affected,  and\r\n\r\nother  interests  to make proper representations,\r\n\r\nbefore  it  is  taken for its Third,  and  final,\r\n\r\nReading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of the Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which  I\r\n\r\nhope   this  House  would  pass.

In addition, the words in the final\r\n\r\nparagraph of the article were so taken out of the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the speech that a reader might  well\r\n\r\nconsider  that they referred to what is described\r\n\r\nin  the  article as \"the sentiments of the  Queen\r\n\r\nabout the constitutional progress of Singapore\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these additions, the impression must have\r\n\r\nbeen  created  in the minds of some  readers,  as\r\n\r\npointed out by the Chief Minister, that the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was guilty of casting some reflection on\r\n\r\nHer   Majesty.  This  particularly  is  extremely\r\n\r\nunfortunate. I was and am entirely satisfied that\r\n\r\nno  disrespect  was  shown or intended,  and  the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister  has  himself  stated  that   he\r\n\r\npersonally  resents very strongly the  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  he should be capable of discourtesy to  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of the words in the final\r\n\r\nparagraph  of the article out of the  context  of\r\n\r\nthe   Chief   Minister's   speech   resulted   in\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation, which is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether such misrepresentation was \"gross,\r\n\r\nwilful or scandalous\" is something, which, on the\r\n\r\nface of the article, is not easily apparent,  and\r\n\r\nif  the Powers and Privileges Bill had been  law,\r\n\r\nthe appropriate action would have been for me  to\r\n\r\nrefer the matter to a Committee of Privileges for\r\n\r\nfurther inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.
