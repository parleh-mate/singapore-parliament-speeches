Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is probably referring to the Public Utilities Board's (PUB) proposal to develop a golf course at the Lower Peirce Reservoir. This is still at a very preliminary stage as PUB has not submitted it to the Chief Planner for planning approval. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> PUB has commissioned an \"environmental impact study\" to determine the impact of the project on the ecology of the area. If the study shows that the golf course will cause extensive damage to the nature reserves, it is unlikely that the Chief Planner will approve it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that my Ministry is as aware as anybody else of the need to protect our nature reserves. Despite our limited land resource, we have set aside some 2,000 hectares of land in the Central Catchment and Bukit Timah areas as gazetted Nature Reserves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the National Parks Board is conducting a physical and biological survey of the nature reserves. This survey will provide National Parks Board with a comprehensive data base on the reserves' physical features and animal and plant life. The survey findings will be used to identify and preserve core areas with the richest concentration of animal and plant life. Through proper planning, National Parks Board can tap the full potential of our nature reserves for educational and recreational use with minimal impact on areas of greatest ecological value. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, which organisation has been commissioned to undertake the \"environmental impact study\" and what are their credentials? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot recollect the name of the person who has been engaged by the PUB.

I cannot tell the Member the name but obviously before they were selected we went through their qualifications. If the Member wants, I can supply him the name later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if this project is still in the proposal stage, why is it that an announcement has been made and this has created so much anxiety among certain Singaporeans? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the word \"proposal\" that I used is not quite the right word. It is an idea that the PUB is looking into. I do not know who made the announcement and how it came out in the press. Certainly no announcement was made by my Ministry or by the Planning Department. But somehow the subject emerged in the media and, of course, nature lovers jumped on it and blew it up into a big matter.

Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the demand for bigger Housing and Development Board purchased flats increased significantly in 1990 and 1991 and what further steps are being taken to reduce the waiting period for such flats under the new booking system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, demand for all categories of HDB flats has increased in recent years. In 1989, HDB received a total of 32,800 new applications for 4-room and larger flats. The number of applications increased to 35,100 in 1990 and 48,200 in 1991, an increase of 47% over the three-year period. This increase is due to the increasing number of applicants who are upgrading to bigger flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand for 5-room flats was especially buoyant, with the number of applications for 5-room flats nearly doubling over the last three years, from 10,100 in 1989, to 11,300 in 1990, and 19,200 in 1991. Over the same period, demand for Executive flats also rose but at a lower rate of about 26%. There were 7,400 applications in 1989 for Executive flats, 8,200 in 1990, and 9,300 in 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has therefore stepped up its Construction Programme for new flats over the past three years. But such increase in construction is constrained by the capacity \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the construction industry as a whole. It has to be done gradually so as to maintain quality and not overheat the construction industry and push up building costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the waiting period for certain groups of flat applicants, the balloting system for allocation of flats was modified at the beginning of this year to give priority in the allocation of flats to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) new households, in preference to upgraders; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) repeatedly unsuccessful applicants, in preference to first-time applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this change, new households who apply for 5-room and Executive flats in new towns under development such as Woodlands, Chua Chu Kang and Jurong West, are generally able to book a flat after two to three ballots, ie, about six to nine months from first application. As demand for flats in Tampines New Town is relatively high, those who apply for 5-room and Executive flats in Tampines may have to wait a little longer. Generally, they should be able to book a flat after three to four ballots. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Revised Balloting Scheme was implemented only recently and is working satisfactorily, it would be premature to modify it further. HDB will continue to monitor demand for HDB flats and will step up its Construction Programme for new flats as much as possible, to further reduce the waiting period for applicants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister two supplementary questions? Is the current new booking system working better than the old system? Are there plans to address the concern about increasing prices of HDB flats? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to go into all the advantages of the new booking system over the old waiting list system. The system is working well and people know at the time of application whether they are going to get a flat within a very specific period. Under the old system, they just put their names there and they did not know when they were going to be offered, where they were going to be offered, and what price they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were going to be offered. All these uncertainties are removed in the new booking system. My view is that it is a better system, both from the point of view of the buyer as well as from the point of view of HDB which has to build these flats. It has got a better idea as to what to build and where to build these flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing prices of HDB flats, yes, some concern has been expressed. But I think it is very important for Members to inform their constituents and the general public that when we talk of changes in the prices of HDB flats over a period of time, and when people talk of a 4-room flat going up by 20-30% in price, we are not talking about the same product or the same type of flat. HDB is not like McDonald's. You can go to any McDonald in Singapore, it is the same Big Mac that you are going to get, the price is the same and I assume that what you buy today will be the same as what you buy a month or a year from now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each HDB development is different It is in a different location, it has got a different orientation and it has got a different design. So you cannot compare, say, a 4-room flat built one year ago in Chua Chu Kang with a 4-room flat offered now in Tampines. They are not the same thing. Just as people would not compare developments in the private sector over different periods and in different places, I think people must get used to the idea that HDB is now building flats which are different. Every contract is virtually different because it takes into account location and builds in improvements that the HDB has tried out. In spite of the increased prices, it is very clear from the applications that people do value location and design and are prepared to pay for it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we compare the general increase in prices, we tend to lump together all the flats offered in a quarter. Many of the flats offered may be in the city area and the prices here are high. They can be as much as one-third more than similar size flats in the outlying new towns. In spite of that, applications are also high. In the mature \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> estates, for example, in Queenstown and Geylang, for every flat there are almost seven applicants. In other words, the total number of applications was seven times the number of flats that we offered in spite of the fact that the prices were about one-third more than elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards design, Members are aware that in the last quarter, we offered, for the first time, flats designed by private architects and built by contractors for the HDB. These prices were about 15% higher than the HDB-designed flats. Yet the applications were 18 1/2 times more than the number of flats offered. So people are prepared to pay for design. But if we get the feedback that people do not want better design or good locations, then of course HDB can go back to smaller flats, cheaper designs and poorer finishes. If people want that and that is the kind of feedback we get from the demand pattern, then we will go down to building such flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister agree that the price of public housing should be kept at a level which is affordable to Singaporeans? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is obviously one of the main considerations - whatever we build, whatever improvements and designs we provide in HDB flats should be within the affordability of Singaporeans. We constantly keep track of this and if the Member had looked at an article in the Business Times of 16th July, which is based on some facts given by the HDB, he would have noted that in spite of the increased price, the monthly income required to afford these flats - calculated on the basis of their CPF contributions - is, in fact, still much less than the average monthly household income. So affordability is an important criterion. We try to make sure that flats are built and priced in such a way that they continue to be affordable to Singaporeans. But what we cannot do is to build flats and price them in such a way that everybody can afford an Executive flat. That is not possible. There are 3-room, 4-room, 5-room and Executive flats. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provide the whole range. People must choose the flat that they can afford. We cannot promise to build the biggest flats in the best area and make them affordable to all Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WET MARKETS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Selling of stalls to existing stallholders)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment whether the Government has any plans to sell the stalls in some selected wet markets to the existing stallholders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government's policy is to divest itself from the management of markets and food centres over time.

You may continue, Mr Lee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I was trying to explain to Mr Chiam and to Members that although the Ministry registers the schools, it does not run the schools. For example, it does not run the private schools and there are many private schools. In the same way, the PCF kindergarten is a private school. So it is not for the Ministry to say whether they have certain conditions for their enrolment or whether they should expand the capacity in certain places. These are entirely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> matters for the management of the kindergartens. In the same way, for example, the Ministry of Finance registers companies, but it does not interfere in the management of the companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COST SHARING BY UNIVERSITY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STUDENTS AND FEE INCREASES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will explain the rationale for the long-term target of 25% cost sharing by university students and justify the recent National University of Singapore fees hike (1992/93) by making public the details of \"wage and other cost increases\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even with the recent fee revisions, university education in Singapore continues to be highly subsidised. The Government pays the entire capital cost and about 80% of the running cost of the two universities. Students in the universities make up about 5% of our student population but consume a disproportionate 20% of the total education budget. As university graduates will earn more than most Singaporeans, it is fair that they should eventually bear about 25% of the universities' operating budget. Otherwise the universities' share of the education budget will further increase, leaving less for those students who do not make it to the universities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities' operating budget for financial year 1992/93 is $517 million. This is an increase of 11% over their budget for financial year 1991. Manpower cost constitutes nearly 70% of their total operating budget and has increased by 14% in financial year 1992 over financial year 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my question I asked for details of \"wages and other cost increases\", not only percentage increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was giving the general picture. I do not have the details here. But if he wants them, I can supply them. There is no problem there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister to make public my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> question. I am asking details of \"wage and other cost increases\" in 1991 for NUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think the important figure is the 14% I mentioned. He can also find out the details from the budget book, for example, or from the University's annual report. It is no secret. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, why is the Ministry still increasing the University fees in the light of the Government's conclusion that wages have exceeded productivity and there should be lesser or no wage increase? Does the Minister think that parents can afford the increase? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> In terms of affordability, I think there is no difficulty. There are a number of schemes. For example, there is a Tuition Loan Scheme whereby students can borrow from the fund set up by the universities and they can repay over a period of up to 20 years, beginning two years after they graduate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the figure shows that only about 25% of the students are borrowing from that source. Some other students are borrowing from their parents' CPF. The increase this year has in fact been very marginal. It is only 5% to 7% as compared to the manpower cost increase of about 14%. So in that sense, the Government is in fact under-recovering the cost increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that the Government is spending less. The Government is also spending more. But it is a matter of policy that the share of the students should be maintained at about 20%, eventually increasing to 25%. The reason, as I have explained, is that it is fair to do this. Otherwise, they will be eating into the education budget and leaving less for the others. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned just now about loan schemes. Does the Minister think that it is healthy for the future of Singapore if our graduates are indebted as a result of study loans, even before they enter the job market? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think this is no different than, for example, when the students graduate and they borrow money to buy a house. So it is the same thing. The important point is that they are enjoying \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the most subsidy from the Government. Of course, the students will prefer that there is no fee increase. I think they should look at it positively that henceforth, the fee increases will be very moderate, keeping up with the cost increases and slowly creeping up to a 25% share. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students can be assured that over the next few years there will be no big sudden increase, unlike in the past few years. That is the essential point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Loh. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Supplementary question, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Loh has the floor. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Question No. 7, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCREASING NUMBER OF SMOKERS AMONG YOUTHS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Plans to reverse trend)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See</b> asked the Minister for Health what are his Ministry's plans to reverse the trend in the increasing number of smokers among our youths. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry's Smoking Control Programme has a two-pronged strategy - education and legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As education is the key to the prevention of smoking, my Ministry plans to step up the education of youths against smoking.

Most CPF members have used part of their savings to purchase HDB flats or private residential properties. They also use the monthly CPF contributions to meet their mortgage repayments. The result is that more than half of the CPF members have net balances of less than $22,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not feasible to allow CPF members to withdraw their savings to finance repayment of housing loans taken by their relatives, or to pay conservancy charges and living expenses incurred by their relatives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on medical expenses, the current Medisave Scheme allows the CPF member to use his Medisave to pay for the hospitalisation expenses of his dependants which include his spouse, children, parents and grandparents, provided their grandparents are either Singapore citizens or permanent residents. Extending this to include other relatives will only make it more difficult for the member to save for hospitalisation needs in his old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the CPF concept is based on family self-reliance. Each employee should save to meet his future requirements.

The high number of deregistrations is likely to result in increased demand for COEs in the next few months as some owners seek to replace their vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is now studying how best to recycle some of these COEs earlier. The study is being done together with the current review on the Vehicle Quota System, which we have operated for two years already.

So if you take the extraordinary number of vehicles, above and beyond this number, it is something like 16,000 or 17,000. So we really do not have the \"37,000\" figure that was mentioned by Mr Chiam. But having said that, as I explained in my answer just now, we are currently reviewing this policy of putting back the deregistered COEs 12 months later and try to bring them forward, with the intention of increasing the supply to keep up with the increased demand for COEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PREFERENTIAL ADDITIONAL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REGISTRATION FEE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Incentive to deregister cars</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>earlier than 10 years old)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether he will consider graduating the Preferential Additional Registration Fee benefit to provide an incentive to a car owner to deregister his car at an earlier age than ten years in order to enjoy a higher PARF value for his car. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find the Member's suggestion on the graduated PARF Scheme an interesting one.

The Town Councils Act allows Town Councils to control, manage, maintain and improve the common property of the public housing estates under their management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils can decide how best they wish to run the housing estates. For example, they can determine the level of services they wish to provide, and the amount of service and conservancy charges they want to levy.

First, HDB flats are owned by the lessees. HDB continues to own the common areas. The Town Council only manages the common areas on behalf of the owner, ie, the HDB. So if the Town Council wants to make any improvement to the common \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> areas, the Town Council has to apply to the HDB for the landowner's consent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why the Town Councils have to apply to HDB is that the Town Councils have to meet certain planning requirements and planning standards. HDB has been delegated certain powers by the Planning Department to oversee the planning provisions in the HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is, as the engineering authority delegated by the Building Control Division, HDB must also satisfy that any improvement that the Town Council wants to do will not affect the structural safety of the HDB blocks. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, despite municipal approvals, why is it that the Potong Pasir Town Council still needs to get clearance from the HDB in regard to planning and other factors?

Basically, the Town Councils are managing the estates on behalf of the owner. The Town Councils do not own the common property. So when you want to do something, obviously you have to seek the consent of the owner. That is the first reason. You are only managing the common property, you are not the landowner of the common property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is, as I have explained, you have to meet certain planning requirements and HDB will also evaluate the planning requirements and planning standards. HDB also evaluates the structural safety. If the Member has problem with any particular facility that he wants to implement in Potong Pasir and has not got approval from HDB, he can write to the Ministry of National Development and we will consider his request. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may like to know that most of the requests which he has put up have been approved - barbecue pits, sheltered pedestrian walkways, town signboards, residents' corner, multi-purpose court, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> even a swimming pool, which he asked for, have been approved by the HDB, as the landlord.

We do not agree with what the Minister has said. Recently, the Prime Minister has announced that Town Councils should play a bigger role. Now, if the HDB --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, please learn to frame your remarks in the form of a question. Could you go direct to your supplementary question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister willing to allow Town Councils to play a bigger role without, every now and then, having to get consent from the HDB in running the Town Councils? If so, is he willing to give the Town Councils a completely free hand to do so? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I have answered the question. HDB and the Ministry of National Development are not prepared to give the Town Councils a completely free hand where it interferes with the rights of the landowner. The Town Council has got a completely free hand to raise the SC and CC charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, will the Minister of State confirm that several Town Councils have implemented improvement projects in their towns and that Mr Chiam is only using this as an excuse for not taking these projects off the ground? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I not only confirm that but I am prepared to give a long list of the things which the Potong Pasir Town Council has requested for and they have been approved. As I rattled off just now, there were barbecue pits, sheltered pedestrian walkways, signboards, residents' corner, multi-purpose court, swimming pool, widening of footbridge, security grilles. I can go on, but I would not want to embarrass him by stating the status of the implementation. So there is no problem in getting approval from HDB, as the landlord. All the other Town Councils go through the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> same procedures. They have got the permission very promptly and they executed their improvements. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If the Minister is right, does he not realise that the permission given to build a creche at Block 139 of Potong Pasir Estate has been revoked by the HDB? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the Member is referring to the child care centre that the Potong Pasir Town Council has put up, child care centres are provided by the private sector and HDB, as the landowner, generally disallows child care centres to be put up in the void decks. The particular case in Block 139 has been given approval by HDB. It has not been revoked. HDB has informed the Potong Pasir Town Council that another urgent requirement has come up and that the child care centre will be put up in a year's time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Since the Minister is in front of me, I would like to ask him which alternative site has the HDB given to the Potong Pasir Town Council to build a creche that has been refused permission? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HDB has not given the Member an alternative site because the site that has been allocated to him will be built. It will be built side by side with the other facilities that are coming up. But to stage the implementation of the various facilities in Potong Pasir, HDB has told him that the construction of the child care centre will be delayed by one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We have letters from the HDB saying that the HDB is building an alternative child care centre next to this mental home that has been taken over from the original site. That is what the HDB said. I am afraid the Minister's answer is wrong. I am asking now whether or not he would like to clarify his answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The answers which I have given are the facts. You have been allocated a site to build a child care centre. That site has been taken over by a more urgent requirement for a facility for the aged.

The new Authority will take over the existing functions of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and act as agent of the Government in administering, assessing, collecting and enforcing payment of income tax, property tax, stamp duties, estate duties and other taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRD implements the Government's taxation policies. It plays a key role in collecting revenue to finance the operations of the Government. In 1991, IRD collected $7.85 billion or 56.4% of total Government operating revenue. From the Government's viewpoint, it is therefore very critical that IRD be prompt in its assessment and collection of taxes. IRD must be well managed and efficiently run. To enable IRD to respond to the changing operating environment, its line managers must be given sufficient manpower resources and expertise and the flexibility to manage them. There must also be adequate resources if IRD is to safeguard the integrity of the tax system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its operations, the IRD has to deal with some 1.2 million income taxpayers and some 700,000 property taxpayers. This tax base is growing every year. As the tax \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> payer population covers a wide spectrum of the public, ranging from individual taxpayers to big corporations, IRD must be able to provide a high standard of public service and be responsive to their needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, IRD will be able to perform its functions more effectively. With the flexibility to formulate its own personnel policies and offer more competitive wages, it will be in a better position than as a Government department to compete with the private sector for its fair share of available talent in the market. It will be better able to attract and retain the right people to enhance its management and professional competence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes and improvements will result in tax revenue for the Government being collected more promptly. They will also benefit the public. Taxpayers can expect more responsive and better quality service. The conversion will, however, not affect the amount of taxes the public has to pay. The amount of taxes depends on tax policies and tax rates as decided by the Ministry and approved by Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to draw the attention of the House to the main clauses of the Bill. Clause 3 establishes the Authority as a body corporate. Clause 5 provides that the Minister for Finance will be the ex-officio Chairman of the Authority. This is a necessary safeguard given the sensitivity of tax administration and collection. In addition to the Chairman, there will be four to six other members of the Authority, to be appointed by the Minister from among persons who have had experience in public administration, financial, tax or commercial matters. Among these members will be the Deputy Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 set out the functions and powers of the Authority. The Authority will perform the present functions of IRD in administering, assessing, collecting and enforcing payment of taxes. As a statutory body, the Authority will act as agent of the Government in these matters. It will also take over the other non-revenue functions currently undertaken by IRD such as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> representing Singapore in negotiations with other countries on the avoidance of double taxation, providing advice on property valuation, and the registration and supervision of charities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9, the CEO of the Authority, to be known as Commissioner of Inland Revenue, will be responsible to the Chairman for the proper administration of the Authority's functions. The Authority will also consult the Public Service Commission before appointing the Chief Executive Officer. It is my intention that the CEO of the Authority will also be appointed as the Comptroller of Income Tax, the Comptroller of Property Tax, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties, the Commissioner of Estate Duties and the Commissioner of Charities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO of the Authority will discharge the duties of these various statutory offices. This is in line with the current practice whereby the person holding the departmental title of Commissioner of Inland Revenue also holds these various statutory offices. With this arrangement, the powers to assess, collect and enforce payment of income tax will remain with the Comptroller of Income Tax. Similarly, such powers in relation to property tax will remain with the Comptroller of Property Tax. Therefore, tax returns and notices will continue to be in the name of the Comptroller, and not the Authority. There will be no change in the legal relationship between the taxpayer and the Comptroller after the Authority is established. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 to 17 set out the financial provisions governing the Authority. The Authority, in return for the services it renders to the Government, will be paid an agency fee to finance its operations. The tax moneys collected by the Authority will be paid into the Consolidated Fund. The accounts for the Government's tax revenue and the Authority's internal funds will be kept separate. Financial statements relating to both accounts will be presented to Parliament each year. The financial statements of the Authority will be audited by the Auditor-General. Further details on financial provisions are set out in the Second \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Schedule, which follows the model provisions stipulated by the Auditor-General. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to discuss clauses 18 to 24 which provide for the transfer of assets, liabilities and employees of IRD to the Authority. Under clause 18, the rights and obligations relating to IRD in connection with taxes or licence fees will remain with the Government and will not be transferred to the Authority. Under clause 19, such categories of staff in IRD as the Minister may determine will be transferred to the Authority on terms not less favourable than what they were enjoying before the transfer. Pension rights of these transferred officers will also be preserved. These are standard provisions which are also found in other Acts where Government departments were converted into statutory boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final part of the Bill from clauses 25 to 31 relate to general provisions. As the Authority is acting as an agent of the Government in tax matters, legal proceedings in such matters will continue to be brought by or against the Government, and not the Authority. However, since the Authority will be administering the Acts specified in the Third Schedule, its officers will continue to represent the Government in criminal proceedings for offences under these Acts. These officers will, however, have to be authorised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the consent of the Attorney-General. Clause 26 also provides for the Authority's legal officers to represent the Government in any civil proceedings involving tax matters. This preserves the current position where legal officers of the IRD appear in tax cases before the Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that this Bill will put our tax administration in a better position to cope with its heavy workload, and to meet future challenges it will face in the task of tax collection and administration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> support for the Bill which provides for the conversion of the Inland Revenue Department into a statutory board to be called the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). At present, one of the major difficulties of the Inland Revenue Department is the lack of manpower to process tax returns. As a statutory board, the IRAS will be better placed to attract and retain good officers by offering them competitive wages and more flexible perks and benefits which are closer to the market. I agree with the Minister that a tax administration which has motivated and well-trained staff will mean greater efficiency and better service to the taxpayers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am, in principle, supportive of the Bill, I would like to seek a few points of clarification with the Minister with regard to how he envisage the new Authority would operate and how it could function in an efficient and cost effective manner. As the IRAS is acting essentially as the managing agent of the Government to provide a service in administering, assessing and collecting taxes, I wonder how the IRAS' efficiency and effectiveness can be measured and sustained. The point I would like to make is that unlike other statutory boards where some performance reference can be made to similar private sector practices or entities, or to similar activities in other countries, the proposed IRAS is not subject to market competition. Therefore, it does not need to be cost or manpower conscious as there is no bottom line or profit and loss for the IRAS to be conscious of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same line of argument, I wonder what kind of checks and controls the Minister would apply to ensure the financial and manpower usage discipline of the IRAS. It may well be possible that the IRAS could just simply seek to employ more and more people to process the backlog of tax assessments rather than to be more cost conscious and to seek out more innovative and efficient methods, such as to intensify its computerisation programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a final query that I have is that in the formation of the IRAS, would the Government be thinking that with its plan to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> eventually introduce consumption tax, there will be more manpower and administrative cost involved? Therefore, forming a statutory board now could be a conduit for more flexibility in manpower recruitment and future cost increases. My primary concern, Sir, is: Would the taxpayers be paying more to process their own tax assessments than before? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, given the record of the Government for its efficiency in collecting vast amounts of money from the people, the Opposition is naturally apprehensive about the handing over of the job of collecting the nation's revenue to an independent body. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to last year's annual report of the Inland Revenue Department, the total revenue collected by the Government was $27.412 billion, 40% of which, at $7.842 billion, were collected by the Inland Revenue Department from the various types of taxes. The amounts collected year after year by the Government are far in excess of the Government's total annual expenses. No wonder, the Minister for Finance almost in a reflex action can announce massive budget surpluses yearly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did express the fear in last year's Budget debate that the incumbent Government may be forced to increase its own savings as a result of the amendments to the Constitution giving powers to the Elected President to stop a Government from using the national reserves which it did not earn. Is the transfer of duties of collecting Government revenue from the Government department to an independent statutory body an attempt to increase the already high Government revenue to an over-flowing level so as to accumulate more reserves for the present Government? If that is so, then the cost of living and the cost of doing business in Singapore naturally will further increase. In that event, there shall be further hardship on the working people and local businessmen shall suffer even more. The Government has already got a very sharp knife in respect of the Inland Revenue Department in collecting taxes. Why does it need a still sharper knife? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people at the ground speculate that the conversion of the Inland Revenue Department to a statutory body is a natural progression of the Government's privatisation policy. A statutory board like the Singapore Telecom has been privatised. Very soon, the PUB shall also be privatised. These privatised bodies may soon be listed in the Singapore Stock Exchange. The Government, in taking these steps, intends to make massive amounts of profits. With profit motive in mind, will the Inland Revenue Department also take the path of the Singapore Telecom and the PUB? I would like the Minister to let the public know whether or not the Inland Revenue Department will also be eventually privatised and be listed in the Singapore Stock Exchange, since the Government is so bent in making huge profits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a few clarifications on Mr Chiam's points. I believe that the IRAS is not going to be a private company to be listed in the Stock Exchange. Perhaps that is his hope. But, as I understand it, the IRAS is going to be a statutory board. So I think he is extending his imagination too far. Besides, Singapore Telecom is not a private company yet. He continues to talk about how Singaporeans are paying onerous and burdensome tax. The fact is that while the tax paid in Singapore is wide, not many people pay a lot of taxes. Most people in Singapore pay less than $500 in taxes or thereabouts. If you factor in the benefits, I think most Singaporeans will agree that what they pay is value for money. So I think his arguments are totally groundless, totally irrelevant. I think he has a high sense of drama and he exaggerates minor things, and he has a flair for hyperbole. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the proposed Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) are now being competently performed by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). This includes administering, assessing, collecting and enforcing payment of taxes on behalf of the Government. It also carries \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> out non-revenue functions like negotiating with other countries for the avoidance of double taxation, registering and supervising charities and providing advice on property valuations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these functions are being competently performed by the IRD, I believe that by allowing the IRD to become a statutory board, it can do its job better. How? I think some of the reasons have been elucidated by the Minister and Mr Leong. Basically, by becoming a statutory board, the IRAS will have the flexibility to formulate its own personnel and financial policies. In short, it can hire and fire, and be more accountable to the public in terms of cost and efficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ties in very nicely with the President's Address of January 1992. In that Address, the President advised that Government departments should, whenever possible, be subject to the market discipline as private companies do, but not amounting to what Mr Chiam has understood to be listed in the Stock Exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the efficiency of taxation is not transparent because it does not undertake its own staff recruitment, it does not pay for its services rendered by other agencies, neither does it pay for rental for office space. The proposed IRAS Act will force the full cost of tax collection to be totally transparent. But, first to increase efficiency, I believe the IRAS must recruit competent and motivated staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the turnover of staff in the IRD is presently very high, higher than most civil service departments. This is not surprising because the nature of the job makes them very marketable and valuable. Yet at the same time, the administering of tax collection and the enforcing of tax payments are an arduous task not designed for the feeble-minded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRD officers are often at the sharp end of public fury. Why? Because few people like to pay taxes, and those who pay taxes, most of them think that they have been over-assessed. So they scream over the telephone, they bang tables at the counter at the IRD. I support the proposal to pay \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the IRAS officers competitive market salaries because what we pay them will be more than returned to us when tax efficiency rises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more efficiently our IRD officers collect taxes, the less all of us need to pay taxes. Because for everyone who is not paying taxes, the tax burden shifts to somebody else, or else total Government expenditure must drop, because inputs drop, meaning a drop in the quality of service, and by extension, a drop in the quality of life. If everybody pays taxes, then the tax burden will be spread over a wider base, and it will never become too heavy for any one individual. I think we must work on the principle that everybody who receives services from the Government should pay taxes, and those who have not been paying taxes, should be dragged into the tax net. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My principal concern in supporting this IRAS Bill is the welfare of the existing civil servants in the IRD. I have, however, been assured that their welfare has been carefully considered. I am told, and in fact the Minister has just reinforced that, that everybody will be given a choice to either stay in the civil service or be transferred or seconded to the new statutory board. And the salary of those transferred will be no less favourable than those enjoyed by the same officers in the civil service. My advice to the existing civil servants in the IRD is to quickly join the IRAS before they close the door. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I really cannot think of any rational being who might wish to oppose this Bill. But then perhaps I could be wrong. Clearly, it is not in the interest of those who have cheated on the IRD or who wish to cheat the IRD, to want the IRAS to be more efficient than the IRD. These people might oppose the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since none of these people is represented in this House, I should think that the Minister will get unanimous support from the hon. Members in this Chamber. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of order? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I object to the Member trying to imply that anybody who does not support the Bill intends to cheat the Inland Revenue Department. I think that this statement that he has made should be withdrawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, Mr Chiam, that is not a point of order. Mr Koo, you can continue with your speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I have already concluded my speech, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Leong and Mr Koo for supporting the Bill. I will try to alleviate Mr Chiam's concerns about the reasons for the change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong was concerned about how the effectiveness of the IRD would be affected by the change from a Government department to a statutory board. Basically, the same criteria in evaluating and monitoring the performance of the IRD would be applied in the case of the Board. Do not forget, the Chairman of the Board will be the Minister for Finance and the Deputy Chairman is intended to be the Permanent Secretary (Revenue). So these are precisely the same people who are now concerned with overseeing the activities of the Department. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the performance of the IRD, three basic criteria are used. The first is to assess the cost of collecting each dollar of revenue. In other words, we monitor the amount of money which the IRD, or the IRAS as a statutory board, consumes in collecting every dollar of revenue. So far, the performance has been good although it could be improved because a lot of taxes remain uncollected. Currently, the most recent figure is that for every dollar of revenue collected the cost is about three-quarters of one cent, which I think is very good by international standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another way of monitoring IRD's performance is in ascertaining the efficiency with which its assessments are processed and taxes collected. Here, as I have stated, the performance is not adequate at all because of a shortage of staff. Hence, the proposal to convert the department to a statutory board to allow it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more flexibility to employ staff and pay them sufficient wages to retain them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final criterion used to measure the performance of the tax collection department is the public satisfaction of taxpayers. Here we conduct surveys of taxpayers to assess whether they are satisfied with the service that they are receiving from the Department from time to time. So there should be no change in the use of these criteria in evaluating the performance of the statutory board as opposed to the Department. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also wanted to know whether the conversion will cost the Government additional money. Effectively, there will be no change whatsoever in the cost of collection other than the need perhaps to recruit additional staff in the future to make up for positions which have never been filled. But as far as the Government is concerned, we will try to ensure that the cost of collection does not increase the tax burden of the taxpayer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the concerns raised by Mr Chiam. He was also worried that the transfer of the Department to a statutory board would mean an increase in both the tax collected from the public and wanted to know why it is necessary to sharpen the knife to collect more taxes since the Government is already collecting vast sums. I would like to assure him that the tax levying function is still retained by the Ministry of Finance, subject to the approval of Parliament. In other words, only the Ministry of Finance and the Government can propose tax changes which affect the tax payable by our citizens, and that is subject to final approval by Parliament. The IRAS has no power whatsoever to change tax rates. It merely collects what is due to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is no question of a sharper knife needed, except to collect taxes which taxpayers already owed the Government, which they by law should pay but have remained uncollected because the staff of the Department are unable to process large numbers of cases. I have quoted in the Budget debate the level of uncollected taxes, and the current figure is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> still around $1.14 billion of uncollected taxes a year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also wanted to know why we need to collect more of the uncollected taxes because revenue collections are rising very healthily, and we have large balances and surpluses. Tax rates, as I said, are determined by Government, and Government's record in tax changes, I think, has been very satisfactory, in fact very generous, because over the past few years both corporate and personal taxes have been cut regularly. We have in fact not increased taxes other than those levied for specific social needs, such as petroleum taxes, liquor taxes, tobacco taxes and water conservation taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we are able, notwithstanding falls in taxes and cuts in taxes, to increase our revenue collections is because the economy has been growing very strongly, and Government has exercised very careful controls over expenditure; hence the surpluses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to address the question raised by Mr Koo about concerns over protection of the staff of IRD who are being transferred to the statutory board. I have said earlier that all their rights will be preserved. There are two categories of staff in the Inland Revenue Department. Those who are considered to be Inland Revenue Officers - and these are people concerned with tax evaluation, property evaluation, and legal officers - this class of employees would be compulsorily transferred to the new Inland Revenue statutory board, because their services are essential to the functioning of the IRAS. The balance of the staff which accounts for some 45% of the total staff of the Department, are support staff like clerks, record keepers, typists, and so forth, they are offered the option of either remaining with Government or transferring to the statutory board. But whether they choose to remain with Government or be transferred to the new statutory board, their rights and employment terms are protected fully. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have a clarification from the Minister? The Inland \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Revenue Department has in fact improved on its performance. Last year, as the Minister pointed out, 0.75 cents was used to collect $1 of tax. There was an improvement from 0.79 cents of the previous year. In other words, its efficiency has been going up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I want to ask what a statutory body can do which the Inland Revenue Department cannot do in collecting this $1.14 billion of uncollected taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two factors - the performance of the Inland Revenue has been improving, and what the statutory board can do which the Inland Revenue at the moment cannot do. So there is really no reason to change. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The performance indicator of cost per revenue dollar collected applies only to revenue collected. If you have not collected it, that portion is missing. And that is why I said earlier, there are three criteria used - the number of assessments you can process, and hence the number of cases where you have successfully collected, and that cost is progressively decreasing. So it is efficient. But where the inefficiency arises is the inability to process about half the number of cases. So the need to process these half the number of cases, which account for the $1.14 billion worth of uncollected taxes, is the main reason why we want to convert from a Government department to a statutory board. And as I have said earlier in the Second Reading speech, the main reason is, as Mr Koo has noted, the Inland Revenue Department has been unable to recruit staff to fill the positions of substantial numbers of its key tax assessment and valuation people who have left for the private sector for much better salaries. A Government department cannot pay the sort of competitive wages to retain its staff because the question of relativity over the large civil service structure makes it impossible. Hence the need to convert to a statutory board which has much more autonomy in the selection of staff, in recruitment, not subject to Public Service Commission's criteria, and it can pay competitive wages outside the civil service structure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS FUND (DISSOLUTION) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to dissolve the Redundancy Payments Fund (RPF). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Fund was established in March 1968 under the Redundancy Payments Fund Act to administer the retrenchment benefits paid to employees affected by the withdrawal of the British forces from Singapore. Under the Act, all such benefits must be paid into an account in the RPF. If the retrenched employee is a citizen, he can withdraw monthly amounts from this account until it is exhausted. However, if he is a non-citizen, his monthly payments stop when two-thirds of the original balance are exhausted. The remaining one-third is paid to him only when he leaves Singapore permanently or when he acquires Singapore citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were originally a total of about 25,000 members in the Fund. As at the end of last year, only 556 members were left. Eighty-nine of these are citizens, of whom three are still receiving monthly payments from the Fund. The remaining 467 are non-citizens who will receive their one-third residual balances when they leave Singapore permanently or when they acquire Singapore citizenship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with only three citizen members still receiving their monthly payments, the RPF is now practically dormant. The Government has decided to dissolve the Fund as it has outlived its purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of last year, the Fund has a balance of $4.4 million, of which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> $1.1 million belongs to the existing 556 members, while the remaining amount is surplus. The surplus came about because investments of the Fund between 1968 and 1986 were earning higher returns than the interest rate of 5.25% per annum paid to members in accordance with the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has decided that the citizen members be paid their balances in full before dissolution of the Fund. This is provided for in clause 4 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the non-citizen members, they are provided for in clause 5 of the Bill. Non-citizen members who are already residing abroad, or about to leave Singapore permanently, will be given a final opportunity to withdraw the balance due to them. If they fail to do so, the balance will be transferred to their Medisave accounts. The clause also provides for the balances of non-citizen members, who reside in Singapore, to be transferred to their Medisave accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 9 of the Bill provides for the transfer of the remaining balances in the RPF, including accumulated surplus, to the Workers' Fund established under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Amongst other uses, the Workers' Fund provides financial assistance to injured workers who have failed to secure workmen's compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 11 of the Bill seeks to repeal the RPF Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to seek a clarification from the Minister regarding the moneys in the Redundancy Fund. As I see it, the moneys in the Fund belong to the members. And if this is correct, should not the surpluses in the Fund be distributed to the members or credited to their Medisave accounts, instead of being transferred to the Workers' Fund, as provided for in clause 9 of the Bill? Could the Minister explain, please? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is whether the surpluses in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> RPF should be distributed to the existing members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier on, the surplus came about because over the years the rate of return earned from investment of the Fund was consistently higher than the interest rate of 5.25% provided for under the Redundancy Payments Fund Act. Most of the investments were in the form of government bonds. In 1968 when Government fixed the interest rate of 5.25%, the prevailing interest rate ranged from 5.5% to 6%. All the payments from the RPF were also exempted from income tax. Therefore, the 5.25% guaranteed under the Redundancy Payments Fund was significantly better than the prevailing interest rate in 1968. Furthermore, the Government also undertook to pay this amount of interest even if the revenue from the principal in the Fund amounted to less than 5.25%. So the 5.25% is a guaranteed return on the money held in trust for the members of the Fund. Hence, all members have been adequately compensated and transfer of the surplus to the Workers' Fund is fair and equitable. Furthermore, the Workers' Fund will be available to help the workers who have been unsuccessful, for a variety of reasons, in their claims for workmen's compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I believe Members would like to know the amount in the Fund, the number of members and, in the case where a member cannot be traced,because this Fund first came into being 24 years ago, what happens to the unclaimed funds? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, I did say earlier on that, at the end of last year, there were only 556 members left in the Fund, and for any unclaimed funds, the administrator of the Redundancy Payments Fund will mount a special exercise to locate and to pay all the members the amount that is due to them. If the member has passed away in the meantime, then the money will be paid to the nominees. However, if the member has no nominees, or he is not traceable, the money that is standing in his account will be transferred to the Public Trustees to be disposed of in accordance with the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill proposes additional provisions for the collection of compulsory Medisave contributions from self-employed persons and the use of CPF savings by CPF members to pay for their share of the cost under the HDB upgrading programme. The Bill also seeks to provide for the appointment of a Deputy Chairman for the CPF Board who, in the absence of the Chairman, will carry out his duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as announced by the Minister for Health during the 1992 Budget Debate, self-employed persons will be required to contribute to Medisave. This will enable self-employed to provide for their hospitalisation needs. It is in the interests of the self-employed to save in anticipation of their future needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from 1st July 1992, all self-employed earning more than $200 per month (or $2,400 per year) were required, under section 77(1)(e) of the existing CPF Act, to contribute 3% of their earned income into their Medisave accounts. The rate of contribution will increase to 4% in January 1994 and thereafter by 1% per year until it reaches the same rate of Medisave contribution as for employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new provisions to be included in the CPF Act for the collection of Medisave from the self-employed are in clauses 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11. I shall elaborate on these clauses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 5 of the Act to extend the investigation powers of the CPF Board's inspectors to cover the self-employed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the charging of interest on late payment of CPF contribution by the self-employed. The interest charged will be credited into the Medisave account of the self-employed to make up for the loss in interest that would have accrued had he contributed his Medisave payment on time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8(b) provides for the crediting of contributions made by the self-employed to the Medisave, Ordinary or Special Account as the Minister may direct. Sir, such contributions will initially be channelled entirely to the Medisave account. However, should the amount accumulated in the Medisave account exceed the prescribed limit (which is $15,000 currently), the excess will be channelled to the Ordinary Account, as is the practice for employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 8(c) is a new provision. At present, there is a prescribed upper limit of $15,000 for each CPF member's Medisave, and I have mentioned this earlier. Upon reaching this limit, monthly contributions are credited to his Ordinary Account. Clause 8(c) will enable such overflows into the Ordinary Account to be transferred back to the Medisave account. However, applications for such transfer are subject to approval by the Minister. This provision is intended to help those CPF members who have exhausted their Medisave savings after reaching the prescribed limit, but continue to have large balances in their Ordinary Accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the self-employed require licensing by the various authorities to carry out their trade or business or to practise their profession or vocation. To ensure that such self-employed persons do contribute to Medisave, clause 9 of the Bill gives the licensing authorities the power to impose contribution to Medisave by the self-employed as a condition for the granting or renewal of any licence, certificate or permit. In practice, the licensing authorities will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> require the self-employed to show proof of their Medisave contributions before licences are issued or renewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11(a) of the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations to provide for the appointment of agents for the assessment, collection and recovery of CPF contributions. For instance, the Inland Revenue Department could be appointed under this provision to assess and, if necessary, collect CPF contributions for the self-employed as an agent of the CPF Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is now embarking on an upgrading programme for older HDB flats. Upgrading will enhance the value of older HDB flats. It is, therefore, in the long-term interest of owners of such HDB flats to be allowed to use their CPF savings to pay for their share of the upgrading cost. Clause 11(c) of the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations to allow CPF members to withdraw CPF savings for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Ministry is also taking the opportunity to amend section 11 of the Act to strengthen the existing financial and auditing provisions as requested by the Auditor-General. These new provisions, as well as the existing ones, are in the new Second Schedule created under clause 7 of the Bill. Sir, HDB, URA and TAS have similar provisions in their Acts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well-intentioned. It provides for the self-employed persons to open and to contribute to their Medisave accounts. It also allows the use of CPF for the upgrading of HDB flats. I have spoken to a number of self-employed persons - the hawkers, taxi drivers and shopkeepers. Their response to the Medisave scheme for the self-employed has been positive. Generally, they appreciate the need to put aside some money while they are still fit and healthy, and the need to save to pay for the medical bills and to meet the unforeseen emergencies is all the more pressing with rising medical cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the scheme to allow HDB owners to use their CPF for upgrading work, this is welcomed by the flat owners. But I have a question to ask the Minister. The HDB flats which are to be upgraded are generally the older ones. Invariably, the residents who live in those flats tend to be our older citizens. Some may still have their children staying with them but there are those whose children have already been married and moved out. So some of these older residents may have difficulty paying for the upgrading work. They may not have CPF accounts, or may not have sufficient balance in their accounts. I would like to know if the Government would allow such flat owners to use the CPF savings of their children to help pay for the upgrading work, if their children are willing to help. After all, there is already a CPF Topping-Up Scheme in place, which allows the children of the CPF account holders to top up their parents' CPF retirement accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would appreciate the Minister's response to this suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the original purpose of the CPF scheme is for the workers to accumulate a sum of money as security for their old age. Later on, the Government imposed such high rates that each worker has accumulated fairly large savings which are more than enough as a nest-egg for their old age. So the Government amended the CPF Act and the workers are allowed to use their CPF for various purposes other than the original intention of the CPF, such as buying of HDB flats, private houses and commercial properties, and also to invest in shares and gold. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have before the House this amendment which will stray from the original purpose in which the CPF was set up. A person is now asked to contribute not for his old age but as a form of medical insurance. Is the Government not straying from its original purpose? Having set a precedent today, then what is there to stop the Government from using the CPF for purposes other than as a security for old age? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Mr Goh Chee Wee, Chairman \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the GPC for Labour, for his support on the extension of the Medisave scheme to the self-employed. He asked whether a CPF member would be allowed to use his CPF saving to pay for the owner's share of the upgrading cost for his parent's flat. Mr Goh mentioned that there is already a Topping-Up Scheme for the children to top up their parents' CPF accounts. I would like to point out that the Topping-Up Scheme is only for the purpose of establishing the minimum sum for their parents' accounts. In other words, at the point of retirement, if their parents do not have sufficient balances in their CPF accounts to maintain a minimum sum, the children can use their CPF savings or cash to top up their parents' CPF accounts to the minimum sum level. In most cases, the parents are already owners of HDB flats and therefore they would be able to meet the Minimum Sum Scheme by pledging their HDB flats. Therefore, the Topping-Up Scheme is not applicable in this case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we could allow members to use their CPF to top up their parents' CPF accounts to pay for their share of the upgrading cost, my feeling is that this is not necessary because the Minister for National Development, when announcing the HDB upgrading programme, also offered to assist the older home owners who lack CPF or cash savings to pay for their share of the upgrading cost. The Minister then said that the HDB will proceed with the upgrading for such people who may not have the cash or adequate CPF to pay for their share. But HDB will impose a condition that the owner must reimburse HDB when the flat is subsequently sold. In effect, HDB is saying that it is prepared to advance a second loan to the home owner to enable the owner to take part in the upgrading exercise, and that the payment of the loan would be deferred until the flat is sold. HDB will, of course, have to charge an appropriate interest on such loan. With this offer by HDB, there is no need for CPF members to use their savings to top up their parent's CPF account in order to enable them to meet their share of the upgrading cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam has said that the Government is straying from the original purpose of CPF by requiring the self-employed to contribute to Medisave. Medisave is not a new scheme. Medisave has been in existence since 1984. It is very much part and parcel of the original concept of the CPF Act to enable all wage earners, all workers, to put aside some of their income in anticipation of their future requirements, whether it is just retirement expenses, living expenses, but also to meet their future medical expenses. Therefore, extending the Medisave scheme to include the self-employed is very much in line with the objectives of the CPF scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the CPF scheme for home ownership and to allow members to use their balance to invest in stocks, shares or gold is again part of the concept of allowing Singaporeans to increase their asset value. They are allowed to use their CPF savings to build up their assets, so that in future when they retire and when they are not working, they will have sufficient savings to provide them with income to meet their living expenses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a need for me to answer the point about Government extending the use of CPF, because it is highly speculative. The Government has no other intention of allowing CPF to be used for purposes other than what has already been stated, which is for retirement, for housing and for medical expenses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just want a clarification from the Minister. In this particular amendment, self-employed persons will contribute to the CPF specifically for their hospitalisation and medical needs, and not for their old age. That is my point. Whereas other CPF members contribute, in the first place, for their old age needs, and then for other investments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Chiam for raising \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this point. In fact, he is correct. We are only extending this contribution to the CPF by the self-employed for Medisave at this present moment. In fact, we would like to encourage all self-employed persons to contribute to the other accounts in the CPF, ie, Ordinary Account and the Special Account. I am very pleased that Mr Chiam supports this move. In due course, perhaps we can take up his suggestion and move in the direction to extend the entire CPF scheme to all self-employed persons. Anyway, at the present moment, CPF does encourage all self-employed persons to contribute to the CPF as any other employee. It is voluntary. And in order to encourage them, CPF actually provides all self-employed persons who make contribution to their CPF account tax exemption on CPF contributions up to a limit of, I believe, about $12,800 a year. So this is a gesture to ensure that the self-employed are not left out of the CPF scheme and they are also able to save from their current income to put aside money which they will need for their old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RECLAMATION (TUAS)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.
