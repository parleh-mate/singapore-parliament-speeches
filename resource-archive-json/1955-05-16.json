Goode):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this is a sad and an anxious  occasion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  barely  three weeks since this  new  Assembly,\r\n\r\nmainly  composed  of  elected representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore,  was formally  opened  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the majority party stated its  programme\r\n\r\nfor  the  coming year. We had then many fine  speeches\r\n\r\nand keen cut and thrust in debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, less than three weeks later, it has been the\r\n\r\nunfortunate duty of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to call this second sitting as an emergency\r\n\r\nsitting in order that this House may have a chance  of\r\n\r\nconsidering matters of the most grievous importance to\r\n\r\nthe  future of Singapore. So it is, Sir, with  sadness\r\n\r\nand anxiety that I rise to move the motion standing in\r\n\r\nmy name on the Order Paper today,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection (4)\r\n\r\nof  section  4 of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1948  (No.  17  of 1948), as amended by the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948  (No.  39  of\r\n\r\n1948)   and   the  Emergency  Regulations  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1951  (No. 9 of 1951)  resolves  that  the\r\n\r\nEmergency (Amendment No. 2) Regulations, 1955, made on\r\n\r\nthe   13th   day  of  May,  1955,  and  published   as\r\n\r\nNotification  No. S 143 in the Gazette Supplement  No.\r\n\r\n38  of 13th May, 1955, as contained in Sessional Paper\r\n\r\nNo. S.L. 10 of 1955, shall continue in force until the\r\n\r\nexpiration or revocation of any Proclamation extending\r\n\r\nthe  period of the Proclamation of Emergency published\r\n\r\nas  Notification  No. S 219 in the Gazette  Supplement\r\n\r\nNo. 50 of 26th July, 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motion seeks the approval of this Assembly to\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Regulation restoring to the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police power to impose a curfew in such areas  and\r\n\r\nat such times as he thinks necessary. It is only three\r\n\r\nweeks,  Sir,  since that Regulation was revoked  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  we, on this side of the House, hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  situation  in  Singapore and the  development  of\r\n\r\nresponsible leadership was such that we could, without\r\n\r\nharm to the safety of Singapore, consider relaxing and\r\n\r\nrepealing the Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then we have had a night of terror in the\r\n\r\nstreets  of Singapore - a night of rioting and bloodshed\r\n\r\nand  killing by wild mobs - a night which demanded  that\r\n\r\nthe  power to impose an immediate curfew to clear  the\r\n\r\nstreets   should  be  restored.  The  Government   the\r\n\r\nfollowing  day by administrative order gave back  this\r\n\r\npower  to  the  Commissioner of Police, and  now  this\r\n\r\nmorning  we seek the full and wholehearted support  of\r\n\r\nthis  House in taking that additional emergency  power\r\n\r\nand  in  supporting us in every measure which  we  may\r\n\r\nhave to take in order to keep the peace in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the last few days have shown the horror\r\n\r\nand the hatred that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  created  by  irresponsible political  leaders\r\n\r\nworking  on  crowds  of  normally  decent  law-abiding\r\n\r\nworkers.  We have suffered disgrace to the  reputation\r\n\r\nof Singapore throughout the world, and particularly in\r\n\r\nthat  great  and friendly democracy which  has  always\r\n\r\nshown  its  full  sympathy to peoples  moving  towards\r\n\r\nindependence - one of whose citizens has  been  savagely\r\n\r\nbeaten to death by a mob of Singapore people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a ghastly setback to Singapore's claim to\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and maturity, to the  claim  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  and the  political  leaders  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are ready and capable of managing their  own\r\n\r\naffairs.  We  are  met together today  at  the  second\r\n\r\nsitting of this newly-elected Assembly that has had to\r\n\r\nbe  called  urgently to consider maintaining  law  and\r\n\r\norder in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of these terrible days have been fully\r\n\r\nreported  in the Press, though I am sorry to  have  to\r\n\r\nsay  that certain Chinese newspapers have still failed\r\n\r\nto  give  any support to the side of law and order.  I\r\n\r\nhope  and  I  appeal  to them to  see  their  duty  as\r\n\r\nresponsible citizens. I think, Sir, that hon.  Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House will wish me to give a  clear  and  an\r\n\r\naccurate  account  of the events  leading  up  to  the\r\n\r\ndisorders and of the terrible events on the  night  of\r\n\r\nThursday,  May  12.  I think, too,  Sir,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that such a statement should be accurate and\r\n\r\ncorrect  as to timings of the various events. I  have,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  had  prepared a  report  of  the  security\r\n\r\nsituation and how the trouble developed, and with your\r\n\r\nindulgence, Sir, and that of the House, I should  like\r\n\r\nto read that report to the House so that we may all be\r\n\r\nwell aware of the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mornings of the 25th and 26th April, 1955,\r\n\r\nstrikers  of the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus  Company  at\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road  attempted  to  stop  the  buses  from\r\n\r\nleaving  the Depot by sitting on the ground completely\r\n\r\nblocking the main gate with a human barrier with  arms\r\n\r\nand  legs  interlocked. The management of the  Company\r\n\r\nappealed to the Police to obtain their right  of  free\r\n\r\npassage in and out of the Depot. On both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   mornings,   the  arrival  of   strong   Police\r\n\r\nformations  persuaded the strikers to  give  up  their\r\n\r\nattempt to stop the buses, and no force was necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the 27th April, about 150 strikers\r\n\r\nagain formed their human barrier in front of the  main\r\n\r\ngate  and, despite exhortations to move by the Police,\r\n\r\nand despite repeated warnings that they were offending\r\n\r\nagainst  the law by physically preventing  freedom  of\r\n\r\nmovement  to  the  buses, they stubbornly  refused  to\r\n\r\nmove. The Police first attempted to move them by using\r\n\r\ndivisional  Police  to pull them  away.  The  strikers\r\n\r\nresisted strongly, and the Police efforts to move them\r\n\r\nin this manner proved unavailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squad of Police from the reserve unit, who are\r\n\r\nspecially trained in unarmed combat to deal with  this\r\n\r\ntype  of  incident, was then instructed  to  move  the\r\n\r\nstrikers  away from the gate. This they  succeeded  in\r\n\r\ndoing  quickly and efficiently without any undue force\r\n\r\nbeing  used,  and  the buses were  able  to  move  out\r\n\r\nunmolested.  Stones were thrown at the  Police  during\r\n\r\nthis operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the strikers who had been manhandled away\r\n\r\nfrom  the gate feigned injury, and two of them lay  on\r\n\r\nthe  ground  near the gate, being tended  by  friends,\r\n\r\ncomplaining   that  they  were  seriously   hurt.   An\r\n\r\nambulance   was  immediately  called,  whereupon   the\r\n\r\ninjured  men made themselves scarce and could  not  be\r\n\r\nfound when the ambulance arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the rest of the day there were large\r\n\r\ncongregations of strikers, sympathisers  and  students\r\n\r\noutside  the  Bus Company Depot; fiery  speeches  were\r\n\r\nmade  through loud-speakers inciting the  strikers  to\r\n\r\nfurther  opposition to the Police, and condemning  the\r\n\r\nso-called  Police brutality. The action taken  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice  was  grossly exaggerated by the agitators  and\r\n\r\ntheir  student  sympathisers.  Fifteen  strikers  were\r\n\r\nreported to have been brutally assaulted, whereas,  in\r\n\r\nfact, no single striker suffered anything more serious\r\n\r\nthan  superficial bruises, although  they  had  to  be\r\n\r\nforcibly   separated  from  each  other  and  resisted\r\n\r\nstubbornly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indignation meetings, supported by large groups\r\n\r\nof  students  and addressed continuously by  agitators\r\n\r\nthrough  loud-speakers, continued  for  several  days,\r\n\r\ndeliberately designed to whip up hatred and  hostility\r\n\r\ntowards  the Police Force as a whole. Throughout  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  growing tension, the Police did everything\r\n\r\nin their power to prevent any incident occurring which\r\n\r\nmight  provoke a clash, and thereby nullify the  great\r\n\r\nefforts  being  made  by the Chief  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Labour  to  reach  a  settlement   by\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  The  forces of evil, through  agitation,\r\n\r\nfalse allegations, intimidation, and deliberate rabble-rousing methods continued to fan the flames of  hatred\r\n\r\nagainst  the Police, who stood by with admirable  calm\r\n\r\nand suffered abuse and jeers from crowds of up to five\r\n\r\nand seven thousand workers, sympathisers and students,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly two weeks of constant efforts to obtain\r\n\r\na  settlement,  the negotiations broke down,  and  the\r\n\r\nPolice  were  ordered by the Government to  take  such\r\n\r\naction as was necessary to ensure the right of passage\r\n\r\nof buses which the Company was prepared to operate. On\r\n\r\nthe  morning  of Tuesday, 10th May, 1955 the  strikers\r\n\r\nagain  resorted to their manoeuvre of forming a  human\r\n\r\nbarrier in front the gate. The Commissioner of  Police\r\n\r\nhimself, accompanied by two Magistrates, exhausted all\r\n\r\nmeans  of  peacefully persuading  them  to  move.  The\r\n\r\nMagistrates  ordered the Police to  disperse  them  as\r\n\r\nthey  were an unlawful assembly within the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code. The Commissioner of Police dispersed\r\n\r\nthem  by  means of hoses from trailer pumps. The  buses\r\n\r\nwere  then  able to resume service to the public.  Ten\r\n\r\npersons   complained  of  injuries  in   this   Police\r\n\r\noperation,  and eight were carried into ambulances  on\r\n\r\nstretchers.  On arrival at the General Hospital  these\r\n\r\neight  stretcher  cases were treated,  and  it  is  of\r\n\r\ninterest  that the medical report received  two  hours\r\n\r\nlater  stated:  Except for one man who  was  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom   mild   concussion,  the  remainder  had   minor\r\n\r\nabrasions  or  contusions and  were  treated  as  out-patients. One had no apparent injuries whatsoever.  So\r\n\r\nmuch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  stretcher cases carried into ambulances  and\r\n\r\ntaken  to the General Hospital, alleged to be severely\r\n\r\ninjured  by  the  brutal  Police,  to  which  so  much\r\n\r\npublicity  was given by the extremists, and which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  used  as a weapon to fan further hatred  against\r\n\r\nthe Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 11th May, although the strikers got\r\n\r\ninto  position again to block the gate,  they  changed\r\n\r\ntheir minds when the Police arrived on the scene,  and\r\n\r\nthe buses were able to come out. A further twenty-four\r\n\r\nhours of more meetings outside the Depot, addressed by\r\n\r\nagitators   condemning  the  Police  and   threatening\r\n\r\nconcerted  action by all labour if the  Police  should\r\n\r\nagain interfere, succeeded in stiffening the morale of\r\n\r\nthe  strikers  who again attempted to stop  the  buses\r\n\r\ncoming out on the morning of Thursday, 12th May.  Once\r\n\r\nagain,  the  efforts  of senior  Police  officers  and\r\n\r\nMagistrates failed to persuade them to obey  the  law;\r\n\r\nonce  more  the Police were ordered by the Magistrates\r\n\r\nto  disperse them by force. They were again  dispersed\r\n\r\nwith  water,  but on this occasion the crowd  gathered\r\n\r\nround and bricks and stones were hurled at the Police.\r\n\r\nOne  officer  was  injured in  the  face,  and  others\r\n\r\nreceived minor injuries. The buses came out, but three\r\n\r\nof them were damaged by stones hurled by the crowd and\r\n\r\nhad  to  return. Throughout the morning of  the  12th,\r\n\r\nthere was widespread propaganda against the Police  by\r\n\r\nagitators addressing students and workers, and efforts\r\n\r\nwere made to call out other labour unions to strike in\r\n\r\nsympathy with the men of the Hock Lee Bus Company  who\r\n\r\nhad been so brutally treated by the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 1.45 p.m. a Hock Lee bus was attacked by a\r\n\r\ngang  of  hooligans,  and the Commissioner  of  Police\r\n\r\nimmediately ordered a full stand-by of all  Police  in\r\n\r\nthe  island,  as he rightly feared that this  incident\r\n\r\nmight  develop into general rioting. During  the  next\r\n\r\nthree  hours there were two further attacks  on  buses\r\n\r\nwhich  had  stones  thrown at them,  and  the  drivers\r\n\r\nsought  Police  protection. By 3  p.m. the  remaining\r\n\r\ndrivers  of  the buses were intimidated into  stopping\r\n\r\nthe service and large crowds of workers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstrikers  and students converged in growing  numbers\r\n\r\nin  the  area  in  which the Hock Lee Bus  Company  is\r\n\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3 o'clock it was clear to the Commissioner that\r\n\r\nvery  large numbers of workers and students were being\r\n\r\norganised throughout the island and were converging on\r\n\r\nthe  Alexandra  Road  area by  bus  and  by  lorry.  A\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   system  of  Police   road-blocks   was\r\n\r\nimmediately  established  throughout  Singapore,   and\r\n\r\nwherever  lorries  or buses were encountered  carrying\r\n\r\nstudents  or workers, they were stopped by the  Police\r\n\r\nand  ordered back. Some refused to obey, and  in  such\r\n\r\ncases  the  vehicles were immobilised  by  the  Police\r\n\r\nremoving the rotor-arms in the distributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile a tight Police cordon of road-blocks was\r\n\r\nthrown  round  the  danger  area  bounded  by  Gillman\r\n\r\nCircus,  Alexandra Circus, Tanglin Road  junction  of\r\n\r\nJervois  Road,  Delta Road junction of  Jervois  Road,\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley  Road, junction of  Kim  Seng  Road  and\r\n\r\nHavelock Road, right down to Outram Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These road-blocks were designed to make it virtually\r\n\r\nimpossible for any person to enter the danger area  by\r\n\r\nroad   without   being  stopped.  They  also   stopped\r\n\r\norganised  bodies of students and workers  in  lorries\r\n\r\nfrom swelling the hostile crowds, but there were large\r\n\r\nnumbers of students and others who infiltrated on foot\r\n\r\nthrough  the  surrounding open  country,  particularly\r\n\r\nafter  dark. From 5 o'clock onwards Radio  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nRediffusion, at the request of the Police, interrupted\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  give frequent warnings to  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  that the area described above was  dangerous\r\n\r\nand asking motorists and others to avoid entering it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police plan to protect life and property was to\r\n\r\nprevent  reinforcements from  arriving  to  swell  the\r\n\r\ncrowds,  by  these methods to cordon  the  area  where\r\n\r\ntrouble  was  likely to occur, to prevent  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  from  going  into  danger  unwittingly,   to\r\n\r\nmaintain a powerful Police guard round the main target\r\n\r\nof  the  rioters, which was the Hock Lee Bus Depot  in\r\n\r\nAlexandra Road, and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  mobile  Police squads within the danger  area  to\r\n\r\ndeal with individual attacks on property. At this time\r\n\r\nthe  General  Officer Commanding was  alerted  to  put\r\n\r\ntroops  in readiness to come to the aid of the  Police\r\n\r\nif required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. there were incidents of\r\n\r\nstones  and bottles being thrown at Police on duty  in\r\n\r\nthe  danger area; and on three occasions hostile  mobs\r\n\r\nof  up  to  1,000  people attacking  the  Police  were\r\n\r\ndispersed  by tear smoke. Some arrests were made,  but\r\n\r\nas  was expected, it was not until after dark that the\r\n\r\nmobs  made determined efforts to attack Police  posts,\r\n\r\nroad-blocks,  individual policemen  and  Radio  Patrol\r\n\r\ncars.  By  this time the Police had completely  sealed\r\n\r\noff  the  area by road-blocks, had stopped lorry-loads\r\n\r\nof  students  and  workers from reinforcing,  and  had\r\n\r\nstrong  guards  in  the Bus Depot  and  mobile  Police\r\n\r\nreserves within the danger area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police were hampered by the darkness and the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  terrain from effecting  arrests,  and\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  night  up to  3  a.m. on  the  13th,\r\n\r\nrepeated  hit-and-run  attacks were  made  on  Police,\r\n\r\nwhile  the liberal use of tear smoke by mobile  Police\r\n\r\npatrols succeeded in keeping the mobs on the move  and\r\n\r\nprevented  them  from concentrating in  any  organised\r\n\r\nattempt  to overwhelm the Police by weight of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe   greatest  restraint  was  shown  by  all  Police\r\n\r\npersonnel on duty, including the Volunteer Police  who\r\n\r\nworked  side  by side with the regulars  in  a  manner\r\n\r\nwhich  deserved the highest praise and thanks  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Throughout  this night of confused  fighting,\r\n\r\nhit-and-run  attacks on the Police, attacks  on  road-blocks, setting up of street barricades by the mobs to\r\n\r\nprevent  Police mobility, there was only one  occasion\r\n\r\non  which  a  Police  officer was forced  to  use  his\r\n\r\nrevolver,  and  on one occasion the commander  of  the\r\n\r\nreserve unit troop fired a round of buckshot. The case\r\n\r\nof  the  Police officer who used his revolver to  save\r\n\r\nhis   life   is  typical  of  the  high   morale   and\r\n\r\ndetermination  of every man not to cause  more  damage\r\n\r\nthan  was  absolutely necessary. About  10.35  p.m. a\r\n\r\nPolice  Radio Patrol car \"Peter One-One\" was  cornered\r\n\r\nin Prince Philip Avenue by a large mob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarrying  poles  and  sticks and  hurling  stones  and\r\n\r\nbottles. \"Peter One-One\" with Police Lieutenant Harris\r\n\r\nand  three  constables, one of whom was  a  volunteer,\r\n\r\nradioed  to Control for urgent assistance. The nearest\r\n\r\nunengaged  troop  of the reserve unit was  immediately\r\n\r\nwarned to race to the help of \"Peter One-One\". It  was\r\n\r\nhindered  by  large  bricks and rocks  strewn  on  the\r\n\r\nroadway to prevent its progress. Meanwhile \"Peter One-\r\n\r\nOne\"  was systematically being smashed up and the mobs\r\n\r\nwere  advancing closer and closer on Police Lieutenant\r\n\r\nHarris  and  his  three men who were reporting  calmly\r\n\r\nback  to Control that their Radio car was smashed  up,\r\n\r\nthat they were about to be overrun, that they had used\r\n\r\nup  all their tear smoke and as they put it to Control\r\n\r\nover  the  air,  \"It  looks as if  we  have  had  it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the reserve unit was forcing its way through\r\n\r\nto  their rescue. The last message received from Radio\r\n\r\ncar  \"Peter One-One\" was \"They are on us. I fired four\r\n\r\nshots  from my revolver, but not at the mob.\" At  that\r\n\r\nmoment the reserve unit arrived at the scene, the  mob\r\n\r\nscattered and disappeared in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 3 o'clock on the morning of the 13th May the\r\n\r\nrioting died down and the mobs had dispersed, although\r\n\r\nlarge numbers were still lurking in groups of ten  and\r\n\r\ntwenty in the darkness of the surrounding grounds  and\r\n\r\nbuildings,  throwing stones and bricks at  the  Police\r\n\r\nclearing  the  roads of obstruction  and  towing  away\r\n\r\ndamaged vehicles. By 6 o'clock in the morning  it  was\r\n\r\nfound that in addition to the numerous Police officers\r\n\r\nwho  had suffered minor injuries from bottles,  sticks\r\n\r\nand  stones,  and  who refused to go to  hospital  for\r\n\r\ntreatment, the casualty list included:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One policeman killed; one so seriously injured that\r\n\r\nhe  has  since  died  in hospital;  ten  other  Police\r\n\r\nofficers  injured  of  whom  two  are  still  on   the\r\n\r\ndangerously  ill  list; and from the Police  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  the  most  tragic death  of  all,  an  innocent\r\n\r\ncivilian killed in the riots who was Mr Gene  Symonds\r\n\r\nof  the  United Press. The cause of his death will  be\r\n\r\nthe  subject of a Coroner's inquest, but it  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear that he was killed by the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evening the only revolver\r\n\r\nshots  fired  so  far known by the Police  were  those\r\n\r\nfired by Police Lieutenant Harris, but the body  of  a\r\n\r\nyoung  Chinese was brought to the General Hospital  at 1.10  a.m. with a gunshot wound in the region  of  his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Teo, a Volunteer Special Constable in uniform,\r\n\r\nwas  set upon by a mob at 8.50 p.m. on the 12th  while\r\n\r\ndriving  along Alexandra Road. He was beaten to  death\r\n\r\nby  the  mob  and  the car overturned and  burnt.  His\r\n\r\ncompanion, Volunteer Sergeant Kenneth Koh, was rescued\r\n\r\nby  the arrival of the reserve unit and suffered  head\r\n\r\ninjuries only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Inspector Teoh and three Detective Police\r\n\r\nofficers were set upon at the same time and place, and\r\n\r\nthe  car  in which they were travelling was overturned\r\n\r\nand  burnt.  Detective  Corporal  Yuen  was  so  badly\r\n\r\ninjured  and  burnt  that he has  since  died  of  his\r\n\r\ninjuries.  The arrival of the reserve unit  saved  the\r\n\r\nothers.  All  were  armed but they  did  not  fire.  A\r\n\r\nbystander  picked  up  the  revolver  of  the  wounded\r\n\r\nDetective  Corporal while the mob was being dispersed,\r\n\r\nand  shortly afterwards handed it in to Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nPolice Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Corporal Ho on a motorcycle was intercepted\r\n\r\nby a mob at 9.20 p.m. in Leng Kee Road just behind the\r\n\r\nThye Hone Factory and was beaten up by the crowd.  His\r\n\r\nrevolver  was stolen and he was left unconscious.  The\r\n\r\nreserve unit dispersed the mob and picked him  up.  He\r\n\r\ndid not fire his revolver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteer Police Lance-Corporal Simon was on duty at\r\n\r\nPolice  road-blocks at Pulau Saigon at 9.45 p.m. with\r\n\r\nfour  other Volunteer policemen and two regulars. They\r\n\r\nwere  attacked and overrun by a screaming mob of  over\r\n\r\n200. They did not open fire. Lance-Corporal Simon  was\r\n\r\nleft  unconscious with multiple head  injuries  and  a\r\n\r\ndislocated shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Chinese who was shot was aged 16, a student\r\n\r\nliving at 799-D Havelock Road. When he was brought to\r\n\r\nhospital  at  1.10  a.m. on the  13th  he  was  dead,\r\n\r\nsuffering from a gunshot wound\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was alleged to have been fired between 9.30  and 10.30   p.m.   The  young  Chinese  was   not   killed\r\n\r\ninstantaneously but was carried around the  town  from\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road, and possibly as far as  Middle  Road,\r\n\r\nbefore being sent to hospital hours later when he  was\r\n\r\ndead. The bullet had pierced the lung, and it is quite\r\n\r\npossible  his life might have been saved if  his  body\r\n\r\nhad not been used for propaganda purposes for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the shot which wounded this young\r\n\r\nChinese  was  one  of the four shots fired  by  Police\r\n\r\nLieutenant Harris at 10.35 p.m. above the heads of the\r\n\r\nmob  which  attacked him, but this has  not  yet  been\r\n\r\nestablished.  In  addition to the 16  Police  officers\r\n\r\nkilled  or  injured, there were two cases of civilians\r\n\r\nbeing  injured.  In  one case  a  European  lady  and\r\n\r\ngentleman driving a car down Henderson Road  at  about 12.15 a.m. were set on by a mob of twenty Chinese,  armed with sticks, stones and bottles. They managed  to\r\n\r\nrun  into a nearby flat where they were harboured  and\r\n\r\nlater  sent to hospital. The lady was unhurt  but  the\r\n\r\ngentleman   was  slightly  injured.  The  other   case\r\n\r\nconcerned two Chinese who received pellet wounds  from\r\n\r\nthe  reserve  unit  shotgun loaded with  the  smallest\r\n\r\ngauge of buckshot. Both were treated as out-patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except, therefore, for the death of Mr Symonds and\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  student, the injuries  caused  to  other\r\n\r\ncivilians were slight both in numbers and severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, May 13, was quieter. There were large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  strikers moving about in the city,  their\r\n\r\nnumbers  greatly swollen by an almost complete  strike\r\n\r\nof  bus  workers throughout the island.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nminor  incident  in Penang Road; but,  throughout  the\r\n\r\nday,  there  was  less  organised  violence.  It   is,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  significant that on that day, Friday,  there\r\n\r\nwere  no organised parties of Chinese students in  the\r\n\r\ntown.  Individual Police were subjected to booing  and\r\n\r\nstoning, and there were bands of young hooligans going\r\n\r\nround  the town throwing stones and slashing  motorcar\r\n\r\ntyres.  In the evening two cars belonging to Europeans\r\n\r\nup toward Changi were set on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Saturday, was again a day of tension\r\n\r\nand  uncertainty. There was a clear possibility  of  a\r\n\r\ndangerous demonstration over the funeral of the  young\r\n\r\nChinese student, but thanks to tactful handling,  this\r\n\r\npassed  off  without incident. That evening,  as  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  know,  my  hon.  Friend  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  getting a settlement of  the  Hock  Lee\r\n\r\nstrike, and yesterday there was a marked lessening  of\r\n\r\ntension,  and transport returned to work. We  are  now\r\n\r\nleft,  I think, with only a comparatively small number\r\n\r\nof genuine industrial disputes. The tension has eased,\r\n\r\nbut  I  want  all  Members of this  House  to  realise\r\n\r\nclearly and to face the hard fact that we still have a\r\n\r\npotentially dangerous situation which at any time  may\r\n\r\nrequire  the firmest possible measures to support  law\r\n\r\nand order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all Members of this House will wish me to\r\n\r\nexpress  our  deep  regret that men should  have  been\r\n\r\nkilled by a Singapore mob, and to express our full and\r\n\r\nsincere sympathy with the families of those killed, in\r\n\r\ntheir  tragic loss. In particular, we grieve  for  the\r\n\r\nloss  of  those two Police officers and the journalist\r\n\r\nwho  were killed doing no more than their duty. I hope\r\n\r\nthat  others who were injured may have a speedy return\r\n\r\nto full strength and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want also to pay tribute to the courage and\r\n\r\ndiscipline and training of our Police Force. Not  once\r\n\r\nduring  that  long  night  of hysterical  burning  and\r\n\r\nkilling  did their courage or their discipline falter.\r\n\r\nAll the men were armed but you have heard that on only\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions did they fire; and you have  heard  the\r\n\r\nprice   they  paid  for  that  discipline   and   that\r\n\r\nrestraint.  Two  men killed; others  still  critically\r\n\r\nill,  and  many more injured. These are the men,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwho saved Singapore from the devil on the night of May\r\n\r\n12.  It  was  they  who restored order  without  doing\r\n\r\ndamage -  with  only one death not known to  have  been\r\n\r\ncaused by the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, May 12, is a black day in Singapore's\r\n\r\nhistory, but it has, in some measure, been relieved by\r\n\r\nthe behaviour, the gallantry and the competence of our\r\n\r\nPolice Force of whom every one of us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  proud and to whom everyone of us  owes  an\r\n\r\nimmeasurable debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded, Sir, of words of comfort spoken last\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon at the funeral of Volunteer Special\r\n\r\nConstable Andrew Teo. The words were spoken  by  Canon\r\n\r\nAdams,  the Headmaster of his old school. Canon  Adams\r\n\r\ntold us so wisely that afternoon that we should temper\r\n\r\nour  grief  at a young life cruelly cut off by  giving\r\n\r\nthanks  to  God,  giving thanks to God that  Singapore\r\n\r\nproduced  young men like Andrew Teo, and I do suggest,\r\n\r\nSir, that we should all take hope and courage from the\r\n\r\nfact  that, thank God, there are hundreds of men  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  women  in Singapore like Andrew  Teo - men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who do not seek wealth, who do not seek  power,\r\n\r\nwho  do not seek fame - they only seek to serve,  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  duty  to  their  fellow-citizens,  to  help  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  all  that is honourable and  decent  in  our\r\n\r\nlives.  Thank  God we can find them. We find  them  as\r\n\r\nyoungsters in the Boy Scouts and the Boys Brigade.  We\r\n\r\nfind  them when they grow up in the Singapore Military\r\n\r\nForces,  in the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve,\r\n\r\nin  the  Malayan  Auxiliary Air  Force;  and  we  find\r\n\r\nthem - thank  God - in  our  Police  Force.  It  is  these\r\n\r\nmen - regulars and volunteers - in our Police Force who do\r\n\r\ntheir  duty under training and discipline even  if  it\r\n\r\nmeans giving their lives for us. It is to them that we\r\n\r\nowe an immeasurable debt of gratitude. Yet it is these\r\n\r\nmen  who are still today being lyingly slandered;  who\r\n\r\nare  being maliciously attacked; who are being  stoned\r\n\r\nin  the streets; who are being booed at and jeered  at\r\n\r\nby misguided students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the main features of this grim story? First\r\n\r\nof  all,  on  the Government side, we have been  faced\r\n\r\nwith  many  strikes - not all of them unreasonable,  but\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  timed and fomented by  irresponsible\r\n\r\nleaders  in order that those leaders could demonstrate\r\n\r\ntheir   power   and  could  challenge   the   lawfully\r\n\r\nconstituted Government. I do not intend, Sir, to dwell\r\n\r\non  the  issues involved in these industrial  disputes\r\n\r\nexcept  to  say that, given responsible leadership,  I\r\n\r\nknow of no reason why those disputes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  settled  fairly  and  justly  without\r\n\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. Friend the Minister for Labour has worked\r\n\r\nuntiringly  every day and a good part of  every  night\r\n\r\nsince  this  House  last  met,  using  his  skill  and\r\n\r\nexperience  in  industrial  matters  and   his   known\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  the  cause of  unions  and  workers  in\r\n\r\nattempts   to  promote  negotiations  and   to   reach\r\n\r\nsettlements.  He  has  been constantly  frustrated  by\r\n\r\nindividuals who clearly do not want grievances  to  be\r\n\r\nremoved, but are out to maintain unrest and are out to\r\n\r\nexploit  the genuine grievances of decent workers  for\r\n\r\ntheir own evil ends. We have used, Sir, every possible\r\n\r\nendeavour to secure settlement through peaceful means.\r\n\r\nAs  soon as the gravity of the Hock Lee dispute became\r\n\r\nevident,  my  hon.  Friend appointed  a  Committee  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  to  search  out the facts  and  find  a  just\r\n\r\nsolution,   but  these  attempts  have   always   been\r\n\r\nthwarted.  It  was our object and hope that  we  could\r\n\r\nprove  to the workers that genuine grievances  can  be\r\n\r\nsettled   in   the  proper  way  by  negotiation   and\r\n\r\narbitration  and  with  the  full  assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour. We wanted to  win  these  decent\r\n\r\nworkers  from those who were urging them into  general\r\n\r\nstrikes and violence and who were out to exploit  them\r\n\r\nin  ways which could do nothing but harm both  to  the\r\n\r\nunions  and to the workers. The Police, while carrying\r\n\r\nout their essential task of maintaining law and order,\r\n\r\ndid  their  utmost  to  avoid  any  serious  clash  or\r\n\r\nphysical violence which would inflame tempers and  add\r\n\r\ndangers  to the situation, and how magnificently  they\r\n\r\ncarried  out their task - despite incessant provocation,\r\n\r\ndespite jeering and stone throwing, despite the  abuse\r\n\r\nof  schoolgirls, and despite the grim perils of  being\r\n\r\noverrun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the other side? On the other side, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmaintain  there  was  a deliberate  and  a  successful\r\n\r\nattempt   to   prevent  settlements  and  to   provoke\r\n\r\ndisorder. There has been a vicious campaign of calumny\r\n\r\nand   hatred  against  the  Police.  There  have  been\r\n\r\nrepeated attempts to incite a clash against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their lust for their own power the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  and  their  covert  Communist  supporters   and\r\n\r\nbackseat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers  wanted violence and bloodshed and  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b>Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W.

He has  deplored  violence\r\n\r\nafter  hell was let loose and men were killed.  I  ask\r\n\r\nhim:  What  did  he do to prevent violence  before  it\r\n\r\nhappened? What did he think was likely to happen when,\r\n\r\nat  a  May Day rally organised by his Party under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of the hon. Member who sits  behind  him\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong), Mr Fong Swee  Suan  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bus Workers' Union, after speaking  of  the\r\n\r\nbrutal  force  of the Police against  the  workers  on\r\n\r\nApril 27 - we heard the force used - went on to say,  \"All\r\n\r\nworkers must unite and should not hesitate to organise\r\n\r\nthemselves into trade unions to struggle for their own\r\n\r\nwelfare.

What,  I  ask\r\n\r\nhim,  did  he  do on May 11 and May 12 to stop  decent\r\n\r\nworkers  being turned into murderous rioters?  Did  he\r\n\r\nmake  any attempt to stop the extremists in his  Party\r\n\r\nstaging this night of horror? Is his conscience clear?\r\n\r\nOr  did he lose control to the Member for Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nwho sits behind him and drives the Party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, too, that the Member for Bukit Timah will\r\n\r\ndeclare his position openly before this House and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.  He has great  power  over  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Factory  and Shop Workers'  Union.  He  has\r\n\r\ngreat power over the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. Did\r\n\r\nhe or did he not deliberately organise as many strikes\r\n\r\nas  he  could during the last few days? Is his concept\r\n\r\nof  democracy - government by  general  strike  and  mob\r\n\r\nviolence - or  does  he stand for peaceful  and  orderly\r\n\r\ndemocracy?  I  ask him to declare his stand  in  these\r\n\r\nfateful days for the future of Singapore. Is he for or\r\n\r\nagainst Communism? Is he for or against violence?  And\r\n\r\nif he is against violence - and I hope he is - what did he\r\n\r\ndo to stop those whom he controls from rioting? Did he\r\n\r\ngo down to Alexandra Road on May 12 and stop this hell\r\n\r\nfrom  breaking loose? He must have known that violence\r\n\r\nwas  building up. Did he try to stop it? If  not,  why\r\n\r\nnot? As I have said, the Member for Bukit Timah is the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the Singapore Factory and Shop  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion. I ask him whether, in his capacity as Secretary\r\n\r\nof  that  Union,  he  approved?  Did  he  approve  the\r\n\r\npublication in a manifesto of that Union on 1st May of\r\n\r\nthe  following verse? I read a translation,  which  of\r\n\r\ncourse  may not be fully accurate. I give it for  what\r\n\r\nit  is  worth,  and if any Member wishes  to  see  the\r\n\r\noriginal, he can do so.

Has he\r\n\r\nor has he not deliberately aroused the workers against\r\n\r\nthe   Police   by  accusing  them  of  brutality   and\r\n\r\noppression?

This is an organised attempt to undermine  the\r\n\r\nability   of  the  Police  Force  to  keep  peace   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. And it is still going on.

They have also been  visiting  other\r\n\r\nstrikers.  They  arrived  in lorries,  regimented  and\r\n\r\norganised.  They  have given large sums  of  money  to\r\n\r\nworkers.  They have made speeches. They  have  danced,\r\n\r\nand  they  have sung inflammatory songs. And this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  happening  day  after  day.

They have been round - strikers and\r\n\r\nother  crowds - demonstrating and inciting and  singing\r\n\r\nCommunist songs. I give you the words of some of their\r\n\r\nsongs.

They were stopped by  the\r\n\r\nPolice,  but,  nevertheless, one  lorry  attempted  to\r\n\r\ndrive  through  the  Police round the  block.  It  was\r\n\r\nstopped  and  the students were taken off  the  lorry;\r\n\r\nbut, of course, we could not stop them flooding across\r\n\r\nthe  fields through the houses to join in the dispute,\r\n\r\nand  it  was at that time that hell began  to  be  let\r\n\r\nloose down there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I say, Sir, the students of these Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  who  have  done  much  to  cause  hatred  and\r\n\r\nbloodshed  in Singapore. Neither the school principals\r\n\r\nnor the school committees have done anything to put  a\r\n\r\nstop to this subversion of the youth of Singapore. The\r\n\r\nprincipals are frightened. They are frightened that if\r\n\r\nthey  thwart the Malayan Communist Party they will  be\r\n\r\nassassinated. And until the Police took the heart  out\r\n\r\nof the Communist killer gangs, they had good reason to\r\n\r\nbe  frightened.  That is Singapore.  That  is  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools. The management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommittees refuse to take a strong line. They seem  to\r\n\r\nbe, if anything, frightened of the students, and their\r\n\r\none   endeavour  is  to  hand  the  problem   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  situation in  these  Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschools  is  the  most  serious  problem  that   faces\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Youth in those schools is being  corrupted\r\n\r\nand  perverted,  through the skilful  use  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nnationalism  and  propaganda, into a dangerous  weapon\r\n\r\nfor the Malayan Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government has been tolerant and\r\n\r\nsympathetic  towards Chinese students. We  offered  to\r\n\r\nregister  their Middle School Union if they, on  their\r\n\r\nside, would undertake to keep clear of politics.  This\r\n\r\noffer was rejected with insolence. We did not - perhaps\r\n\r\nwrongly - prevent  Chinese  students  moving  about   in\r\n\r\nlorries to public meetings and demonstrations  and  to\r\n\r\nstrikes.  This freedom had been abused until  we  were\r\n\r\nfaced  with large numbers of Chinese students inciting\r\n\r\nviolence and themselves mixed up in rioting. Our duty,\r\n\r\nSir, is clear. If no one else will stop these boys and\r\n\r\ngirls from being worked up, intimidated and regimented\r\n\r\nat  their  schools  by a fanatical  few,  loaded  into\r\n\r\nlorries,  taken  down to industrial disputes,  pitched\r\n\r\ninto the middle of riots where men are being killed - if\r\n\r\nno  one else will stop them, then the Government must.\r\n\r\nWe  have a paramount duty to the parents of these boys\r\n\r\nand  girls  to protect their children from corruption,\r\n\r\nfrom   injury,  and  possibly  from  death.  We  have,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  as the House knows, had the  Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool  and  the Chung Cheng School closed down  until\r\n\r\nfurther  notice. I am glad to say this of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh  School, that this order was obeyed in an orderly\r\n\r\nfashion.  At  the Chung Cheng High  School,  on  the\r\n\r\nfirst  morning, several hundred students were in  open\r\n\r\nrevolt  against  the  school authorities  closing  the\r\n\r\nschool. Drastic measures must be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attribute the rioting on Thursday night to\r\n\r\nirresponsible   political  leaders  and   to   Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents. It was they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  had  deliberately provoked widespread  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  and, by a vicious emotional campaign,  aroused\r\n\r\nthe workers against the Police. Thus they succeeded in\r\n\r\ncreating  an  acute  state  of  emergency - a  state  of\r\n\r\nemergency  that was contained and ended  only  by  the\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and the steadiness of the Police.  It  was\r\n\r\nthey  who  paid  the price for saving  Singapore  from\r\n\r\ndisaster. No doubt the enemies of the Government - both\r\n\r\nopen and secret - are well content. What could be better\r\n\r\ncalculated  to  prevent this Government,  this  newly-elected   Government,  carrying   out   its   election\r\n\r\nprogramme - its  programme  for  social   and   economic\r\n\r\nprogress  in  Singapore -  and thus  consolidating  its\r\n\r\nsupport  from the people? There are those who  do  not\r\n\r\nwant this Government to succeed. They want it to fail.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to  create  chaos in  Singapore,  so  that\r\n\r\nCommunism  may spring out of the ruins and establish  its\r\n\r\nruthless  dictatorship. So they  have  exploited  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   inflaming  them  against  the  Police   and\r\n\r\ninciting  them  to violence. That is not  the  way  to\r\n\r\nbetter  things,  to better working  conditions,  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher  share in the country's wealth for the workers,\r\n\r\nbetter   housing   and  health   and   schooling,   to\r\n\r\nresponsible self-government and independence. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  way to chaos and ruin and Communism. I only  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  awful events of these last  few  days  have\r\n\r\nopened the eyes of the workers of Singapore that these\r\n\r\nleaders  of the extreme Left are leading them  not  to\r\n\r\nbetter things, but to disaster and Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House, Sir, believe that our\r\n\r\nways are true ways, but we cannot go along it if there\r\n\r\nis  no  peace in the land, if Singapore is kept  in  a\r\n\r\nstate  of continued emergency. We hope that this House\r\n\r\nwill  unanimously  support us in our determination  to\r\n\r\nstop  violence  and disorder, and will  give  us  such\r\n\r\nemergency powers as are or may be needed to keep peace\r\n\r\nand  order -  for keep the peace we must and  will.  If\r\n\r\nstern  measures have to be taken, they will be  taken;\r\n\r\nand those who persist in inciting peaceful citizens to\r\n\r\nbecome murderous rioters will be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving this motion, I ask all Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  to declare themselves wholeheartedly behind  us\r\n\r\nin  our  task  to  proving that  democracy  and  self-government can work in Singapore.

Unfortunately,  I  feel\r\n\r\nbound to say that the Government, in its short term of\r\n\r\noffice,  took  too long to rise above  the  level  of\r\n\r\nparty rivalry, and we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been watching with growing concern the  struggle\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Labour  Front - the ruling  Party - and  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party for the control of trade  unions\r\n\r\nfor  political ends, failing dismally to  see  what  a\r\n\r\ndangerous  game  they  were playing.  The  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty   members  of  this  House  will,  nevertheless,\r\n\r\nsupport   the  Government's  determination  today   to\r\n\r\nmaintain law and order, provided that they turn  their\r\n\r\nfaces away from thoughts of political advantage to the\r\n\r\nhard  and  not  necessarily  unrewarding  business  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Let us remind ourselves  that  the  wound\r\n\r\nwhich  has eaten deeply into the vitals of this island\r\n\r\nis stemmed and not healed, and unless it is cauterized\r\n\r\nfirmly and effectively, it will fester and poison  the\r\n\r\nwhole  body politic. The worst of a serious crisis  is\r\n\r\nover, we hope, but the causes of that crisis have  yet\r\n\r\nto  be removed, lest we drift into another, and proper\r\n\r\nremedies can only be applied when the causes have been\r\n\r\nthoroughly diagnosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking into some of these causes, I hope I may\r\n\r\nhave  your  permission, Sir, to look just a short  way\r\n\r\nback into past history, because while we know only too\r\n\r\nwell  where the true enemy lies, the Government cannot\r\n\r\nbe exonerated from all blame for these tragic events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front threw itself into the recent\r\n\r\nelection  campaign  with  an Opposition  mentality,  a\r\n\r\nplatform  which in some respects, to say the least  of\r\n\r\nit,  was  disingenuous, and an orgy of hatred  of  the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party, which was labelled as the  opponent\r\n\r\nof     Labour's     twin    bogeys - colonialism     and\r\n\r\ncapitalism - conveniently overlooking the fact that  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party had done more than any other  Party\r\n\r\nto   send  colonialism  on  its  way  out,  and   that\r\n\r\ncapitalism is to be found in Soviet Russia as much  as\r\n\r\nin  the  United  States or Britain.  However,  by  the\r\n\r\nstrange process of democratic arithmetic that afflicts\r\n\r\nelections  when there are a number of parties  in  the\r\n\r\nfield, 42,000 votes out of 150,000 put into power  the\r\n\r\nvery  Party which had conditioned itself to  years  of\r\n\r\nhappy    irresponsibility   in    opposition.    Their\r\n\r\nextravagance  of outlook, pardonable  in  an  election\r\n\r\ncampaign,  has  taken  longer to  wear  off  than  the\r\n\r\ncountry can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafford,  and the rhetoric in which the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nindulged at the first sitting of this Assembly must, I\r\n\r\nfear, be regarded as, to some extent, responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  disasters of last week.

Was  there  need  for  such\r\n\r\nverbal  dramatics, when even at that moment the drama,\r\n\r\nthe  tragic  stark  drama, was being  enacted  of  the\r\n\r\n\"cruel,  uninhibited\" battering to  death  of  men  in\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road?  And  surely  by  thundering  against\r\n\r\nColonialism, which is so far on its way to  extinction\r\n\r\nthat  even the Bandoeng conference could not  take  it\r\n\r\nseriously, and by inveighing against the wickedness of\r\n\r\nCapitalism, these two \"Isms\", dressed up by the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  in  the  guise  of virulent and  uncontrollable\r\n\r\nmonsters,  the  livelihood of  the  masses  which  you\r\n\r\ndesire  to protect was at once endangered.

Our interpretation of  events\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, this - that Government was too  obsessed\r\n\r\nwith  the  need to honour impossible election  pledges\r\n\r\nand, alas, too blind to what the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nreally  stood  for to take serious enough  account  of\r\n\r\nwhat happened as early as the 25th April.  I refer to\r\n\r\nthe  appearance of those misguided singing and dancing\r\n\r\nChinese  middle school students as strike sympathisers\r\n\r\nfor  the first time on an organised basis, which  from\r\n\r\nthat  moment  made it impossible for  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  free  will  in  deciding  their   own\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warnings were not heeded, and the growing\r\n\r\nchallenge of the next two and a half weeks against law\r\n\r\nand  order was not taken up strongly enough  to  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  disasters of last Thursday, as they  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of force is an action which all of us would\r\n\r\nponder  deeply  before adopting, but the  worst  thing\r\n\r\nstill  was to show weakness in the face of a  ruthless\r\n\r\nenemy  whose \"pattern of action followed the Communist\r\n\r\ntechnique\" - to use the Chief Minister's own words.  But\r\n\r\nthe  truth of the matter is that the Government failed\r\n\r\nto  act responsibly at the first signs of trouble when\r\n\r\nthat  very \"pattern of action\" began to unfold itself.\r\n\r\nThey  wanted,  if  possible,  to  avoid  the  risk  of\r\n\r\nunpopularity which taking stern action always  brings,\r\n\r\nhoping  that,  by  waiting, the  dispute  would  solve\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet \"the forces of chaos\" which the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nonly  announced  for the first time on Thursday  night\r\n\r\nwere  there plain for all to see - well over a fortnight\r\n\r\nago. And in our view it was Government's plain duty at\r\n\r\nthat  early  stage  to have made a  clear  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  the  innocent  and the  guilty;  between  the\r\n\r\nordinary  and  legitimate striker and  the  subversive\r\n\r\nagent  and  agitator; between the boy  and  girl  with\r\n\r\ntheir  books  and  the  bands of  regimented  student-\r\n\r\nprovocateurs.  They  failed to  act  on  these  lines;\r\n\r\nhesitant  to submerge party interests in the  national\r\n\r\ninterests;  still  vying for votes among  the  workers\r\n\r\nwith  the People's Action Party, and taking the chance\r\n\r\nthat  the  affair would blow over and that they  could\r\n\r\nclaim a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvictory  in  which both the innocent  and  the  guilty\r\n\r\nwould then be found on their side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what happened? The sinister forces of evil were\r\n\r\nfortified by the realisation that the Government would\r\n\r\nbend over backwards rather than take a firm line.  The\r\n\r\ngangsters,  the hooligans moved in behind  the  strike\r\n\r\nagitators; and the Chinese students danced and chanted\r\n\r\nwith increasing defiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So matters moved to the inevitable climax, and the\r\n\r\nbloody  blows  began to fall, with the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nstill  trying  to  cloak their hideousness  behind  an\r\n\r\nannouncement  about  Professor  Arthur  Lewis  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the three Chinese schools which are now\r\n\r\nclosed, so that innocent children must be deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir   education   along  with  the   guilty,   whose\r\n\r\nactivities demonstrate that they are not fit to be  in\r\n\r\nthese  schools?  Two  weeks  ago,  in  our  view,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had the chance to separate the sheep  from\r\n\r\nthe  goats; those who stayed in schools from those who\r\n\r\nwent off in their lorries in clearly defined groups to\r\n\r\nmingle with the strikers. But no action was taken.  If\r\n\r\nthis  student insubordination had been tackled at  the\r\n\r\nright time, the schools might well be open today,  and\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding children would be carrying on  with  their\r\n\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the innocent students, like the innocent\r\n\r\nstrikers, had to suffer with the guilty, because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would not do the right thing at  the  right\r\n\r\ntime,  and  because previously they  had  in  indecent\r\n\r\nhaste begun to tear down the barriers put up long  ago\r\n\r\nagainst  the forces of chaos, by revoking a number  of\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this part of the House recognise the need, the\r\n\r\nimperative   need,   for  the  reimposition   of   the\r\n\r\nRegulation  which is before us today. We  welcome  the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of the Government that they are  resolved\r\n\r\nto  govern henceforth with the utmost firmness; and in\r\n\r\nview  of  what  has  been said this  morning,  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests, we will side with  them  in  this\r\n\r\ntime  of  crisis to strengthen and support  them  with\r\n\r\nequal resolution.

I take it that no one in the Progressive Party\r\n\r\nhad  the courage to say the things that the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin (Mr John Ede)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  4,000  expatriate votes had the courage  to  say\r\n\r\nthis  morning. But I would like today to  meet,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  Parliamentary levity, the full charge  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  levied  against the People's Action  Party.  The\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary would wish to put the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  and its leaders on trial on the floor  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We  stand accused because he has recited  this\r\n\r\nnarrative,  and  in  this narrative  no  one  but  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party comes out as the devil  of  the\r\n\r\npiece.  Let me tell him that we have not come here  as\r\n\r\nprisoners  to  be  accused, or as prisoners  who  must\r\n\r\ndischarge the burden of their guilt. We have come here\r\n\r\nas  representatives of the people, and we shall  speak\r\n\r\nas  such. The Chief Secretary has said that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar should declare what he stands  for,\r\n\r\napart from clever sophistry. I think, Sir, I have been\r\n\r\naccused  of  many things in my life, but not  even  my\r\n\r\nworst  enemy  has ever accused me of being  afraid  to\r\n\r\nspeak  my mind. What I say now is on my behalf and  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  People's Action Party.  The  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  cannot be responsible for every  single\r\n\r\nmember of the Party, but let me say here and now  what\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party stands for.  If  what  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary  said was true, then  he  would  have\r\n\r\nfound   the  People's  Action  Party  completely   and\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly with him. We have said  time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain   that   we  stand  for  a  free,   independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  non-Communist  Malaya,  and  I   say   it\r\n\r\ntoday - now.  The Chief Secretary wants to know  what  I\r\n\r\nwould  say,  without  quibble,  about  Communism   and\r\n\r\ncolonialism. But it is not sophistry, Sir; it  is  an\r\n\r\nhonesty which transcends temporary expediency  when  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  will  not  fight  Communism  to  support\r\n\r\ncolonialism. Not all the riots will make me do it. But\r\n\r\nI  say  here and now that if I had the choice  between\r\n\r\ndemocracy - an    independent,    democratic    Malaya - a\r\n\r\nCommunist  Malaya, and a colonial Malaya,  I  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  choosing  and  in  fighting   for   an\r\n\r\nindependent, democratic Malaya. There is no  sophistry\r\n\r\nin that choice.

We  will  not  fight the  Communists  or  other\r\n\r\nFascists  to  preserve the colonial  system.  Let  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office officials here take note that that  is\r\n\r\nthe   feeling  of  a  vast  majority  of  the  people,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the younger people of this country.  But\r\n\r\nwe  will  fight, if we have something worth  while  to\r\n\r\nfight for. It is no use for the Member for Tanglin  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Self-government is bound to  come.\"  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  telling us that for months, for years and years.\r\n\r\nGive  it to us now and we will fight Communism or  any\r\n\r\nother  ideology that seeks to destroy an  independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Malaya.  That is the first  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, and let there be no  sophistry\r\n\r\nconstrued upon that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stand of the People's Action Party is\r\n\r\nequally unequivocal and clear. We seek to destroy  the\r\n\r\ncolonial system and we seek to do so by methods of non-violence.  We abjure violence as a method of achieving\r\n\r\npolitical ends. We have said that before, and  we  say\r\n\r\nthat  now,  that we are opposed to any group,  or  any\r\n\r\nquarter from which violence comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the two grave doubts which the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary has sought to cloud over the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty. Having made clear those two stands - and as I say\r\n\r\nI speak for myself and for the Party I represent - I can\r\n\r\nnow  proceed to answer his account, his conclusive and\r\n\r\ndecisive  judgment, on what were  the  causes  of  the\r\n\r\nunhappy events of the 12th May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief Secretary would like to\r\n\r\nhave  me  to  answer for my clients. I  am  the  legal\r\n\r\nadviser to the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  the legal adviser to the Preparatory Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Students Union. Therefore, I am the devil\r\n\r\nof the piece. Therefore the People's Action Party, and\r\n\r\nmyself  in  particular, were the people who  fomented,\r\n\r\nwho  instigated, who fed the flames that finally broke\r\n\r\nout into the rioting of the 12th May. It is simple. It\r\n\r\nis  easy.  But it is a pity that if what he  said  was\r\n\r\ntrue, he did not have the courage to get his Attorney-General, who is today absent, to take those things to\r\n\r\na  court  of  law  and prove them. He  has  made  very\r\n\r\nserious  charges against several of my colleagues.  In\r\n\r\nso  far  as  they are personal charges, my  colleagues\r\n\r\nwill   answer  them.  But  in  so  far  as  they   are\r\n\r\nallegations against the People's Action Party, I  will\r\n\r\ndeal with them now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first, to get these things in perspective,\r\n\r\ngive   another  account -  another  viewpoint - of  these\r\n\r\nfacts, of these events, which led to the riots of  the\r\n\r\n12th  May. To the Chief Secretary it was a case  quite\r\n\r\nsimply of unreasonable workers who linked arms and sat\r\n\r\non the floor and blocked the gates of a bus depot; who\r\n\r\nwere  gently  and  gingerly, with as little  force  as\r\n\r\npossible,  removed.  And  then  there  descended  like\r\n\r\nlocusts  hordes  of  agitators,  out  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\nsituation, to fan the flames of bitterness and  hatred\r\n\r\nthat  finally  blew up on the 12th May!  It  is  quite\r\n\r\nsimple - there  were  the workers,  unreasonable;  there\r\n\r\nwere  these hidden enemies who came and fomented them;\r\n\r\nthere  were  the  students  who  fed,  instigated  and\r\n\r\nstiffened their morale for worse and worse things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should proceed, first, with how the\r\n\r\ndispute  was  solved. For it was  not  his  firm,  his\r\n\r\nefficient Police Force that resolved this dispute.  It\r\n\r\nwas not even the Emergency Regulation for which he now\r\n\r\nseeks the approval of the House. It was, if I may  say\r\n\r\nso  with great respect, the patient handling, the firm\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the Chief Minister which  led  to  a\r\n\r\nsolution  of  what  was  a very  important  industrial\r\n\r\ndispute, which involved a basic trade union principle,\r\n\r\nand which so bestirred the workers of this colony that\r\n\r\nthey were prepared to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  on  a  general strike to establish this principle.\r\n\r\nHad  it  been  the Member for Tanglin and his  friends\r\n\r\nwho, together with the colonial officials, had to deal\r\n\r\nwith  such  a  situation, I can assure them  that  all\r\n\r\ntheir threats of use of force would not have been  any\r\n\r\nuse  at  all  in solving something which was  a  human\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, 250 out of the 300 workers in\r\n\r\nthe  Hock  Lee  Bus Company joined the  Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union. Sir, before I proceed, as a matter  of\r\n\r\nformality,  I  should declare that I  acted  as  their\r\n\r\ncounsel at the Commission of Inquiry - but what  I  have\r\n\r\nto  say  I  will say regardless of whether  I  had  an\r\n\r\ninterest to declare. On the formation of this Union on\r\n\r\nthe  24th  February,  the employer  announced  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Press the formation of another union  in  the\r\n\r\nsame company. He announced also that since he expected\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest,  he  was recruiting,  and  he  had\r\n\r\nrecruited, 200 workers to meet any trouble.  Six  days\r\n\r\nbefore the formation of that Union, to prove his  good\r\n\r\nfaith   in  trade  unionism,  he  dismissed  the   two\r\n\r\norganisers of this branch union. Needless to say, when\r\n\r\nthe  Union  was  formed,  the first  dispute  was  the\r\n\r\nreinstatement  of  these  two  men.  Eventually   they\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  obtaining  the  reinstatement  of  one,\r\n\r\nthrough  arbitrators - but  not  before  very  strenuous\r\n\r\nattempts  had been made to buy the man off. A  company\r\n\r\ndirector  offered the man who was dismissed, in  order\r\n\r\nto  get  him  to  go away, to forget all  about  trade\r\n\r\nunionism - offered him for this three months'  pay  from\r\n\r\nthe  company  and three months from his  own  personal\r\n\r\npocket  and  if  he  should wish  to  go  for  further\r\n\r\nstudies, all expenses for further studies would be met\r\n\r\nby  him  personally. The offer was spurned. The worker\r\n\r\nwas reinstated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the company systematically recruited redundant\r\n\r\nworkers  into  a spare pool and put all these  workers\r\n\r\ninto  a union which he formed with a few old employees\r\n\r\nwho did not join the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. And\r\n\r\nthus was created a second union in the company. It was\r\n\r\nthis  that  bedevilled the whole of  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the  Bus  Company  and  the  Hock   Lee\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Bus Company Limited. It was this that made\r\n\r\nany  settlement  in  good faith  between  the  parties\r\n\r\nalmost  an impossibility. It would still have been  an\r\n\r\nimpossibility  were  it  not for  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer finally conceded that their union was  bogus.\r\n\r\nHe  repudiated  the  union, and the  union  agreed  to\r\n\r\ndissolve itself. That is the background of the dispute\r\n\r\nwhich,  so  far as the Chief Secretary was  concerned,\r\n\r\nwas  not  a  matter of relevance. But  so  far  as  my\r\n\r\nclients were concerned, it was a constant irritant  in\r\n\r\nthe whole dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first series of disputes was settled by an\r\n\r\nagreement  between the company and the  Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union on the 4th April, but that was  just  a\r\n\r\ntemporary lull because the employer was, then, not yet\r\n\r\nready  with  his  full force to take over  when  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  strike or, as it turned  out,  when  he\r\n\r\ndismissed the lot of them. Recruitment went  on  apace\r\n\r\ninto  this  spare  pool.  He even  departed  from  his\r\n\r\ncustomary practice of not paying anything to the  band\r\n\r\nof   drivers  and  conductors  waiting  for  permanent\r\n\r\nemployment  should  there  be  a  vacancy,  by  paying\r\n\r\npersons  in this spare pool $2 a day per person.  They\r\n\r\nwere   forced  to  join  his  union.  They   paid   no\r\n\r\nsubscription fees, no entrance fees; they  were  given\r\n\r\nbadges.  They were no more than 'black legs', all  the\r\n\r\ntime  waiting on the side-lines ready for  the  moment\r\n\r\nwhen  the  employer was ready to take  over.  In  that\r\n\r\nsituation  no  real  goodwill  was  possible   between\r\n\r\nemployer and employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor dispute arose about the interpretation of\r\n\r\ntwo clauses in that agreement. The employer refused to\r\n\r\ngive any increment to nine people whom he had promised\r\n\r\nincrement by agreement. The employer refused to put on\r\n\r\nthe  permanent establishment two of the spare  workers\r\n\r\nwho were most senior and who ought to have been put on\r\n\r\nbecause  one  term of the agreement  said  that  spare\r\n\r\nworkers  should be put on the permanent  establishment\r\n\r\naccording  to seniority. They were minor things  which\r\n\r\nwould  have  fizzled  out with a bit  of  goodwill  on\r\n\r\neither  side, but because of this real fight between  a\r\n\r\nunion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfighting  for survival against an employer  determined\r\n\r\nto  break the union, the untiring efforts of the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister did not meet with any success for quite  some\r\n\r\ntime - because  the  company would not  admit  that  it\r\n\r\ncould not break this union by forming its own 'yellow'\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister - I beg his pardon - the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary - (the Chief Minister has not  accused  me  of\r\n\r\nanything yet; in fact, in a moment, I hope it was  not\r\n\r\nalone, of elation, he complimented counsel involved in\r\n\r\nthe  case for their civic consciousness and said a few\r\n\r\nother  kind things.) And I am glad that it is  not  he\r\n\r\nwho  has  pointed the accusing finger at me and  said,\r\n\r\n\"What  have you done, you scoundrel!\" Let me  say  now\r\n\r\nthat  if it were not for the constant efforts of those\r\n\r\nwhom  he would believe to be the forces of evil, there\r\n\r\nwould have been a great deal more trouble for the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Chief Secretary and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was called into the dispute on the morning of the\r\n\r\n27th April, when this House was sitting for the second\r\n\r\nday.  At  6.15 that morning I was summoned by the  Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union to go down to the garage at  Alexandra\r\n\r\nRoad where there had been - as the Chief Secretary would\r\n\r\nput  it - a very gentle and restrained effort to  remove\r\n\r\nworkers  who were obstructing the gates of the garage.\r\n\r\nThe  Chief Secretary would have us believe that  there\r\n\r\nwere  two  who  feigned injuries, lay on  the  ground,\r\n\r\nmoaned away, and disappeared when the ambulance  came!\r\n\r\nSir, I had this one advantage over the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nin  that  I  was  there  at a quarter  past  six  that\r\n\r\nmorning,  and he was not. I have no desire, either  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  or outside, to exacerbate or in  any  way\r\n\r\nirritate  the feelings of mobs or workers against  the\r\n\r\nPolice  or  against  the Government.  And  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndesire,  therefore,  to describe  the  somewhat  lurid\r\n\r\nscene which I witnessed that morning. But let me  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that  it was not as he was informed. In my  whole\r\n\r\nlife I have never seen Chinese workers emotional  and\r\n\r\ndistraught;  but  at that moment I found  drivers  and\r\n\r\nconductors, ordinary workers, literally sobbing their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhearts  out with pain, frustration and bitterness.  It\r\n\r\nwas a scene which I hope I will never witness again as\r\n\r\nlong as the Chief Minister is in office. I came to the\r\n\r\nAssembly that day and I never - I could have if I wanted\r\n\r\nto,  as the Chief Secretary would have us believe - made\r\n\r\npolitical  capital  out of this. I could  have  raised\r\n\r\nthis  quite easily to the embarrassment of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister and his colleagues, who did not know what had\r\n\r\nhappened that morning. I congratulated them when,  the\r\n\r\nmoment  they  came to know of what had happened,  they\r\n\r\nappointed  a Commission of Inquiry into the facts  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the dispute, and a little while later\r\n\r\nappointed  a commission to inquire into the force,  or\r\n\r\nalleged force, that was used that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary would have us believe that\r\n\r\non that little bit of very restrained police action  a\r\n\r\ncrowd  of  agitators  and hate-mongers  were  able  to\r\n\r\nfoment  and blow up a great deal of bitterness,  anger\r\n\r\nand  emotions which finally overcame them on 12th May.\r\n\r\nI do not know if he has ever tried to go to a crowd of\r\n\r\npeople,  such as clerical servants in the Secretariat,\r\n\r\nand  tried  to excite them over things which  are  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  I  could also, if I were given time  and  given\r\n\r\nnotice,  write a seven-page manuscript closely  typed,\r\n\r\ngiving  a full recital of what took place from another\r\n\r\npoint  of  view,  but  I think it serves  very  little\r\n\r\npurpose  unless we are to have the whole  matter  once\r\n\r\nagain  before the public eye, and before tempers  have\r\n\r\ndied down. To my personal knowledge there were several\r\n\r\ncases  where  more than just the necessary  force  was\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step in the dispute in which the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  would  have us believe  that  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party deliberately frustrated every attempt  at\r\n\r\nsettlement,   was  when  after  considerable   effort,\r\n\r\ndespite very strong, very bitter feelings on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the workers against the management, I was able to\r\n\r\nconvince  and persuade the Secretary of the Union  and\r\n\r\nthe Committee of the Branch to go to the Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry, to place their case before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission  and settle the dispute in a  peaceful  and\r\n\r\norderly fashion. I say once more I am glad that it was\r\n\r\nnot  the  Chief Minister who has accused the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party of these things, because  if  he  had  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  would  find  it very  uncomfortable  to  be\r\n\r\nreminded of certain negotiations in which both he  and\r\n\r\nI  were  involved. But, no doubt, his Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nhas no knowledge of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, after the award was given in Court, it\r\n\r\nwas  found  that the Secretary of the  Union  and  the\r\n\r\nBranch Committee had misjudged the temper of the  men,\r\n\r\nthat   they   were   more  bitter,   more   frustrated\r\n\r\n[Interruption.] and it was not until the  early  hours\r\n\r\nof the next morning that the Secretary and myself were\r\n\r\nable  to  persuade and reason with the men to do  what\r\n\r\nwas  the  right  thing. There was so much  bitterness,\r\n\r\ndistrust and suspicion from the employees towards  the\r\n\r\nemployer. At four o'clock in the morning the employees\r\n\r\ntold  me that the employer was out to trick them,  and\r\n\r\nwould  make them sign a form when they went  back,  to\r\n\r\nregister   individually  for   employment.   If   that\r\n\r\nhappened, they would not go back to work. To forestall\r\n\r\nany  such hitch, any such difficulty, I called at,  at\r\n\r\nfour  o'clock in the morning, the residence of counsel\r\n\r\nfor  the  Hock  Lee  Bus Company, woke  him  from  his\r\n\r\nslumber,   after  considerable  difficulty  with   his\r\n\r\nAlsatian dog, and informed him that everything was all\r\n\r\nright,  but that he was to warn his client not  to  do\r\n\r\nanything  which he should not do, such  as  requesting\r\n\r\nhis employees to sign forms, which they had never done\r\n\r\nbefore.  In  my  presence he rang up his  client,  the\r\n\r\nManager  of  the Company. At first he  allowed  me  to\r\n\r\nspeak  to  his  client, which I did.  I  informed  his\r\n\r\nclient that the men would be ready to go back to  work\r\n\r\nat  quarter past five, and that they would be glad  if\r\n\r\nhe   would  lend  us  transport  to  collect  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary paraphernalia of their work - punches,  ticket\r\n\r\npads,  arm badges - and I warned him not to ask them  to\r\n\r\nsign any forms. I then passed the telephone to his own\r\n\r\ncounsel who, in my presence, told him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now,  do not do anything foolish! Do not ask them  to\r\n\r\nsign  anything new!\" I went home, and went to  what  I\r\n\r\nthought was a well-earned rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was awakened at nine and informed that the Union\r\n\r\nwas  told  by  the men that they were  asked  to  sign\r\n\r\nforms,  and the men walked out. All the buses  stopped\r\n\r\nand  they  refused  to  go on.  The  employer  had  an\r\n\r\nexplanation,  and it was, for reasonable  people  like\r\n\r\nhis  lawyers, a very good explanation. He did not want\r\n\r\nanything  that would prejudice the employees.  All  he\r\n\r\nwanted  of  them  was to sign a piece of  paper  which\r\n\r\nsaid: - this is my name, this is my badge number,  this\r\n\r\nis  the bus I am on; information which he had, and had\r\n\r\nnever asked for before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that little device to have a psychological\r\n\r\nvictory  over his employees made further  attempts  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  parties together before the real  core  of\r\n\r\ndispute  was got rid of, an impossible task.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nwent  on  with  the Inquiry hoping that  the  employer\r\n\r\nwould  see  sense.  We  invited  him  to  have  direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations and settle this dispute. He  refused.  He\r\n\r\nwas  going  to have it out. He was going to  fight  it\r\n\r\nout.  He was a very brave man, but a very foolish one,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  was not only fighting the  Hock  Lee  Bus\r\n\r\nCompany  employees, but he was fighting the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement in Singapore, including a lot\r\n\r\nof  the  trade unions which the Chief Secretary  knows\r\n\r\nare  strong supporters of the Labour Front.  They,  as\r\n\r\nmuch   as  any  other  union,  were  angered  by   the\r\n\r\ndisreputable   and  contemptible  methods   of   their\r\n\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary has complained about the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  some  sections of the Chinese  Press  in\r\n\r\ntheir  presentation of the events of the last week.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have any complaint. I just wish to  record  a\r\n\r\nfact - that  we  are really living in different  worlds:\r\n\r\nthose  who read the English Press, those who read  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Press,  those who read the Malay  Press,  and\r\n\r\nthose who read the Indian Press. In the Chinese Press,\r\n\r\nin the Malay Press and the Indian Press, everyday, was\r\n\r\npublished\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  evidence  presented  before  the  Commission   of\r\n\r\nInquiry, the evidence of how the workers were cajoled,\r\n\r\nwere   coerced,  to  join  the  employer's  union   on\r\n\r\nrecruitment.  Evidence was heard of how  the  employer\r\n\r\ntried  to  buy trade union leaders over with  rewards,\r\n\r\nand  of  all  the  other  disreputable  tactics  which\r\n\r\nreaders of the English Press were so happily spared. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to have it said that the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty is against the English Press or any other Press.\r\n\r\nThey  own the newspapers. Subject to what the general\r\n\r\nlaw  has  to say, they have the right to publish  what\r\n\r\nthey  wish.  But it was this clear divergence  between\r\n\r\nthe actions of the English and the Chinese Press which\r\n\r\nexplains  the complete difference of two  sections  of\r\n\r\npublic  opinion. In every coffee-shop in town - I  think\r\n\r\nthe Chief Secretary's very efficient C.I.D. could have\r\n\r\ntold him this - the Chinese-speaking people were talking\r\n\r\nabout the Hock Lee Bus workers. They knew the Hock Lee\r\n\r\nBus  Company.  They knew what was happening,  and  the\r\n\r\nthing was before their eyes everyday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English-speaking people only knew about counsel for\r\n\r\nthe  employer asking whether my clients and  witnesses\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Chinese People's Government  in  Peking.\r\n\r\nThis  has nothing to do with the case. But it was very\r\n\r\ngood.  It  created  the sort of  atmosphere  in  which\r\n\r\ngenuine trade unionists become subversive elements  of\r\n\r\nthis  vast Communist conspiracy which spreads out from\r\n\r\nPeking.  That  was what got reported one  day  in  one\r\n\r\nEnglish paper. And so it was that when the thing  blew\r\n\r\nup  we  found ourselves in Singapore in two completely\r\n\r\ndifferent segments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the trade union world was concerned, there\r\n\r\nwas  no doubt - I think the Chief Minister would be  the\r\n\r\nfirst to acknowledge it - that all trade unionists  were\r\n\r\nsolidly behind the fight for survival of the Singapore\r\n\r\nBus  Workers'  Union's Branch  in  the  Hock  Lee  Bus\r\n\r\nCompany,  Limited, It was a straight fight between  an\r\n\r\nemployer who had decided, the day the union was formed\r\n\r\nin his company, that he was going to crush it, and who\r\n\r\nthen systematically set out to recruit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nredundant  workers whom he fed at two dollars  a  day,\r\n\r\nwhom he forced into his own union. He just waited  for\r\n\r\nthe  time  which he knew was coming when  wage  claims\r\n\r\nwould  be made, and an industrial dispute would arise,\r\n\r\nand  either they would go on strike, in which case  he\r\n\r\nwould  just carry on with his new workers; or he would\r\n\r\ndismiss  them, which was what he did. It was  a  plain\r\n\r\nstraight fight for survival. That was the basic  cause\r\n\r\nof  the  bitterness, the hostility, the anger  in  the\r\n\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary hinted - I cannot say that he did\r\n\r\nmore  than  hint - that there were other  genuine  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes in town. But this one was not. This  one  was\r\n\r\nsubversive.   But   there  are  about   30,000   trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  I  think, who knew better, men  with  very\r\n\r\ngood   credentials  who  know  that  what  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary hinted at is completely untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the solution. Was it the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulation?  Was it the firm and tactful  handling  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police which resolved, which averted  a  wave  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest throughout Singapore and  in  which\r\n\r\nmany unions which supported the Government Benches  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side  were going to be  involved?  If  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin (Mr Ede) and his crowd  had  been\r\n\r\nin,  I  have no doubt whatsoever that they would  have\r\n\r\ndealt  with  it  as  good  employers  deal  with  good\r\n\r\nemployees. I am quite sure that they would have  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  them  in  a  suitably firm and decisive  manner.\r\n\r\nWhether  their firm and decisive handling  would  have\r\n\r\nsolved  the dispute with less bitterness and  violence\r\n\r\nand unhappiness is quite another matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in the habit of giving unnecessary\r\n\r\ncompliments to my opponents, Mr Speaker, Sir. But  if\r\n\r\nI  may  mention what I consider to have  been  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong influence in bringing about a solution, it  was\r\n\r\nthe  untiring patience of the Chief Minister  and  his\r\n\r\ndetermined spirit to get a peaceful settlement. Even I\r\n\r\nnearly  gave  up trying for a peaceful  settlement.  A\r\n\r\nvicious   employer  should  have  it  out   with   his\r\n\r\nemployees, and that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the way trade unionism has grown up in other parts\r\n\r\nof  the  world. But he was determined.  \"Let  us  have\r\n\r\npeace!\"   In  fact,  his  flamboyance,  his  colourful\r\n\r\nrhetoric  was  able, where the workers were  not  able\r\n\r\nearlier,  to  make the employer see the  stupidity  of\r\n\r\ngoing  on  with  his  policy of  repression  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  The moment that point was conceded, that  the\r\n\r\nemployer recognised the Singapore Bus Workers'  Union,\r\n\r\nand  would  dissolve - he did not want  to  dissolve  it\r\n\r\nbecause he kept up the fiction to the end; he said: \"I\r\n\r\ncannot  dissolve the Union since I am not an  official\r\n\r\nof the Union, but I would cease to recognize it, and I\r\n\r\nshall  get the Union officials to dissolve the  Union;\r\n\r\nand the Union officials have obliged me and said 'Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  will sign on the dotted line, and we will dissolve\r\n\r\nourselves'  \" - the moment that happened,  there  was  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  transformation. The tension died  down.  The\r\n\r\nwhole   dispute   settled  into  an  ordinary   normal\r\n\r\nindustrial  dispute,  with no  extra  bitterness.  But\r\n\r\nbefore  that  point was conceded, it was a  fight  for\r\n\r\nsurvival,  and one in which I could not have prevented\r\n\r\nthe  workers from fighting for existence. I think  the\r\n\r\nChief Secretary was careful throughout his seven pages\r\n\r\nof  narrative never to have, at any single time,  held\r\n\r\nhis  finger  at  the  strikers for violence.  Not  one\r\n\r\nsingle  striker to my knowledge, and I  think  to  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the Chief Secretary, has been  arrested\r\n\r\nfor  having  done anything which involved the  use  of\r\n\r\nforce.  They  did squat on the ground; they  did  link\r\n\r\narms. It was passive resistance in the best traditions\r\n\r\nof  another  struggle elsewhere.  They  did  it  as  a\r\n\r\ngesture of protest against the men inside, the  `black\r\n\r\nlegs',  150 to 200 of them. They showed to the  others\r\n\r\ninside what their jobs meant to them, what their union\r\n\r\nmeant  for them. They could have gone back and  signed\r\n\r\nindividually, and their employer would have taken them\r\n\r\nback,  giving  them back their jobs but without  their\r\n\r\nunion. But they did it as a gesture of protest to show\r\n\r\nthe  employer and the 'black legs' that this  is  what\r\n\r\nthey  think  of  themselves, of their jobs  and  their\r\n\r\nunion. I find myself in agreement with that policy  of\r\n\r\npassive resistance of people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are determined to stand for what is right. But  I\r\n\r\nam  in complete disagreement when any force is used to\r\n\r\noppose  what must inevitably come, a forcible  removal\r\n\r\nof  the  workers. To my knowledge there was never  any\r\n\r\nresistance - no   force  was  ever  used   against   any\r\n\r\npoliceman who ejected them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always stood against the use of force or\r\n\r\nviolence in any form, whether as a method of resolving\r\n\r\na trade dispute, or as a method of achieving political\r\n\r\nobjectives.  We  have  said  so  openly.   The   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary would wish to know what the leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party were doing when the riots  were\r\n\r\non. The police had given out messages, saying: \"Do not\r\n\r\ngo  out into the area!\" If the leaders of the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  had turned up in the  area,  they  were\r\n\r\nlikely  to have been involved in a skirmish  with  the\r\n\r\npolice, who would have been quite convinced that  they\r\n\r\nhad gone there to stir up the mob. But let me tell the\r\n\r\nChief Secretary this - and I had no intention of telling\r\n\r\nthis earlier, even though it has been distorted in  an\r\n\r\nEnglish newspaper. This English newspaper said that  I\r\n\r\nasked  for police protection to go down and  speak  to\r\n\r\nthe  rioters.  Sir,  I  have never  asked  for  police\r\n\r\nprotection,  and I did not ask for police  protection.\r\n\r\nBut  I  did suggest to the police that if we would  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to go into the area, we would be prepared  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  mob.  We are not people who run  away  from\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when you fight a colonial system,\r\n\r\nthere  are bound to be a lot of side-eddies and cross-currents.  We  are not frightened or intimidated  just\r\n\r\nbecause  something untoward happened and the mobs  got\r\n\r\nout  of hand. I was prepared to go down there,  and  I\r\n\r\nwas  quite prepared to face that mob and tell them  to\r\n\r\ndisperse, if I had any power with them at all. Even if\r\n\r\nI had not, I would have tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, of course the Chief Secretary would want\r\n\r\nus  to  believe that we engineered this whole  bag  of\r\n\r\ntricks just to terrify the Labour Front, just to break\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister and his colleagues. I think, other\r\n\r\nthan the Chief Minister, no one worked harder than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmyself  to  see that his Government and its policy  of\r\n\r\nfirm  but  understanding  handling  of  the  situation\r\n\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said before that if I went into all the lurid\r\n\r\ndetails  of  what took place and gave it from  another\r\n\r\npoint of view, there would be further trouble. But  if\r\n\r\nthe  Press would refrain from publishing some  of  the\r\n\r\nthings  which I think I must mention just in passing - I\r\n\r\nwould say that if there was no force used, in the  way\r\n\r\nin  which  some people alleged was used in  the  later\r\n\r\nstages - I  was not there myself - but if it was not  used\r\n\r\nin that way, it would have been impossible to get that\r\n\r\ndegree  of animosity and hostility. It is a difficulty\r\n\r\nof  people from other countries of never understanding\r\n\r\nthe   Asian   mind,  and  they  try  to   hide   their\r\n\r\nembarrassment behind a sneer. There is a great deal of\r\n\r\nuneasiness  at the moment because the four people  who\r\n\r\ncarried  the  dead body to the General  Hospital  were\r\n\r\ndetained, released, detained - arrested at 1.30 a.m. on\r\n\r\nthe  morning  of  the 13th when they appeared  at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, released at 4 p.m. in the afternoon\r\n\r\nof  the 13th, re-arrested on the 14th, released in the\r\n\r\nafternoon   of  the  14th,  recalled  to  the   C.I.D.\r\n\r\nyesterday  afternoon. Sir, some of the matters  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  referred  to in this place, but one  of  the  four\r\n\r\npersons  is now, I am reliably informed, very  gravely\r\n\r\nill  in  the General Hospital, with internal  injuries\r\n\r\nwhich  he did not have at the time he took the  corpse\r\n\r\nto the General Hospital. I witnessed a scene yesterday\r\n\r\nwith the mother wailing beside her son in obvious pain\r\n\r\nlying  on a lorry. A new storm was gathering,  and  we\r\n\r\nthe  trouble-makers, we got someone into the lorry and\r\n\r\nwhipped the man off to the General Hospital before the\r\n\r\ncrowd got too big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Chief Secretary must have his theory, and he\r\n\r\nmust justify some of these things he would wish to do.\r\n\r\nWhat better opportunity than this one to justify every\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulation,  every  strong,  firm  colonial\r\n\r\naction? Before it was just colonial. Now, in the  name\r\n\r\nof  Democracy  he  can do all these things.  \"Give  us\r\n\r\nthose  powers.\" They were quite unnecessary. I do  not\r\n\r\nblame\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary, or the Chief Minister  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  for  having  acceded to the  request  of  his\r\n\r\npolice  officers  for  stronger  powers,  because  the\r\n\r\ncolonial police have different traditions from that of\r\n\r\nother  police  forces  in independent  countries  like\r\n\r\nBritain for instance. Whenever they are faced  with  a\r\n\r\nnew  situation other than the arresting of hawkers and\r\n\r\nthe  taking down of traffic offences - anything  out  of\r\n\r\nthe ordinary - \"Let us have new powers. Let us deal with\r\n\r\nthem,  but we cannot deal with them under the ordinary\r\n\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sections in the Penal Code which deal with\r\n\r\nan  unlawful  assembly, and there are  other  sections\r\n\r\nwhich  deal  with  many other offences  which  may  be\r\n\r\ncommitted by an unlawful assembly. If it is true, what\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary said about these vicious speeches\r\n\r\nbeing  made on the picket line, then I say it is wrong\r\n\r\nof  the police not to have proceeded under the law  as\r\n\r\nthey  had  the  right to do. Anyone fomenting  unrest,\r\n\r\nanyone deliberately provoking hatred to a point  where\r\n\r\nit  is bound to break out into violence, must be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  his  words.  He  should  have   been\r\n\r\napprehended and charged, and the police would have the\r\n\r\nfull support of the People's Action Party. But what we\r\n\r\nobject to now, and what we have always objected to, is\r\n\r\nthis  insinuation, this smear of evil  forces  working\r\n\r\nbehind  the  scenes, behind the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nand its leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have never said one word, either before the\r\n\r\nelection,  during the election or after the  election,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  wish now to retract. I have been misreported\r\n\r\non  one  occasion. I have corrected that Press report,\r\n\r\nand I do not retract any word that I said then. It  is\r\n\r\nno  use,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, to tell the people:  \"You\r\n\r\ncannot  have  Democracy. You are not fit for  it.  You\r\n\r\nwill be devoured by the Communists. Let us first fight\r\n\r\nthe  Communists.\" It does not work. It does not strike\r\n\r\none  bell  anywhere  in the hearts  of  any  patriotic\r\n\r\nMalayan   who   would  wish  to  see  an  independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic, non-Communist Malaya. We are not  prepared\r\n\r\nto fight to perpetuate or to prolong the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonial  system. But give us our rights and  we  will\r\n\r\nfight  the  Communists or any others who threaten  the\r\n\r\nexistence of an independent, democratic, non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It is one of those difficult things,  because\r\n\r\nwhen you are under tutelage, your masters say: \"Let me\r\n\r\nmeasure  your  fitness for independence.  Let  me  see\r\n\r\nwhether   you  have  sufficient  numbers  of  literate\r\n\r\npeople,    sufficient   civil   servants,   sufficient\r\n\r\nscientists, doctors, lawyers, sufficient good, mature,\r\n\r\nold,  steady  political leaders. If you  satisfy  this\r\n\r\nnebulous  test, which I have not published beforehand,\r\n\r\nthen  you shall have your independence. You shall have\r\n\r\nyour freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the worst things about violence is that it so\r\n\r\nvery  often  succeeds - and that is the real tragedy  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  You  never  can have,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  who  really believes that the  British  would\r\n\r\nrelease  their hold without our creating  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhich  makes  it  wise  and  cogent  for  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment as benign governors and rulers to give  us\r\n\r\nand  concede us our independence. It is only when such\r\n\r\nconditions  existed that the British  left  India  and\r\n\r\nsaid:   \"We   knew   the  Indians   were   ripe   for\r\n\r\nindependence.  We quitted. So did we leave  Burma;  so\r\n\r\ndid  we  leave  Ceylon.  But we cannot  leave  Malaya.\r\n\r\nMalaya  is not ready for independence.\" But the  whole\r\n\r\nworld does not challenge the right of the Siamese  to\r\n\r\ngovern  themselves. By any of the tests, either  posed\r\n\r\nby  Sir  Anthony Eden or by any colonial  governor  or\r\n\r\ncolonial  official, I think this island in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  Siam - perhaps I should put it the  other  way  in\r\n\r\ncase I should offend the Consul General for Siam - but I\r\n\r\nwould  say  with great respect that we  have  as  many\r\n\r\neducated people as the Siamese, that we have  as  many\r\n\r\nable leaders as the Siamese, that we have less changes\r\n\r\nof  government, we have less violence with changes  of\r\n\r\ngovernment. But there the Americans are determined  to\r\n\r\ndefend  the  rights of the Siamese to self-government,\r\n\r\nto  independence. Arms, ammunition, men - I do not know;\r\n\r\nI  am  told by the Press very few men - are being poured\r\n\r\ninto it, to make sure that that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  remains  an  independent,  sovereign   state.\r\n\r\nEverybody says: \"Look, what has happened in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nChaos,  violence,  corruption, disaster.\"  But  nobody\r\n\r\nchallenges  the  right  of the  Indonesians  to  their\r\n\r\nsovereign   right,  their  divine   right   of   self-determination, and nobody says that the  Dutch  should\r\n\r\ngo  back  and tell their former pupils that they  have\r\n\r\nmisjudged the maturity of the Indonesians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it once before, badly reported, and I have\r\n\r\ncorrected it, and I will say here and now that if  you\r\n\r\nwant  an  independent,  democratic  and  non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya,  then  let us have something  worth  while  to\r\n\r\nfight  for at once. Give us something worth  while  to\r\n\r\ndefend. Give us proof that you will not fight us.  But\r\n\r\nI  can  say  here  and now: it is impossible  for  any\r\n\r\nperson, any political party, to fight the British  and\r\n\r\nfight  the Communists. It is not possible, and of  the\r\n\r\ntwo,  the  British are in control, so  you  fight  the\r\n\r\nBritish  alone. But give us our rights, and  we  shall\r\n\r\nfight  anyone - anyone as Mr Thomas said,  the  present\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Transport, and for a  short  while  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Housing - we will fight the Communists  or\r\n\r\nanybody else to defend our freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I believe in, and that is what my Party\r\n\r\nbelieves in, but you will not get the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  to  join the colonial band-wagon on this  anti-Communist  hysteria.  I  have  said  before  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that it is not a simple matter of  evil  men\r\n\r\nout to destroy good. If it were so simple, the problem\r\n\r\nwould  not he so difficult throughout the world as  it\r\n\r\nis.  It is a question of men who want to do good,  but\r\n\r\nmen  who  find frustrations, impossibilities, who  then\r\n\r\nslowly decide that this particular system is a way  of\r\n\r\nresolving a bad situation which they dislike. I myself\r\n\r\nam not convinced that the Communist revolution and its\r\n\r\ntechnique  is  the  only way or is the  right  way  to\r\n\r\nresolve colonialism in Malaya. It is because I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  British  may be sensible enough  sooner  or\r\n\r\nlater, and I hope it is sooner, that if you want  this\r\n\r\nMalaya to be democratic, to be independent, to be part\r\n\r\nof the free world, then - I will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvoke  God for this - but I would say: \"Do it  quickly,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  for God's sake, or for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nMalaya - for  the sake of their political beliefs  which\r\n\r\nthey  have preached, whether they believe in  them  or\r\n\r\nnot  at the time they preached them, but for the  sake\r\n\r\nof   those  political  beliefs  which  sometimes  have\r\n\r\nsparked  the  hopes, the ideals of some of  those  who\r\n\r\ncame within their system.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Suspension of Sitting</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion made, and Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the meeting be suspended until 2.30 p.m.\" (The\r\n\r\nChief Minister).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>at 12.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what I have to say may, in view of the drama  of\r\n\r\nthis   morning's  debate,  sound  rather   pedestrian,\r\n\r\nsomething in the nature of an intermezzo, but in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of trade in this Colony,  I  hope,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  you  will regard it as relevant.  This  is\r\n\r\nsurely  the  time  when  anything  that  can  be  said\r\n\r\npublicly to promote confidence and faith in the future\r\n\r\nof this country and of this Government should be said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports of flight of capital have been circulating\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Some of them indicate that  the  exodus\r\n\r\nhas  been on a colossal scale. A figure of 150 million\r\n\r\ndollars   has   been  mentioned,  17\ufffd  million   pound\r\n\r\nsterling. Sir, I speak with some authority when I  say\r\n\r\nfrom  my knowledge as a banker that these reports  are\r\n\r\nutter  nonsense.  The remittance of such  a  vast  sum\r\n\r\ncould  only  be  made in two ways. It  could  be  made\r\n\r\nthrough the Commissioners of Currency by the remitters\r\n\r\ndrawing the money from the banks and paying it to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Commissioners of Currency, thus causing  an\r\n\r\nacute shortage of the circulating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedium  and,  indeed, creating a minor crisis;  or  it\r\n\r\ncould  actually be remitted through the banks. But  if\r\n\r\nit  were  remitted through the banks, it would  create\r\n\r\nsuch  a  demand for sterling that we should  know  all\r\n\r\nabout  it. Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been  no  such\r\n\r\ndisturbing factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that no capital has left this country.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there are some people who have regarded the\r\n\r\nrecent  victory  of  the  Labour  Front  as  a   major\r\n\r\ncataclysm. Such people have indeed attempted  to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  excellent securities and try to get  the  money\r\n\r\nsafely  out of the country. What folly! However,  such\r\n\r\nflight  of  capital could take place, particularly  by\r\n\r\nwithdrawals by overseas investors if they thought that\r\n\r\nthe  sinister and evil forces which exist in  strength\r\n\r\nin this Colony, whose symbol is the clenched fist, and\r\n\r\nwho  have thus far so successfully poisoned the minds,\r\n\r\nthe   exceedingly   susceptible   minds   of   Chinese\r\n\r\nadolescents,  were  to gain the  ascendant.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, is the root of the matter, as has already been\r\n\r\nsaid this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With half of our population under 21, what a fruitful\r\n\r\nfield  for the sowing of dragon's teeth. Would it  not\r\n\r\nbe  possible for Government to investigate the case of\r\n\r\nthe  \"old\" students one hears so much about? Could not\r\n\r\none place an age limit at which students must withdraw\r\n\r\nfrom schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more mundane, Sir, but equally realistic, such\r\n\r\na  flight  of  capital as was rumoured to  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace  would  take  place if the  public  feared  that\r\n\r\nrestrictions might be placed on movements of  resident\r\n\r\nsterling.  I mean that if restrictions were placed  on\r\n\r\nthe  free  remittance of funds from  this  country  to\r\n\r\nother points in the sterling area. The public would, I\r\n\r\nthink, respond well to an assurance by Government that\r\n\r\nno  such legislation - and it would take legislation, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  impose such restrictions - is contemplated,\r\n\r\nor likely to be contemplated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the Governments of India and the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  are  reported  to  be  considering  an\r\n\r\nagreement designed to encourage private American\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestments in India. The agreement would provide  for\r\n\r\nguarantees   against   expropriation   and   for   the\r\n\r\nremittance of profits in convertible currency. And how\r\n\r\nnecessary these provisions are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen and investors are not altruists but in\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  make profit. Here in Singapore  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal   of   nonsense  is  talked  about  profits   and\r\n\r\ndividends.  It  is true that on the existing  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital  of companies sometimes three-figure dividends\r\n\r\nare  paid, but it takes no account whatsoever  of  the\r\n\r\nenormous reserves belonging to the shareholders  which\r\n\r\nare  in these companies, and which are employed in the\r\n\r\nbusiness.  By  the simple process of  tidying  up  the\r\n\r\nbalance sheet and transferring these reserves  in  the\r\n\r\nshape  of  bonus shares to the shareholders, the  same\r\n\r\namount  of  money would be available for  distribution\r\n\r\nand  dividends would become more normal. There  is,  I\r\n\r\nsubmit,   Sir,  nothing  ignoble  about  trading   for\r\n\r\nlegitimate  profit, and I state solemnly that  capital\r\n\r\nwill  not  flow  to  any country  where  controls  and\r\n\r\nregulations are introduced to reduce the profit  below\r\n\r\nwhat is expected in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would say that if the use of the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations is one  of  the  means  whereby\r\n\r\nconfidence can be restored to this country,  then  let\r\n\r\nthem be used resolutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  events of the past week have  caused  grave\r\n\r\nconcern  to the citizens of Singapore, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  retracing any of the ground  which  has  been\r\n\r\ncovered  by the other Members this morning.  My  Party\r\n\r\nwas  concerned with the dispute between the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBus  Workers' Union and the management of Hock Lee Bus\r\n\r\nCompany. We disapprove of the way in which the company\r\n\r\nwas using the Hock Lee Employees' Union, a union which\r\n\r\nthe  company had organised to break the unity  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  Singapore Bus Workers'  Union.  This\r\n\r\naction of the company we deplore as it endangered  the\r\n\r\nwhole  trade union movement in Singapore. The sympathy\r\n\r\nmy  Party showed in this dispute was the same sort  of\r\n\r\nsympathy  which  all responsible trade  unions  showed\r\n\r\ntowards the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBus  Workers' Union in this dispute. We were  all  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  stand  aside  and  to  be  idle,  while   a\r\n\r\nresponsible union was in danger of being gulped by the\r\n\r\nirresponsible behaviour of the management of the  Hock\r\n\r\nLee Bus Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, accepts responsibility throughout this\r\n\r\ndispute.   When  feelings  were  high  and  when   the\r\n\r\nsituation worsened, my Party clearly stood opposed  to\r\n\r\nviolence, for resort to violence would not be  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the workers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion before the Assembly this morning the\r\n\r\nGovernment is seeking power to impose a curfew to deal\r\n\r\nwith  a  situation  which the  citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwitnessed a few days ago. As such my Party is  opposed\r\n\r\nto  the  principle  of governing by way  of  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations.  As  this motion is to  be  a  motion  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  Government, my  Party  will  not,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the events of a few days ago, oppose  the\r\n\r\nmotion.  I do hope sincerely that the Government  will\r\n\r\nnever  have the occasion to invoke this Regulation  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, and peaceable settlement of  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes  will  be  so accepted and practised  by  all\r\n\r\norganised  workers as to make it never again necessary\r\n\r\nfor  this Assembly to meet again to consider the  need\r\n\r\nof  re-introducing Emergency Regulations which we  all\r\n\r\ndeplore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nevery  responsible  citizen in  Singapore  must  abhor\r\n\r\nviolence, and nobody could look back to the black days\r\n\r\nof  May the 12th and May the 13th without feeling that\r\n\r\nsomething is essentially wrong with the present  state\r\n\r\nof  affairs, that riots should have taken place.

Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, despite my ill-health, I feel it is my bounden duty to say a few\r\n\r\nwords on this occasion. The motion which was moved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Chief Secretary merely  asks  for  the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  a  certain  clause  in  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations imposing a curfew, and I thought  probably\r\n\r\nhe  would  deal with the reasons as to  why  that  was\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But I find, in the course of  the  speech,\r\n\r\nthat several points were brought out which should  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought  out  in this  debate  at  all.  A\r\n\r\ndescription of the events which took place  was  read\r\n\r\nout   to  this  sitting,  and  I  felt  that  a   very\r\n\r\ncontroversial debate would take place.  We  are  aware\r\n\r\nthat a Commission of Inquiry has been instituted,  and\r\n\r\nat  this  juncture  it would be  wrong  to  state  the\r\n\r\nreasons  or  the implications of the dispute  and  the\r\n\r\npolice action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alleged that the influence of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party had created the situation. Well,\r\n\r\nI,  as  a  trade unionist, have understood  the  whole\r\n\r\nposition and would suggest that that allegation should\r\n\r\nnot  have  been brought up at all at this debate,  but\r\n\r\nsince  it  was  brought  up,  may  I  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that this Commission of Inquiry  should  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  make  it a public inquiry  so  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  will  be  able to judge who were  involved  in\r\n\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a trade unionist, I believe that the trouble\r\n\r\nstarted because of a very unhealthy situation  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement. In Singapore, the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement has taken very strong roots ever since  1945,\r\n\r\nand  although we have organisations of various  kinds\r\n\r\nwe  have  yet  to  realize the real  dreams  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism. People have been active in the trade unions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of them sincerely, and some of them just for  the\r\n\r\nfancy  of  it.  The  result today  is  that  even  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trades  Union  Congress  cannot  say   very\r\n\r\nvehemently  that  it has helped the movement  to  grow\r\n\r\nsteadily  and  in the manner in which it  should  have\r\n\r\ngrown.  It has no department to deal with organisation\r\n\r\nof trade unions. It has no research department to find\r\n\r\nout how and where the movement went wrong. Therefore I\r\n\r\nwould  say that there has been something wrong in  the\r\n\r\norganisation of the trade union movement in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,   ever  since  1945,  there  have  been  splinter\r\n\r\norganisations in the trade union movement, and  I  see\r\n\r\nwith  satisfaction that a certain amount of  sincerity\r\n\r\nin  the  movement has come into being  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrade  unionism today. They have realised that  it  is\r\n\r\nonly by a sincere and honest trade union movement that\r\n\r\nthe  workers  will be able to better their  prospects,\r\n\r\nand  I  think they felt that a splinter union  in  the\r\n\r\nHock Lee Bus Company was very undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the observations which I have made, the\r\n\r\ndispute  was, up to a certain stage, a dispute  purely\r\n\r\ninvolving   the  tussle  between  the  Singapore   Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union  and  the  Hock  Lee  Amalgamated  Bus\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union.  But at a later date  the  fight  for\r\n\r\nestablishing  the union's right became involved  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious  one in which a riot took  place.  As  a\r\n\r\ntrade unionist I have to condemn violence in any  form\r\n\r\nin  a  trade union movement like we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut let us not say that we move this motion, adopt it\r\n\r\nand  sit on it. What I would like to see is that there\r\n\r\nshould be some sort of a body to reorganise the  whole\r\n\r\ntrade union movement into a very strong and beneficial\r\n\r\none to the people of Singapore in which they will have\r\n\r\na  fair share in the management of the trade union and\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of experience which other people  may  be\r\n\r\nable to give them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe, Sir, that any action such as the\r\n\r\nclosure  of  schools  would be  able  to  curtail  the\r\n\r\nmovement of the Chinese students. I have observed  all\r\n\r\nthese    years the action taken by the Government  to\r\n\r\nmake the Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents realize their role as students and as members\r\n\r\nof  the community, but I have found that at all  times\r\n\r\neither  the children have been expelled or the schools\r\n\r\nhave  been closed, and I should like to know what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment policy would be in the future to handle the\r\n\r\nsituation. For myself, I believe that they should  not\r\n\r\nenter  into politics at this stage. They should be  at\r\n\r\nschool,  and  I feel that they should be  educated  to\r\n\r\nbecome  useful citizens of Singapore. May I ask  which\r\n\r\nschool  in  Singapore today has a scheme of  educating\r\n\r\nits students to become useful citizens? We have yet to\r\n\r\nopen a new charter for the students of Singapore.  You\r\n\r\nmay have a course in civics or something of that kind,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is no specific form of education  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  become useful citizens of  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to the Government, Sir, that the working\r\n\r\nperiod  of  schools  be shifted  from  the  present  8\r\n\r\no'clock to ten; ten to four or ten to five like  that,\r\n\r\nso  that  the students will be able to concentrate  on\r\n\r\ntheir  studies properly, go home and have the time  to\r\n\r\ndo  their  homework, rather than having more  time  to\r\n\r\nindulge  in various other activities. This may  be  an\r\n\r\nidea  which you all may feel not very applicable here,\r\n\r\nbut  I  do suggest for your consideration at least  to\r\n\r\ntry and see whether this will work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about the other matters in the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's speech, I regret that certain parts of his\r\n\r\nspeech  have  been  very provocative.  It  is  no  use\r\n\r\npointing  out to somebody and saying: \"You are  wrong,\r\n\r\nand I am right.\" What we all have to emphasize is what\r\n\r\nis  right and what is wrong. By pointing out to me and\r\n\r\nsaying  I  am wrong or he is wrong, I do not think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to get anywhere, and particularly  in  a\r\n\r\ndebate  like this. Government should try and  win  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of other opposition Parties by  diplomatic\r\n\r\nmeans. I think certain statements made have been  very\r\n\r\nprovocative,  and  I believe that in  future  measures\r\n\r\naffecting the national interests of the people  should\r\n\r\nbe  handled in an entirely different way, rather  than\r\n\r\nin a provocative and antagonistic exchange of words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   should   like  to  say  that  I  am   an   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the people.  As  such,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nanswerable for my actions to a colonial official. I am\r\n\r\nonly  answerable to the people. Secondly, as a  member\r\n\r\nof  the  People's Action Party, I stand  for  a  free,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Malaya through peaceful  and  non-violent\r\n\r\nmethods,   but  I  should  not  support  the  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials in spreading the negative hysteria of  anti-Communism.  There is nothing which I can  add  to  the\r\n\r\nstand  of the People's Action Party which was  defined\r\n\r\nby the Secretary of my Party this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nlistening to a number of dramatic and solemn speeches,\r\n\r\nI  think  I have come to the conclusion that  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse all of us condemn violence, and I am sure all of\r\n\r\nus want to keep law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I would want to say about the\r\n\r\nclosure  of the Chinese schools. We are not  convinced\r\n\r\nthat   just  by  closing  the  three  Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nGovernment would have accomplished their objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to raise a further question on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   education   policy   in   general   and\r\n\r\nespecially in respect of Chinese education.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  that  there are a few people carrying  on  evil-minded  activity in the Chinese schools, and  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  caused the spreading of irresponsible propaganda,\r\n\r\nteaching  and misleading many of the innocent  Chinese\r\n\r\nyouths.  But  one  basic  fact  is  that  our  present\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Government elected  by  the  people,\r\n\r\nforget  to remind us that this Government is  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the previous colonial government,  and\r\n\r\non  this  point  this  Government  should  assure  the\r\n\r\npeoples  of Singapore, especially the Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Government is aware of the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among the Chinese community  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  Ten-Year Education  Plan,  the  Frisby\r\n\r\nSupplementary Plan and the White Paper. I  heard  what\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Secretary said this morning  about\r\n\r\nthe rioting and that the Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool committees should do something about it. But he\r\n\r\nis never aware of or understands what the feelings are\r\n\r\nthese  days among the Chinese school children, as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  parents, the school teachers and  the  school\r\n\r\nmanagement   committees.  They  have  been   patiently\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  the  Government  to  change  their  most\r\n\r\nunpopular education policy. I think that is the  basis\r\n\r\nto  clear away the so-called dissatisfaction which  is\r\n\r\nin the Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the closure of these three schools, we find\r\n\r\nfrom reports that in the Hock Lee Bus strike, not only\r\n\r\nstudents  from  the Chung Cheng High  School  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese   High  School  are  involved,  but   also   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of girl students and a good number\r\n\r\nof  the  onlookers were also involved. It  is  a  most\r\n\r\nimportant fact that the student who was killed  during\r\n\r\nthe riot was identified as not belonging to either  of\r\n\r\nthese two above-mentioned schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize that the activities carried\r\n\r\nout  by students outside their schools are beyond  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the school authority, and we therefore\r\n\r\nfind  little justification in Government's  action  in\r\n\r\nclosing  the three Chinese schools. We therefore  feel\r\n\r\nthat  unless there are good and valid reasons  unknown\r\n\r\nto  us  to  justify  the action, the  Government  must\r\n\r\nforthwith  lift  the closure order in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nthree schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I am sure the House will share my grief\r\n\r\nand  condolence in the deaths during this rioting, and\r\n\r\nI am sure their blood will not have flowed in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  have  come to the crux of the problem  if  we  can\r\n\r\nanswer what is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all regret very much the violence we have seen in\r\n\r\nthe  last few days in Singapore, but now having  taken\r\n\r\nstock  of the situation, what is more important to  us\r\n\r\nis  that  we  should see that such violence  does  not\r\n\r\noccur again, and the key to that, I think, is to  find\r\n\r\nout what is wrong with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if anybody who professes himself to be a\r\n\r\npolitician, anybody who professes himself to represent\r\n\r\nthe  people, who has gone out to the people, seen them\r\n\r\nand  met  them, who really knows the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  he will be able to tell the answer.  Probably\r\n\r\nsome  who  are in this House may not know the  answer,\r\n\r\nbecause  they have not met the people in the way  they\r\n\r\nshould have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have found the answer to that question and\r\n\r\nthat  is that the whole trouble is because of our  bad\r\n\r\nand  outmoded social system in Singapore. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Hon. the Chief Minister was not  flaunting\r\n\r\nhigh-sounding phrases over the radio on Thursday night\r\n\r\nwhen  he blamed the past colonial system. Sir, whoever\r\n\r\nmay  be  to blame for the lack of social services,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  apparent that in a society where  children\r\n\r\nwho have grown to school age cannot find admission  to\r\n\r\nschools,  in  a  society where  the  sick  cannot  get\r\n\r\nmedical attention as they should, Sir, in that society\r\n\r\nbreed  the germs of discontent, and it is up  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse - to  the  representatives of the people  sitting\r\n\r\nhere - to find the causes and to try to remove them  and\r\n\r\nfind  the  solutions to the causes. That is  why,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I think the Labour Front has appealed to\r\n\r\nthe  sense of the people, and that is why I think  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front is the answer to the needs of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  I think it is up to all right-minded citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  who  have the interests  of  Singapore  at\r\n\r\nheart,  to  support the Government to eradicate  those\r\n\r\nevils  in our society so that we may be able to get  a\r\n\r\ncontented people in Singapore, who would not  then  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to the propaganda of those who try  to  make\r\n\r\nuse of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  are all sad and sick of the recent outbursts\r\n\r\nof violence in this Colony.

This  fact had united the workers against  the\r\n\r\nemployer.

Since the grave events leading  to  the\r\n\r\nloss of many lives and property, there has followed an\r\n\r\natmosphere of uneasy quietness. I do hope that this is\r\n\r\nthe  sign of being wiser after the event. But how much\r\n\r\nbetter  it  would be for one to be more  cautious  and\r\n\r\nwise before the event?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government has definitely promised us to\r\n\r\ncarry out a number of measures aimed at improving  the\r\n\r\nlot  of  the workers of this country, and it  is  only\r\n\r\nfair  to  give it a chance to put these measures  into\r\n\r\nexecution. All things cannot be done at once. It  must\r\n\r\nbe  given  time.  But  if in the meanwhile  particular\r\n\r\nsections  of  workers  feel that they  have  immediate\r\n\r\ngrievances  in  their conditions of  employment,  then\r\n\r\nthere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  procedures  by  which such  grievances  could  be\r\n\r\nbrought  out  to light and measures for  putting  them\r\n\r\nright  be discussed and negotiated, and if it is  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the law governing the procedures is not fair  to\r\n\r\none  side  or  the other, such points  could  also  be\r\n\r\nbrought to this House and discussed, and, if they  are\r\n\r\nreally  unfair, could be amended. But in the  meantime\r\n\r\nlaw  and order must be maintained. Innocent people and\r\n\r\ntheir  property must have protection and,  above  all,\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  the country and its people  must  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded, for otherwise there will be  chaos  which\r\n\r\nwill benefit no one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when a jockey has chosen a horse to ride during\r\n\r\na  race, he certainly appears to have a better  chance\r\n\r\nto  win, but if that horse is over-whipped and,  worse\r\n\r\nstill, given an overdose of stimulant, the chances are\r\n\r\nthat  that  horse will run wild. The able jockey  will\r\n\r\nthen lose control of his ride, with the result that he\r\n\r\nwill either be thrown off half way round the track, or\r\n\r\nbe  carried at a suicidal speed far beyond the winning\r\n\r\npost he aimed at - and perhaps over the precipice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  speakers previously have  covered  much\r\n\r\nground.  Some of them have given a history leading  to\r\n\r\nthe  violence  and thereafter. I feel that  the  price\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  has had to pay to  settle  one  trade\r\n\r\ndispute is too high, with four lives lost and so  many\r\n\r\npeople injured. I feel that that sort of way to settle\r\n\r\na  dispute is not the right way. Indeed, when you come\r\n\r\nto  think  about  the ways the leaders start  settling\r\n\r\ndisputes  by a show of force, I feel that it  is  only\r\n\r\nright that decent people should come forward and voice\r\n\r\ntheir  opinion  and  help the workers  to  make  their\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as an example I quote you - trade unions have\r\n\r\nbeen  established since the war. There have been  many\r\n\r\npeople  who claim to be their leaders. There are  many\r\n\r\nwho  would say that they care for the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  but  I am not too sure about  it.  Are  they\r\n\r\nmaking  use of these trade unions as tools  for  their\r\n\r\npolitical ends, or are they really willing tools to be\r\n\r\nmade  use of by those trade unions and the workers  to\r\n\r\nbetter their conditions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few days the Chief Minister has\r\n\r\ntried,  and  tried  very hard,  to  solve  a  dispute.\r\n\r\nHowever, that solution was forced out of him with a 24-hour   ultimatum.  Should  that  settlement   be   not\r\n\r\neffected, we had been told that there would be greater\r\n\r\ndisorder or a bigger strike. Now, those are forces  we\r\n\r\nare  faced  with in this world - and are  their  demands\r\n\r\nright?  Can  we  withstand  such  forces?  Or  do   we\r\n\r\ncapitulate  before such forces? I  can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has virtually capitulated, or if  that\r\n\r\nis not so, he has made another party capitulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the negotiations in a trade dispute I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  should not be for the  strong  to  demand\r\n\r\neverything  from  the other side. I believe  that  the\r\n\r\nessence should be compromise. Again, I feel, too, that\r\n\r\nin Singapore the weapon of strike has been used rather\r\n\r\ntoo  often. I feel that more opportunities  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  negotiations before any  such  weapons  are\r\n\r\nused.  Perhaps it is said that we are fighting  for  a\r\n\r\ncause. Perhaps that cause is most worthy, but a  cause\r\n\r\nthat has caused riots is not going to be one that will\r\n\r\nbe  supported by the people. Furthermore, I feel  that\r\n\r\nworkers  during  such strikes led by  their  so-called\r\n\r\nleaders  have  inflicted more pain on  themselves  and\r\n\r\nmore loss on themselves. During such strikes there are\r\n\r\nsuch  things  as a few arrests and injuries.  The  so-called  leaders are free from such injury. The leaders\r\n\r\nhave  suffered  no loss of wages, which  I  think  the\r\n\r\nworkers themselves have suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, trade unionism, I believe, is going to foster\r\n\r\nbetter employer-employee relationship. I find that  if\r\n\r\nthis  strike weapon is used all along, if we find that\r\n\r\nto  support a small section, the whole lot of the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers  should go out on strike, are  they  not  only\r\n\r\npunishing the one they call a defaulting employer  but\r\n\r\nalso those who take no part and with whom they have no\r\n\r\ngrouse  or grievance? I feel the strike weapon  should\r\n\r\nbe used very discreetly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, workers, I believe, should think of the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  they will cause to fellow  workers  who\r\n\r\nare dependent on their services. It is not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer  class  that is going to suffer,  but  indeed\r\n\r\nthey  are inflicting suffering on the workers who  are\r\n\r\ndependent on them for their services and the  children\r\n\r\nwho have got to go to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise leaders, I believe, have not been too wise.\r\n\r\nThe  present  strike that has been settled,  I  should\r\n\r\nsay, has not created a sense of peace in the minds  of\r\n\r\nmany  people.  Indeed, to me and to  a  lot  of  other\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore it seems to be only a truce,  and\r\n\r\nthat truce might be broken up. When trouble will start\r\n\r\nnobody  knows. Singapore seems to be expectant  as  to\r\n\r\nwhen the next crop of trouble will start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this, we have had strikes, genuine trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  coming up by single unions, but at  present,\r\n\r\njust  these  few  weeks,  there  have  been  crops  of\r\n\r\nstrikes. What is behind all this? Government  has  put\r\n\r\nforward one or two points. Government probably will do\r\n\r\nits best. We trust that the Government will do all  it\r\n\r\ncould to preserve peace and order, without which it is\r\n\r\ndifficult to work - even for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

I  must  confess\r\n\r\nthat  the  pleasure  which those words  gave  me,  the\r\n\r\nintimation of a sense of responsibility which seems to\r\n\r\nhave  come  anew to the hon. Gentlemen  opposite,  was\r\n\r\nimmediately destroyed, because the hon.

We have had an example of  it  today.  I\r\n\r\nwould like it to be made clear, Sir, in this stress of\r\n\r\ntragedy through which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  passed, at a moment when we do  not  require\r\n\r\nvotes  as we are in power, that my Government is  very\r\n\r\nconscious of the extremely weak position of the worker\r\n\r\nof  this territory, and so long as it exists, it  will\r\n\r\nwork unflinchingly with the greatest possible emphasis\r\n\r\non  the  welfare of the worker.

There is  no\r\n\r\nquestion of impropriety. They seek power, and that  is\r\n\r\nproper. That they should seek power in this fashion is\r\n\r\nimproper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin made the suggestion that\r\n\r\nGovernment  could have acted swifter  and  quicker.  I\r\n\r\nwould  remind  him, Sir, that in a democracy  one  can\r\n\r\nonly  act in harmony with public opinion, and  it  can\r\n\r\nonly act in opposition to public opinion in moments of\r\n\r\nurgent stress, and not otherwise. That moment was  not\r\n\r\nreached in Singapore before Thursday, the 12th of May,\r\n\r\nand  we are a democracy, whatever the hon. Members for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. may think. The time had not come for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of the bullet and the Emergency Regulations.  Had\r\n\r\nwe,  prior  to the 13th, sought to use the bullet  and\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency Regulations as a means of  establishing\r\n\r\norder,   we  would  have  destroyed  the  concept   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and its value in this territory completely.\r\n\r\nWe would have identified ourselves with a system which\r\n\r\nwe  ourselves abhor. It was important that  we  should\r\n\r\nnot   act  in  a  fashion  which  would  destroy,  not\r\n\r\nourselves,  which  does not matter,  but  which  would\r\n\r\ndestroy  those  ideals for which  I  trust  the  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  hon.  Members  of  this  House  are\r\n\r\nstriving - the  ideals  of  the democratic  process.  We\r\n\r\nwould have given magnificent propaganda value to those\r\n\r\nwho say that this constitution is unworkable, and that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  democratic in utilizing, when  it  seemed\r\n\r\nunnecessary from surface symptoms, methods which  were\r\n\r\ntoo drastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 13th, Sir, representations were made to us by\r\n\r\nthe  Police - and this in answer to the hon. Member  who\r\n\r\nasked why the curfew was re-introduced - representations\r\n\r\nwere made to us that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nre-introduction of the curfew regulation itself  would\r\n\r\ngive an indication that Government intended to take  a\r\n\r\nvery  firm  stand against violence, and that  if  that\r\n\r\nindication  was  not  respected, it  might  well  have\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary for the curfew to be  imposed.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers across the floor will realize that that curfew\r\n\r\nemergency regulation was, in fact, not used. In answer\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) as\r\n\r\nto why we should require Emergency Regulations in this\r\n\r\nterritory,  when  in other territories  they  seem  to\r\n\r\nquell  riots without them, I would remind him that  in\r\n\r\nIndia, for example - perhaps he knows well - the power  of\r\n\r\nthe Police to impose curfew regulations is part of the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code. We have not that power here. The question\r\n\r\nthat  is before you is whether we were right at  that\r\n\r\ntime  to re-impose that curfew regulation. Even  more,\r\n\r\nSir,  is the question whether Government was right  in\r\n\r\nthe  way it handled the situation and wherein  is  the\r\n\r\nroot of the causes of that day of terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar spoke with a\r\n\r\npersuasiveness that, to those who are not in the know,\r\n\r\ncompletely obliterated his glaring omissions, masterly\r\n\r\nomissions.  I have been today the object  of  bouquets\r\n\r\nfrom  hon.  Gentlemen opposite, and I find  them  very\r\n\r\nflattering, for which I am very grateful and  which  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  are  sincere. But I would be  failing  in  my\r\n\r\nduty,  Sir,  if I permitted my appreciation  of  those\r\n\r\nacts of courtesy to deter me from giving the House the\r\n\r\nfacts as I believe them. The story that you have heard\r\n\r\nis  that  this  violence arose out of a dispute  of  a\r\n\r\nvital  nature  essential for  the  survival  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar and every  one\r\n\r\nof  his colleagues know the facts. Although originally\r\n\r\nso,  the dispute did not, in fact, pursue those  lines\r\n\r\nas   it  developed,  and  although,  I  believe,   the\r\n\r\ngrievances   of  the  dismissed  men  were  legitimate\r\n\r\ngrievances,  as  indicated by  my  action  in  forcing\r\n\r\nthrough   a   solution   very  favourable   to   their\r\n\r\ngrievances,  their  act in parking themselves  outside\r\n\r\nthe  gates  and  giving physical  obstruction  to  the\r\n\r\npassage of the buses was knowingly a criminal act, and\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  he  says  that,  \"I am in  agreement  with  this\r\n\r\npassive  resistance,\" is, in fact, suggesting that  he\r\n\r\nis  in  agreement with processes which  he  knows  are\r\n\r\ncontrary to the law. That is important in so far as he\r\n\r\nis  concerned, Sir, but not in so far as  the  workers\r\n\r\nare  concerned. The workers' interests, when they vary\r\n\r\nwith the law - they do not always understand the law - but\r\n\r\nI think it should be appreciated at this juncture that\r\n\r\nwe  were  in this Chamber on the 27th when  there  was\r\n\r\nthat  charge, without our knowledge, that  morning  at\r\n\r\nthe  gates of Hock Lee Bus Company in pursuance of the\r\n\r\nrequest of the management to clear the gates and allow\r\n\r\ntheir  buses their lawful right to proceed;  that,  on\r\n\r\nthe  27th,  Sir, a court of inquiry was  appointed  to\r\n\r\ninquire  into  all  the  matters  in  dispute  between\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  labour,  and that  responsible  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  and  responsible workers with  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ncivic  consciousness, who are aware of their  duty  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  as  well as to the trade union  movement,\r\n\r\nwould  have  abided  in patience the  result  of  that\r\n\r\ninquiry. And I have not the slightest doubt, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe man we have appointed, whom the workers themselves\r\n\r\nrespect,  may  have come to some similar  solution  to\r\n\r\nthat  which I, under the pressure of the tragedy which\r\n\r\nhad  occurred, had to bulldoze through in  four  hours\r\n\r\nwith  the  assistance  of the counsel  for  the  three\r\n\r\nparties  concerned, including the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  But that was a procedure which, as the  leader\r\n\r\nof  the Progressive Party put it, short-circuited  the\r\n\r\nlaw  and  short-circuited the due process of the  law,\r\n\r\nand  a  procedure which every responsible  person  and\r\n\r\nevery responsible trade unionist should deplore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from appointing a court of inquiry, Sir,\r\n\r\nperhaps  wrongly I went down myself seeking, with  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of my colleague the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock), some solution,\r\n\r\nand the workers' statement was, \"We know it is against\r\n\r\nthe  law,  but  it  is  not fair  that  we  should  be\r\n\r\nprohibited from working and earning our living, whilst\r\n\r\nthey  are  allowed to make profits.\" Sir, I have  said\r\n\r\nthat  seemed logical enough, although the law did  not\r\n\r\nsupport it. But let us say this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the management that has been attacked repeatedly,\r\n\r\nand  I do not say attacked without justice - but let  us\r\n\r\nsay   this   for   the  management  which   co-operated\r\n\r\nvaliantly,    with   considerable   restraint,    with\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  its  efforts  to  maintain  law.   The\r\n\r\nmanagement  said, \"Very well, we will reinstate  these\r\n\r\nmen,  without prejudice, and pay them in  full,  until\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  and findings  of  the  court  of\r\n\r\ninquiry are made.\" So, Sir, from that moment when they\r\n\r\nwere to be reinstated, without prejudice, their salary\r\n\r\nto  be  paid, their grievances looked into by a court,\r\n\r\nthere  did  not  any longer exist any question  of  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  character, let alone a question  vital  to\r\n\r\ntrade unionism which required the continuation of that\r\n\r\nphysical obstruction contrary to the law. Let  us  get\r\n\r\nthat  straight,  everyone of us.  The  hon.  Gentleman\r\n\r\nopposite, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  has  one\r\n\r\nthing  in common with Lord Nelson. It is said of  Lord\r\n\r\nNelson, Sir, that at a certain naval battle his  staff\r\n\r\ncaptain  said,  \"The  Admiral  is  ordering   you   to\r\n\r\nretreat,\"  and Nelson put his telescope to  his  blind\r\n\r\neye and said, \"I cannot see that signal. Proceed!\" The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member opposite has an extraordinary capacity - an\r\n\r\nextraordinary capacity, I repeat - for turning  a  blind\r\n\r\neye to unpleasant facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was ingenuously quite shaken by the refusal of the\r\n\r\nBus Workers' Union to accept this reinstatement, their\r\n\r\ngrim  dislike of the idea of a settlement; and then  I\r\n\r\nrealised,  Sir,  that we were on the 29th  April,  and\r\n\r\nfrom   various  other  items  of  information  at   my\r\n\r\ndisposal,  this  was obviously the  hard  core  of  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  work  up  a  demonstration - a  test  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  party's own strength for the time  when  it\r\n\r\nmay  have  to  use  it - an intention  to  have  a  mass\r\n\r\ndemonstration so successful in character that it would\r\n\r\nsnowball  its  own membership campaign. And  this  was\r\n\r\nconfirmed  by  strikes that grew like  mushrooms,  all\r\n\r\nunder  the  control of individuals within  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fairness, I would like to say this openly as\r\n\r\nan  individual. I personally accept unhesitatingly the\r\n\r\nassurance  of  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  opposite\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  not a Communist. I accept  that  without\r\n\r\nreservation. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  accept  the assurance that he is working  for  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  non-Communist Malaya. And I say,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsay   with   respect   to   him - he   is   a   man   of\r\n\r\nintelligence - that  he is allowing himself  to  be  the\r\n\r\ncat's-paw of forces which he knows to be evil. He,  in\r\n\r\nhis  hunger for popularity, in his desire to  maintain\r\n\r\nintact this organisation which he has helped to build,\r\n\r\nin  his  desire to destroy colonialism - he  is  working\r\n\r\nwith forces that he knows are evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had these remarks about Government seeking to\r\n\r\nstir up anti-Communist hysteria. This is not hysteria.\r\n\r\nThese  are  facts. Singapore is a political  balancing\r\n\r\npoint  of Asia today. I love Malaya, Sir, as  much  as\r\n\r\nany  man in this House, and I am working for a  Malaya\r\n\r\nthat  will  not be a satellite of England  or  of  any\r\n\r\nother  nation in the world. And I am appealing now  to\r\n\r\npersons  who  are honest, to persons who are  genuine,\r\n\r\nand to persons who are able, to open their eyes to the\r\n\r\nevils within their own camp. You cannot have one  foot\r\n\r\nin  the  Communist camp and one foot in the democratic\r\n\r\ncamp. You must come out frankly, and this is the  time\r\n\r\nto  come  out because, Sir, they must be conscious - the\r\n\r\ngentlemen  across the floor - that they  did,  in  fact,\r\n\r\npermit their organisation to be utilised fully for the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  manoeuvrings workers into  an  emotional\r\n\r\ndemonstration for 1st May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismissed workers at Hock Lee Bus Company taunted\r\n\r\nand  provoked  the police day after day. The  students\r\n\r\npassing  police  stations were most insulting  to  the\r\n\r\npolice  in  the hope that there would be at least  one\r\n\r\nincident  out of which capital could be  made  on  1st\r\n\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One newspaper editorial said that they were tired of\r\n\r\nhearing about commendable restraint. They may be,  but\r\n\r\nI   will  repeat  it - it  is  because  of  Government's\r\n\r\nrestraint that the tragedies which we saw on Thursday,\r\n\r\n12th May, did not occur on May 1. It was then planned,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  test  this strength which may ultimately  be\r\n\r\nused    for    the   overthrow   of   the   democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment - and the cat's-paws, I will name  them:  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, the poor workers of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhose legitimate grievances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  exploited; and I will show you  how.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   opposite -   trade   unionists   and    legal\r\n\r\nadvisers - were deluding this House into believing  that\r\n\r\nit  is  a  vital question of 'yellow' unions that  has\r\n\r\nbrought  about  this dispute. Let  me  read  to  you  a\r\n\r\nstatement  by  a  gentleman  whom  the  P.A.P. should\r\n\r\nrecognise, in a paper published yesterday.  Sir,  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee Suan, whom I think the P.A.P. knows very well - one\r\n\r\nof  its men - as Secretary of the Singapore Bus Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion, published in the Nanyang Siang Pao and the Sin\r\n\r\nChew' Jit Pao of yesterday's date - what does he say was\r\n\r\nthe  cause of this trouble? Would the P.A.P. take  his\r\n\r\nword for it? He is one of their apostles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We would like to point out\" - this release is in the\r\n\r\nname  of  the  Singapore Bus Workers  Union - after  the\r\n\r\nsettlement, Sir, when they had gained\r\n\r\nso much -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We would like to point out that the bloodshed and\r\n\r\nrioting resulting from the present case was occasioned\r\n\r\nentirely by acts of violence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the principle of right to collective bargaining,\r\n\r\nnot  the  principle  that 'yellow'  unions  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntolerated in a healthy trade union movement, but \"acts\r\n\r\nof violence\" - just imagine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Instead of showing sympathy for the Hock Lee Bus\r\n\r\nworkers,  who were dismissed on pretext for no  reason\r\n\r\nby   their   employer,  the  authorities,  under   the\r\n\r\nprotection   of   the  unreasonable   Trade   Disputes\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  applied  corporal  punishment  thrice   on\r\n\r\nutterly defence - less workers peacefully seeking their\r\n\r\nown survival.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that is false, but that is exactly how the\r\n\r\nemotions  of  the workers were roused by hon.  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  and  their colleagues, and  by  those  other\r\n\r\ncat's-paws - our  deluded  and idealistic  students.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  true? Is it? Were they peaceful strikers seeking\r\n\r\ntheir own survival? Could they not wait one week until\r\n\r\nthe  court  of inquiry had made its findings?  Was  it\r\n\r\nessential that four should die? Was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that violence should be held\r\n\r\nresponsible - violence - and that is the plea,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nno striker can resist. The workers of this country are\r\n\r\nresponsible people, but they are mainly illiterate  in\r\n\r\nany language - I will not speak of English only - and when\r\n\r\nyou go to them and you say, \"Solidarity of the workers\r\n\r\nde-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmands  that  you  stand up and spit at Government  for\r\n\r\nviolently  attacking  peaceful workers  seeking  their\r\n\r\nsurvival,\" naturally they rise in anger. Only you know\r\n\r\nthat  that was not true; that Government did  not  use\r\n\r\nviolence  against  peaceful  strikers  seeking   their\r\n\r\nsurvival. That was not true. But that is how  emotions\r\n\r\nwere worked up and ultimately, Sir, the incident which\r\n\r\nwas sought was capitalised for this other day, which I\r\n\r\nunderstand  in  the Communist calendar  is  known  as\r\n\r\n\"Five  One Three\" - the 13th of May, the Day of  Chinese\r\n\r\nStudent  Heroes. That was what it was being worked  up\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received from trade unions under the control\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. insulting ultimata which no responsible\r\n\r\nperson, no honest trade unionist could tolerate.  They\r\n\r\nknow - the people may not know\r\n\r\n- that they have placed at strategic points in many  of\r\n\r\nthese  trade unions men who are not workers, and  have\r\n\r\nnever been workers in the sense that they work in  the\r\n\r\nunions,  in  the  work  which  those  unions  seek  to\r\n\r\nprotect.  They  have placed students and outsiders - who\r\n\r\nnow  control them - not for the welfare of the  workers,\r\n\r\nbut  working  through the welfare of  the  workers  at\r\n\r\ntimes, with but one object - utilisation of those people\r\n\r\nfor political ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the hon. Gentleman for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) statesmanlike words\r\n\r\ntoday,  about how he regrets this violence and how  it\r\n\r\nis  unhealthy for all labour - and he is very right. We\r\n\r\nmust  all be conscious, Sir, that the events  of  the,\r\n\r\npast few days have meant a tremendous setback to many\r\n\r\nof  our aspirations, have destroyed to a large extent\r\n\r\nthe goodwill we had with the Federation, and the hopes\r\n\r\nwe  had  of  union with the Federation. Their  present\r\n\r\nattitude  is - and  let  us get it  clear - \"We  are  glad\r\n\r\nSingapore is no part of us. Singapore is going to be a\r\n\r\nRed  enclave, and we are well rid of it.\" That is what\r\n\r\nhas been achieved, and I think the P.A.P. - with respect\r\n\r\nto my friends and thanks for their courtesy - the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  its  defence today in omitting the truth, glossing\r\n\r\nover  certain facts and presenting them to you on  the\r\n\r\nbasis that this was noth-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ning but a perfectly legitimate dispute in respect of a\r\n\r\nvital trade union matter, have proved their own guilt.\r\n\r\nI  do not know, Sir, whether you have noticed in those\r\n\r\nmasterly  omissions  from the hon. Gentlemen  opposite\r\n\r\nhow  careful  they have been to avoid  mentioning  the\r\n\r\nschools  and the part that the students of the  middle\r\n\r\nschools played in this tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newspaper editorial today, Sir, I read these\r\n\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The threat of the middle school students is to the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  Singapore.  Their  capacity  to  provoke\r\n\r\nviolence  and their obvious subservience to disruptive\r\n\r\nforces has become evident in the riots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it must have been evident to the hon. Gentlemen\r\n\r\nopposite, so closely related with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while representatives of labour and management\r\n\r\nand  Government  achieved a  solution  with  the  full\r\n\r\nco-operation  on  Saturday of the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  and  the hon. Member behind him (Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong),  let us remember that, Sir, it was  not  in  a\r\n\r\nmoment  of  elation that I thanked them for their  co-operation  that day, but because I have at  all  times\r\n\r\nbeen  prone to gratitude for that which is helpful  at\r\n\r\nthe moment, whatever the reason that has inspired that\r\n\r\nhelp.  Although we recognise that, we must  not  blind\r\n\r\nourselves  to the fact that there is in this territory\r\n\r\na  small  group  of  people who seek  to  destroy  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process by, shall we put it in the words of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Gentleman  opposite,  \"seeking  to  destroy\r\n\r\ncolonialism\",  and  have found ready  tools  in  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen,  and  through  them  in  the  schools,  and\r\n\r\nthrough the schools in the Chinese newspapers,  for  a\r\n\r\nprocedure  which would not bring about self-government\r\n\r\nfor  this  territory, but which would forever  destroy\r\n\r\nany  hopes of independence. The hon. Member  says,  \"I\r\n\r\nhave no faith in the Labour Front as a vehicle of  its\r\n\r\nplatform.\" Fair enough, Sir. He says, \"I have no  faith\r\n\r\nin the British and do not believe they will keep their\r\n\r\npromise until we compel them to.\" Very good, Sir.  But\r\n\r\nhe  forgets, when he says, \"I will not - \" - what are  his\r\n\r\nwords? - \"I  will  not  fight Communism  to  preserve  a\r\n\r\ncolonial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya.\" If he permits, or co-operates with the  blind\r\n\r\nNelsonian eye in Communism's fight to control  Malaya,\r\n\r\nhe  will  never, ever, have the chance  of  having  an\r\n\r\nindependent Malaya. Many people and many nations which\r\n\r\nhave  been satellites of England are now independent.\r\n\r\nI  ask  hon. Members opposite to try and think of  one\r\n\r\nsingle  nation  which,  having  been  a  satellite  of\r\n\r\nCommunism, has managed to escape those clutches.  One!\r\n\r\nName  me  one! If we allow this territory, because  of\r\n\r\nyour  desire to destroy colonialism, if we  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith Communism, once we are in their clutches, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  merely  out of the frying pan, we are right  into\r\n\r\nthe fire. Is that what they want?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P., which consists of responsible, decent,\r\n\r\nhonest men - many of them - if they would purge themselves\r\n\r\nof the Communists and fellow-travellers that they know\r\n\r\nthey   have,   if   they   would   face   their    own\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  they could be the  organisation  that\r\n\r\nthey  hope to be that would one day lead this  country\r\n\r\nto  win its independence. But along the road that they\r\n\r\nhave  so  far  chosen lies chaos and  misery  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, and they should face it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of - I must say a few words, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nsubject of Chinese schools. Others may avoid it, but I\r\n\r\nmust say a few words even though the division is at  4\r\n\r\no'clock, and it is this: That this Government believes\r\n\r\nin  the decency and the worth of the great mass of our\r\n\r\nyouth  and  their potential; that we  believe  a  tiny\r\n\r\ngroup,  which  does  not stop  at  murder,  has  given\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Chinese schools of Singapore  a  bad\r\n\r\nname throughout the world. This small group has struck\r\n\r\nat  the heart of Chinese education. Students have been\r\n\r\nintimidated,  coerced; and so have their  parents  and\r\n\r\ntheir  principals  and their teachers.  Students  have\r\n\r\nbeen  driven from class-rooms to the streets.  Parents\r\n\r\nfear for their children's safety and for their own, if\r\n\r\nthey  seek  to deter their children from participation\r\n\r\nin these vicious activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our primary duty as a Government to protect\r\n\r\nChinese  education in Singapore, and we intend  to  do\r\n\r\nit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether you cry destruction of Chinese culture or  no.\r\n\r\nI  am not an expert on Chinese culture, I admit to the\r\n\r\nhon.

We  have\r\n\r\nclosed  these, Sir, it has been said, two schools.  We\r\n\r\nhave  not  closed  them. We have  indicated  to  their\r\n\r\ntrustees  that we are extremely dissatisfied with  the\r\n\r\nexisting position, and suggested that they be  closed.\r\n\r\nThat suggestion has been accepted, and the question is\r\n\r\nnow  for us, Sir, quite frankly if they do not  accept\r\n\r\nthat  suggestion, there are methods of procedure  that\r\n\r\nwe  can employ, and will employ. We will not evade our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. Now we are in process  of  examining\r\n\r\nto what extent it is necessary to reorganise either or\r\n\r\nboth  of  those  schools, so that the schools  may  be\r\n\r\nreturned     to     their    primary     object     of\r\n\r\neducation - education  in  the  arts  of  life,  not  in\r\n\r\nthuggery and intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I close, I, who have been known for many\r\n\r\nyears  as a violent antagonist of the Police Force  of\r\n\r\nthis  colony - and  I  say now I think  with  right  and\r\n\r\njustice every time I attacked them - I would like to say\r\n\r\nthis:  that  from  all reports at my  disposal,  I  am\r\n\r\namazed   and   deeply  impressed  by   the   wonderful\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and the magnificent manner in  which  they\r\n\r\nperformed their duty in a ghastly time.

Our only thoughts were for the safety, security\r\n\r\nand  happiness of Singapore, and we would  never  have\r\n\r\nadded  to  all  the  uncertainties and  commotion  of\r\n\r\nhaving to change a government during these troublesome\r\n\r\ntimes  when death was in the streets just a few nights\r\n\r\nago, and we know that the trouble may not yet be over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were on the point of issuing to the Press a denial\r\n\r\nthat  there  was such an approach, and it is  a  great\r\n\r\npity  that  the Chief Minister has chosen  to  believe\r\n\r\nlies  before he has made proper inquiries. I would  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment ask him to name the persons whom we  have\r\n\r\napproached, either on this side of the House or on his\r\n\r\nside  of the House, to join us to form a coalition  to\r\n\r\ntopple his Government. I do not want to belabour  this\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir. If  there was any  doubt  in  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  mind, this doubt should have been  removed\r\n\r\nthis  morning when our spokesman for the  day  assured\r\n\r\nhim  that  our Party would stand by the Government  in\r\n\r\nits  efforts  to  maintain public  order  and  we  are\r\n\r\nwilling not to taunt him any more if he does not carry\r\n\r\nout some of the impossible promises his Party made  in\r\n\r\ntheir election platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I have no wish to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection (4)\r\n\r\nof  section  4 of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1948  (No.  17  of 1948), as amended by the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948  (No.  39  of\r\n\r\n1948)   and   the  Emergency  Regulations  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1951  (No. 9 of 1951)  resolves  that  the\r\n\r\nEmergency (Amendment No. 2) Regulations, 1955, made on\r\n\r\nthe   13th   day  of  May,  1955,  and  published   as\r\n\r\nNotification  No. S 143 in the Gazette Supplement  No.\r\n\r\n38  of 13th May, 1955, as contained in Sessional Paper\r\n\r\nNo. S.L. 10 of 1955, shall continue in force until the\r\n\r\nexpiration or revocation of any Proclamation extending\r\n\r\nthe  period of the Proclamation of Emergency published\r\n\r\nas  Notification  No. S 219 in the Gazette  Supplement\r\n\r\nNo. 50 of 26th July, 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 27; Noes, Nil; Abstentions, 3.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    Ayes                                Noes\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat.
