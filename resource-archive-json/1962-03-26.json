The\r\n\r\ntarget  date for this takeover is 1st January, 1963.  In\r\n\r\norder  to maintain an efficient service when the  pilots\r\n\r\nare employed by the Port Authority, it is estimated that\r\n\r\nit will be necessary to employ 35 pilots. The Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board, as the forerunner of the  proposed  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority,  has  since October last year  recruited  and\r\n\r\ntrained 17 pilots, of whom 14 have already been licensed\r\n\r\nby  the  Pilot Board. These pilots are directly employed\r\n\r\nby  the  Harbour Board, and by the time of the takeover,\r\n\r\nall  pilots,  including those pilots  at  present  self-employed and who elect to remain in service, will be  in\r\n\r\nthe employ of the Harbour Board or the Port Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, which deals\r\n\r\nwith  pilotage, does not provide for any  limitation  of\r\n\r\nliability  for loss or damage occasioned by any  act  or\r\n\r\ndefault of a pilot whilst engaged in his duties; neither\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Ordinance provide protection front  liability\r\n\r\nfor  the  pilot's  employment. Now  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board is employing pilots, it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\namend  the  Merchant Shipping Ordinance to  protect  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board and the pilots it employs from claims  for\r\n\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parts of the world, pilotage authorities\r\n\r\nemploying  pilots are covered either by  being  able  to\r\n\r\nlimit their liability or by exempting themselves of  any\r\n\r\nliability, in  the  United Kingdom, this  liability  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to \u00a3100 multiplied by the number of  pilots  in\r\n\r\nthe  pilotage  district. The Bombay Port  Trust  is  not\r\n\r\nliable  to  pay  any damages. The pilots in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  are  enabled  by  legislation  to  limit  their\r\n\r\npersonal liability to \u00a3100 plus the pilotage fee for the\r\n\r\nship involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is therefore designed to enable a harbour\r\n\r\npilot  to  put  up  a bond of $1,000  and  his  personal\r\n\r\nliability shall be limited to that amount and the amount\r\n\r\npayable  to him for piloting the vessel.

The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board operates  and  maintains  the\r\n\r\nState's  internal telephone system, and Cable & Wireless\r\n\r\nLtd, operate and maintain a submarine cable  and  radio\r\n\r\ncircuits    associated   with   the   intra-Commonwealth\r\n\r\ntelegraph service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable & Wireless Ltd, operate in Singapore under the\r\n\r\nfollowing three licenses all of which are due to  expire\r\n\r\non 31st December, 1962:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Landing Licence issued in January 1939 permits\r\n\r\nthe Company \"to maintain, renew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  use  on  and  along the shore and bed  of  the  sea\r\n\r\nspecified  submarine telegraph cables at  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nPenang (and also at Cocos Islands and Labuan).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Cable Licence issued in November 1940\r\n\r\ncovers   the  use  of  underground  cables  inter-connecting   the   Company's   installations    in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Penang and Labuan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Wireless Telegraphic Licence issued in\r\n\r\nDecember  1953 authorises the Company to establish\r\n\r\nwireless telegraphy circuits between Singapore and\r\n\r\nplaces  listed  in the Schedule  attached  to  the\r\n\r\nLicence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the licences of Cable & Wireless Ltd, expire at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  this  year, we have to  reach  a  decision\r\n\r\nwhether  a  new lease should be given to the Company  or\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government should take over the assets  and\r\n\r\nfunctions of the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communications system of any country is one of its\r\n\r\nmost   vital   assets  and  this  aspect  is  especially\r\n\r\nimportant  in  respect  of  external  communications.  A\r\n\r\nnatural development is for independent or self-governing\r\n\r\ncountries  to  acquire  the  control  of  the   nation's\r\n\r\ncommunication  facilities  in  order  to  develop   such\r\n\r\nfacilities    in   accordance   with   the    countries'\r\n\r\nrequirements and also to maintain the prestige value  of\r\n\r\nthe  external  communications. Furthermore,  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndesirable     or    efficient    that    the     State's\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  services  should   be   run   by   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  department on the one  hand  and  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany   on  the  other.  It  was  therefore  not   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention that Cable &  Wireless  licences\r\n\r\nshould  be  renewed  on their expiry on  31st  December,\r\n\r\n1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it was realised that because of the\r\n\r\nlarge  initial capital outlay involved and the  shortage\r\n\r\nof   experienced  engineers  and  managerial  staff   in\r\n\r\nGovernment service, it was not expedient at this  moment\r\n\r\nto acquire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutright  the  assets  of  Cable  &  Wireless  Ltd, in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or  to take over the existing functions  and\r\n\r\norganisation of the Company. It was estimated  that  the\r\n\r\nassets   of   the  Company  in  Singapore  amounted   to\r\n\r\napproximately  $8\u00bc million. It was  therefore  decided\r\n\r\nthat  the best arrangement would be to merge the  assets\r\n\r\nof  the Telecommunications Department, which amounted to\r\n\r\napproximately  the same value, with  those  of  Cable  &\r\n\r\nWireless Ltd, and to form a statutory board to take over\r\n\r\nthe  combined assets and the existing functions  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo organisations. This statutory Board will be known as\r\n\r\nthe \"Singapore Overseas Telecommunications Board\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed integration will not involve the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in a large capital outlay as  would  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  if  the  assets  of Cable  &  Wireless  Ltd, were\r\n\r\npurchased  outright. It is estimated that  approximately\r\n\r\n$300,000  only will be required as Government's  capital\r\n\r\ncontribution towards the Board's initial expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This partnership with Cable & Wireless Ltd, is to last\r\n\r\nten  years,  after which the Government  will  have  the\r\n\r\noption   to   terminate  or  vary  the  joint  ownership\r\n\r\narrangement  by  giving  two  years'  prior  notice   in\r\n\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that Government will own 51 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the  undertakings of the Board and the Company  will\r\n\r\nown  the  remaining 49 per cent. Thus,  Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  control  over the activities of  the  Board.  This\r\n\r\ncontrol by Government is further emphasised in that  the\r\n\r\nBill  provides that the Chairman and two members of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  will be appointed by the Government and that  the\r\n\r\nCompany  will appoint the remaining two members  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 relate to the transfer of officers of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Telecommunications  Department  and  of\r\n\r\nCable  &  Wireless  Company to the new statutory  Board.\r\n\r\nThis  process of transferring personnel is a complicated\r\n\r\noperation  as  the salary and terms of  service  in  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  departments have to be considered.  If  there\r\n\r\nare two separate salary scales and terms of service for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  staff  of the proposed statutory Board, it  can  be\r\n\r\neasily  imagined the difficulties which the  Board  will\r\n\r\nrun into. There will be difficulty in equating status of\r\n\r\nstaff,  and  at the same time differences  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nservice  will engender dissatisfaction among  the  staff\r\n\r\nthemselves. It is therefore necessary that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  a unified salary scheme and terms of service for all\r\n\r\nmembers of the proposed statutory Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 is therefore so worded as to permit\r\n\r\ndiscussions between the Board and staff members  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Telecommunications Department and  the  staff\r\n\r\nmembers of Cable & Wireless Company. The broad object is\r\n\r\nthat  such  staff  shall  not suffer  in  their  overall\r\n\r\nconditions of service by reason of transfer, but  regard\r\n\r\nto  be  had  with  the  conditions  of  service  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees at the time of transfer.  In  this\r\n\r\nway we hope a reasonable compromise can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 has the intention to train national staff\r\n\r\nprogressively  to take over more responsible  work  with\r\n\r\nthe  object  of  replacing  expatriate  staff.  Suitable\r\n\r\nnationals  will  be  given the  opportunity  to  undergo\r\n\r\ntechnical  training  in  the  United  Kingdom   at   the\r\n\r\nPorthcurno  School of Cable and Wireless Ltd, or  other\r\n\r\nsuitable   technical   institutions   and   to    attend\r\n\r\nadministrative courses at the Company's head  office  in\r\n\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Sir, we are generally in\r\n\r\nfavour of the principles outlined in the Bill except  in\r\n\r\none respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has said that in regard to the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  the  present  employees  of  Cable  & Wireless  Ltd,\r\n\r\nto the Government service there might  be some  difficulty  over\r\n\r\nthe terms of service  and  salary scales.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the wording of clause 9 gives rise to such fears because -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  think it is only proper that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  give  an undertaking that no one will  suffer  a\r\n\r\nloss as a result of this transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"as near as may be to those they had previously\r\n\r\nenjoyed\"  does not necessarily mean that the  new  terms\r\n\r\nare  going to be even identical. I believe it is grossly\r\n\r\nunfair to tell these employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they have no choice but to be transferred, and that\r\n\r\ntoo on terms which may be less favourable. I submit that\r\n\r\n\"as  near as may be\" is frightfully vague. I am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that no locally engaged officer should have  his\r\n\r\nremuneration  or other terms changed to his disadvantage\r\n\r\nby  a transfer of this nature. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nintention  of Government is to effect comparable  terms,\r\n\r\nbut  clause 9 as it stands now gives ample room for  one\r\n\r\nto  believe  that locally engaged staff will have  their\r\n\r\nterms   changed  to  their  disadvantage   on   becoming\r\n\r\nemployees of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the employees to ensure  that  they  will\r\n\r\nincur  no  loss.  I hope the Government appreciates  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  in  effecting transfers  of  this  nature.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  has  an  obligation  to  guarantee  locally\r\n\r\nengaged  staff  that  they shall be transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  only  on  terms that will not be less  favourable\r\n\r\nthan those which are in force at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the\r\n\r\namendment  because, as the clause stands, there  is  not\r\n\r\nonly room for doubt but a possibility for those who  are\r\n\r\ntrying to adjust the salaries to fix lower salaries than\r\n\r\nthose prevailing at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"as near as may be\", Sir, may mean not up to or\r\n\r\nbeyond, but under. Now, people framing salary scales are\r\n\r\nvery  fond of round figures and naturally when, in round\r\n\r\nfigures,  the salary of the present employee goes  down,\r\n\r\nno  doubt  from the point of view of the man  who  wants\r\n\r\ntidy  figures it looks fine, but from the point of  view\r\n\r\nof  the employee he feels that he has been given  a  bad\r\n\r\nturn. I am sure the amount involved is so small that the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  desiring  to  have  the  goodwill  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers,  will not in any way make them feel  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  penalised by the transfer.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, when he says that in the transfer\r\n\r\nthe present employees should not suffer, surely would be\r\n\r\nglad to accept this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I must explain why the\r\n\r\nwords  \"no less favourable than\" have been left  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  clause and replaced by \"as near as may be to\".  In\r\n\r\nthe  original draft of the Bill, I myself suggested that\r\n\r\nthe  phrase  \"no less favourable than\" be  used  in  the\r\n\r\nclause.  Subsequently the Government  side  had  several\r\n\r\ndiscussions with Cable & Wireless Ltd, and we discovered\r\n\r\nthat  if the words \"no less favourable than\" were  used,\r\n\r\nin  effect the new statutory Board would be placed in  a\r\n\r\npredicament, for the reason that you would have a salary\r\n\r\nscale  for  Government employees who are transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  new  Board  and another salary scale  for  Cable  &\r\n\r\nWireless employees transferred to the new Board,  and  a\r\n\r\nthird  salary  scale  for new employees.  Now,  for  any\r\n\r\nstatutory  Board or any single employer  to  have  three\r\n\r\ndifferent  rates of pay for its employees  is  obviously\r\n\r\nnot  feasible. That is exactly what the Board  would  be\r\n\r\nlanded with if the words \"no less favourable than\"  were\r\n\r\nused  in  clause  9.  Therefore, it is  obvious  that  a\r\n\r\ncompromise  has  to be achieved and this  compromise  is\r\n\r\nattained by inserting the words \"as near as may be\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give the undertaking that discussions with the staff\r\n\r\nof both the Government Telecommunications Department and\r\n\r\nthe  staff of Cable & Wireless Ltd, will be held so that\r\n\r\nthe  terms  arrived  at  for transfer  will  be  to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of all parties. It is not the intention  of\r\n\r\nthis  clause to do the workers in. Far from it. In fact,\r\n\r\nmay  I  point  out  that when the Oriental  Telephone  &\r\n\r\nElectric Co. Ltd, was converted into a statutory  Board,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Telephone Board, the terms of transfer  of\r\n\r\nthe  staff  of this Company to the Telephone Board  were\r\n\r\nworded  similarly - \"shall be deemed to be an officer  of\r\n\r\nthe Board at the same rate of pay and as near as may  be\r\n\r\non the same conditions as those on which he was employed\r\n\r\nby  the  Company\"? Now in the case of  the  transfer  of\r\n\r\npersonnel  from the O.T.E.C. to the Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard, the exercise is relatively simple because  it  is\r\n\r\njust merely transferring bodies from one department to a\r\n\r\nnew department. In other words, it is just a question of\r\n\r\nchange of name. But in the formation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Telecommunications Board, we have  an  exercise\r\n\r\nwhere   staff  from  two  different  bodies  are   being\r\n\r\nintegrated and unfortunately the salary scales for these\r\n\r\ntwo  departments  vary - they are  not  exactly  equal - and\r\n\r\ntherefore a happy mean will have to be struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in respect of drafting, I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Thomson has failed to read on  from\r\n\r\nwhere  he left off in this clause. Clause 9 states  that\r\n\r\nthe  employees who are transferred \"shall be transferred\r\n\r\nto  the service of the Board on terms as near as may  be\r\n\r\nto  those  they had previously enjoyed and  such  terms,\r\n\r\nwhich shall be determined by the Board, shall take  into\r\n\r\naccount  salaries and conditions of service  enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nsuch officers when in the employ of the Government or of\r\n\r\nthe  Company.\" So that, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Board will\r\n\r\nbe under an obligation to take into account the salaries\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by  the officers in Government at the  time  of\r\n\r\ntheir transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am not a lawyer but I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  cases  have  failed  because  of  some\r\n\r\ntechnicality. Now, the wording to anybody here is clear,\r\n\r\nthat  \"as near as may be\" may be as near from the bottom\r\n\r\nor  as  near from the top. And it can be interpreted  by\r\n\r\nwhoever  draws  up the salary scales that  it  does  not\r\n\r\npreclude  that  \"being as near from  the  bottom\"  means\r\n\r\nless. No doubt the Deputy Prime Minister has given us an\r\n\r\nassurance,  but the interpretation of the clause  as  it\r\n\r\nstands does not preclude the wrong interpretation  later\r\n\r\non.

Now,\r\n\r\nobviously he has not got a good start because in dealing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  this  question of future terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice of the Board, he starts off with something  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is out to do the workers in, that if  we\r\n\r\nwant to equate it, we would not equate it by taking  all\r\n\r\nthe  terms together but what we want to do is to pay the\r\n\r\nchap just a few dollars less than what he is entitled to\r\n\r\nget. I mean this is really too childish an approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine that it is stated that the staff\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the Board shall receive  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  no  less favourable than they are now  getting.\r\n\r\nLet  us  look  at  the  implications  of  that  sort  of\r\n\r\nundertaking. Now, some of these persons are  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunications Department, Divisions I, II, III\r\n\r\nand  so  on. One of the purposes of office in Government\r\n\r\nis  entitlement to holiday bungalows at low cost. If you\r\n\r\nwant to say no less favourable terms than what they  are\r\n\r\nenjoying,  then the Board would be required  to  put  up\r\n\r\nholiday  bungalows  on a scale and  at  places  no  less\r\n\r\nlavish  than  those which the Government  is  providing.\r\n\r\nThen  there are other conditions such as leave,  pension\r\n\r\nrights, and so on. It is not possible in respect of each\r\n\r\nand  every  item to give the employees  who  are  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred treatment no less favourable than what  they\r\n\r\nare  getting now without the Board being committed to  a\r\n\r\ntremendous amount of capital expenditure. And  not  only\r\n\r\nthat. The staff of Cable & Wireless Ltd, may be enjoying\r\n\r\ncertain perquisites which the Government officers do not\r\n\r\nget  and  which the Government are required,  after  the\r\n\r\ntransfer,  to give to their staff. If you  give  to  one\r\n\r\nsection of the staff, you must give to everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the test to be applied whether or not fair play has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  is  whether  taking  overall  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  justice has not been done. I say  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary  for  Members of the Opposition  to  pretend\r\n\r\nthat the Government is out to do the workers in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may perhaps briefly refer to another integration\r\n\r\nexercise,  i.e.,  the integration of  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nstaff into the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice. We did give an undertaking  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  transferred on terms no less  favourable  than\r\n\r\nwhat  they  were then enjoying. And this has  meant,  in\r\n\r\npractice,  that  the  former City Council  staff  remain\r\n\r\nexactly  on their old salary scales, on their old  terms\r\n\r\nof  service,  and integration is only an  organisational\r\n\r\none - in  the sense that they are put into some  positions\r\n\r\nin   the   hierarchy   of   Ministries.   But   complete\r\n\r\nintegration, i.e., in the sense of having one  identical\r\n\r\nsalary   scale  for  all  officers  whether  they   were\r\n\r\noriginally in the Government or in the City Council,  is\r\n\r\nnot possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council was formerly a Government department,\r\n\r\nand   although   there  were  divergences   of   working\r\n\r\nconditions  between the City Council and the Government,\r\n\r\nthey  were not of such a major order of magnitude as  to\r\n\r\ncreate  insoluble problems. But in the case of a private\r\n\r\ncompany - although  I  have not  examined  in  detail  the\r\n\r\nworking  conditions in both Cable and Wireless Ltd, and\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunications Department - I  say  it  would  be\r\n\r\nquite  impossible in respect of each and every grade  of\r\n\r\nstaff  to  have treatment no less favourable  than  what\r\n\r\nthey  are getting now. All that we can aim for is  that,\r\n\r\ntaking all conditions of service together, they get fair\r\n\r\ntreatment. More than this, I think, we cannot  guarantee\r\n\r\nthem.  But  less  than this, we in  the  Government  can\r\n\r\nassure that they will not get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand why the Minister should say that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  pretends that the Government is  out  to  do\r\n\r\ndamage. The Opposition is not pretending. The Opposition\r\n\r\nknows for a fact that the Government has done damage  to\r\n\r\nits  civil servants, and, therefore, the Opposition does\r\n\r\nnot  rely  on  any assurance given by the Government  in\r\n\r\nregard to any dealing by the Government of any employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a very important point in trade unionism\r\n\r\nthat,  in any transfer from one service to another,  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service  shall be  no  less  favourable.\r\n\r\nSurely,  if  the Government says that we are  pretending\r\n\r\nthat  it is out to do damage and that it sincerely  does\r\n\r\nnot want to do damage, then why all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis opposition to this amendment, which only means that\r\n\r\nthe  terms  and conditions of service shall be  no  less\r\n\r\nfavourable than what they have had before? The  Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that  it  is  not possible for  employees  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to continue to receive privileges of bungalow\r\n\r\nfacilities  and what not, and that in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nCable  and  Wireless employees, there might be employees\r\n\r\nwho  are being given certain conditions of service which\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  acceptable  to  the  Government.  But  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health and Law has clearly pointed out that\r\n\r\nin  so  far  as  their own conditions of employment  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it shall be as near as may be. And  we  only\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  there  is no intention  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do  damage, then surely  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  accept that the transfer shall be on  terms  \"no\r\n\r\nless favourable than\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to say a few\r\n\r\nwords. First of all, I think the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw  has suggested that I have not read the other  parts\r\n\r\nof  the  clause. Sir, I assure him that I have read  the\r\n\r\nother parts of the clause. What it says here is that the\r\n\r\nBoard   shall   take  into  account  the  salaries   for\r\n\r\ndetermining   the  new  terms.  Sir,   that   does   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean again, to say the least of it, that the\r\n\r\nnew  salaries  and new terms are going to be  identical.\r\n\r\nSir,  all  that the Deputy Prime Minister said was  that\r\n\r\nbecause  there  are more than two salary scales  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  it  may be difficult to work out an arrangement\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  terms may not be less favourable.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nfrankly  do not see any difficulty in this.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nGovernment Members will agree that that has happened  in\r\n\r\nother  industries  and  in other establishments  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Whether  there is one salary  scale,  two  salary\r\n\r\nscales or three salary scales, if we adopt the principle\r\n\r\nof  converting so that no one receives terms  which  are\r\n\r\nless  favourable than the old terms, we can easily  fuse\r\n\r\nthis  into one common salary structure. I am not  saying\r\n\r\nthat the Government is definitely going to do it to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  What  I  am saying is that it  should  provide\r\n\r\nsafeguards to say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  salaries and other terms of service of the  locally\r\n\r\nengaged   staff - I  am  not  concerned  about  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers - be  ensured  and are not less  favourable  than\r\n\r\nwhatever they are enjoying at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am glad the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nhas  at least agreed that on principle we should have  a\r\n\r\nunified  salary scale for employees of the new statutory\r\n\r\nBoard.  It is pretty obvious that in order to arrive  at\r\n\r\nthis  new salary scale, the terms of clause 9 should  be\r\n\r\nsuch as to enable the Board to discuss it with the staff\r\n\r\nmembers in the Telecommunications Department and members\r\n\r\nin  Cable and Wireless Ltd, so that this unified  salary\r\n\r\nscale can be achieved. But the moment we insert the term\r\n\r\n\"no  less  favourable than\", that means they  are  stuck\r\n\r\nwith  the  terms  and conditions which  they  have  now.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is not possible to arrive  at  a  unified\r\n\r\nsalary  scale. As I have explained earlier to the House,\r\n\r\nI  myself inserted in the draft Bill \"no less favourable\r\n\r\nthan\". But after listening to all sides, I was convinced\r\n\r\nthat  it  was not possible to proceed with the  transfer\r\n\r\nwith  this  phrase  \"no less favourable  than\".  Let  me\r\n\r\nassure the House and staff members of Cable and Wireless\r\n\r\nLtd, and in the Telecommunications Department  that  we\r\n\r\nwant   this   telecommunications  service   to   proceed\r\n\r\nsmoothly,  just as the telephone system in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nproceeding  smoothly under a statutory Board. Therefore,\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  will be given for negotiations  between\r\n\r\nthe Board and the staff members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Bani, a vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 17; Noes, 23; Abstentions,\r\n\r\nNil; Absent, 9; Paired, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Ayes.

Taxation\r\n\r\nauthorities are wary about separating incomes  of  wives\r\n\r\nfrom  those  of their husbands. Unless proper safeguards\r\n\r\nare taken, separation of incomes for assessment purposes\r\n\r\ncan give rise to many opportunities for tax avoidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is unfair that when a wife is\r\n\r\nearning an income through her own efforts and in her own\r\n\r\nright,  such  income  should be, for taxation  purposes,\r\n\r\nconsidered  as accruing to her husband. This Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nto  remove  this form of injustice hitherto  imposed  on\r\n\r\nworking wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first be allowed to clarify the principles\r\n\r\nunderlying  the Bill, before going into the implications\r\n\r\nof  the  separate clauses? This Bill provides that  only\r\n\r\nthe   earned   income  of  a  wife  shall  be   assessed\r\n\r\nseparately.  That is to say, the incomes from  property,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  rent,  dividends,  interest  on  loans,  etc.\r\n\r\naccruing to a wife shall continue to be aggregated  with\r\n\r\nthe  income of her husband. This is obviously  necessary\r\n\r\nin  order to provide safeguards against large-scale  tax\r\n\r\navoidance. Where a wife works in the business carried on\r\n\r\nby   her   husband,  and  this  business   is   a   sole\r\n\r\nproprietorship or a partnership, she shall not  deem  to\r\n\r\nhave   earned  a  separate  income  except  in   certain\r\n\r\nspecified  profession.  The purpose  of  this  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear.  We  do not want to allow a loophole whereby  the\r\n\r\nhusband can put the wife on the payroll of his business,\r\n\r\nthereby reducing his total tax liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, however, the wife has her own professional\r\n\r\nqualifications as specified in clause 4  (b),  then  her\r\n\r\nincome  will  be separately assessed from  that  of  her\r\n\r\nhusband,   even  though  she  works  in  her   husband's\r\n\r\nbusiness.  This  list  of  professions  given   includes\r\n\r\ndoctors,  lawyers,  dentists, pharmacists,  accountants,\r\n\r\nengineers  and architects. There may be wives  who  work\r\n\r\neither as partners or employees in their husbands'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate business, and where the wife is a duly qualified\r\n\r\nprofessional,  she  should  be  entitled   to   separate\r\n\r\nassessment  of  her  income. The  range  of  professions\r\n\r\nlisted  in  clause  4  (b) is fairly comprehensive,  but\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  the odd case in other professions  where\r\n\r\nsimilar  treatment  is merited. I  therefore  intend  to\r\n\r\nmove, subject to your consent, Mr Speaker, Sir, and the\r\n\r\ngeneral  assent of Members present under Standing  Order\r\n\r\n32, an amendment in Committee to allow the extension  to\r\n\r\nother  professions. This would enable the Government  to\r\n\r\ngrant  similar  treatment  to  wives  working  in  other\r\n\r\nprofessions than those listed in clause 4 (b). I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  there are instances in other  professions\r\n\r\nwhere  the  wife  is  a partner or an  employee  of  the\r\n\r\nhusband's  private  business.  It  is  conceivable,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, that a private medical practitioner may  marry\r\n\r\nhis  nurse. These things always happen in the Government\r\n\r\nservice.  If  such a thing happens in private  practice,\r\n\r\nthen I think the nurse deserves the same rights as women\r\n\r\nin other professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause, however, is not intended to be used\r\n\r\nindiscriminately. It must be confined to professions  in\r\n\r\nwhich  certain  standards are laid  down  and  observed.\r\n\r\nOffhand,  I  can  think  of  professions  like  nursing,\r\n\r\nteaching,  quantity surveying and valuation.  There  are\r\n\r\nprofessional standards here and registration  procedures\r\n\r\nwhich  will make the task of the Comptroller  of  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will be of benefit to all married women who\r\n\r\nare  employed in establishments unconnected  with  their\r\n\r\nhusbands'  business. There are married  women  teachers,\r\n\r\ndoctors,  clerks, stenographers, architects and  so  on.\r\n\r\nProfessional  married women will enjoy this  benefit  of\r\n\r\nseparate  assessment  even if  they  do  work  in  their\r\n\r\nhusbands' business. But all married women, regardless of\r\n\r\ntheir  profession, will enjoy this benefit if  they  are\r\n\r\nnot working in their husbands' business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses of the Bill are really consequential\r\n\r\nto  clause 4. They are, intended to regulate the  manner\r\n\r\nin which deductions in respect of relief on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccount of dependants should be calculated so as to\r\n\r\navoid double deduction for the same person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  Minister that it is  unfair  to  treat\r\n\r\nwomen's salaries as part of their husbands' salaries and\r\n\r\nassess  them  as one. I am glad about this Bill.  But  I\r\n\r\ncannot   understand   why  this  benefit   is   extended\r\n\r\nespecially  to professional women. What about  the  poor\r\n\r\nwife  who works in her husband's shop, let us say, as  a\r\n\r\ncashier  in  a  little provision shop and  who  probably\r\n\r\nreceives cash from her husband? Is not her value as much\r\n\r\nas  if her husband had employed another girl who may not\r\n\r\nbe  as trustworthy as his own wife? Just because she  is\r\n\r\nworking  in her husband's shop and just because  she  is\r\n\r\nnot a professional, she is not to enjoy the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. What if she is her husband's typist, cashier\r\n\r\nor  stenographer?  To add insult to  injury,  all  these\r\n\r\npeople are going to benefit if they do not work in their\r\n\r\nhusbands' firms. So the penalty is, firstly, if they are\r\n\r\nnot  professional, and secondly, if they work  in  their\r\n\r\nhusbands' firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Bill it gives me the impression\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  going to benefit families  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome group. Let us take a clerk for instance who earns\r\n\r\n$400,  and his wife is not working, compared with a  man\r\n\r\nwho  earns  $400 and his wife is earning $400.  Mr  A's\r\n\r\nfamily  has to depend entirely on the $400 pay  and  yet\r\n\r\nthat family is given less relief than the family who  is\r\n\r\nearning  $800 (husband $400 and wife $400). That  family\r\n\r\nreceives  more relief. I cannot understand the logic  of\r\n\r\nthis -  the more you earn the more relief you are  given,\r\n\r\nan  extra  $1,000 to the wife. The argument is that  the\r\n\r\nworking  wife spends more. What about the home, not  the\r\n\r\nwife, with a non-wage-earning wife? It spends more  too.\r\n\r\nIt  needs more, Sir, because it has less to spend.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlogic  that  the wife who goes out to earn  money  needs\r\n\r\nmore  money  to spend is very dangerous. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas just introduced equal pay for women, and equality for\r\n\r\nwomen.  But while introducing equality between  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen, they are now creating this disparity amongst  the\r\n\r\nwomen  themselves. There are new anomalies  now  created\r\n\r\nbetween  professional and non-professional  women,  non-professional  women who work in their  husbands'  firms,\r\n\r\nnon-professional  women  who  do  not  work   in   their\r\n\r\nhusbands'  firms,  and the non-wage-earning  wives.  All\r\n\r\nthese new anomalies are quite unnecessary and dangerous.\r\n\r\nI  say  they are dangerous because at almost all  United\r\n\r\nNations  conferences, especially when  they  talk  about\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency or the status of  women,  emphasis\r\n\r\nhas  always  been  laid  on  the  deplorable  fact  that\r\n\r\nalthough the services of the non-wage-earning wife as  a\r\n\r\nwife  and a mother in the home are of the highest value,\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be replaced by any paid services, they have\r\n\r\nnever  been given recognition and the appreciation  that\r\n\r\nthey  deserve.  If this Bill is going through,  it  will\r\n\r\nfurther  belittle such valuable services of a  wife  and\r\n\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to recall that in \"The Tasks Ahead\" of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. they described housework services rendered  by  a\r\n\r\nwife  to  her husband, children and home as slavery  aid\r\n\r\ndrudgery of housework. They promised to free women  from\r\n\r\nthis slavery and drudgery. I was against it at that time\r\n\r\nand I am still against it. I deplore this attitude. I am\r\n\r\nsurprised how the women on the Government Bencher  allow\r\n\r\nthese  terms to be used. I say categorically as a  woman\r\n\r\nthat the service we render our husbands is a service  to\r\n\r\nlove  to  the  family. A wife does not  deserve  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  a wife if she calls those services to her family\r\n\r\ndrudgery  and slavery. It is a service of  love  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill emphasises the monetary value of the\r\n\r\nservices  of a woman to her family.

It tends to break\r\n\r\nthe  family unit because money will be the criterion  of\r\n\r\ndecision. The wife's dignity and respect will depend  on\r\n\r\nhow  much  money she can bring home.

Sir, in the first  place,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is proud to crow that it has reached  an\r\n\r\nagreement  on  closer  association with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961  sets  out  that  in\r\n\r\nregard  to taxes it is Federal. May I therefore ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether   the   Government   has   had    any\r\n\r\nconsultations  with  the  Federation?  If  so,  is   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government going to introduce a similar  Bill\r\n\r\nin  order  to regularise the income tax laws  throughout\r\n\r\nMalaya?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has touched on the family\r\n\r\nunit.  I  want to touch on it too but from  a  different\r\n\r\nangle - from  that of a man. In spite of what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nprofess  insofar as culture is concerned, they  are  now\r\n\r\nembarking  on  a scheme that is going to  break  up  the\r\n\r\nfamily  unit. I remember, and I am sure all married  men\r\n\r\nwill  remember, what they and their brides said the  day\r\n\r\nthey got married: To cherish and to hold; what I have is\r\n\r\nyours  and  what  you have is mine;  we  work  and  live\r\n\r\ntogether for the good of the family. But now the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Ah,  but  wives  who work belong  to  a  separate\r\n\r\nclass - the  P.A.P. class - because if you  work,  you  can\r\n\r\nsubmit  a separate income tax form for assessment.\"  But\r\n\r\nwhat is the benefit? Just $1,000 more and nothing else..\r\n\r\nInstead  of  a  $1,000 allowance for the wife  which  is\r\n\r\nallowed under her husband's income tax returns, it means\r\n\r\nthat  if a wife qualifies under the proposed legislation\r\n\r\nshe  is  entitled to a personal allowance of $2,000.  If\r\n\r\nthat is the case, why should the Government introduce  a\r\n\r\nreduction from $2,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  $1,000  for wives in 1961? Why place  a  premium  on\r\n\r\nwomen who go out to work against women who stay at  home\r\n\r\nto  look after the family for the good of the family and\r\n\r\nof  the country? Why? Is that culture? I myself as a man\r\n\r\nwould  place  a higher value on the woman who  stays  at\r\n\r\nhome  and looks after her family and her house. But  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. say, \"No. If you go out to work, all right,  you\r\n\r\ncan  have your own income tax.\" All for a measly  $1,000\r\n\r\nextra  allowance!,  That  is all - $1,000  extra  personal\r\n\r\nallowance.  Instead  of $1,000  for  a  wife  under  her\r\n\r\nhusband's income tax returns, she will get $2,000 if she\r\n\r\nsubmits her own separate income tax returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again under clause 4, the Minister has brought\r\n\r\nout this statement. \"It is all right. The wife can claim\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  feeding six children and, the  husband  can\r\n\r\nclaim that he is feeding four children (if there are ten\r\n\r\nchildren  in the house) so long as the husband  and  the\r\n\r\nwife  do  not claim for the same children.\" Are  we  not\r\n\r\nbreaking  up the family? Are we not letting our children\r\n\r\nknow that it is the mother that looks after them and not\r\n\r\nthe  parents? Are we not trying to do that in this  way,\r\n\r\nto  tell  your  children, \"Your mother is looking  after\r\n\r\nyou.  Your father is no good. No, he cannot even  earn.\"\r\n\r\nBut  if there is a family, if it is intended and if they\r\n\r\nreally have their culture of a family unit -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is a family bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the Government should not try to\r\n\r\ndo  things which tend to disrupt the family unit.

Firstly,  can  the\r\n\r\nMinister assure us that the relief of $3,000 in the case\r\n\r\nof  the  husband's  income for  his  wife  will  not  be\r\n\r\ninterfered with if his wife is not employed? Because  if\r\n\r\nby  the  wife working the husband is penalised, then  of\r\n\r\ncourse that would not be fair to the husband. I just ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 11th December, 1961, I raised the question of\r\n\r\nincome  tax relief for aged parents and the reply was - to\r\n\r\nparaphrase it - that the Finance Minister had not  given\r\n\r\nthought to that and that\r\n\r\nin view of the fact that income tax legislation would be\r\n\r\na  Federal subject he would not give any thought to that\r\n\r\nfor  the time being. In view of the fact that he has now\r\n\r\nbrought up this amending Bill, I therefore infer that he\r\n\r\nmust  have  consulted  the Federal  Government  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.

First,  the extension of benefits to  professional\r\n\r\nwomen,  and  not  giving  them  to  all  wives  as,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the old lady who looks after a  sundry  shop.\r\n\r\nWhere  a  man runs a family business and the wife  takes\r\n\r\ncharge  of the till or the counter now and then,  it  is\r\n\r\nclear  that  in such a family business it is  only  fair\r\n\r\nthat the income accruing to the whole business should be\r\n\r\ntreated  as one unit. That is a natural taxation entity.\r\n\r\nThe  other point is that you just let open loopholes for\r\n\r\na  terrific amount of tax avoidance, and that we are not\r\n\r\nprepared to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was raised about the effects of this Bill on\r\n\r\nbreaking  of  family units - demoralising housewives  and\r\n\r\nforcing them to work. I cannot follow this logic. I have\r\n\r\nlistened  to  both  the Member for Mountbatten  and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, and I cannot follow their logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is a different line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is quite\r\n\r\nsimple. This is nothing new tried out in other\r\n\r\ncountries. There has been no collapse of families and\r\n\r\ninstitutions in those countries, and there is not going\r\n\r\nto be any collapse or break-up of family spheres as a\r\n\r\nresult of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all the three speakers, I think,\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the effect of this Bill. They thought that\r\n\r\nthe  only benefit this Bill would confer on the taxpayer\r\n\r\nis to increase the personal allowances of working wives.\r\n\r\nThat  is not correct. When the income of a wife is taxed\r\n\r\nseparately, then both the husband and the wife will  pay\r\n\r\nincome,  tax  at  lower  rates, and  this  is  a  fairly\r\n\r\nsubstantial benefit which they will get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you treat the wife as a separate\r\n\r\ntaxpayer,  naturally she will get the  full  benefit  of\r\n\r\npersonal allowances. Now it is not possible to give  the\r\n\r\nassurance  which the Member for Tanglin sought - that  the\r\n\r\nman  should  get personal relief even when his  wife  is\r\n\r\nworking.  That is a bit thick. You cannot  get  it  both\r\n\r\nways. If the wife is working, she `should be exempt from\r\n\r\ntaxation.  This is separate. This is set out clearly  in\r\n\r\nclause  3 (a). This clause, in conjunction with section\r\n\r\n39 of the principal Ordinance, sets out that if the wife\r\n\r\nearns less than $1,000 a year, then what she earns  will\r\n\r\nbe deducted from the personal allowance. And, of course,\r\n\r\nif  she  earns more than $1,000 a year, then the husband\r\n\r\ngets no relief in respect of his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin raised the question of tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for aged parents. I do not know whether I should\r\n\r\nreally reveal this to the House, but I did have a  brief\r\n\r\nand informal discussion with the Minister for Finance in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, and we both came to the conclusion that\r\n\r\nthere  is no case for proceeding with it.

These\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  not doing the type of business  normally\r\n\r\nassociated  with  life  insurance.  One  would  normally\r\n\r\nassociate a life insurance policy as being taken out  by\r\n\r\nan  insured person to set aside a small portion  of  his\r\n\r\ncurrent income for the eventuality when there might be a\r\n\r\ndanger to his life. The insurance cover that is provided\r\n\r\nwill  enable  his  dependants to  have  some  protection\r\n\r\nshould  the  worst  happen  to  him.  Subsequently  life\r\n\r\ninsurance has developed into a form of saving money, and\r\n\r\nmany  people buy life insurance policies as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nsavings for their old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mushroom insurance companies do not deal in this\r\n\r\ntype  of  insurance. Their business is more  a  form  of\r\n\r\ngambling  and  swindling as their main  objective.  They\r\n\r\npromise  a  fixed capital sum at the end of a period  of\r\n\r\nyears  to  anybody  who is prepared  to  pay  a  regular\r\n\r\nmonthly  premium. The attraction here is  that  anybody,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of his age or physical condition,  can  be\r\n\r\ninsured.  The  gambling instincts  of  many  people  are\r\n\r\nstrong,  and the foolish and the avaricious are  thereby\r\n\r\ninduced  to  insure the lives of their aged or  decrepit\r\n\r\nrelatives in the hope of getting this capital sum  after\r\n\r\na  short  time. This form of life insurance  degenerates\r\n\r\ninto little more than gambling - the fortunes of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  gamblers  to  be determined by the  early  or  late\r\n\r\ndemise of their insured relatives or friends. There have\r\n\r\nbeen  cases where more than 100 policies have been taken\r\n\r\nout  on  the  life of one old man in the  family.  These\r\n\r\npolicies  may  be taken out on his life  either  by  his\r\n\r\nchildren  or  by  other  relatives  or  even  by   total\r\n\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mushroom insurance companies have exploited the\r\n\r\nsituation and have duped thousands of people who possess\r\n\r\nstrong  gambling  instincts and hope  to  make  a  quick\r\n\r\npenny. These people do not realise that they are playing\r\n\r\ninto  the hands of unscrupulous racketeers who  have  no\r\n\r\nintention  whatsoever of remaining in the  business  for\r\n\r\nmore  than the initial few years. The mushroom companies\r\n\r\nbegin their business by having runners working for  them\r\n\r\non  a  commission basis and selling as many policies  as\r\n\r\npossible. Some of them do not even comply with  the  law\r\n\r\nby  putting  the  required  $200,000  deposit  with  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General. One of the indications of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  they  have no intention to remain in the  business\r\n\r\ncan  be  gleaned  from the way the  premium  monies  are\r\n\r\ncollected. For a typical policy of $500 maturing at  the\r\n\r\nend  of ten years, a person who buys as insurance policy\r\n\r\nfrom  a mushroom insurance company pays $5 entrance fee,\r\n\r\n$3  annual  registration fee and $3 monthly  premium.  A\r\n\r\npolicy can be taken out for anybody irrespective of age,\r\n\r\nsex  and  physical  condition.  No  medical  examination\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  of  the  insured person  is  necessary.  The\r\n\r\nperson  who buys a policy needs to do very little except\r\n\r\npay  the necessary fee and monthly premiums. Often  even\r\n\r\nthe   proposal  forms  are  completed  for  him  by  the\r\n\r\ninsurance company's agents. The first payment he has  to\r\n\r\nmake  is a total of $11. This whole sum is not collected\r\n\r\nand  paid into the insurance company, for in its  effort\r\n\r\nto  sell  as many policies as possible, it has to  offer\r\n\r\nattractive commission rates to its runners;  and  so  $8\r\n\r\nout  of the first $11 is pocketed by the agents who sell\r\n\r\nthe  policy  and  the  company  gets  only  $3.  Of  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  collections  of $3  per  month,  the  agents\r\n\r\nsometimes get as much as 30 to 40 per cent. By any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactuarial  assessment, the amount of premiums  collected\r\n\r\nby the insurance company cannot provide the insured with\r\n\r\na  capital  of $500 at the end of ten years. It  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely that the mushroom insurance company can remain in\r\n\r\nbusiness for long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation of Malaya, many mushroom companies\r\n\r\ncame  to  life  towards  the latter  part  of  1960  and\r\n\r\ncontinued  until a stop was put to them by a  Federation\r\n\r\nlegislation  introduced in October 1961. By  this  time,\r\n\r\nthere  had  already  been  in  existence  more  than  50\r\n\r\nmushroom  companies. There were certain companies  which\r\n\r\nwere  not even registered, but were nevertheless issuing\r\n\r\ninsurance policies until the law caught up with them. In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  are 17 registered companies  of  this\r\n\r\ntype - l4  of them being branches of Federation  companies\r\n\r\nand  three being incorporated in Singapore - with $200,000\r\n\r\ndeposited with the Accountant-General. The Government is\r\n\r\nof the view that this type of insurance companies should\r\n\r\nbe prevented from further cheating the people. An effort\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  to  assist the poor  people  who  have\r\n\r\npurchased  insurance  policies  to  seek  some  form  of\r\n\r\nredress, and, if possible, to recover a portion of their\r\n\r\npayment.  The  problem is a very big  one.  Hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  policies  have  been  issued  by  various\r\n\r\nmushroom   companies.  The  Federation  Government   has\r\n\r\nbrought   in  legislation  to  wind  up  these   unsound\r\n\r\ncompanies. I have obtained agreement from the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  the  claims  of  policy  holders   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  against  the  Federation  companies  will  be\r\n\r\ntreated  in  the  same manner as those held  by  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Although  this  generous  attitude  has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  by the Federation Government, I would not  like\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  hopes  of Singapore  policy  holders  or\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries. They must realise that they have ventured\r\n\r\ninto a most unprofitable form of investment. What little\r\n\r\nasset  may  be left by the mushroom insurance  companies\r\n\r\nwould constitute in most instances only a small fraction\r\n\r\nof  the  money  that has been mulcted  from  the  policy\r\n\r\nholders during the period of operation. The monies  that\r\n\r\nhave been paid by the insured or the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  have  been divided  between  the  agents,\r\n\r\ncollectors  and various directors and employees  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  Nevertheless, it is necessary that  action  be\r\n\r\ntaken   to  terminate  the  activities  of  the  unsound\r\n\r\ninsurance companies operating in the State and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these  rackets are stopped once and for  all.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  the Life Assurance Companies  (Compulsory\r\n\r\nLiquidation) Bill is now before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency\r\n\r\nto enable the Government to deal with mushroom companies\r\n\r\nin  the  State effectively and to offer some redress  to\r\n\r\nthe  poor  policy holders from any assets that would  be\r\n\r\nrealised. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister\r\n\r\nmay  compel mushroom companies to furnish him  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  seven  days with the rates of  premium  they\r\n\r\ncharge  for  policies issued. If the premium  rates  are\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  inadequate  or  determined  without   any\r\n\r\nactuarial basis, they, as well as those companies  which\r\n\r\nhave  not complied with the Minister's notice, shall  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  unsound, and the Minister may  petition  the\r\n\r\ncourt to wind up these companies. This liquidation shall\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out  by the liquidators  appointed  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt.  They will be empowered to seize and realise  the\r\n\r\nassets  of  the company under liquidation and distribute\r\n\r\nthem  on  a  pari  passu basis with  creditors  who  can\r\n\r\nestablish  proper claims. In doing so, priority  payment\r\n\r\nshall  be accorded to claims established by persons  who\r\n\r\nhave  paid  premiums to this company.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\npolicy  holders of this company shall get first priority\r\n\r\non the claims to the assets of this company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also ensure that in future only life\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies which can satisfy  certain  minimum\r\n\r\nstandards of actuarial and business rationality will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to continue to operate or to start business  in\r\n\r\nthe  State.  The  Bill now presented  contains  parallel\r\n\r\nlegislative  provisions  incorporated  in  two  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya  Insurance  Acts   which   were\r\n\r\nintroduced   in   October   1961   and   February   1962\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain minor amendments, however, have been made in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  experience in the  Federation,  both  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  winding  up  and  liquidation  of   the\r\n\r\nmushroom  companies  and to meet local  conditions.  The\r\n\r\namended  or additional provisions of the Bill  are  sub-clauses  (4), (5) and (6) of clause 7. This would  cater\r\n\r\nfor  the situation where mushroom companies are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  voluntary liquidation.  The  Government  is\r\n\r\naware  that it could be possible, because of  the  terms\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in insurance policy, that the policy  holder\r\n\r\nwould  find difficulty in establishing his valid  claim.\r\n\r\nIt  would,  therefore, be to the interest of the  policy\r\n\r\nholder for the company to be wound up in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of the present Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clauses (4) and (5) of clause 8 will provide that\r\n\r\nthe claims of the policy holders are given priority.  We\r\n\r\nare aware that the assets of the insurance companies are\r\n\r\nnot likely to be sufficient to meet all claims, and that\r\n\r\nvery probably only a small proportion of the claims  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  met.  Hence it is  decided  that  policy\r\n\r\nholders should have first priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 enables the Minister to make rules for\r\n\r\ncarrying out the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends the existing Life Assurance Companies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  (Chapter 178) to provide for an  increase  of\r\n\r\npenalty  for  persons  who  fail  to  comply  with   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this Bill will be threefold. First, it\r\n\r\nwill  enable  a  stricter control to be  exercised  over\r\n\r\ninsurance companies. Second, it will enable the Minister\r\n\r\nto  declare certain insurance firms which cannot  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the requirements of clause 7 as being unsound  and\r\n\r\nto  order  their winding up. Lastly, it will enable  the\r\n\r\nliquidator to realise the assets of these companies  and\r\n\r\nto   distribute  them  in  accordance  with  the  claims\r\n\r\nreceived, but with priority being given to those of  the\r\n\r\npolicy holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome the provisions\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill,  particularly that aspect  of  it  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  itself  with  the  compulsory  liquidation  of\r\n\r\ncertain mushroom life assurance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seems to deal with two\r\n\r\naspects  of  the problem. The first aspect  is  that  it\r\n\r\nseeks  to amend certain provisions of the Life Assurance\r\n\r\nCompanies Ordinance (Chapter 178) which, as I see it, is\r\n\r\na  permanent statute intended to deal with all bona fide\r\n\r\nlife assurance companies, whereas the main impetus given\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill before the House, I take it, was by  these\r\n\r\nmushroom companies coming into operation; as a result of\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is necessary to compulsorily liquidate  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have welcomed two Bills on\r\n\r\nthis - one dealing with permanent amendments to, if I  may\r\n\r\nsay   so,   a  permanent  Ordinance  and  a  Liquidation\r\n\r\nOrdinance dealing specifically and particularly with the\r\n\r\nmushroom companies in respect of which this Bill  really\r\n\r\nseeks to proceed against. On the aspect of the companies\r\n\r\nwhich  this  Bill seeks to liquidate, I find  myself  in\r\n\r\nsympathy with the Finance Minister in rushing this  Bill\r\n\r\nthrough  because the problem is one of urgency,  and  we\r\n\r\nourselves from this side of the House have been pressing\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to take immediate action  against  such\r\n\r\ncompanies. But there is this position where the Bill was\r\n\r\npresented  to the Opposition, I understand, at  about  3\r\n\r\no'clock:  I  was not in the House when it was presented.\r\n\r\nBut  may  I suggest to the Minister - I do appreciate  the\r\n\r\nurgency for this Bill - that if this Bill had been given\r\n\r\nto  us say on Sunday (or Saturday afternoon, if that was\r\n\r\npossible),  it  might have served  the  purpose?  But  I\r\n\r\nderive  some solace because this Bill follows to a  very\r\n\r\nlarge extent the Federation Liquidation Ordinance which,\r\n\r\nI  take  it,  was  also promulgated to  meet  a  similar\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  the  Federation. So probably  from  that\r\n\r\npoint of view, the objections of presenting this Bill in\r\n\r\nthe  manner in which it has been presented are not  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial. But I do suggest to the Government that the\r\n\r\nmajor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  arising from these mushroom companies probably\r\n\r\nstem  from  the fact that the provisions of the  present\r\n\r\nLife   Assurance  Companies  Ordinance  have  not   been\r\n\r\nutilised to the fullest possible extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was surprised to hear the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  say  that in some cases not even the  $200,000 \r\n\r\ndeposit  required  by the Assurance Companies  Ordinance\r\n\r\nhad  been  extracted  from these companies  before  they \r\n\r\nstarted business.

Even then, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if that was so, probably there is a hiatus\r\n\r\nin  the  law.  Any foreign company - and it is  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncompany  which  establishes its branch  here - seeking  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  an insurance business here, having registered\r\n\r\nitself  probably  under section  301  of  the  Companies\r\n\r\nOrdinance or probably registered itself under  the  Life\r\n\r\nAssurance  Companies Ordinance, -should,  by  that  law,\r\n\r\nhave been made to pay the $200,000 here rather than rely\r\n\r\non  the $200,000 paid in the Federation. Possibly there\r\n\r\nis  a  hiatus  in  the law. I have not looked  into  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, but I would have done so if I had  notice  of\r\n\r\nthis  earlier.  It  did surprise me  to  hear  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  it  was possible for  a  life  insurance\r\n\r\ncompany   which  .was  possibly  incorporated   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  to  start  business   in   this\r\n\r\ncommercial  city of ours and extract a lot  of  premiums\r\n\r\nwithout  paying the minimum deposit which the Government\r\n\r\nthought  was  necessary before it was let loose  on  the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, I have no comments.

Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nfail  to understand why when we had this mushroom growth\r\n\r\nin  1960  the  Government had failed to  take  immediate\r\n\r\naction and warn the public against investing their whole\r\n\r\nlife savings in these bogus life insurance companies. We\r\n\r\nunderstand that there is a Commercial Crimes  Branch  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Department. I do not know  whether  it  has\r\n\r\nbrought   to   the  attention  of  the  Government   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of these bogus life insurance companies.  If\r\n\r\nit  has,  then  it  is  a crime and  a  failing  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in not having taken action one or  two  years\r\n\r\nback.  After the citizens of Singapore have  lost  their\r\n\r\nlife  savings in the policies issued by these bogus life\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies, the Government is  now  forced  to\r\n\r\ntake  appropriate action. Mr Speaker, Sir, in my  view,\r\n\r\nmost  of the directors or managers of the life insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies who formed these companies were conscious that\r\n\r\nthey  were perpetrating a fraud and swindling  the  poor\r\n\r\ngullible  public. The Bill, as it stands,  is  going  to\r\n\r\ntreat these bogus insurance companies in the same way as\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  treating  persons  who  run   into\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. I do not agree that such companies should be\r\n\r\ntreated in the same way as bankrupts are treated by  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  The  Government should go one step  further.  They\r\n\r\nshould  take  criminal action against the directors  and\r\n\r\nmanagers  of  these  bogus insurance companies  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, impound their personal assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not envisage these policy\r\n\r\nholders  getting  back anything substantial  from  their\r\n\r\ninvestments in these companies because the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has said just now that much of the  funds  were\r\n\r\nwasted  or  were spent on agents' commission, collection\r\n\r\nfees,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   so  on.  In  addition  to  this  expenditure,  the\r\n\r\ndirectors and managers who were prepared to perpetrate a\r\n\r\nfraud must have also written off large sums of money  in\r\n\r\nthe   form  of  salaries,  travelling  allowances   and,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  transferred  a  big portion  of  their  assets\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly  advocate  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should take action not only  under  the\r\n\r\nproposed  insurance  law but that it  should  also  take\r\n\r\ncriminal  action against the directors and  managers  of\r\n\r\nthese life insurance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to inform the House how\r\n\r\nmany of these companies registered in Singapore, and how\r\n\r\nmany branches of companies registered in the Federation,\r\n\r\ndo  not pay the $200,000 deposit which is required of  a\r\n\r\nlife insurance company, and whether the Government would\r\n\r\nconsider  introducing legislation to make sure  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture  a  percentage  of  the  premiums  collected   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  by all life insurance companies are  invested\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this Bill which has been introduced  today\r\n\r\nis just like trying to prepare the net for the fish that\r\n\r\nhas  already escaped. But we welcome this Bill which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has introduced today because it will  prevent\r\n\r\nany  future  occurrence of illegal insurance agents  and\r\n\r\ndirectors  mulcting our local people. We  did  not  have\r\n\r\nmuch  time to study this Bill in detail because we  only\r\n\r\nreceived it this afternoon in this Chamber. According to\r\n\r\nthe explanation given by the Minister for Finance, there\r\n\r\nare  at present 17 life insurance companies of this sort\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.   I  understand  that  these   insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies have already wound up their business and  that\r\n\r\nmany  policy  holders have not been able to contact  the\r\n\r\ninsurance  agents  after  the Government  announced  its\r\n\r\nintention   of  introducing  legislation.  Many   policy\r\n\r\nholders are now worried and they are at a loss as to how\r\n\r\nthey can get back all or part of the premiums they paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance explained that the liquidator appointed by the court will have the power to order the liquidation of these life insurance companies - whether they are incorporated locally or in the Federation - and that a certain amount will be paid back to the policy holders after the assets of these companies have been assessed on liquidation. But we understand that such life insurance companies have very limited assets in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At  the most, they have a few  rooms  in  an\r\n\r\noffice and a few vans. It is also doubtful whether these\r\n\r\nreally  belong to them. The Minister has said that  when\r\n\r\nthese   insurance  companies  are  liquidated  the-local\r\n\r\ncitizens   will  get  priority  on  their   claims   for\r\n\r\ncompensation. But I say that what they will get will  be\r\n\r\nvery limited. The Minister for Finance has said that  he\r\n\r\nhad  already discussed the matter of companies which are\r\n\r\nregistered  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Minister  of  Finance  and  that   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens,  just like Federal citizens, will be  able  to\r\n\r\nget  compensation from such companies. He has also  very\r\n\r\nclearly  intimated that the policy holders will be  able\r\n\r\nto  get  a  very limited amount of payment  out  of  the\r\n\r\npremiums paid to these companies which are registered in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  try to take all  possible  steps  to\r\n\r\nrecover what the policy holders have paid in the way  of\r\n\r\npremiums to these companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a great number of such\r\n\r\ninsurance companies. It may be that there are only 17 in\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  of the Mutual Benefit  Organisations\r\n\r\nBill  which  was passed in this Assembly  sometime  ago.\r\n\r\nMany  people  who  were  members  of  these  mutual  aid\r\n\r\nassociations  then  took  out policies  with  such  life\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies. I understand  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  has helped to transfer membership  lists  of\r\n\r\ncertain mutual aid societies to the Kinta Life Assurance\r\n\r\nCompany.  At  that  time,  I  discussed  with  the  then\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and the Member for Bukit Timah about\r\n\r\norganising  a committee on this question. The  names  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the mutual aid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocieties  were  transferred to the membership  list  of\r\n\r\nthis life insurance company. But now this life insurance\r\n\r\ncompany  has  already stopped functioning. Many  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  holders have told me that it was the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  helped them to transfer their names to this  life\r\n\r\ninsurance  company. Therefore, the Government should  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  getting back their payments  on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf.  I have already informed the Director of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare   of  this  matter  and  have  urged  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should contact this life insurance company so\r\n\r\nthat  a  solution to this problem can be arrived  at.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister for Finance can give us a  reply  on\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the Bill is passed, we hone that the poor\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore will not be exploited any  more  by\r\n\r\nagents  and  operators of these illegal  life  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  We also hope that from now on  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  will pay more attention  to  such  illegal\r\n\r\ncompanies in order that the people of Singapore will not\r\n\r\nsuffer any more losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to clear up\r\n\r\none  point  which  the  Member for  Choa  Chu  Kang  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  just now. He tried to give the  House  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  Social  Welfare  Department   got\r\n\r\ncontributors to a mutual aid organisation to transfer to\r\n\r\nthe Kinta Insurance Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was an old lady who was\r\n\r\noperating some sort of a family benefit society  in  the\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang area. As soon as the Government introduced\r\n\r\nthe Mutual Benefit Organisations Bill, she ceased to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  there  was  a danger  of  those  who  had\r\n\r\ncontributed to her little organisation losing all  their\r\n\r\nmoney. At that time, the Kinta Insurance Company of  the\r\n\r\nFederation were seeking to do business in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthey  had a number of discussions and meetings with  all\r\n\r\nthe  interested parties together with the  officials  of\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Department. They undertook  to  take\r\n\r\nover  all  the liabilities of the organisation that  was\r\n\r\nrun by the old lady in Bukit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanjang.  A  meeting was held. All the contributors  to\r\n\r\nthis  organisation met at the Community Centre in  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah Road. The position was explained to them and  they\r\n\r\nagreed  to  transfer  to  the Kinta  Insurance  Company.\r\n\r\nBefore the Company took over the liabilities of the  old\r\n\r\nlady, they paid a deposit of $200,000 to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance.   So  that  the  position  as  far   as   those\r\n\r\ncontributors are concerned is that because  they  sought\r\n\r\nthe  assistance  of the Social Welfare  Department  they\r\n\r\nwould  now be able to have access to the money that  has\r\n\r\nbeen deposited with the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nmade  the  important  point that  the  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\namending  Bill is a temporary one, to deal with  certain\r\n\r\nmushroom  companies, and that it is not really something\r\n\r\nthat  is  suitable to remain as a permanent  statute.  I\r\n\r\nentirely agree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme that is before the Governments of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Federation  is  to   introduce   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  Ordinance  to regulate  all  the  various\r\n\r\nforms  of  insurance - not only life  insurance  but  fire\r\n\r\ninsurance,  marine insurance, and so on. We have  worked\r\n\r\non  this  for  nearly two years with the  assistance  of\r\n\r\nexperts  sent  by  the Australian Government  under  the\r\n\r\nColombo  Plan. So we hope eventually to have a tidy  and\r\n\r\npermanent  Ordinance on the statute book regulating  the\r\n\r\nproper conduct of insurance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point the Member for Farrer Park made was\r\n\r\nthis.  He asked whether it was true that foreign  branch\r\n\r\ncompanies  could operate in Singapore without  paying  a\r\n\r\ndeposit of $200,000. The answer is that any company that\r\n\r\nhas  made  a  deposit  with the  Federation  Accountant-General  can  carry  on  business in  Singapore  without\r\n\r\nmaking a deposit here; and vice versa anybody who  makes\r\n\r\na  deposit  in Singapore can carry on operation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  However, when we get the final  legislation\r\n\r\non this, I think all these weaknesses in our present law\r\n\r\nwill be remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Hong Lim who\r\n\r\nimplied that these bogus insurance companies  were\r\n\r\nknown  to have started many years ago and he asked\r\n\r\nwhy  no  action was taken earlier. The  answer  of\r\n\r\ncourse is that the Member has got his facts wrong.\r\n\r\nSo   far   as  Singapore  is  concerned,  mushroom\r\n\r\ncompanies  began to sprout round about the  middle\r\n\r\nof  last  year  and they were really  active  from\r\n\r\nSeptember or October onwards last year. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  have  not had all the time in the  world  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their nefarious activities. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is quite untrue for the Member for Hong Lim to\r\n\r\nallege  that most of the poor have lost all  their\r\n\r\nlife  savings. I would say that a person who  took\r\n\r\nout  an  average  policy of $500 might  have  paid\r\n\r\nout - I  do  not  know - $20 or $25  from,  say,  last\r\n\r\nSeptember  till now, and I think the life  savings\r\n\r\nof the poor are considerably more than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is one point to which some\r\n\r\nattention must be drawn. In the policies  of  most\r\n\r\nof  these companies, it is stated that unless  you\r\n\r\npay  your  monthly premiums regularly your  policy\r\n\r\nwill lapse. I think they give a period of grace of\r\n\r\ntwo months or so. Now under this Bill whatever  is\r\n\r\npaid  will be considered as a claim on the  assets\r\n\r\nof  the  company when it is wound up  and  if  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  the policy say the  policy  lapses,\r\n\r\nthat condition will be set aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now both the Member for Farrer Park and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim urged  that  the  strongest\r\n\r\naction  be taken against the offending parties.  I\r\n\r\nam  completely  in  agreement with  the  sentiment\r\n\r\nbehind   this  request,  but  I  can  see  certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties. First, the directors  of  all  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  are Federation citizens and  therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  being  a civil suit, it is not possible  for\r\n\r\nthe    Singapore   Government   to   request   the\r\n\r\nextradition   of  the  culprits.  No   doubt   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government will take  suitable  action\r\n\r\nshould criminal offences be revealed in the course\r\n\r\nof  their  investigations into the  activities  of\r\n\r\nthese  companies.  In fairness to  some  of  these\r\n\r\ndirectors  or  some of the persons connected  with\r\n\r\nthese  companies, I think it is wrong to say  that\r\n\r\nall  of them are equally criminal and evil-minded.\r\n\r\nSome may have been led into this business and induced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  put some capital into it by  the  major\r\n\r\nculprits,  and there may be innocent people  among\r\n\r\nthe   directors  who  have  been  misled  by   the\r\n\r\npromoters  into putting money into  this  venture.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  although  we can say  with  confidence\r\n\r\nthat  the  persons who run this mushroom insurance\r\n\r\nbusiness  run  it  as  a racket,  nevertheless  we\r\n\r\ncannot   condemn  everyone  connected  with   this\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleague the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw  has  answered the main point  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Choa Chu Kang and I need not say  more\r\n\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 3\r\n\r\nstand part of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I realise that clause 2 has enlarged\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of an actuary as defined in  the  Life\r\n\r\nAssurance Companies Ordinance to \"include a Fellow\r\n\r\nof  the  Society of Actuaries in America  and  any\r\n\r\nperson possessing such other qualifications as the\r\n\r\nMinister may, by order, prescribe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I know. At the moment, I am told that\r\n\r\nthe   qualifications  under  the  Ordinance   are   very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  obtain  and that  there  are  very,  very\r\n\r\nfew   actuaries  in  this  work.  Of  that,  I  am  told\r\n\r\nthere  are  about  two  or three persons  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  have  met  two  of them but there  may  be  a  third.\r\n\r\nNow  under  clause  3,  a present insurance  company  or\r\n\r\na future insurance company - it seems to me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreading this clause hurriedly - will not be able to  carry\r\n\r\nout  their  operations  \"unless  there  is  in  force  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  by an actuary .... establishing the  minimum\r\n\r\nrates of premium which are proper to be charged\".  As  I\r\n\r\ndo   not   know  how  many  insurance  companies   there\r\n\r\nare - perhaps  12,  15  or 20; I do  not  know  the  exact\r\n\r\nnumber;  certainly  over 12 - I would  take  it  that  the\r\n\r\nactuaries  in  Singapore  would  be  employed  by  these\r\n\r\ninsurance companies. Assuming that an insurance  company\r\n\r\nemploys  one  of  the  actuaries and  another  insurance\r\n\r\ncompany employs the other, then it seems to me that  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  insurance companies are left  without  an\r\n\r\nactuary.  Now is the suggestion by the Government  under\r\n\r\nthis  clause  that  these  two  or  three  actuaries  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are going to act for the ether companies  and\r\n\r\nprovide them with certificates which will enable them to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  their  business?  While  I  agree  with   the\r\n\r\nprinciple behind the Bill, I do not know whether  it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  from  a practical point of view,  to  fix  an\r\n\r\nappointed  day  in the near future and then  bring  into\r\n\r\nplay the provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not really expect much trouble\r\n\r\non  the  administration of this clause.

If  the\r\n\r\nMinister   also  permits  actuaries  living   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries to certify for particular companies registered\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, I think that also would further ease  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\nTuesday, 17h April, 1962.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">six minutes past Five o'clock p.m. to Tuesday, 17th April, 1962.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
