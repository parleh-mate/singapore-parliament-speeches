But it appears to me that the CPF is\r\n\r\nlike the Singapore version of a Swiss knife.  It is multi-purpose and has a sharp blade.  A 3% cut in CPF cuts like\r\n\r\na  knife  for the workers, but may not be magical  enough\r\n\r\nfor  businesses.  Most of all, a CPF cut in  itself  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  sufficient to give us the competitive edge.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  businesses  do  not look at  wage  cost  alone  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  where  to do business.  They  will  study  the\r\n\r\ncosts and rewards through the four factors of production,\r\n\r\nbeing land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, as well\r\n\r\nas  the  ease of doing business and even the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore.   In other words, it  has  to  be  a\r\n\r\nholistic  look at our competitiveness, and not just  wage\r\n\r\ncost  alone.  Hence, the slew of initiatives unveiled  by\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee on Friday, if anything, is a signal to the world\r\n\r\nat large that we are prepared to bite the bullet and push\r\n\r\non.   But the question remains: how far and how effective\r\n\r\nwill these measures be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year or so, I visited many SMEs and\r\n\r\ntrade associations to hear their cries.  Four buckets  of\r\n\r\ntears  were quickly filled up.  The four buckets are  SME\r\n\r\nfinancing, rental cost, jobs and job applicants, and  red\r\n\r\ntapes  and  bureaucracy.  Much has been said about  these\r\n\r\nfour  buckets of cries in previous debates, and  I  would\r\n\r\nchoose  to  focus  on  the  last,  being  red  tapes  and\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I am delighted at the setting up of the Cut\r\n\r\nWaste  Panel announced by DPM.  I applaud the setting  up\r\n\r\nof such a brilliant committee and I would like to quote a\r\n\r\nfew  instances  where  rigidities and  procedures  hinder\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  I spoke with a Mr Renaud Semerdjian, General\r\n\r\nManager  of  Clear Channel (Singapore)  Pte  Ltd.   Clear\r\n\r\nChannel is a Fortune 500 company which has invested  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  in  just hardware cost for the bus shelters  and\r\n\r\ntaxi  stands, and I understand that more investments  are\r\n\r\non  the  way.  In addition, they are committed to  paying\r\n\r\nLTA $232 million in rental for the entire contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Renaud reflected to me that up until August this\r\n\r\nyear,  they were receiving as many as 1,583 invoices  per\r\n\r\nmonth   in  1,583  separate  letters  with  1,583   reply\r\n\r\nenvelopes from Singapore Power.  Why?  Because they  have\r\n\r\nbuilt, to date, 1,584 bus shelters, and each one of  them\r\n\r\nis  individually billed.  They spoke with Singapore Power\r\n\r\nabout  consolidating their bills so that they can receive\r\n\r\none  bill  for  all  the bus shelters in  a  consolidated\r\n\r\naccount,  so that he does not have to assign a staff  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of opening envelopes, sticking  stamps  and\r\n\r\nsending  them  back.  Unfortunately, Mr Renaud  was  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed  because  he  had  to  spend  time  engaging\r\n\r\nconsultants and lawyers to speak with the relevant people\r\n\r\nbefore  this  decision of not allowing  them  to  have  a\r\n\r\nconsolidated billing was reversed.  I understand that  he\r\n\r\ngot  positive  news  from Singapore Power  only  on  28th\r\n\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Renaud told me that he was willing to pay six\r\n\r\nmonths of the average total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbill  in  advance, just to cut down on the administrative\r\n\r\nhassles.   But  what he also highlighted was  that  if  a\r\n\r\nFortune   500   company   with  financial   muscles   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial investment in Singapore has to go through  18\r\n\r\nmonths  of  negotiations and incur legal  fees  and  huge\r\n\r\nadministrative  cost,  then what chance  has  an  SME  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  the  bureaucracy and the  procedures?   He  also\r\n\r\npointed  out the opportunity cost forgone for the  entire\r\n\r\nprocess.   The  energy could have been more  productively\r\n\r\nused in creating more business opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I was told by some representatives from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association that  some\r\n\r\nof   them   experienced  having  to  apply  for  separate\r\n\r\ncertificates  for their export to various  countries,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the agriculture and fishery exports  to  the\r\n\r\nEU.  I understand that EU does have some requirements but\r\n\r\nwas  told  that the certificates issued by a neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry  exporting  to the EU has a much  more  efficient\r\n\r\nprocess and allows many items to be listed within the one\r\n\r\ncertificate.  I also understand that the cost of  such  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  is  about four times that  issued  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  They hope that the Government can  look  into\r\n\r\nsome  ways to help them smoothen this process and  reduce\r\n\r\nthe cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I have come across some statistics on our\r\n\r\ncivil service sector.  Perhaps it is time for us to  also\r\n\r\ntake  a  look  at cutting waste within the civil  service\r\n\r\nsector.  From the year 1992 to 2001, I noticed that there\r\n\r\nhas  been  an  almost 100% increase  in  the  Division  I\r\n\r\nofficers  over the last 10 years.  In fact,  out  of  the\r\n\r\nfour  Divisions of our civil service, Division I officers\r\n\r\nmake up about 40.6% and Division II officers 29.9%, which\r\n\r\nmeans about 70% of our civil servants are in Divisions  I\r\n\r\nand  II, whereas Division III, 22.6% and Division IV only\r\n\r\na  mere  7%.  My sense is that it could be that  we  have\r\n\r\noutsourced  a  lot  of  the lower ranking  jobs,  thereby\r\n\r\nreducing  the  need  for Division  III  and  Division  IV\r\n\r\nofficers.  Perhaps we have employed more people to  think\r\n\r\nand  to  plan  for  us,  and perhaps  teachers  are  also\r\n\r\nincluded in the Division I officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: are we getting too top heavy where\r\n\r\nthere are too many Generals and not enough soldiers?  How\r\n\r\ndo  the Generals keep in touch with the heartbeat of  the\r\n\r\nheartlanders    and    ordinary    Singaporeans?     Most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  how  has the quality of the  civil  service\r\n\r\nimproved  as  they become planners and thinkers,  meaning\r\n\r\ntop  heavy?  I think our people need to know whether  our\r\n\r\ntax dollars are well spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn my focus back to CPF itself. My\r\n\r\nhope  is  that  we do not need to revisit the  CPF  issue\r\n\r\nagain  for the purpose of trimming business costs.  While\r\n\r\nthe CPF cut may help boost a few businesses, it certainly\r\n\r\nmeans a reduction in retirement nest-egg.  The purpose of\r\n\r\nCPF remains that of, first, a retirement nest-egg, then a\r\n\r\nhousing fund and a medical fund. With the proposed  fine-tuning, Singaporeans will be saving less for their  nest-egg  through CPF.  They are encouraged to do more through\r\n\r\nself-help,  such as financial planning.   I  think,  like\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  Singaporeans would  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  help to boost consumer financial  literacy.\r\n\r\nI  have  spoken on this topic many times.   I  shall  not\r\n\r\nrepeat too much.  But I would like to point out that even\r\n\r\nMr  Low  Thia  Khiang did not appear  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nconcept of financial planning, and he linked it to fixing\r\n\r\nlong-term  CPF  rates  so  that  there  is  certainty  in\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that financial planning is\r\n\r\nnecessary precisely because there is uncertainty in life.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the purpose of financial planning is  to  help\r\n\r\npeople realise their financial goals.  And because  goals\r\n\r\nare  unlimited,  whereas resources are  limited,  therein\r\n\r\nlies  the  need for optimum planning.  And  because  each\r\n\r\nroute  to  achieving  one's goal is  not  a  smooth  one,\r\n\r\ntherefore you need to build into the plan shock absorbers\r\n\r\nand  do  periodic  plan  reviews to  factor  in  personal\r\n\r\nchanges, career changes, family changes, economic changes\r\n\r\nand  unforeseen circumstances. Any good planner worth his\r\n\r\nsalt   would   advocate  the  use  of  a  slightly   more\r\n\r\nconservative  assumption  and  the  establishment  of  an\r\n\r\nemergency fund to take care of events like job loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  emergency  use of cash, which is why  I  support  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's statement and advocate using a band  for\r\n\r\nflexible CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also mentioned that the changes affect many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  financial plans.   He  is  only  partially\r\n\r\nright.   The  truth is most people do  not  even  have  a\r\n\r\ndeliberate plan to start with and, therefore, the  urgent\r\n\r\nneed to educate Singaporeans to help them to become self-reliant.   In addition, I also hope that Mr Low  realises\r\n\r\nthat  unless  there  is inheritance  money  or  long-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  contributions from friends  and  relatives,  a\r\n\r\nperson cannot even start planning because, basically,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is no job, there will be no money, and there  will\r\n\r\nbe  no meaningful plan.  And this is why the emphasis  is\r\n\r\non cutting business cost, so that the existing businesses\r\n\r\nwill  stay and more investments can flow in to  help  job\r\n\r\ncreation.  Let me reiterate that only when there are jobs\r\n\r\ncan there be meaningful financial plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, with the cut, I am\r\n\r\nalso  concerned  about the viability of some  workers  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing with some of their own initiatives  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  already  started.  In the past, when  the  CPF  was\r\n\r\nliberalised,  many  workers  invested  their  money  into\r\n\r\nfinancial   products   like  annual   premium   endowment\r\n\r\npolicies.  These are saving plans that require members to\r\n\r\npay  their  annual  premiums through their  CPF  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount.  The objective is to realise a sizable lump  sum\r\n\r\nfrom  their policies at retirement.  These efforts should\r\n\r\nbe applauded.  However, with the cut, they may default on\r\n\r\ntheir annual premiums because of fewer dollars going into\r\n\r\ntheir CPF accounts.  If they stop paying, they may suffer\r\n\r\na  substantial loss on these policies.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that these members have prudently set aside the\r\n\r\nmoney  systematically on an annual basis because  of  our\r\n\r\nencouragement.   They have planned for  their  retirement\r\n\r\nproactively and I think we owe it to them to help them to\r\n\r\nfulfil some of their payments.  As such, I advocate  that\r\n\r\nwe  allow the use of their CPF Special Account to top  up\r\n\r\nthe differences if they are caught in a bind.  This would\r\n\r\nmitigate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir losses and, at the same time, allow them to achieve\r\n\r\ntheir retirement goals and objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many articles have been written about\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of  the CPF cut.  In today's Straits  Times,\r\n\r\nErnst  &  Young had a report about the group of 50  years\r\n\r\nold  and above being the most critically affected.   This\r\n\r\ngroup of people will have less tax sheltered dollars  and\r\n\r\nincreased tax liability.  My sense is that we do  have  a\r\n\r\nvehicle  in  place that could help them, that  being  the\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Retirement Scheme (SRS).   The  SRS  is  a\r\n\r\ndeferred  tax shelter.  Unfortunately, under the  current\r\n\r\nregime,  it  is not an attractive instrument.   Hence,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the relevant authorities would relook  at  the\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Retirement Scheme  and  fine-tune  it,  to\r\n\r\nincentivise people to invest into this scheme to beef  up\r\n\r\ntheir retirement dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the housing fund and the use of Special\r\n\r\nAccount to top up for any differences.  I am heartened to\r\n\r\nhear  that there will be a change of rules to help people\r\n\r\nkeep the roof over their head.  However, I am mindful  of\r\n\r\nthe implementation blues.  Here, I would like to quote  a\r\n\r\ncase of my Punggol North resident, Mr Ang Tock Chye.   Mr\r\n\r\nAng  lost  his job where he commanded a salary  of  about\r\n\r\n$1,800  in  the past.  Today, he works in a  supermarket,\r\n\r\ntaking  home about $800 to feed his family, working  from\r\n\r\n<br>10.00 am to 10.00 pm, six days a week. Because of the\r\n\r\nreduction in salary, he could not pay his mortgage  loan.\r\n\r\nWhat he did was to write to HDB asking to use his Special\r\n\r\nAccount  to  pay his instalments.  However, he  was  told\r\n\r\nthat he had purchased his home after the CPF cut in 1999,\r\n\r\nwhich  meant that the CPF cut in 1999 would already  have\r\n\r\nbeen  factored  into the mortgage loan  calculation.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  he  was  not eligible for the use of  his  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  to repay the loan.  In addition, he was  greeted\r\n\r\nwith  another  letter from HDB titled, \"Late  payment  of\r\n\r\ncharges of mortgage loan instalment\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is where the implementation blues could\r\n\r\nset in.  I believe that HDB has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na heart to help, but it has to do more to ensure that its\r\n\r\nimplementation meets its policy intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nalso mentioned that the additional 0.1% charge (being the\r\n\r\ndifference  between cost of fund and HDB subsidised  loan\r\n\r\nrate)  for  the  loans  issued  under  HDB  is  to  cover\r\n\r\nadministrative  cost.   I  understand  that   the   total\r\n\r\nmortgage  loan outstanding is $64 billion.  At  0.1%  per\r\n\r\nannum, it means that the interest cost is $64 million per\r\n\r\nannum.  My question is: is that a reasonable sum to cover\r\n\r\nthe  yearly administrative cost?  Obviously, I would like\r\n\r\nHDB  to verify the above figures and also explain why  it\r\n\r\ntakes $64 million per annum to administer the loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, going back to the final\r\n\r\nobjective  of CPF, which is that of setting up a  medical\r\n\r\nfund,  there is a need for more insurance schemes  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  under Medisave.  The current MediShield policies\r\n\r\nand  long-term  disability policies are not  adequate  to\r\n\r\naddress the range of medical needs, especially if  people\r\n\r\nare  to  live  to  100  years old.   It  will  be  almost\r\n\r\nimpossible  for hard cash savings to catch  up  with  the\r\n\r\ncost  of medical needs, given inflation and rising needs.\r\n\r\nHence,  a  good  way  to pass on the cost  would  be  the\r\n\r\npooling  of  risks  via insurance.   I  advocate  a  more\r\n\r\ndiversified  menu  of  plans carefully  selected  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to augment these long-term needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, indeed the CPF cut is a bitter\r\n\r\nmedicine,  but  it is a necessary though  painful  bitter\r\n\r\nmedicine.  My sense is Singapore can only continue to  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive  if  the people, the private sector  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment stay together, and stay as one.  My  sense  is\r\n\r\nthe  music has not died.  It has perhaps become much more\r\n\r\nsombre than before.  But if the three `Ps' - which is the\r\n\r\npeople,  public and private sector - could stay together,\r\n\r\nie,  whenever  we  hear someone singing to  the  Beatle's\r\n\r\ntunes  of  \"Help! I need someone\", that they are  not  so\r\n\r\nself-assured  these  days, I hope we  could,  whether  as\r\n\r\nindividuals   or   as  Members  of  Parliament   or   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, respond with John\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLennon's \"Stand by me\", so that Singapore can continue to\r\n\r\ncompose  and churn out our own music, and let the  lion's\r\n\r\nroar we hear be alive and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the retuning\r\n\r\nof  the CPF was a landmark decision.  Unlike past changes\r\n\r\nwhich  primarily  affected the  contribution  rates,  the\r\n\r\npresent   changes  touch  on  withdrawal   amounts,   the\r\n\r\ncontribution quantum and how much will be channelled into\r\n\r\nthe  Special Account.  I must commend the Government  for\r\n\r\nits  brevity and honesty in addressing our short-term and\r\n\r\nlong-term problems openly and rationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people's reaction is mixed. Employers are\r\n\r\nnaturally  happy and wish they have more.  Employees  are\r\n\r\nworried as they have to reorganise their finances and cut\r\n\r\nback  their  consumption.  I have received feedback  from\r\n\r\nthe  public and my grassroots leaders and I do hope  that\r\n\r\nthe Government can address the issues raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is on wage policy. It is clear that\r\n\r\nwe have a rigid wage structure in Singapore which becomes\r\n\r\nparticularly  acute during recessions when wages  do  not\r\n\r\nadjust  downwards fast enough.  While the National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil has been pushing for the AVC and MVC for the past\r\n\r\nfew  years, there are few takers in the unionised  sector\r\n\r\nand  even  fewer in the non-unionised sector.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nMNCs and other businesses find it cumbersome to implement\r\n\r\nthem.   A one-size-fits-all national wage policy may  not\r\n\r\nbe  suitable  for our economy which is facing  structural\r\n\r\nproblems.  Is it the right time to let go of the NWC  and\r\n\r\ninstead  leave it to employers, unions and  employees  to\r\n\r\nwork out wage matters?  This may be a better approach  to\r\n\r\nwage matters than the Government using a blunt tool, like\r\n\r\nthe  CPF,  to  macro manage the economy at  the  workers'\r\n\r\nexpense.   Is  it  the right time to explore  whether  we\r\n\r\ncould  arrive  at a laissez-faire model,  which  is  more\r\n\r\nnimble,  responsive and adaptable to  our  fast  changing\r\n\r\neconomic environment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on whether it is the right time\r\n\r\nto make the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of the economy recovering in the second\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the year, many have asked whether this  is  the\r\n\r\nright  time  to  retune  the CPF,  particularly  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates.  The reality on the ground  is  that\r\n\r\nmany companies and firms have already cut the salaries of\r\n\r\nworkers  over the past few years because of deteriorating\r\n\r\neconomic  condition.  Some are already working  alternate\r\n\r\ndays.   The  wage market was working its own  equilibrium\r\n\r\nand  determining Singapore's competitiveness.  The latest\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts  are  a further cut of workers' salaries.   The\r\n\r\njobs  that  have left Singapore left solely  not  due  to\r\n\r\nwages.   Some  of the technologies have become  obsolete.\r\n\r\nSome  wanted  to  be close to their MNC customers.   Some\r\n\r\nwanted  to be in growing markets.  Some are not convinced\r\n\r\nthat the small cut in CPF will help keep some of the jobs\r\n\r\nfrom migrating to cheaper labour cost centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the Government's decision to\r\n\r\ncap  the  future CPF employer's contribution at a maximum\r\n\r\nof  16% is a strong signal that we intend to cap wage and\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs,  and  that it will  certainly  help  the\r\n\r\ncompanies to consider staying here.  But as to whether it\r\n\r\nwill help save costs or businesses to stay here, I am not\r\n\r\nconvinced.  Perhaps the Government could have provided  a\r\n\r\nbetter  case with more detailed studies rather than  tell\r\n\r\nthis House that they rely on gut feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point is on unions. I am truly\r\n\r\nimpressed  by  the  way our unionists have  come  out  to\r\n\r\nsupport the CPF cuts as measures needed to save jobs  and\r\n\r\ncreate  new  jobs.   My sense is that  some  workers  are\r\n\r\nquestioning  the  relevance of unions  in  an  era  where\r\n\r\nemployers  hire and fire at will.  These are tough  times\r\n\r\nfor  our  union leaders.  I support them for being  frank\r\n\r\nand  discussing  the problems with their workers  openly.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to remind our union leaders that just as\r\n\r\nthey  support the Government on these CPF cuts, they have\r\n\r\nan  equally  important job in getting the  best  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers when the economy recovers.  I would like to  call\r\n\r\nupon   our  unions  to  be  equally  fervent  and  demand\r\n\r\nappropriate wages and bonuses when the economy  recovers,\r\n\r\nand not let employers off lightly when they make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood profits.  It is important that unionists be seen  to\r\n\r\nbe  championing workers' rights and fair demands in  good\r\n\r\ntimes  in  as  much  as  they call  on  workers  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices   during   bad  times.    Workers   are   very\r\n\r\ndiscerning, and how unions represent them will  determine\r\n\r\nthe  future  of unionism in Singapore.  I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthat  our  unions will get the best deal for our  workers\r\n\r\nwhen the economy turn-around comes about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Singapore companies. Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nurge  Singapore companies locating overseas  or  starting\r\n\r\nbusinesses   overseas  to  see  how  they   can   provide\r\n\r\nemployment for Singaporeans.  My message to them  is:  do\r\n\r\nnot  all  of you abandon our Singapore workers.  Many  of\r\n\r\nour  workers have worked many years in Singapore and have\r\n\r\nvaluable  experience.  I am confident that they can  help\r\n\r\npass  on  some of their skills and experience to  foreign\r\n\r\nstaff.   I  would  like to appeal to these  companies  to\r\n\r\nbring  along some of these workers with them and, in  the\r\n\r\nprocess, help reduce unemployment in Singapore.  In doing\r\n\r\nthis  National Service, I am confident it will  exemplify\r\n\r\nthese companies as good corporate citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, brain drain. Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment as to whether making Singapore a low wage cost\r\n\r\ncentre   might  make  Singapore  inadvertently   a   less\r\n\r\nattractive  place  to  work for expatriates  and,  hence,\r\n\r\ndrive  them elsewhere.  In the long run, I wonder whether\r\n\r\neven  Singaporeans may choose to settle overseas as  they\r\n\r\nmay  find that the disparity in the wage levels  and  the\r\n\r\ncost  of living is more manageable in other countries  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to Singapore.  We must ensure that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nencourage reverse brain drain due to lower wages but high\r\n\r\ncost of living.  This brings me to the main issue of cost\r\n\r\nof living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, businesses can easily choose to migrate to\r\n\r\ncheaper cost centres but, unfortunately, Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nunable  to.  Some try to save by going to Johor Baru  and\r\n\r\nBatam for cheaper shopping, but for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe more daily expenses they are unable to run away from.\r\n\r\nI wish the Government could do more to reduce the cost of\r\n\r\nliving  for  Singapore.  While the consumer  price  index\r\n\r\nshows  that  inflation is low, the reality is that  costs\r\n\r\nare arbitrarily raised in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. The SGX raised its fees\r\n\r\narbitrarily in Singapore and nobody could object  because\r\n\r\nyou  either use the SGX or you go somewhere else, because\r\n\r\nit  is  a virtual monopoly.  We have many GLCs and  other\r\n\r\nbusinesses  that will claim that business conditions  are\r\n\r\ntough and that they are helping their customers.  But yet\r\n\r\nthey  will  report  $1 billion profits  or  $500  million\r\n\r\nprofits   when  their  annual  accounts  are   presented.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  performance-based and profit-based  remuneration\r\n\r\npackage  is  making the management of these organisations\r\n\r\nruthless  in  its pursuit of profits at  the  expense  of\r\n\r\nordinary people and businesses.  In fact, the joke  among\r\n\r\nprofessionals  is  that when we deregulate  a  particular\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  price  of  the goods  or  service  goes  up\r\n\r\ncontrary  to conventional economic theory.   We  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave a market where deregulation means higher prices  for\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that we can set up an Anti-monopoly\r\n\r\nCommission,  something like the Anti-trust Commission  in\r\n\r\nother  countries, that can scrutinise all monopolies  and\r\n\r\noligopolistic market practices and see whether  they  are\r\n\r\ncolluding  or  charging unreasonable  charges  for  their\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services.  This commission should also  audit\r\n\r\nmany of our Government regulators to see whether they are\r\n\r\ndoing their jobs competently and have the public interest\r\n\r\nin  their decisions, and not always give the excuse  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  make  the public service  providers  make\r\n\r\ndecent returns on investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am glad that the DPM highlighted the case of\r\n\r\nthe Land Transport Authority reducing the fees for taxis,\r\n\r\nI  am  quite sure more can be done by the Government.   I\r\n\r\nlook forward to the Cut Waste Panel being transparent and\r\n\r\nhighlighting cases within Government and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  of  wastage and over-charging.   These\r\n\r\ncases  will certainly make other organisations take  note\r\n\r\nand   work  towards  doing  the  same.   The  inequitable\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore is that Singaporean  workers  can\r\n\r\ntake  losses  in  their salary cuts  but  public  service\r\n\r\nproviders can make good profits even in tough times,  and\r\n\r\nthis  only happens in Singapore.  While I am dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  market practice of some of the public  service\r\n\r\nproviders,  I  do not have kind words for our  own  local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  who  squeeze  Singaporeans  in  these  tough\r\n\r\ntimes,  and  I  would  just  highlight  an  example.    I\r\n\r\npatronised  a  goreng pisang stall in Pasir  Ris  housing\r\n\r\nestate.   In the past, they sold three goreng pisang  for\r\n\r\n$1.   But  suddenly, last month, they sold  three  goreng\r\n\r\npisang of the same size for $1.50.  I am not going to the\r\n\r\nstall again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many businesses in Singapore who are\r\n\r\ngreedy  and raise prices arbitrarily.  Somehow, my  sense\r\n\r\nis  that  these  price increases are not  caught  in  our\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price  Index.  In fact, with  the  confirmation\r\n\r\nthat  GST will be raised next January 2004, we can expect\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to raise prices.  I would like to  appeal  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses in Singapore to help their fellow Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  bring  down  the cost of living, settle  for  smaller\r\n\r\nprofits,  and not to make life miserable for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nby  squeezing them.  Perhaps NTUC FairPrice can take  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step by transferring the CPF savings arising  from\r\n\r\nthese  CPF  cuts to a 5% discount on all their  products.\r\n\r\nThat should herald measurable immediate cost savings  for\r\n\r\nmany Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the relief measures, Sir. While I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that the DPM announced some relief measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp   those   affected   by   the   latest   CPF   cuts,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, if one takes away the amounts set aside to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  construction  sector and  the  other  specific\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  the amount actually reaching the  worst  hit\r\n\r\npeople is very minimal.  In fact, in some cases, nothing.\r\n\r\nMy  middle  income residents have given me feedback  that\r\n\r\nthe  relief package has very little for them.   They  are\r\n\r\nthe ones worst affected by these changes.  I do hope that\r\n\r\nthe middle income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will receive some good  news  in  the  next\r\n\r\nBudget,  in  terms  of  greater  tax  relief  and   other\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the CPF figures that were provided\r\n\r\nyesterday.   Sir,  I would like to seek clarification  on\r\n\r\nthe  data  that was released by the Acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower  yesterday as regards the amounts that the  25th\r\n\r\npercentile  worker  would have  accumulated  in  his  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts.    The withdrawal amounts at age 55  were  also\r\n\r\ngiven.   We  all  know that many workers will  use  their\r\n\r\nMedisave  before they reach 55 years of age,  either  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  or their families.  I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister how much a worker can withdraw at age 55, if  he\r\n\r\nhad  used  up  all his Medisave account monies  by  then.\r\n\r\nWhat  percentage  of members would have adequate  Minimum\r\n\r\nSum in this scenario?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on tinkering the CPF scheme. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask whether the Government can indicate whether\r\n\r\nit  intends  to  stop tinkering with the CPF  system,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  CPF  would  continue to be  a  regular  tool  of\r\n\r\neconomic management.  This question is raised as it makes\r\n\r\nit  difficult  for Singaporeans to plan  their  financial\r\n\r\nfuture, as the basic premise for their financial planning\r\n\r\nis  adjusted by the Government far too regularly.  To  be\r\n\r\ncandid, I also find it confusing to plan for my long-term\r\n\r\nretirement  plans.  Employees above the age of  40  years\r\n\r\nare  confused, as regular changes are confusing  them  in\r\n\r\nhow  they  should  plan for their old age.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should state that there is a base amount which\r\n\r\nwill  never be changed and a variable range which can  be\r\n\r\naltered.   Can the Government give an assurance that  the\r\n\r\n30-36% range would be the final figure?  Or should we  be\r\n\r\nlooking  at lower figures?  Some clarity would  certainly\r\n\r\nhelp guide our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that the CPF\r\n\r\nchanges are tough measures, but hard times call for tough\r\n\r\nchoices.   As a people, we have never failed to  confront\r\n\r\nchallenges  realistically and squarely.  The way  forward\r\n\r\nis to work together - Government, people and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinesses - to bring new investments and new  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nthese  I  am  confident we can achieve.  These short-term\r\n\r\nsacrifices  by  our people to make Singapore  competitive\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  help bring growth  to  our  economy  and\r\n\r\ngreater prosperity for all in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Government on its\r\n\r\nnew CPF policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran   has  a  suggestion  for  NTUC  FairPrice   to\r\n\r\nconsider.   I  will bring the message back to  FairPrice.\r\n\r\nMay  I  assure  Members of this House that NTUC  and  its\r\n\r\nfamily  of cooperatives are considering measures to  help\r\n\r\nthose  who  are needy, especially the lower  income,  and\r\n\r\nannouncements will be made in the course of time.  And  I\r\n\r\ncan  even  ask  FairPrice to sell goreng  pisang,  if  it\r\n\r\nhelps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some workers ask: with these CPF changes, how\r\n\r\nmany jobs will be created?  How many will be saved?  They\r\n\r\nare  disappointed that there is no road map for  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.  They do not feel secure.  They want to  see  a\r\n\r\nplan  that says:  do this to get to point A, then do that\r\n\r\nto reach point B, and all will be well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are no precise answers to what\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  changes will bring.  Technology and  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy are changing too quickly for anyone to be able to\r\n\r\ndraw up blueprints that come with a guarantee.  That does\r\n\r\nnot mean there will be no jobs created or saved.  What it\r\n\r\ndoes  mean  is  that the right economic environment  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  creation and saving of jobs,  even  though\r\n\r\nthere  are  no mathematical models to give us  the  exact\r\n\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit like planning to build the bird\r\n\r\nsanctuary at Sungei Buloh.  If people asked at that time:\r\n\r\nhow  many birds will come?  What type of birds will come?\r\n\r\nHow  long will they stay before they fly away? - then the\r\n\r\nbird sanctuary might never have been built.  No one could\r\n\r\nhave given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  answers.   But the designers who  understood  bird\r\n\r\nmigratory  behaviour knew that if we  built  a  sanctuary\r\n\r\nwith  the  right environment, the birds would come.   And\r\n\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is it the same with the economy? Get the\r\n\r\neconomic and investment climate right, and the jobs  will\r\n\r\ncome.   Precisely what jobs will come, or how  many  will\r\n\r\ncome?   No one can tell.  But even as we debate  the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges in this Chamber, decision makers around the world\r\n\r\nwould have read about our strong effort to make Singapore\r\n\r\na  good  place  to invest in.  We may not even  know  who\r\n\r\nthose  investors  are.  The products  and  services  they\r\n\r\nmight  bring  here may not even have been announced  yet.\r\n\r\nBut  they  have heard of us and they will make enquiries.\r\n\r\nIf  we can bring our labour and business costs down to  a\r\n\r\nlevel  that  gives good value for money, more investments\r\n\r\nwill  come, more jobs will be created and more jobs  will\r\n\r\nbe saved.  That, we can be confident about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the companies already in Singapore, some are\r\n\r\ndoing  well.   They do not need the CPF cuts to  survive.\r\n\r\nAs  Mr Ravindran said just now, they should give some, or\r\n\r\nall,  of the savings back to their workers.  The SBF  and\r\n\r\nSNEF  have  bluntly dismissed the idea.  But  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat,  since last Thursday, when the Prime Minister  made\r\n\r\nthe   announcement,   several  companies   have   already\r\n\r\nindicated to the union leaders they will share the  gains\r\n\r\nwith  their employees.  Such enlightened managements  are\r\n\r\nto be applauded.  I urge companies that are doing well to\r\n\r\nfollow their good example in being fair to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong and other MPs pointed out that one\r\n\r\nreason  workers will have low retirement savings is  that\r\n\r\nthe  rate of return on the CPF savings is low.   In  this\r\n\r\nclimate of low returns on fixed income instruments, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult to get higher returns.  Workers should not risk\r\n\r\ntheir hard earned money on high risk investments to  seek\r\n\r\nhigher  returns.  They may lose much more than  they  can\r\n\r\ngain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC will do what we can to help. NTUC has a\r\n\r\nsavings cooperative, NTUC Thrift.  Its social mission  is\r\n\r\nto help workers put aside small sums of money every month\r\n\r\nfor  a  rainy day.  Since its formation, NTUC Thrift  has\r\n\r\nconsistently given an interest rate on the small  savings\r\n\r\nhigher   than  what  the  banks  give  on  their  savings\r\n\r\naccounts.  With this renewed impetus to ensure sufficient\r\n\r\nretirement savings for our workers, the unions will  work\r\n\r\nwith  employers and NTUC Thrift to encourage more workers\r\n\r\nto open accounts with NTUC Thrift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who wish to give the gains from the CPF\r\n\r\ncuts  as  lump sum payments can help the workers  deposit\r\n\r\nthe  money  into NTUC Thrift accounts.  To the individual\r\n\r\nworker,  it  may not seem a large sum at first.   But  if\r\n\r\nworkers can continue to set aside small sums every  month\r\n\r\nand  keep  their  money untouched for long  enough,  NTUC\r\n\r\nThrift will work hard to grow their money at better  than\r\n\r\nbank  rates.  In the long run, the money will  be  useful\r\n\r\nfor   retirement,   or  to  help  cover   a   period   of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, the rationale and\r\n\r\nobjectives of the CPF changes have been well explained by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Ministers.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for me to further elaborate.  While  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system  has been re-tuned with a lower  contribution\r\n\r\nrate,  the fundamental objectives of the CPF to meet  the\r\n\r\nbasic housing, medical and old age needs will continue to\r\n\r\nbe  preserved.   In other words, the basic social  safety\r\n\r\nnet for our workers will remain intact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the lower contribution rate, Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  need  to  make adjustments  to  their  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments,  particularly on housing, so that  they  all\r\n\r\ncould  better manage their needs and expectations.   This\r\n\r\nrequires a mindset change on the part of CPF members  and\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employability of older workers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make reference to the problem faced\r\n\r\nby  our  older  workers.   As highlighted  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   workers  aged  50  and  above  face   greater\r\n\r\ndifficulties    in    securing    re-employment     after\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  This will be a growing problem because  of\r\n\r\nour ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers must therefore take skills training\r\n\r\nseriously  and continue to upgrade themselves  to  remain\r\n\r\nrelevant.  But skills alone are not enough.  Due  to  our\r\n\r\nseniority-based wage system, our older workers  are  more\r\n\r\nexpensive than the younger ones doing the same  job.   To\r\n\r\nhelp enhance our older workers' cost competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nenable  them  to remain employed, a further reduction  on\r\n\r\nthe employer's CPF contribution rate for workers aged  50\r\n\r\nto  55  is therefore necessary.  This will help to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  cost burden of employers in retaining older  workers\r\n\r\narising  from  our  seniority-based  wage  system.   Some\r\n\r\nworkers  may be depending on their full CPF contributions\r\n\r\nin  the  Ordinary Account for their mortgage instalments.\r\n\r\nThey  may  experience shortfall in their monthly mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayments  as  a  result of the CPF changes.   To  these\r\n\r\nworkers,  measures  will be put in  place  to  help  them\r\n\r\novercome  their difficulties.  These assistance  measures\r\n\r\nhave been announced earlier by DPM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Phasing out the 50% withdrawal rule</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 42% of active CPF members who have turned\r\n\r\n55 are able to set aside the Minimum Sum of $80,000.  The\r\n\r\nproportion  of  CPF  members who are  able  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum requirements is low, partly because  of  the\r\n\r\n50%  withdrawal  rule.  Under the rule, CPF  members  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw  50%  of  their combined  Ordinary  and  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  balances.  Hence, most members do not set  aside\r\n\r\nenough  savings  in  the CPF for their  retirement.   The\r\n\r\nrevision  of  the  50% withdrawal rule  is  to  help  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers set aside their Minimum Sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some workers may be disappointed by the change in\r\n\r\nthe 50% withdrawal rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  CPF  members who reach 55 over  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears  will  not  be affected.  Even when the  withdrawal\r\n\r\nrule  starts to be phased out from 1st January  2009,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  done gradually over five years.  Also,  members\r\n\r\nwill  still  be allowed to withdraw the first $5,000,  or\r\n\r\nlesser  amounts,  in their Ordinary and Special  Accounts\r\n\r\nwhen they turn 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that workers understand the need to keep CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions as low as possible to help companies remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive and preserve jobs.  As assured by PM, DPM and\r\n\r\nMinisters,  this  will  be done without  undermining  the\r\n\r\nfundamental objectives of meeting the housing, healthcare\r\n\r\nand  retirement needs and, indeed, preserving the  social\r\n\r\nsafety net for our workers.  Changes to the CPF will also\r\n\r\nbe  introduced gradually and assistance measures will  be\r\n\r\nput  in  place to help workers who are affected by  these\r\n\r\nchanges.   Hence, workers need not be unduly  worried  by\r\n\r\nthese changes but continue to upgrade themselves so  that\r\n\r\nthey can continue to be relevant and employable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need to restructure wages apart from CPF changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making changes to the CPF system would be\r\n\r\ninsufficient  without at the same time pushing  for  wage\r\n\r\nrestructuring.  Although our wage system is  more  nimble\r\n\r\nthan before, it is not responsive enough for companies to\r\n\r\nclosely  link  their wage cost to corporate  performance.\r\n\r\nDue   to  our  seniority-based  wage  system,  individual\r\n\r\nperformance  and  contribution are  also  not  adequately\r\n\r\nrecognised  and  rewarded.  Changes  should  be  made  to\r\n\r\nreplace   the   seniority-based  wage   system   with   a\r\n\r\nperformance-based  wage  system.   With   the   impending\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the CPF, companies should therefore  quickly\r\n\r\nembark  on wage restructuring, so that they could put  in\r\n\r\nplace a highly responsive wage system to better meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir needs in a rapidly changing business environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help expedite the implementation of a nimble wage\r\n\r\nsystem  which could link rewards closely to  company  and\r\n\r\nindividual performance, the Ministry of Manpower has  set\r\n\r\nup  a  Tripartite Taskforce to study the issues and  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  As  has  been  reported  in  the  House\r\n\r\nbefore,  it is headed by the Permanent Secretary  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower with representatives from employers\r\n\r\nand  the  trade unions, and its study is expected  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the question raised by the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member,  Mr R Ravindran, concerning the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  a worker can expect to withdraw at the age of  55,\r\n\r\nif  he  has used up all the money in his Medisave Account\r\n\r\nbefore  reaching 55.  Mr Ravindran is quite  right  that,\r\n\r\nbased on the table distributed by the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  yesterday, the withdrawal amounts  assume  that\r\n\r\nthe  25th  percentile worker has not touched his Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount.  This was stated in the footnote below the table\r\n\r\ndistributed  yesterday.  If the worker uses  up  all  the\r\n\r\nmoney  in  his Medisave Account, then at age 55 he  would\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to withdraw.  In fact, he would  only  have\r\n\r\naccumulated $50,000 for his retirement account and  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  reached  the $60,000 cash  component  for  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.   The annuity payouts per  month  would  be\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly reduced to $362 from $433 per month.   If\r\n\r\nwe  assume no transfer from the Medisave Account  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account, then about 76% instead of 80% can  reach\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum Sum.  This figure may in fact be  lower,  as\r\n\r\nmany  members  consume all the money  in  their  Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount  and  then would have to top up the $25,000  from\r\n\r\ntheir   Ordinary  Account  and  Special  Account.   These\r\n\r\nnumbers reiterate my Minister's point yesterday that  our\r\n\r\nCPF  system meets basic requirements for housing, medical\r\n\r\nand retirement.  We have not over-provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on some comments made by\r\n\r\nMr Ravindran on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntinkering of the CPF rate.  Members should be aware  that\r\n\r\nthe  CPF system is an instrument for us to safeguard  our\r\n\r\nworkers' interests in three main areas: housing,  medical\r\n\r\ncare, as well as for retirement.  And this instrument has\r\n\r\nto  be  guarded very zealously.  But, from time to  time,\r\n\r\nwhen economic and business conditions change, we may need\r\n\r\nto  take  a relook at our CPF system to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  objectives  for our workers,  to  provide  for\r\n\r\ntheir social safety net, will always be safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked whether we should liberalise\r\n\r\nthe  wage  system  and leave it to  the  unions  and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies to determine wage level.  Sir, we have to  bear\r\n\r\nin  mind  that  only 23% of our workers in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nunionised.  So, a larger proportion of our workers is not\r\n\r\nunionised.   The  tripartite National Wages  Council  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a very important institution to help  provide\r\n\r\nthe  guide for determining wage levels.  Indeed, what the\r\n\r\nNWC   was   doing  in  the  past  years  was  to  provide\r\n\r\nguidelines,  rather  than to give  quantum  increases  or\r\n\r\nadjustments to our wages every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more importantly, as a former official of a\r\n\r\ntrade  union, it is for us to remember and to  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  larger contributions of unions in Singapore.   If  I\r\n\r\ncan  elaborate on this, beyond negotiating for good wages\r\n\r\nand  working  conditions, our unions  are  also  able  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the workers' long-term interest.  In a changing\r\n\r\nbusiness and economic condition, the three key areas that\r\n\r\nI  think most unions and union leaders concern themselves\r\n\r\nwith remain intact:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Fair wages;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Fair play; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Job security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing business and economic conditions\r\n\r\nnecessitate  employers as well as unions to look  at  all\r\n\r\nthese three issues differently.  Yes, we can expect  that\r\n\r\nthere is no more lifelong employment for most workers, if\r\n\r\nnot  for all workers.  But, at the same time, despite the\r\n\r\nchanges in the business and economic conditions, our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions  are working hard to ensure that some form of  job\r\n\r\nsecurity can still be enjoyed by our workers, even though\r\n\r\nthere would be constant churning in the economy.  So,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not look at the role of the unions only to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  the maximum benefits in terms of pay and salary  for\r\n\r\nour  workers.   They are doing more than just  that.   In\r\n\r\nterms of training, which is to provide the most important\r\n\r\ntool  for our workers to be relevant and employable,  our\r\n\r\nunions  actually  spearheaded the  birth  of  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP).  I remember that in  1996,\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC,  together with unions in Singapore, looked  at\r\n\r\nthe  issues of structural unemployment in Europe and came\r\n\r\nout with the idea of starting the SRP which was taken  up\r\n\r\nby  the  Government as a national programme a year  after\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, as mentioned by Mr Matthias\r\n\r\nYao,  our  unions have also been very active  in  helping\r\n\r\nmanage the cost of living in Singapore.  NTUC's family  - FairPrice, Healthcare and other cooperatives - has helped\r\n\r\nSingapore workers stretch their dollar.  And, during  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  times  in  the  past,  the  union  family   in\r\n\r\nSingapore has given away a lot of benefits to our workers\r\n\r\nthrough the cooperatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while Singapore workers feel that their wages\r\n\r\nhave shrunk and that retrenchments may be looming, it  is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to help them understand that the  unions\r\n\r\nhave played a very important role in helping them to keep\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  by agreeing to measures like CPF rate  cuts,\r\n\r\npromoting  training and ensuring that fair play  and  job\r\n\r\nsecurity continue to be practised in workplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like also to thank the hon. Member,\r\n\r\nMiss  Penny  Low, for her suggestions for more  insurance\r\n\r\nschemes, using CPF savings.  I am sure the CPF Board  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Manpower will look into her suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate\r\n\r\nin this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first listened to PM's speech on the CPF cuts\r\n\r\nlast  Thursday,  I  was aghast and  taken  aback  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intent  on  placing  the  burden  of   high\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost  solely  as  the  responsibility  of   our\r\n\r\nworkers.   This  was very unfair.  I was pretty  troubled\r\n\r\nand  upset that our Government likes to slice and squeeze\r\n\r\nthe  earnings of our workers at the first instance of any\r\n\r\neconomic trouble.  This is especially so, when PM gave no\r\n\r\nannouncement of any intent to cut the civil  service  and\r\n\r\nhis  bloated  Government bureaucracy which,  as  Dr  Marc\r\n\r\nFaber   said   recently,  that  the   Republic's   costly\r\n\r\nbureaucracy and expensive Government add to the high cost\r\n\r\nof doing business here.  This expensive Government places\r\n\r\nan  unnecessary heavy burden on the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I had prepared a very bitter critique of our\r\n\r\nGovernment  last Thursday night, many of  the  points  of\r\n\r\nwhich  were brought up and very well expressed by Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang, the MP for Hougang, on Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after listening to DPM Lee's comprehensive\r\n\r\nrelief  and cost-cutting packages, I must say that  I  am\r\n\r\nmuch  consoled that this Government is not  that  callous\r\n\r\nand  unfeeling  to the difficulties and problems  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   At the very least, it intends to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nthe  jobless in our society and teach them how  to  fish.\r\n\r\nThis  I  am much satisfied, and thankful that the results\r\n\r\nof   growing   political  competition  are  pushing   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be  more attentive and sensitive  to  the\r\n\r\nfeelings  and  aspirations of our  people.   I  therefore\r\n\r\ndiscarded  my original plan for the very biting criticism\r\n\r\nof our Government and rewrote this speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now go to my first point.\r\n\r\nThis  3%  cut in CPF alone will not ensure that Singapore\r\n\r\nstays  competitive.  Neither will it bring in  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nMy  gut feel is that small employers and bosses are going\r\n\r\nto  take  the 3% saving on salaries to upgrade their  own\r\n\r\nlifestyle and luxuries.  For example, if you are the boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof a small struggling company with a salary cost of about\r\n\r\n$100,000,  a  3% cut in employers' CPF contribution  will\r\n\r\nresult in a saving of $3,000.  There is nothing much  you\r\n\r\ncan do with this saving, and chances are that some bosses\r\n\r\nwill  use this $3,000 windfall to buy a new Mercedes Benz\r\n\r\nor  upgrade to first-class seats and hotel rooms when  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  travel.  I hope employers will not  abuse  this\r\n\r\nsacrifice of the workers for their own consumption gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this 3% cut will only slow down the exodus of\r\n\r\njobs  to  China  and India.  This is because  the  target\r\n\r\nmarket  of these MNCs is not in this region but in  China\r\n\r\nand  India.  Unless Southeast Asia bucks up and  improves\r\n\r\non  its economy and purchasing power as a region, we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to miss out on the investment flows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal is for the Government to spend more\r\n\r\neffort and resources to help promote the economies of our\r\n\r\nimmediate ASEAN neighbours and expedite the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a single common ASEAN market.  In this way, when  the\r\n\r\nASEAN economy improves its purchasing power, the tide  of\r\n\r\ninvestment will return to Southeast Asia and we will  all\r\n\r\nfloat higher.  I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nand   the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  can  be  more\r\n\r\nproductive in pushing for an earlier date than the stated\r\n\r\n2020  for the single market of 530 million people  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my second point concerns the\r\n\r\ninvestment  return on CPF savings.  The CPF Board  should\r\n\r\nseriously  look  into how it can increase the  investment\r\n\r\nreturns for its members.  Simply buying Government  bonds\r\n\r\nat  2.5%  interest and then lending the money to HDB  for\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans  is not doing justice to  our  retirement\r\n\r\nfunds.   CPF  members with money locked in for  the  long\r\n\r\nterm  should  not  be  forced to do National  Service  by\r\n\r\nlending  the money to the Government to lend to  the  HDB\r\n\r\nfor  its  social  objective at the measly  2.5%  interest\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Government and the GIC can do\r\n\r\nmore in this area to provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  expertise for CPF members.  My suggestion  is  to\r\n\r\nconsider and encourage the regular investment of the  CPF\r\n\r\nmoney in a group of tracker fund indexes of the developed\r\n\r\nand  developing economies around the world.  In this way,\r\n\r\nthe  investment return is pegged relative to the economic\r\n\r\nperformance  of the global economy.  And, if the  economy\r\n\r\nstagnates, we will not be too far off, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this point on CPF and HDB mortgage, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB has failed in its duty to source  for  its\r\n\r\nbest  loans  for its mortgagors recently.  If  commercial\r\n\r\nbank mortgage rates for HDB are going at 1% to 1.5%,  how\r\n\r\ncan  the  HDB be charging its mortgagors 2.6%  and  still\r\n\r\ncall  it a subsidised rate?  I do not understand.  I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB should be more proactive and  be  free  to\r\n\r\nsource its funds from cheaper lenders (other than the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard),  especially  if the market provides  lower  rates\r\n\r\nthan what the Government charges HDB at 2.5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to my third point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the Government, the civil service and the statutory\r\n\r\nboards  could  still  do  much  to  help  reduce  overall\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.  As freelance journalist, Lee  Han  Shih,\r\n\r\nsuggested  in an article for the Government  to  cut  its\r\n\r\nexpenditure by 30%, and which DPM Lee had on Friday  said\r\n\r\nabsurd, I wonder why!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think DPM owes it to Singaporeans to explain why\r\n\r\nit  is  absurd for the Government to cut its  expenditure\r\n\r\nand  reduce  the budget by 30%.  If it is not  30%,  then\r\n\r\n20%,  and if it is not 20%, at least 10%.  Is it  because\r\n\r\nwages   of   civil  servants,  Ministers  and   political\r\n\r\nappointees  are sticky and cannot be cut?  Is  Government\r\n\r\ntoo top-heavy and over-staffed?  Why cannot the Ministers\r\n\r\nbe  given  dual appointments and portfolios like  in  the\r\n\r\npast and cut down on the number of Ministers in the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table distributed by Mr Lim Boon Heng,\r\n\r\nMinister without Portfolio, on Friday, I am surprised  to\r\n\r\nsee  that Singapore CEOs are earning around slightly over\r\n\r\n$200,000 per year.  If that is so, does that mean that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  Ministers are overpaid and their wages have gone out\r\n\r\nof line with market rates?   Has their productivity risen\r\n\r\nto  make them wage competitive?  Maybe the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwould like to address these concerns in his reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time for the Government to show moral\r\n\r\nleadership  and solidarity with the people, by  giving  a\r\n\r\nstrong signal to investors and citizens alike that it  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to  cut  down its own fat to help  trim  overall\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  living cost.  Just like  a  Straits  Times\r\n\r\nForum  writer  on  Friday said, \"I  am  appalled  by  the\r\n\r\nexcessive  use  of  plasma TVs in the civil  service  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, and this money saved could go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  to  trim  the  excessive expenditure  in  Government\r\n\r\nservices.\"   This will be my first proposal for  the  Cut\r\n\r\nWaste Panel to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on behalf of many Singaporeans, I want to\r\n\r\nexpress  support  and  thanks to our  new  Acting  Health\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr  Khaw Boon Wan, for cutting  cost  and  the\r\n\r\nbudget  of the Health Ministry.  I hope the Ministers  in\r\n\r\nother Ministries will follow in his footsteps to cut cost\r\n\r\nand  budget.  Like he has said, \"It can be done.\"  Please\r\n\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to my last point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I\r\n\r\nspeak  for  many businessmen, retailers and  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nalike in asking the Government to delay the GST hike  for\r\n\r\nanother year.  I will agree with DPM's argument that  GST\r\n\r\ntaxes  the rich more than the poor, and that the proposed\r\n\r\n1%  increase next year will raise about $650 million  for\r\n\r\nthe Government in 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what is $650 million to the Government?\r\n\r\nIt  is  small, like ikan bilis - as what DPM said in  his\r\n\r\nBudget  reply  to  me.  A $2.3 billion  deficit  is  tiny\r\n\r\ncompared to the size of the Singapore economy, and we can\r\n\r\nwell afford to go for this small fiscal deficit for these\r\n\r\nfew lean years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the economy recovers, do we believe that\r\n\r\nour  economy  will recover?  Does the Government  believe\r\n\r\nthat we will see more good years after the heavy rain?  I\r\n\r\ndo,  and I believe when the economy recovers, the  fields\r\n\r\nwill blossom and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neveryone  will  have a good field day.  By  then,  nobody\r\n\r\nwill  seriously  object  to  the  Government  wanting  to\r\n\r\ncollect  more in GST to prepare for another rainy season.\r\n\r\nAnd  after giving a good fiscal stimulus to the  economy,\r\n\r\nthe  Government can expect a bigger catch with the 1% GST\r\n\r\nthan the current ikan bilis that it is expected to net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I beseech the Government to give more\r\n\r\ntime for the small ikan bilis to grow bigger.  Do not  be\r\n\r\nin  a  haste  to  balance  the  deficit  and  weaken  any\r\n\r\nprospects of growth and recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nexpect more substantial policy initiatives from our world-class Ministers than a simple reduction of employer's CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  CPF cuts should only be taken  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort  when all other alternatives have been  considered\r\n\r\nand  implemented.  Our people cannot be expected to  take\r\n\r\non  the  low salaries offered in China and India. Neither\r\n\r\ncan  they be expected to bear the main brunt of any  cost\r\n\r\ncutting measures consistently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and GLCs are also required to make\r\n\r\nsacrifices by going for deficits and losses in bad years,\r\n\r\nhopefully  to recover back in good years.   This  is  the\r\n\r\ncycle of life and investing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end off on a brighter note, I would like to urge\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans to look up. The dark clouds  will  pass\r\n\r\nbecause  present-day Singapore has two biggest  resources\r\n\r\nthat  will see us through any major difficulty, and  that\r\n\r\nis,  our  talented people and our huge capital  reserves.\r\n\r\nWe should not be afraid to seize this opportunity that  a\r\n\r\ncrisis has brought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  firstly, I would like to thank Members of the House\r\n\r\nfor  their  suggestions and points made  on  two  of  the\r\n\r\nschemes  that  MCDS  is  managing,  that  is,  the   Work\r\n\r\nAssistance Programme (WAP) as well as HOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Warren Lee have suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we  help unemployed Singaporeans to train  for  new\r\n\r\njobs  and  provide them with financial assistance.   Some\r\n\r\nMembers   have   also  given  encouraging   examples   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are determined to find jobs and be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon shared her CDC's\r\n\r\nexperience  and  her  observation that  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly  prepared to make the necessary  adjustments\r\n\r\nand  to  take up low-income jobs.  NMP Mr Nithiah  Nandan\r\n\r\nhas  also mentioned some of the examples that he has come\r\n\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Assistance Programme (WAP) is, in fact,\r\n\r\ndesigned with these resilient Singaporeans in mind.   The\r\n\r\nprogramme,  announced  by DPM Lee last  week,  is  really\r\n\r\naimed  at helping these Singaporeans seek employment  and\r\n\r\ntransit  quickly back to work.  Financial  assistance  is\r\n\r\nonly  an  interim measure while our recipients  look  for\r\n\r\njobs under the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAP beneficiaries will receive job placement\r\n\r\nservices and short-term financial assistance to help them\r\n\r\ntide  over this difficult period.  Those who have  tried,\r\n\r\nbut  are  still unable to secure jobs over a  three-month\r\n\r\nperiod, will be given more personal attention by  a  case\r\n\r\nmanagement   officer.    With  this   support   and   the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  spirit of self-reliance, we  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  WAP  recipients  will  find  jobs  and   be\r\n\r\nindependent within 3-6 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong has proposed that we should do more\r\n\r\nto  help  affected  families cope with  their  children's\r\n\r\nschooling assistance.  Let me assure him that under  WAP,\r\n\r\nprovisions  are available to help deserving families  pay\r\n\r\nfor  schooling  expenses.  This  will  cover  school  and\r\n\r\ntransport fees and a one-off grant to cover miscellaneous\r\n\r\nexpenses,  such as uniform as well as textbook  expenses.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also other sources of help available  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, for example, the School Pocket Money Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House that the CDCs have\r\n\r\nbeen gearing up to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplement the WAP programme from October this year.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has provided more resources to beef  up  their\r\n\r\nemployment-related services.  A total of 83 officers will\r\n\r\nbe  stationed at the CDCs to provide employment services.\r\n\r\n53  of these staff are being trained with case management\r\n\r\nskills.    They   are  taught  skills   on   motivational\r\n\r\ncounselling   and  techniques  to  help  the   unemployed\r\n\r\nidentify barriers and needs.  This training would  enable\r\n\r\nthe  case  management officers to be  more  effective  in\r\n\r\nhelping WAP beneficiaries work towards employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the job placement services in the CDCs to\r\n\r\nbe given a significant boost with these additional staff.\r\n\r\nWe  are  aware  that apart from financial and  employment\r\n\r\nassistance,  some  of  the  families  could  have   other\r\n\r\nproblems  that need to be addressed, for example,  family\r\n\r\nviolence, as Mdm Cynthia Phua has pointed out.  The  case\r\n\r\nmanagement officer will also look into the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  and  link  the  family up  with  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nagencies,  for example, the Family Service  Centres,  for\r\n\r\nassistance and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs are also fine-tuning their work procedures\r\n\r\nto  ensure that all social assistance applicants who  are\r\n\r\nfit to work will be referred for job placement services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Singaporeans who have already lost their\r\n\r\njobs  and need help immediately. Between now and October,\r\n\r\nthey can approach the CDCs for help and advice. Those who\r\n\r\nare  assessed to be eligible will be assisted  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting employment and social assistance schemes  first.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be  given  short-term  interim  help  and  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  WAP  come 1st October  2003.   Likewise,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are interested in HOPE can also approach\r\n\r\nthe CDCs for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members also spoke about the Home Ownership\r\n\r\nPlus  Education (HOPE) programme.  I would like to  thank\r\n\r\nMr Ahmad Khalis and others who have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpressed their support for the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also received feedback, particularly on the\r\n\r\neligibility criteria. Many felt that the criteria  should\r\n\r\nbe relaxed to allow more low-income families to benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate the objective of\r\n\r\nHOPE.   It is designed as an upstream programme to target\r\n\r\nyoung,  low-income families.  The objective is to  enable\r\n\r\ntheir children to get a better headstart in life.  To  do\r\n\r\nso, we are encouraging the couples to keep their families\r\n\r\nsmall  so  that they can concentrate their  resources  on\r\n\r\ntheir  children.  The benefits given are  meant  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  earn a better living, perhaps buy a home, and  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  marriage strong so that they can provide a  stable\r\n\r\nand  supportive family environment for their children  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from educational opportunities offered to  them.\r\n\r\nThis  will provide the best chance for these families  to\r\n\r\nbreak out of the negative poverty cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMP Mrs Fang Ai Lian commented specifically on the\r\n\r\neducational criteria - that a poor family with 4 GCE  'O'\r\n\r\nlevels  would  not  qualify for  HOPE.    Currently,  the\r\n\r\ncriterion  is  2  GCE 'O' levels.  The 2 GCE  'O'  levels\r\n\r\ncriterion  is meant to target couples whose opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  skills  upgrading are potentially limited  by  their\r\n\r\nlack  of  educational qualifications.   The  entry  level\r\n\r\nrequirement for polytechnic courses as well as higher ITE\r\n\r\nNitec  courses is 3 GCE `O' levels.  Hence, those who  do\r\n\r\nnot  meet  this  requirement, ie, 2 GCE  `O'  levels  and\r\n\r\nbelow,  are  likely to face difficulties advancing  their\r\n\r\ntraining and education in post-secondary institutions and\r\n\r\ntherefore need additional help.  That is how we  set  the\r\n\r\ncriterion at 2 GCE 'O' levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received suggestions to extend HOPE to cover\r\n\r\npoor  families  with more than two children  as  well  as\r\n\r\ndivorcees.   Ms Braema Mathi has also made an appeal  for\r\n\r\nHOPE  to  cover single parent families.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate the objectives of HOPE, ie, to encourage  young\r\n\r\ncouples  to keep their family strong and intact  so  that\r\n\r\nthe children can grow up in a stable environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policies should not encourage behaviour that\r\n\r\ngoes against our family values.  Notwithstanding this,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  Ms Braema Mathi that some of these  families\r\n\r\nare  genuinely in need and not all can be assisted  under\r\n\r\nHOPE  and  WAP.  For example, there are Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  unable to work because of old age, illness or  care-giving responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from WAP and HOPE, there are, in fact, many\r\n\r\nexisting schemes to help people in need.  My Ministry has\r\n\r\ncompiled a list of social assistance schemes provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  I am requesting the Clerk of Parliament\r\n\r\nto  distribute the list for Members' reference.   [Copies\r\n\r\nof  list  distributed  to Members.]   This  is  just  for\r\n\r\nMembers'  reference  because many of  these  schemes  are\r\n\r\npublic information.  Many Members already know about many\r\n\r\nof these schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These schemes cater to Singaporeans with different\r\n\r\nneeds   -  those who require long term assistance,  those\r\n\r\nwho  need interim help with rental and utilities arrears,\r\n\r\nand those who need support with child and student care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi may be pleased to know that single\r\n\r\nparent families may be eligible for the interim financial\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme,  the  rent and  utilities  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  and the centre-based financial assistance  scheme\r\n\r\nfor  childcare.  Single mothers who are not ready to seek\r\n\r\nemployment  due  to  care-giving responsibilities,  could\r\n\r\nalso be given some short- to medium-term help.  Those who\r\n\r\nare  ready to seek work will be placed on WAP.  They will\r\n\r\nalso receive financial support to place their children in\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres.  This is to ensure that the  children\r\n\r\nare taken care of while the mother may be working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have expressed concern about those who\r\n\r\nare not covered by the financial assistance schemes.   Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  Abidin  Rasheed mentioned the middle  income,  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran highlighted the `sandwiched groups' who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarginally above the income ceiling criteria, and Mdm  Ho\r\n\r\nGeok  Choo even referred to those earning between $3,000-$6,000 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We empathise with the struggles of these families\r\n\r\nand  recognise  that  they too need help  when  the  main\r\n\r\nbreadwinner   is   retrenched.    For   this   group   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, work is still the best form of welfare.  In\r\n\r\nthe  process  of seeking re-employment, one main  barrier\r\n\r\nfaced  by  this  group is their expectations.   If  these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   are   prepared  to  make   the   necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments  and  moderate their expectations,  and  some\r\n\r\nMembers of the House have indicated that many of them are\r\n\r\nwilling to do so, we will do our best to facilitate their\r\n\r\njob seeking efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned earlier that the CDCs have beefed\r\n\r\nup  their employment service capabilities with more  than\r\n\r\n80  additional employment officers.  I believe that  with\r\n\r\nthis  enhanced capability, we can help more Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nincluding  those from the middle income  group,  to  find\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind the House that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  schemes  are  not the  only  source  of  help\r\n\r\navailable  to  Singaporeans.   The  CDCs  and  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations have also come up with their own programmes\r\n\r\nto  complement the Government schemes.  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  genuinely  in  need can find help  either  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or in the community.  This is in line with our\r\n\r\n'Many Helping Hands' approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mdm Cynthia Phua have raised\r\n\r\nconcerns over the increase in fees for sports facilities.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I am a little bit surprised because this has not\r\n\r\nbeen formally announced yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidises  the use of sports facilities.   For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  average cost of operating the swimming pool is $3.50\r\n\r\nper  user, excluding depreciation cost.  But today,  each\r\n\r\nadult  pays  only $1.00 per entry with no  limit  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber of hours used.  So, that is a subsidy of $2.50  or\r\n\r\n71%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren and senior citizens pay even less, ie, 50 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy for all the SSC sports facilities\r\n\r\namounts  to approximately $18.8 million a year, excluding\r\n\r\ndepreciation costs.  This level of subsidy is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nvery  high, and is a significant proportion of  the  cash\r\n\r\ngrant  given by MCDS to SSC, which stands at  about  $117\r\n\r\nmillion  this year.  So, more than 20% goes to  subsidise\r\n\r\nsports  facilities.   It is not  right  for  MCDS  to  do\r\n\r\nnothing about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the two-phased increase, including the\r\n\r\nsecond   increase  in  July  2004,  SSC  will  still   be\r\n\r\nsubsidising  some 60% of the total cost of operating  the\r\n\r\nsports   facilities.   We  will  formally  announce   the\r\n\r\nincrease  soon.   But  let  me say  that  even  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease,  we will still be subsidising 60% of the  total\r\n\r\ncost of operating the sports facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC last revised fees and charges for its sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  1997, six years ago.  The  increase  that\r\n\r\ntime  was  about  10%.  SSC actually considered  revising\r\n\r\nfees  in  2000  and  2001.  But on both  occasions,  MCDS\r\n\r\ndecided  against  it  because of the economic  situation.\r\n\r\nSir, increasing fees is not something that we do lightly.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, we do it very reluctantly.  Our problem is that\r\n\r\nthere  is  really no good time to increase fees. However,\r\n\r\nif we continue to defer doing so, the quantum of increase\r\n\r\nwill be greater when we eventually have to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the impact of the fee revision on the\r\n\r\npublic,  SSC  will be implementing the revisions  in  two\r\n\r\nphases.   The  first  phase will  take  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nOctober  2003  and followed by a second revision  on  1st\r\n\r\nJuly  2004.   The details will be announced in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will continue to be concession rates for\r\n\r\nchildren, senior citizens and schools.  Furthermore,  SSC\r\n\r\nhas  introduced stored value cards for the swimming  pool\r\n\r\nusers   which   will  allow  some  savings  for   regular\r\n\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option to control costs is to close\r\n\r\nfacilities  that  are under-utilised.  Mdm  Cynthia  Phua\r\n\r\nmentioned  the closure of swimming pools.  In  June  this\r\n\r\nyear, we closed six swimming pools, including one in  Mdm\r\n\r\nCynthia  Phua's constituency.  We did bring  forward  the\r\n\r\nclosure  because of SARS which had resulted in  a  severe\r\n\r\ndrop  in  attendance.  The grassroots organisations  were\r\n\r\nnotified one month in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should cut costs and increase\r\n\r\nrevenues from other sources.  In the past few years,  SSC\r\n\r\nhas   cut   manpower  costs  by  employing   part-timers,\r\n\r\ninstalling ticketing machines and coin-operated  lockers.\r\n\r\nIt  has  also reduced utility costs by cutting  down  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  pumps  running during  the  night  and  using\r\n\r\nrainwater for backwash at swimming complexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has also tried to increase other sources of\r\n\r\nrevenues  from  its sports facilities,  such  as  renting\r\n\r\nparts of the premises to retail shops.  We recognise that\r\n\r\nwe  may not be enterprising enough and, therefore, we are\r\n\r\nopen  to explore other ideas to increase revenues.  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to explore further with Mr Ong Ah Heng his idea  of\r\n\r\nrearing fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia said that he had\r\n\r\nmoderated  his  speech  after  listening  to  the  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures that had been announced.  He said that at  least\r\n\r\nthe Government was aware and was in tune somehow with the\r\n\r\nfeelings  and aspirations of our people.  Let  me  assure\r\n\r\nhim  -  he has left  -  that the Government is always  in\r\n\r\ntouch  and  in tune with the feelings and aspirations  of\r\n\r\nour  people.  Otherwise, it would not be possible to come\r\n\r\nout with all these well-targeted relief measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that our days ahead are going to\r\n\r\nbe  brighter.  Our people are united with the Government,\r\n\r\npartly  because  we are in touch with  the  feelings  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of the people.  The Government was  able  to\r\n\r\nmobilise the whole nation to defeat SARS.  If we talk  to\r\n\r\nthe workers and the grassroots leaders,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall of them acknowledge that the CPF cut is very painful.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, all of them understand why it has\r\n\r\nto  be done.  Nobody likes to receive less money in their\r\n\r\naccounts.  But if it is necessary to preserve jobs,  they\r\n\r\nwill do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why I said that the days are going to\r\n\r\nbe  brighter  is, I do agree with Mr Steve Chia  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  talented people and we have got financial reserves.\r\n\r\nAfter I came to Ministry of Education, I went to NUS  and\r\n\r\nNTU  to  visit the laboratories to look at the  R&D  work\r\n\r\nthat is being done.  They introduced me to many projects.\r\n\r\nTo  be honest, the projects are so complex that I did not\r\n\r\nunderstand  them.  But I fully understand one thing  that\r\n\r\nour  universities told me.  They said  that  top  US  and\r\n\r\nEuropean  universities, after looking at their  projects,\r\n\r\nhave come out with proposals to work together.  To me, it\r\n\r\nmeans three things.  Firstly, our R&D initiatives are  on\r\n\r\nthe  right  track; secondly, the quality of our  research\r\n\r\nworkers  is  high;  and,  thirdly,  there  must  be   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of breaking through.   Indeed,  with  world-class universities coming in, the probability of breaking\r\n\r\nthrough  will be even greater.  And if there were  to  be\r\n\r\nsignificant breakthroughs, then the investment  that  has\r\n\r\ngone into promoting R&D will pay off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago, I went to give away prizes to some JC\r\n\r\nstudents on a programme called the Science Talent Search.\r\n\r\nThey  presented their proposals and projects.   Again,  I\r\n\r\ncould not understand.  They are JC students.  I did study\r\n\r\nScience  up to \"A\" level. Yet, I cannot understand  their\r\n\r\nprojects.  But one thing I heard from the chief judge,  a\r\n\r\nyoung  American  Professor, and he was  very  clear.   He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"You ought to be proud of your young people.  These\r\n\r\nprojects are simply fabulous.  How I wish my chaps  would\r\n\r\nalso do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have talented young people. These talented\r\n\r\nyoung  people have been given space to grow.  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that they will be able to find their feet and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to do well.  How can this be achieved if\r\n\r\nwe  are not in tune with their feelings as well as  their\r\n\r\naspirations?  I do not understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the fact that every cent\r\n\r\ncounts  and, therefore, we have established a  Cut  Waste\r\n\r\nPanel.   We have also talked about reviewing salaries  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  All these will be put in place  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.  I will urge Mr Steve Chia to look at the results\r\n\r\nbefore  coming  out to accuse us of having  an  expensive\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In fact, if he has any specific proposal for\r\n\r\nthe  Cut Waste Panel, I think he should put something out\r\n\r\nmore clearly so that we can take a look at it.  This is a\r\n\r\ntime  for  us  to  be united to face the challenge  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am somehow surprised by Mr Chandra Mohan who\r\n\r\nsuddenly  talked about merger.  I may not  have  got  him\r\n\r\ntotally   right,  but  I  think  he  talked   about   the\r\n\r\npossibility of making merger easier.  I do not  know  why\r\n\r\nhe  feels we should look at merger just because  we  face\r\n\r\nsome  setbacks.  In fact, I raised his comments  with  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders yesterday.  All of  them  were  quite\r\n\r\nshocked.   This is the time to be united as a  nation  to\r\n\r\novercome  the  current difficulties.  So  my  message  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is this: Together we shall overcome.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  Chinese proverb that says that the moon is  there,\r\n\r\nexcept  that  it is covered by dark clouds.   The  clouds\r\n\r\nwill  disappear.  We will see the moon again.   The  moon\r\n\r\nhas always been there and the best is yet to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I want to make a\r\n\r\nclarification.   I  think  there  has  been  a   briefing\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the  Singapore  Sports  Council   to   the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   leaders,  as  well   as   members   of   the\r\n\r\nConstituency Sports Club, regarding the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nentrance fees for the sports facilities.  So I think  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council has not briefed him properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  want  to say the same thing.  Why did the SSC  officer\r\n\r\nnot tell him the truth that they did conduct a briefing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  second  clarification I want  to  make  is:  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister giving the message to all Singaporeans that  the\r\n\r\nswimming  pool admission fees will increase  with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom 1st October despite DPM's call on Ministries to  cut\r\n\r\ncost  and  not to increase fees?  I just want to  make  a\r\n\r\nclarification whether the increase in admission fees will\r\n\r\nbe implemented with effect from 1st October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for the clarification.  Our plan is to implement\r\n\r\nthe increase with effect from 1st October 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for letting me join in the debate.   At  this\r\n\r\nstage, where so many speakers have spoken, I just want to\r\n\r\nhighlight a few points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister identified the critical cause of\r\n\r\nthis  slack  growth in Singapore last  week  as  that  of\r\n\r\ndemand.  He said that we have to cut costs in order to be\r\n\r\ncompetitive  with  the other growing economies  in  Asia,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  China  and  India,  and  in  the  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.   Assuming  that wages for  SMEs  and  smaller\r\n\r\nbusinesses  constitute  50% of business  cost,  I  think,\r\n\r\noverall  in Singapore it is nearer 30-40% for the average\r\n\r\nbusiness unit in Singapore, which includes a lot of MNCs,\r\n\r\na  3%  reduction in the CPF rate by employers as proposed\r\n\r\nwill  only  lead  to  about 1-2% of overall  savings  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   Hence, it is not likely to be the  solution\r\n\r\nfor  employment generating growth in the economy that  we\r\n\r\nhave to tackle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, other costs - rentals, statutory costs,\r\n\r\ntransport  - have to be adjusted downwards as  well,  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  cost packages and reductions  have  been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by DPM a few days ago.  As my colleagues  have\r\n\r\nargued,  no  doubt these have to be reduced significantly\r\n\r\nto  have  any  major  impact, but it  is  only  half  the\r\n\r\nsolution.  The other possibly more important half has not\r\n\r\nbeen  addressed in this debate, and it is how to generate\r\n\r\nmore employment growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the current measures as proposed can do is to\r\n\r\nbuy us some time.  There is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwindow of opportunity for us to adjust and to retune  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  And we have to make good use of that time  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  buying for companies to postpone giving  up  and\r\n\r\nclosing  down  and  moving  overseas  to  China  or   the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, or even moving some processes  to\r\n\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had actually visited the Tata Consultancy Services\r\n\r\nCompany  of  India  four years ago  in  Chennai  (Madras)\r\n\r\nIndia,  and  knew  that they were doing back-end  process\r\n\r\nwork  for a certain Western European airline there.   The\r\n\r\nWestern European airline company is still around.   There\r\n\r\nwere  rows of tables for young Indian men and women, some\r\n\r\nof  them,  not  all, are graduates.  I did  not  get  the\r\n\r\nimpression  of  active  productivity,  but  it  was  very\r\n\r\ncheaply done.  Cost advantage was evident to me.  That is\r\n\r\nwhy  competitive airline companies and others move  there\r\n\r\nto do their labour intensive and routine work.  I am sure\r\n\r\nby  now  they  would have made a few good notches  up  in\r\n\r\nproductivity because companies from other industries have\r\n\r\nalso moved there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can hope from this exercise is a window of\r\n\r\nopportunity to readjust our costs and to generate  demand\r\n\r\nin  the economy so that more growth can take place in the\r\n\r\neconomy,  especially  employment generating  growth.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  talk  glibly  about the  jobless  growth  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and  pretend the problem, like  the  poor,  will\r\n\r\nalways  have to be with us.  We have to solve it with  so\r\n\r\nmany talented people that we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This window of opportunity we have to battle is a\r\n\r\npassing  window.   If  what we  can  achieve  with  these\r\n\r\nproposed  CPF cuts is to buy time, then we must seriously\r\n\r\nask what we must do to raise demand.  It may be that some\r\n\r\nof  our economy's investments in the past few years  have\r\n\r\nbeen   in   sectors  that  are  slackening   away,   like\r\n\r\nelectronics and construction, and we have to raise demand\r\n\r\nacross  the board.  For demand to be raised, in order  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  growth, consumer spending must  be  raised,  as\r\n\r\nwell as investments, local or foreign.  Tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nburden accordingly, including statutory costs, have to be\r\n\r\nlowered.  I believe many of the investments we have  been\r\n\r\nattracting in the past few years are very sizeable plants\r\n\r\nemploying  few  workers.  Have we  forgotten  to  attract\r\n\r\nperhaps  less  lumpy, high-tech investments,  or  smaller\r\n\r\nfirms  who  may  have niche processes  and  have  special\r\n\r\ntechnologies which need not necessarily be in big billion\r\n\r\ndollar plants?  Such medium-size investments may use more\r\n\r\nlabour and have more linkages with the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we may not have so well-educated older\r\n\r\nworkers,  we  must not forget that they were the  workers\r\n\r\nduring the period we made the most rapid growth.  We  can\r\n\r\nstill  employ our older workers usefully and it would  be\r\n\r\nwrong  to  think  that  they  cannot  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   Of  course,  there  has  to  be  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining, which should be specially tailored for  them.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  have we asked ourselves why  and  how  our\r\n\r\nshipyards,  ship-repair and offshore  sectors  are  still\r\n\r\ndoing fine in spite of all similar problems of wage costs\r\n\r\nand  demand they have been faced with for so many  years?\r\n\r\nOf  course, there had been consolidation in that industry\r\n\r\nearlier.   Which  industry does not  face  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nconsolidation  problem  of  players  at  some  stage   or\r\n\r\nanother?  But they are still hiring now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need business investments from more diverse\r\n\r\nsectors  with  their  own  special  niches.   But   these\r\n\r\ninvestments  we  need  must help  us  in  employment  for\r\n\r\nworkers.   Diversity in investments in size and  industry\r\n\r\nsectors will give Singapore an added insurance and buffer\r\n\r\nin  its  future growth strategy.  Because we are a  small\r\n\r\nopen  economy and a nation-state, we need this  diversity\r\n\r\nto  balance  off  sectoral risks.  We are  unlike  a  big\r\n\r\ncountry  or any economy where they can aggregate out  the\r\n\r\nrisk  by  different  regional developments  within  their\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are always looking at how we compare in wage\r\n\r\ncosts  with  other countries, whether it  is  the  United\r\n\r\nStates,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina  or  India,  we  are missing  out  the  other  more\r\n\r\nimportant half of the picture of economic growth.   Costs\r\n\r\nalone  cannot determine business and prosperity.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe  creation  and  the  unlocking  of  values  from  the\r\n\r\nconjoining  of  ideas, technologies and entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nwhether  high-tech  or low-tech, that lead  to  business,\r\n\r\nemployment and prosperity for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister identifies the problem faced by\r\n\r\nthe  economy as demand.  The CPF and other reductions  in\r\n\r\ncosts  affect demand for investments.  As we have lowered\r\n\r\ncosts,   the   demand  for  investments  will   increase.\r\n\r\nHowever, the demand that is necessary for addressing  our\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  and employment in a  competitive  world\r\n\r\neconomy must be raised by other efforts and other  policy\r\n\r\nchanges.   It  is  the  typical 101 economic  problem  of\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  between  a slide  along  the  demand  for\r\n\r\ninvestment  schedule versus a shift  of  the  demand  for\r\n\r\ninvestment schedule.  The tools for the job are different\r\n\r\nand  not  quite the same.  What we need now  is  a  shift\r\n\r\nupwards  of  the demands for investments.  We  must  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  policy  instruments to  tackle  the  required\r\n\r\npolicy objectives and we must assign them correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight two important concerns by\r\n\r\nmany  ordinary Singapore people.  The first concerns  the\r\n\r\nadequacy  of  the  CPF savings for the future  when  they\r\n\r\nretire.  Many of them are quite worried that they may not\r\n\r\nhave  enough.   One suggestion, as proposed  to  me,  was\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government would allow employees voluntarily\r\n\r\nto  contribute  more  into their CPF.   There  is  a  tax\r\n\r\nbenefit for them as well.  The second is whether red tape\r\n\r\nin   the  bureaucracy  can  be  minimised  in  order   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate more entrepreneurial activities for  business,\r\n\r\neither in starting up new business from novel ideas or to\r\n\r\nspeed  up  existing requirements for approval, which  can\r\n\r\nreally  be  trying as many of us running businesses  have\r\n\r\nall  experienced.  Perhaps we should have a Cut  Red-Tape\r\n\r\nand Waste Committee, which will really be more productive\r\n\r\n- killing two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to share some anecdotal experience with\r\n\r\nMembers.  Two weeks ago,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  was  in  China  in Henan Province.  Henan  is  in  the\r\n\r\ncentral  part  of China, with a population close  to  100\r\n\r\nmillion,  more  than  the population  of  France,  UK  or\r\n\r\nGermany.   The  people are engaged mostly in  agriculture\r\n\r\nand  in primary production.  It took about 12 hours  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  reach  this place,  including  inter-modal\r\n\r\ntransport  and  transfers.  I was in the  area  bordering\r\n\r\nShanxi Province, with the Yellow River flowing in between\r\n\r\nHenan  and  Shanxi.  You cannot get more  provincial  and\r\n\r\nheartland in China than there, which is the fons et orgio\r\n\r\n- the fountain and origin - of the Chinese people.  There\r\n\r\nare  people who live there in caves today, dug out of the\r\n\r\nyellow-earthed hills, which are supposed to  be  warm  in\r\n\r\nwinter and cool in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not there for a vacation but I was there\r\n\r\nlooking  for  business opportunities for NTUC  Fairprice.\r\n\r\nThe  people  were  mostly farmers, and  poor  by  Chinese\r\n\r\nstandards.  But, in this provincial heart of China I  saw\r\n\r\nno  hunger.  I saw no idle people on the roadside or  the\r\n\r\nvillages, and I was travelling for four days.  I was  not\r\n\r\nstaying  in  a hotel room and having meetings.   Everyone\r\n\r\nseems  busy, planting and harvesting, digging  roads  and\r\n\r\ncanals  with hammers and shovels, transporting things  or\r\n\r\ndoing petty hawking.  I have almost forgotten the meaning\r\n\r\nof petty hawking in agriculture until I saw it again -  a\r\n\r\nfew  pieces of vegetables and fruits from a garden  patch\r\n\r\nby  the  village path.  I mean a few pieces.  I also  saw\r\n\r\nEuropean  traders there in this, I thought,  god-forsaken\r\n\r\nplace.  This is globalisation at work on its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have read in newspapers and journals\r\n\r\nabout  the  extent of rural poverty and  unemployment  in\r\n\r\nChina, I am convinced, now it is full steam ahead for the\r\n\r\nChinese.  From the Central heartland of China -  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese call this place the Tang Yuan area - perhaps they\r\n\r\nneed  to  rely on us for capital, some skills and  modern\r\n\r\nmanagement for about five years or less - that is, if  we\r\n\r\nare  fast enough.  An expressway runs from this heartland\r\n\r\nof China to the port of Lianyungang, on the Yellow Sea, a\r\n\r\ndistance  of  more than 1,000 km.  Chinese trucks  filled\r\n\r\nwith goods ply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  route day and night.  Very soon it will  be  trucks\r\n\r\nwith  international containers.  This tide is  inexorable\r\n\r\nin spite of the many problems in the Chinese economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anecdote is to underline my concern that we\r\n\r\nmust  address  the larger issue of employment  generating\r\n\r\ngrowth urgently.  This passing window of opportunity  for\r\n\r\nus to retune and catch on to the mainstream of employment\r\n\r\ngenerating growth is a very short one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak  on\r\n\r\nthe   statement.   Being  the  last  person   among   the\r\n\r\nbackbenchers,  after  almost four days  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsittings,  obviously has its drawbacks.  Much of  what  I\r\n\r\nhad  in mind to include in my original speech has already\r\n\r\nbeen  well  covered by hon. Members earlier.  I  am  also\r\n\r\naware  of  the  pressure  to keep  my  speech  short  and\r\n\r\nsuccinct.  Therefore, I shall be brief and focus only  on\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  issue, in the interest of time, although  I  am\r\n\r\njust  as  interested  with the other  social  safety  net\r\n\r\nmeasures discussed in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retuning the CPF actually provides a silver lining\r\n\r\namong  the  dark clouds.  The CPF reforms need not  bring\r\n\r\nabout  unnecessary  insecurity over the  social  security\r\n\r\nchanges.   In  effect,  we  are  really  undertaking  the\r\n\r\nretuning  of the psyche of Singaporeans in the  light  of\r\n\r\ndynamically  changing times.  How so?  In my observation,\r\n\r\nthere  are four related practices leading to the  present\r\n\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have over-relied on the CPF scheme as the\r\n\r\nmain lever to fulfil a number of social objectives;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are not happy with the past high overall CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates as they reduce the cash component  of\r\n\r\nour salaries for discretionary use;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We have over-estimated our ability to use CPF\r\n\r\nfunds to become affluent through speculative property and\r\n\r\nother  investments, at the expense of building sufficient\r\n\r\ncapital for our retirement years;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We make incremental changes to the CPF scheme\r\n\r\nor  tinkering with it, as some say, when in fact a  major\r\n\r\noverhaul  of  our social security system  is  needed  and\r\n\r\noverdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers before me have explained these factors, so\r\n\r\nI  need  not  elaborate on them.   Instead,  I  have  the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions, most of which were also brought up\r\n\r\nby  Members of this House.  The suggestions are  intended\r\n\r\nto  bring about are mindset change for every Singaporean,\r\n\r\nespecially for younger CPF members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Modify the proposed CPF-based model of social\r\n\r\nsecurity  to  include a mixed model of  CPF  and  private\r\n\r\nsector  arrangements, as recommended again by  my  fellow\r\n\r\nMPs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In addition to having pre-assigned contribution\r\n\r\nrates  and  maximum  ceilings for  the  Minimum  Sum  and\r\n\r\nMedisave  scheme,  introduce a separate  category  called\r\n\r\nHome   Financing   Scheme,   with   appropriate   maximum\r\n\r\ncontribution rates also.  This would prevent CPF  members\r\n\r\nfrom   over-using  the  Ordinary  Account   for   housing\r\n\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stress to CPF members that their CPF retirement\r\n\r\nfunds  are meant for minimum sum of expenditure and  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  supplement them with  additional  means  of\r\n\r\nfinancial support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Moderate our expectations about our own\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living,  be  realistic  about  them,   have\r\n\r\nfinancial planning for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Review our life priorities, be less\r\n\r\nmaterialistic and less obsessed with making money as main\r\n\r\ngoal in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Strengthen our relationship with our families\r\n\r\nand  community  for therein lies our real  strengths  and\r\n\r\nresilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a major remake of our social security system,\r\n\r\nwe  should  be  able to move forward with renewed  trust,\r\n\r\nhope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  having  the warmth of the sun with us  again.   This\r\n\r\nrequires  us collectively - Singaporeans, the Government,\r\n\r\nthe  unions, the corporate sector and the community -  to\r\n\r\nstand  side by side with each other at the crossroads  of\r\n\r\nchange  to  meet the challenges of globalisation  and  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  a  new Singapore Dream together as a  nation.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve that this is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Sir, we do have a credible\r\n\r\nand  competent Government that will not let us down.  And\r\n\r\nto  paraphrase the Acting Health Minister  in  his  press\r\n\r\nreleases and speeches, however, the Government cannot  do\r\n\r\nso  on its own.

I believe all of you  support  the\r\n\r\nchanges,  even  the opposition MPs, and if  I  am  wrong,\r\n\r\nplease  let  me know.  You may not fully agree  with  the\r\n\r\nextent  of the changes, but you concur that we cannot  go\r\n\r\nback  to  a CPF rate of 40%.  You accept that we must  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  the  Minimum Sum,  salary  ceiling  and\r\n\r\nwithdrawal rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee and the Minister for Manpower have answered\r\n\r\nthe  questions on the CPF changes and the help  measures.\r\n\r\nI  shall  not  repeat their points.  This  afternoon,  in\r\n\r\nsumming  up the debate, I will go beyond the CPF changes,\r\n\r\nas  I believe our present difficulties are temporary.   I\r\n\r\nwill  talk about the basic factors that will make  for  a\r\n\r\nsustained recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of you who said that the CPF changes alone\r\n\r\nwould not do the trick are absolutely right.  The changes\r\n\r\nare  not  a  miracle cure.  They are necessary  and  will\r\n\r\nbring down our wage costs.  But, by themselves, they  are\r\n\r\nnot sufficient.  We need to do more, to make a difference\r\n\r\nto   our   cost  competitiveness.   As  many   MPs   have\r\n\r\nemphasised,  we must and will keep taxes and other  costs\r\n\r\ndown.  And we will tighten up the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We run an efficient civil service, comparable to the\r\n\r\nbest  in  the world.  But because of many years  of  good\r\n\r\ngrowth and strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbudget  surpluses, we might have been a little  indulgent\r\n\r\nin our spending.  I support, therefore, the setting up of\r\n\r\nthe Cut Waste Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh said that this is not enough, and\r\n\r\nthat we must go beyond cutting waste.  But let us get  on\r\n\r\nwith  the  Cut Waste Panel first.  We welcome suggestions\r\n\r\nfrom   Mr   Inderjit  Singh,  the  general   public   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses,   MPs,  as  well  as  from  public   officers\r\n\r\nthemselves.   The  more  ideas  the  Panel  receives   on\r\n\r\nwasteful  expenditure, the more effective the Panel  will\r\n\r\nbe.  I do not think the civil service is fat.  But if  we\r\n\r\nfind that there is fat beneath the waste, we can set up a\r\n\r\nCut Fat Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, 38 years ago, we had no waste, no fat.\r\n\r\nWe  were  a  lean and hungry Third World  country.   But,\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  are a First World country enjoying plenty  of\r\n\r\ncreature comforts, McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken  and\r\n\r\nother  fast  food.  Thirty-eight years ago, many  of  our\r\n\r\nmothers   worked   as   maids  or  washerwomen.    Today,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans not only refuse such jobs, but one in  seven\r\n\r\nhouseholds  employs  foreign maids.  Another  example  is\r\n\r\noverseas travel.   I took my first plane ride at the  age\r\n\r\nof  25,  and  that was to Kuala Lumpur for a  scholarship\r\n\r\ninterview.   Today, thousands of infant Singaporeans  fly\r\n\r\nbefore they can even walk!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us want this good life to continue. But is\r\n\r\nit   guaranteed?   Thirty-eight  years  from  now,   will\r\n\r\nSingapore  still be in the First World?  Or  will  we  be\r\n\r\nback in the Third World?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an idle question. I ask myself this\r\n\r\nquestion  time  and again.  Nations may be  endowed  with\r\n\r\nrich natural resources, or none at all, but that does not\r\n\r\ndestine  one  to be rich and the other,  poor.   We  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  what it takes for the nation to  succeed,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can make Singapore endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Thirty-eight years ago</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ng Eng Hen has cited the examples of China,\r\n\r\nJapan,  Ireland  and  Finland  to  show  the  fluctuating\r\n\r\nfortunes of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet  me  elaborate on the same theme, but from a personal\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, I went to Williams College in the US to do\r\n\r\na Masters programme in development economics.  This was a\r\n\r\nspecial  course for government officers from Third  World\r\n\r\ncountries.   I was then working in the Economic  Planning\r\n\r\nUnit under the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 20 of us in the class. We came from 16\r\n\r\nThird  World  countries.  Besides  Singapore,  the  Asian\r\n\r\nstudents  came from Malaysia, the Philippines, India  and\r\n\r\nPakistan.    The  African  students  were  from   Uganda,\r\n\r\nTanzania,  Kenya, Liberia, Ethiopia and  Egypt.   Mexico,\r\n\r\nHonduras,   Bolivia  and  Colombia  represented   Central\r\n\r\nAmerica.  And from Europe, we had Yugoslavia.  We were 20\r\n\r\nyoung,   eager  beavers,  with  great  dreams   for   our\r\n\r\ncountries.  But,  unfortunately, 38  years  later,  those\r\n\r\ndreams have disappeared for many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the political and social developments in\r\n\r\neach of the 16 countries represented in my class, and how\r\n\r\nmuch  their  peoples' lives have improved  from  1966  to\r\n\r\n2002,  I think only three of the countries have succeeded\r\n\r\nbeyond a doubt.  They are Malaysia, Mexico and Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  have  brought about development,  and  given  their\r\n\r\npeople  a  better future.  Perhaps I should add India  to\r\n\r\nthis  list, now that it has begun to open up its  economy\r\n\r\nand some results are showing.  The remaining 12 countries\r\n\r\nhave   either  made  little  progress  or,  worse,   gone\r\n\r\nbackwards.   Some  have really fallen into  a  valley  of\r\n\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Yugoslavia. In the 60s and 70s, Yugoslavia was\r\n\r\na  beautiful  country and a popular tourist  destination.\r\n\r\nMy friend from Yugoslavia told me that you could actually\r\n\r\ngo bear hunting in Yugoslavia and, if you want to be sure\r\n\r\nyou  can kill a bear, you just pay the tour guide for  it\r\n\r\nand  the  bear  will be killed.  I visited Belgrade,  the\r\n\r\ncapital,  in 1978.  I went there with Foreign Minister  S\r\n\r\nRajaratnam to attend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  Non-Aligned Movement meeting.  The conference was held\r\n\r\nin a new part of Belgrade.  The streets were wide and the\r\n\r\nbuildings were new.  It was a pleasant neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshal Josip Tito, Yugoslavia's Head of State,\r\n\r\nhosted a reception for the conference participants.  When\r\n\r\nhe  walked  in,  his charisma filled the  room.   But  he\r\n\r\nlooked  old  and  frail.  He did not stay  long  for  the\r\n\r\nreception.  I wondered then how long he would  remain  in\r\n\r\ncharge of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S Rajaratnam, as you know, had a curious mind,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  it came to politics.  In  Belgrade,  he\r\n\r\nasked  to  meet an imam, a Muslim spiritual  leader.   He\r\n\r\nwanted  to know how Islam was practised in Yugoslavia,  a\r\n\r\npredominantly Orthodox Christian country.  The  imam,  an\r\n\r\noldish man, seemed happy and secure.  Of course, he spoke\r\n\r\nthrough  an interpreter.  He lived in a small but decent-looking two-storey house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tito died in 1980. And, soon after, Yugoslavia\r\n\r\nbegan   to  break  up.   Today,  Tito's  Yugoslavia   has\r\n\r\nsplintered  into  five  countries:  Slovenia,  Macedonia,\r\n\r\nCroatia,   Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,   and   Serbia   and\r\n\r\nMontenegro.   And  I am sure that the old  imam  did  not\r\n\r\nexpect the horrors that befell the Muslims of his country\r\n\r\n- the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. In 1966, Pakistan\r\n\r\ncomprised West Pakistan and East Pakistan.  At  a  dinner\r\n\r\ndiscussion  during  my  studies in  Williams  College,  a\r\n\r\nPakistani  student, who had graduated one  year  earlier,\r\n\r\nheld  forth  that  the  trend in the  world  was  against\r\n\r\nseparatism.   He  said that nowadays,  the  states  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry  preferred to stay together.  He could not  think\r\n\r\nof  any  country  having broken up in  recent  years.   I\r\n\r\nreminded  him of Malaysia and Singapore.  \"Ah,\" he  said,\r\n\r\n\"that is an exceptional case.\"  Five years later, his own\r\n\r\ncountry  also  proved him wrong.  In 1971, East  Pakistan\r\n\r\nfought  to  separate from Pakistan.  The East  Pakistanis\r\n\r\nfelt that the Government in Karachi had squatted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  them.   So,  East Pakistan, with a little  help  from\r\n\r\nIndia, became Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also wondered what has happened to the\r\n\r\nhandsome, young Egyptian from my class.  I had planned to\r\n\r\nvisit  Egypt, after my course, on my way home.   At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  I thought that I would never travel again.  So,  I\r\n\r\nactually  planned  my journey from the  US  to  Montreal,\r\n\r\nLondon,   Paris,  Rome,  Cairo,  then  to   Bangkok   and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So, my Egyptian friend gave me the  names  of\r\n\r\nsome  hotels in Cairo.  But a few weeks before my  course\r\n\r\nended,  war broke out between Egypt, Syria and Jordan  on\r\n\r\nthe  Arab  side, and Israel on the other side.   The  war\r\n\r\nlasted six days.  Egypt lost Sinai and the Gaza Strip  to\r\n\r\nIsrael.    My  Egyptian  friend  was  shell-shocked.    I\r\n\r\ncancelled my trip to Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other five African countries, I am sad to\r\n\r\nsay  that none of them made it.  You may recall the names\r\n\r\nof  Jomo  Kenyatta of Kenya, Julius Nyerere of  Tanzania,\r\n\r\nand Milton Obote of Uganda.  I have met Jomo Kenyatta and\r\n\r\nJulius Nyerere.  They were larger than life, the hope  of\r\n\r\nAfrica.  But they could not deliver development to  their\r\n\r\ncountries.  President Milton Obote came to Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth  Heads of Government Meeting  in  1971.\r\n\r\nWhile  he  was here, Idi Amin deposed him.  You know,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the damage Idi Amin then inflicted on Uganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ethiopia and Liberia, they have gone through\r\n\r\ncountless civil wars.  In 1993, a part of Ethiopia  broke\r\n\r\naway  to  become  Eritrea.  And Liberia  today  is  still\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  internal strife.  My Liberian  classmate\r\n\r\nworked  in the central bank.  I used to play table tennis\r\n\r\nwith him.  What central bank is there in Liberia today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Which country was most promising?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of my classmates and their countries has a\r\n\r\nsobering effect on me.  It could well have been  my  fate\r\n\r\nand the fate of Singapore.  Fortunately, as of now, among\r\n\r\nthe  16 countries represented in my class, Singapore  has\r\n\r\ncome out on top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1966, if my professors in Williams College\r\n\r\nhad  done a ranking of the 16 countries - which ones were\r\n\r\nmost likely to succeed by the end of the 20th century - I\r\n\r\nthink  they  would have got the answer wrong,  especially\r\n\r\nwith regard to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in the 1960s, many pundits wrote off\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  we  were an artificial  country.   We\r\n\r\nwere,  and still are, only a dot on the map.  We  had  no\r\n\r\nnatural  resources, no hinterland.   We  were  a  migrant\r\n\r\nsociety  with no sense of nationhood.  There was communal\r\n\r\ntension and distrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have never taken our prosperity for\r\n\r\ngranted,  or  assumed that what we have  today  will  get\r\n\r\nbetter  and  better in the years to come.  For  the  same\r\n\r\nreason,  I am unfazed when we are besieged with problems.\r\n\r\nGiven  our  natural  limitations, we  should  expect  the\r\n\r\noccasional  problems.  I have seen what have happened  to\r\n\r\nmy  classmates.  I have seen how countries have  gone  up\r\n\r\nand  come down.  In fact, we should be surprised that  we\r\n\r\nhave far fewer problems than well-endowed countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When confronted with problems, I go for the basics,\r\n\r\nthe fundamental qualities that make a country successful.\r\n\r\nCPF changes, lower Government fees, lower land and rental\r\n\r\ncosts,  lower taxes - all the things that MPs  raised  in\r\n\r\nthe House today and the days before - they are necessary,\r\n\r\nbut they are not sufficient.  If the basics are wrong, we\r\n\r\nwould not be debating any CPF changes.  We might well  be\r\n\r\nfighting  for our lives in the streets.  Or we  might  be\r\n\r\npaying some snakeheads to smuggle us to another country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the basics? For me, they are, first,\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  a  country's  leadership;  second,  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of the people - whether they are sensible  and\r\n\r\npractical; and third, the trust the people have  in  each\r\n\r\nother  and in their government.  These basics, they never\r\n\r\ntaught  them  in my course at Williams.   I  learnt  many\r\n\r\nuseful lessons there.  But the real lessons I learnt only\r\n\r\nafter I joined the PAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Quality leadership</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the quality of the leadership. As Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  I  have to receive Chairmen and CEOs  of  MNCs\r\n\r\nfrom time to time.  Very often, they have investments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or are thinking of investing.  EDB  recommends\r\n\r\nthat I see them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they just courtesy calls? No. The Chairmen and\r\n\r\nCEOs  are trying to confirm for themselves that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  good and safe place in which to invest.  They  are\r\n\r\nsizing up the leader of the country.  They want to  know:\r\n\r\nis  he  pro-business?  Is he competent?   When  difficult\r\n\r\nproblems demand a solution, will he be a populist or will\r\n\r\nhe  take tough actions?  Can he carry the people with him\r\n\r\nif he has to make tough decisions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when I was the Minister for Defence, I received\r\n\r\ninvestors.   The  meetings had nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nDefence Ministry.  The investors wanted to meet me simply\r\n\r\nbecause  I was the designated successor to Prime Minister\r\n\r\nLee.  They wanted to know whether their investments would\r\n\r\nbe safe with Singapore's future leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, investors will now want to see how\r\n\r\nthe new team performs.  I am confident of the new team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sensible and practical people</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the second fundamental factor for a\r\n\r\ncountry   to  succeed  -  the  people.   What  is   their\r\n\r\ncharacter?   Do  they have skills and capabilities?   Can\r\n\r\nthey learn?  Are they sensible and practical?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, I think, have a reputation for all\r\n\r\nthat, and more.  Listen to Mr Nithiah Nandan.  He is  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Secretary  of  the  Union  of  Gas  and  Power\r\n\r\nEmployees, a union leader.  I was very impressed  by  the\r\n\r\ntone  and  content  of his speech the other  day.   Union\r\n\r\nleaders in many other countries would have berated  their\r\n\r\ngovernments for cutting workers' wages.  They would  have\r\n\r\ntaken to the streets,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the French and the Koreans.  But here, we have far-sighted and realistic union leaders.  Mr Nandan supported\r\n\r\nthe  CPF changes because he understood the gravity of the\r\n\r\nsituation.  At the same time, he urged the Government  to\r\n\r\nhelp the workers adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just Mr Nandan but other union leaders as\r\n\r\nwell.  I meet them from time to time, so I know what they\r\n\r\nthink  and  how  they  think.  They are  a  sensible  and\r\n\r\npractical  lot.  They listen to reason.  They  understand\r\n\r\nfacts and figures.  They know what is going on around the\r\n\r\nworld  and  how  their jobs are affected.   If  they  are\r\n\r\nconvinced of the need for tough measures, they  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage to sell them to their members.  They are the true\r\n\r\nleaders  of the workers, not the politicians in  the  so-called Workers Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of people who have been\r\n\r\ninstrumental in our industrial harmony.  Many  of  us  do\r\n\r\nnot  even  know  they  exist.  They  are  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Officers or IROs, in NTUC.  There are about  50\r\n\r\nof them.  They are the link between the union leaders and\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  They may work unnoticed, but they are  out\r\n\r\nthere in the direct line of fire of unionists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IROs, union leaders like Mr Nandan, and NTUC leaders\r\n\r\nlike  Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng  give investors  confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's labour situation.  Do other Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nthe  same  common sense and pragmatism as  our  IROs  and\r\n\r\nunion  leaders?  I ask because I see the CPF changes  not\r\n\r\njust  as  measures to improve our competitiveness.   They\r\n\r\nare a test of the adaptability of our people.  They are a\r\n\r\ntest of the character of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback I have received, I believe\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have passed with flying colours.   They  may\r\n\r\nnot  be happy with the CPF changes, but they accept  that\r\n\r\nthe measures are necessary.  They are not arguing against\r\n\r\nthe  measures, but rather, they are asking the Government\r\n\r\nto  cushion the blow for less able Singaporeans.  This is\r\n\r\na legitimate request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should also be practical about jobs.\r\n\r\nIf  the  market  is  not so rosy, we should  not  be  too\r\n\r\nchoosy.  We should be prepared to take on less attractive\r\n\r\njobs, rather than stay unemployed for long periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are enough jobs for all Singaporeans even now.\r\n\r\nThere are 85,000 unemployed Singapore residents.  But  in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing and services sectors alone, there  are\r\n\r\n200,000  jobs held by foreign workers.  This  means  more\r\n\r\nthan  two  jobs  per  unemployed Singaporean.   If  these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  prepared to lower their  expectations,\r\n\r\nand  work  shifts  or in the sun, all  85,000  unemployed\r\n\r\nresidents can be gainfully employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you actual examples of job vacancies\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans do not want to fill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam told me that ST\r\n\r\nMicroelectronics tried to recruit 400 workers last  year.\r\n\r\nThe  company offered a starting pay of $1,150  for  wafer\r\n\r\nfab  operators and $1,500 for technicians.  This was  for\r\n\r\nworking  only  15  days  a month,  and  did  not  include\r\n\r\novertime  allowances.   Quite  an  attractive   deal,   I\r\n\r\nthought.  But Singaporeans did not think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how many Singaporeans turned up for\r\n\r\ninterview?  Only 87, for 400 vacancies.  Do you know  how\r\n\r\nmany  walked  away when they found out they had  to  work\r\n\r\nshifts,  and in a clean room?  23.  Of the 64 who  stayed\r\n\r\nfor  interview, 35 were offered jobs.  But only 20 turned\r\n\r\nup for work on the first day.  One quit after a few days.\r\n\r\nIn  the  end,  the  company managed to  recruit  only  19\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for 400 vacancies.  The company  was  forced\r\n\r\nto  turn  to  its Malaysian recruitment contractor.   The\r\n\r\ncontractor promptly produced 360 candidates.  The company\r\n\r\nhired  151  of them.  That was last year.   I  asked  EDB\r\n\r\nwhether   the   company  was  doing   better   recruiting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  this  year. EDB reported  it  still  had  a\r\n\r\nproblem.  Let me add that if ST Microelectronics had  not\r\n\r\nbeen allowed to recruit the 151 Malaysians, it would have\r\n\r\nshelved its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplans  to  expand in Singapore.  And the 19  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould not have a job today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also jobs available in the marine\r\n\r\nindustry.   Last month, the President of the  Association\r\n\r\nof  Marine  Industries, Mr Heng Chiang Gnee,  sent  me  a\r\n\r\nletter.    He   wanted  me  to  convey   a   message   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   He  wanted them to know  that  there  are\r\n\r\nstill  many  jobs available in the marine industry,  from\r\n\r\ntradesmen and engineers, to supervisors and managers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is, there are jobs available in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  we  change our mindset and move away from our comfort\r\n\r\nzone, we need never be out of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trust between people and Government</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third quality a nation needs in order to\r\n\r\novercome its challenges is trust between the people,  and\r\n\r\nbetween the people and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Nandan urged me not just to feel for the\r\n\r\npeople, but to act on my feelings.  Do not fear.  That is\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have done and what we will do.  You have  heard\r\n\r\nDPM   Lee.   He  has  announced  many  measures  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cope with the CPF changes and our  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   We  will not break our  promise  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans adjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes, if we cannot fulfill a promise, like\r\n\r\nrestoring  the  CPF  rate  to  40%,  it  is  because   of\r\n\r\ncompelling reasons.  To keep the promise, we might  cause\r\n\r\nmore  harm than good to Singapore.  Even the people would\r\n\r\nnot want us to keep the promise.  In short, circumstances\r\n\r\nmust have changed so drastically that only a naive person\r\n\r\nor a knave would argue for the promise to be kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang is neither naive nor a knave.\r\n\r\nBut  he made a fierce speech attacking the PAP and me for\r\n\r\nbreaking  our  election promise to create  jobs  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.   He  said that instead of doing so, we  are  now\r\n\r\ncutting workers' wages by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlowering  the CPF rate.  I was not in the Chamber  but  I\r\n\r\nheard his bark from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do Mr Low and I respond differently to\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic plight?  The difference is: he is  a\r\n\r\npolitician;  I  am not.  I regard myself as  a  political\r\n\r\nleader.   Let  me explain the difference.   When  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced with a grave problem, I explain the problem to  the\r\n\r\nvoters,  and work out the options to solve it.  I  choose\r\n\r\nwhat,  in  my view, is the best option after  a  thorough\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  my colleagues, with MPs  and  sometimes\r\n\r\nwith  grassroots leaders, even if that option means  pain\r\n\r\nand  discomfort in the short term.  If necessary, I  give\r\n\r\nsome  anaesthesia or painkillers.  And if I have a little\r\n\r\nmoney in my pocket, I hand it out to give a little cheer.\r\n\r\nI never duck an issue even if it will cost me some votes.\r\n\r\nI let the results speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low, on the other hand, sees a fire in a problem\r\n\r\nand, instead of putting it out, looks for the biggest fan\r\n\r\nto  fan the fire.  And when he sees a wound, he looks for\r\n\r\na bucket of salt to rub into the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our current plight, does Mr Low Thia Khiang offer\r\n\r\nconstructive suggestions to help Singapore recover?   No.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, he accuses me of having total amnesia,\r\n\r\nof  having forgotten my election promise to create  jobs.\r\n\r\nTotal  amnesia is a medical condition.  If I  have  total\r\n\r\namnesia,  the  people will sympathise with me,  at  least\r\n\r\nthat is what I hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Low's case, he has selective amnesia. When he\r\n\r\naccused  me of not keeping my promise to create jobs,  he\r\n\r\nconveniently  forgot to tell this House  that  since  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  election in November 2001, the  world  has  been\r\n\r\nthreatened   by  terrorism,  destablised   by   wars   in\r\n\r\nAfghanistan  and  Iraq,  and  frightened  by  SARS.    He\r\n\r\nconveniently  forgot to tell the House that these  events\r\n\r\nwere  beyond  our control.  He forgot to tell  the  House\r\n\r\nthat  if  the events had not happened, our economy  would\r\n\r\nhave grown by at least 3% this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selective amnesia is not a medical condition. It is\r\n\r\na  political condition, to be admonished, and not treated\r\n\r\nwith  sympathy.  In case Singaporeans miss my punch  line\r\n\r\nagain, the common name for Mr Low's selective amnesia  is\r\n\r\n\"opposition politics\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you briefly the employment situation\r\n\r\nsince the 2001 election.\r\n\r\nDespite   the   external  events  that   shook   investor\r\n\r\nconfidence in our region, we continued to attract a  high\r\n\r\nvolume of investments.  In the manufacturing sector,  EDB\r\n\r\nattracted  $9  billion  of investments  in  2002.   These\r\n\r\ninvestments will create 14,000 jobs when fully  realised.\r\n\r\nEDB  also  attracted  $2 billion of  investments  in  the\r\n\r\nservices sectors they promote.  This will create  another\r\n\r\n7,000  jobs.  The 7,000 jobs are in addition to  jobs  in\r\n\r\nother  services sectors that are being promoted by  other\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a net basis, we lost 23,000 jobs last year. But\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  actually  gained 19,000  jobs.   Foreigners\r\n\r\nlost 42,000 jobs, hence the overall loss of 23,000 jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent some time dismissing Mr Low's\r\n\r\nallegation because his tactic is a corrosive one.  He  is\r\n\r\ntrying to corrode a fundamental pillar of the PAP  -  the\r\n\r\ntrust  between the people and the Government.  This trust\r\n\r\nhas  been  built up over many years, since the  PAP  came\r\n\r\ninto power in 1959.  Mr Low knows that his party will not\r\n\r\nmake headway in elections, so long as the trust is there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP MPs must therefore never squander this trust nor\r\n\r\nallow  anyone to undermine it with selective  amnesia  or\r\n\r\nother political trickery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is not here today. But does Mr Chiam See\r\n\r\nTong  also  suffer from selective amnesia?  I  think  his\r\n\r\ncondition  is  a variant of this.  It is called  \"quoting\r\n\r\nout  of  context\".  He shows a shift in the  Government's\r\n\r\nposition,  without explaining the context of  the  shift.\r\n\r\nThe  objective  is the same as selective  amnesia.   Used\r\n\r\nrepeatedly, and if not countered, it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nerode the trust the people have for the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Chiam made a \"washy-washy\"\r\n\r\nspeech.   Yes,  I  said \"washy-washy\", not \"wishy-washy\".\r\n\r\nIt  is  not amnesia, I assure you.  I remember very  well\r\n\r\nIndranee's  speech  on \"wash-wash\".  I say  \"washy-washy\"\r\n\r\nbecause  Mr Chiam made another attempt to wash in public,\r\n\r\npast  speeches by Ministers.  He wanted to show  that  we\r\n\r\nhad  changed our position and therefore, were not men  of\r\n\r\nour  words.   But his tactic does not work,  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no dirty linen for him to wash!   We  keep\r\n\r\nour PAP shirts and pants very white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, DPM Lee said in 1985 that the CPF was part of\r\n\r\nworkers'  wages and should not be cut.  That was  over  a\r\n\r\ndecade  ago.   Our  competitiveness situation  has  since\r\n\r\nchanged.  So we have to make corresponding changes to the\r\n\r\nCPF to suit the new environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, however, does not seem to change his view\r\n\r\nof  the world even when the world has changed.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  only  change I have seen Mr Chiam make was  when  he\r\n\r\nchanged political parties!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does Mr Chiam stand on the CPF changes? Is he\r\n\r\nin  favour  of the CPF rate cut?  Or is he in  favour  of\r\n\r\nstatus  quo?   What ideas does he have  for  solving  our\r\n\r\neconomic difficulties?  He is another politician,  not  a\r\n\r\npolitical leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia is another politician. He tried to\r\n\r\nhunt with the hounds and run with the hares.  In girl-boy\r\n\r\nrelationship, I call this two timing.  You have to decide\r\n\r\nwhich party you want.  You cannot try to go with one girl\r\n\r\nand then behind her back, go with another girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs must remember this distinction between a\r\n\r\npolitician  and a political leader.  To be a leader,  you\r\n\r\nhave   to   lead,  not  win  support  by  making  popular\r\n\r\nstatements,  or  fan  the fire of discontent.   To  be  a\r\n\r\nleader, you have to analyse problems, explain them to the\r\n\r\npeople, work out the options, choose a solution that  you\r\n\r\nbelieve is right,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  sell it to the people.  Singaporeans are discerning.\r\n\r\nThey are not ungrateful.  If you are sincere and work for\r\n\r\nthem, they will support you.  Of course, you must produce\r\n\r\nresults and improve their lives.  The results do not have\r\n\r\nto be immediate.  But they must come over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retuning the CPF is an example of leadership.\r\n\r\nTogether  with our other measures, it will make Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  competitive,  bring in investments,  and  save  and\r\n\r\ncreate jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also advise PAP MPs not to unwittingly erode the\r\n\r\ntrust  between the people and the Government.  Yesterday,\r\n\r\nin  her speech, Amy Khor said that some Singaporeans felt\r\n\r\nbetrayed  by  the CPF cut.  She used the word  \"betrayal\"\r\n\r\ntwice.   Mr  Low Thia Khiang used the same  word  in  his\r\n\r\nattack on the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Betrayed\" is a very strong word. I know that Amy\r\n\r\nKhor supports the CPF changes.  She said so.  And she was\r\n\r\nonly echoing the views of some of her constituents.   But\r\n\r\nPAP  MPs  should be careful not to broadcast such  strong\r\n\r\nwords,  when there was no betrayal.  They must  not  sing\r\n\r\nthe  same  tune as opposition MPs unwittingly.   Instead,\r\n\r\nthey  should stand their ground and debunk this  betrayal\r\n\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy Khor also mentioned that she knew of unhappy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who were contemplating selling their assets,\r\n\r\nand  migrating.  Perhaps, in these difficult times,  this\r\n\r\nis a sensible thing to do, from their perspective.  And I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they feel disappointed  and  frustrated\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the poorer job situation.  But  they  should\r\n\r\nremember  who created the conditions for them to  acquire\r\n\r\ntheir  valuable  assets, which  they  can  now  sell  and\r\n\r\nmigrate  to  Australia or New Zealand as  men  of  means.\r\n\r\nWhere  did  they receive their education,  and  how  much\r\n\r\nsubsidy have they enjoyed?  They have done well in  their\r\n\r\nlives,  and  have the resources to migrate, because  they\r\n\r\nwere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore had not nurtured them, would they have\r\n\r\nany  assets  to  sell?  Do they think  Australia  or  New\r\n\r\nZealand would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelcome them if they were not well-educated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>More than just CPF cut</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut the CPF by 3%. Ang Mong Seng told the\r\n\r\nHouse  that employees said \"Heng ah!\"  Well,  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat they heaved a sigh of relief, because some employers\r\n\r\nhowled  with disappointment.  That is Singapore for  you.\r\n\r\nYou cannot please everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the 3% cut work? Is it too little? Nobody can\r\n\r\ntell in advance whether 33% is the right rate.  But in my\r\n\r\nconsidered  judgment, it is the most appropriate  in  our\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans accept the rate cut and the other\r\n\r\nchanges  to the CPF, this will send a powerful signal  to\r\n\r\ninvestors that we will go all out to compete. This is the\r\n\r\nreal  value of the rate cut.  Later, if 33% proves to  be\r\n\r\nstill too high, we will lower the CPF rate to 30%.  But I\r\n\r\ndo not think we have to do this for some years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the MPs who said that our economic\r\n\r\nrecovery  strategy cannot be CPF cuts alone.   They  will\r\n\r\nnot be sufficient to make Singapore competitive.  We must\r\n\r\ncut  costs  in all other areas.  As DPM Lee explained  on\r\n\r\nFriday, we have done this, and continue to do so.  Office\r\n\r\nand  industrial  rentals have come down by  39%  and  46%\r\n\r\nsince  early 1997.  Our income tax rates too  are  coming\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy does not focus only on cost\r\n\r\ncutting.  We cannot possibly compete on costs alone.   If\r\n\r\nwe   try   to  match  the  wages  offered  by  lower-cost\r\n\r\ncompetitors, we are engaging in a downhill race.  We will\r\n\r\nall end up at the bottom, with lower standards of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy must, therefore, go beyond\r\n\r\ncost   competition.   Inderjit  Singh  claims  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no strategy for economic recovery, that we\r\n\r\nhave no plan.  But I remind him that in December 2001,  I\r\n\r\nset up the Economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview  Committee to comprehensively review policies  and\r\n\r\npropose strategies to promote the further growth  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy.  In February this year, the  ERC  came\r\n\r\nup  with its recommendations.  The recommendations set  a\r\n\r\nclear direction for Singapore's economy over the next  15\r\n\r\nyears,  while addressing the current slowdown.  So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot   understand  why  Inderjit  Singh  said   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not have an economic plan.   Has  he  not\r\n\r\nread the ERC report?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind. I shall now outline for him five of the\r\n\r\nkey thrusts of our economic strategy.  First, we have  to\r\n\r\noffer  something valuable that our competitors cannot  do\r\n\r\nas  well.  This is why we are continuously improving  the\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we have invested heavily in our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  Our schools equip our  students  with\r\n\r\nstrong  foundations  in  Mathematics,  Science  and   the\r\n\r\nHumanities.   And  our post-secondary  education  already\r\n\r\nranks  amongst  the  world's  best.   But  despite  these\r\n\r\nachievements,  we are not sitting still.  We  are  moving\r\n\r\ntowards  a  more  diverse  education  system  to  nurture\r\n\r\ntalents   in   different  fields.   The  junior   college\r\n\r\ncurriculum  is being revised to focus more on  developing\r\n\r\nthinking skills and multi-disciplinary perspectives.  The\r\n\r\npolytechnics have adopted an inter-disciplinary  approach\r\n\r\nto  learning.   And  our ITEs provide  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  students to engage in problem solving, independent\r\n\r\nlearning  and collaborative work.  In addition, over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years, NTU will be transformed  into  a  full-fledged,  comprehensive university.  NUS  will  become  a\r\n\r\nmulti-campus  university system, with new  campuses.   We\r\n\r\nwill  also consider allowing private universities  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes will equip the young generation of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with  the flexibility,  inventiveness,  and\r\n\r\nability to cope with rapid change.  They will enable  our\r\n\r\nyoung  to  pick up easily technical skills and  knowledge\r\n\r\nonce they join the workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts at human capital development are not\r\n\r\nlimited to the schools and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversities.   We  are  also putting  high  priority  on\r\n\r\nworkers'   training  and  skills  upgrading.    The   new\r\n\r\nWorkforce Development Agency will help Singaporeans  find\r\n\r\nand  keep jobs.  It will spearhead new programmes to  re-skill unemployed Singaporeans to fill job vacancies.   It\r\n\r\nwill  also drive the skills upgrading of employed workers\r\n\r\nin a more systematic and targeted way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust of our economic strategy is to\r\n\r\nexpand  our economic pie by going global.  We  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in going regional.  Now, we must  go  to  the\r\n\r\nFour   Corners   of   the  world,  wherever   there   are\r\n\r\nopportunities.  To do so, we are weaving a  web  of  Free\r\n\r\nTrade  Agreements  (FTAs).  To-date, we  have  agreements\r\n\r\nwith the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, ASEAN and the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA).   These  FTAs\r\n\r\nprovide  our companies tariff-free access to  a  combined\r\n\r\nmarket of one billion consumers, among other advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, with the US-Singapore FTA, Singapore\r\n\r\nfood  in the US will be cheaper.  Singaporeans and  their\r\n\r\nfriends  in  Silicon Valley will save 4-5% in  cost  when\r\n\r\nthey  eat Tee Yih Jia's popiah and roti prata, and  Thong\r\n\r\nSeik's fishballs.   They will eat more of such food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an FTA with the US, American-flagged ships\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  the US government a levy of 50%  of  their\r\n\r\nbills,  for  repair work done outside the US.   Now,  the\r\n\r\nships  will  save on this levy when they are repaired  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    There  will  be  more  business   for   our\r\n\r\nshipyards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only Singapore companies that benefit from\r\n\r\nour FTAs.  Consumers too.  The Senior Minister went to  a\r\n\r\nfunction  for former PAP MPs recently.  He was  surprised\r\n\r\nto  see  Kirin, a Japanese beer, being served.   He  took\r\n\r\none.   I  told  him it could be because of our  FTA  with\r\n\r\nJapan.  I did not know the price of Kirin beer, but I had\r\n\r\nchecked  on  the price of Asahi beer.  It had  come  down\r\n\r\nfrom $20 per six-pack to $17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, selling to customers all over the world must\r\n\r\nbecome a way of life for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  companies, given our small domestic  market.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that our companies are venturing further afield  to\r\n\r\nless familiar territories, beyond our traditional markets\r\n\r\nin East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG George Yeo led an economic mission to Kazakhstan\r\n\r\nrecently.   He  was  surprised to find that  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompany  has  a large market share in 3-in-1 coffee,  not\r\n\r\njust  in  Kazakhstan,  but also in  Ukraine  and  Russia.\r\n\r\nAlso,  Keppel  Offshore & Marine has set up shipyards  in\r\n\r\nKazakhstan and in Azerbaijan.  And a Singapore consortium\r\n\r\nrecently won a bid to provide ground-handling services at\r\n\r\nBaghdad International Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consortium must do a good job of it, and make\r\n\r\nluggage collection at Baghdad Airport \"safe\".  I  was  in\r\n\r\nBaghdad  in  1979  for  a trade exhibition.   I  lost  my\r\n\r\nluggage  at  the airport.   Four or five other delegation\r\n\r\nmembers  also lost their bags.  Our bags were  stolen  at\r\n\r\nthe  airport.   The  SIA station manager  had  personally\r\n\r\nensured  that all the bags and luggage which belonged  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore delegation were put on the plane that flew\r\n\r\nto  Baghdad.  I regretted because before I left, Mr Ngiam\r\n\r\nTong  Dow,  who was then the Permanent Secretary  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance, told me that the Arabs  were  very\r\n\r\nsophisticated and urbane people, and so I packed my  best\r\n\r\nsuits, shoes and ties and put them in the luggage, and  I\r\n\r\nnever saw them again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help more companies succeed overseas, IE\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  former  Trade  Development  Board,  will\r\n\r\nsupport them in building international capabilities.   It\r\n\r\nwill  provide on-the-ground facilitation.  It will double\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  overseas fairs and trade  missions.   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  also launch a $10 million \"International\r\n\r\nPartners  Programme\" to encourage Singapore companies  to\r\n\r\nhunt in a pack.  Our GLCs and larger firms will lead  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  ones  in  consortia  to  secure  overseas   jobs\r\n\r\ntogether.  This is the demand part.  I heard Mr Chay  say\r\n\r\njust  now  that we also need to create demand,  not  just\r\n\r\nattack the cost side alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will continue to climb up the value chain\r\n\r\nin manufacturing. We can no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger compete as a low-cost manufacturing base.  But  we\r\n\r\nretain  a  competitive edge in higher-end  manufacturing.\r\n\r\nWe  have, therefore, upgraded our industries to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith the latest technology.  We have and will continue to\r\n\r\nbuild up our R&D capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seagate, a disk drive manufacturer, is building a\r\n\r\nnew  extension in Singapore.  The extension houses state-of-the-art  equipment  and  new-generation  technologies.\r\n\r\nWhen the new plant reaches full capacity, it will provide\r\n\r\n2,000   jobs   for  our  people.   The   best   days   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing are still ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we are growing our services sector.\r\n\r\nSingapore is already well established as a hub for  info-communications  technology, trading  and  logistics,  and\r\n\r\nfinancial services.  We will strengthen our hand in these\r\n\r\nindustries.   At the same time, we will grow new  service\r\n\r\nsectors  like  education,  healthcare  and  the  creative\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In healthcare, for instance, our handling of the\r\n\r\nSARS  outbreak has enhanced our reputation.   The  Genome\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Singapore is now  working  with  Roche,  a\r\n\r\npharmaceutical giant, to commercialise its SARS test kit.\r\n\r\nIn  the  private sector too, our capabilities  are  well-known.    Overseas   patients  come  here   for   complex\r\n\r\noperations  such  as the separation of  conjoined  twins.\r\n\r\nEach  hospital bed requires at least four staff  to  man.\r\n\r\nIf  we  have another 500 private hospital beds  to  serve\r\n\r\noverseas  patients from China, Indonesia and  the  Middle\r\n\r\nEast,  that  would create another 2,000 well-paying  jobs\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we are seeing a blossoming of entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThese  companies are not necessarily start-ups,  or  from\r\n\r\nthe   high-tech  sector.   A  traditional  SME  that   is\r\n\r\nconstantly renewing its products is Bee Cheng Hiang,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  that makes ba kua.  In addition to  its  classic\r\n\r\nrange of ba kua, or barbecue pork, the company now offers\r\n\r\ncrispy  ba  kua,  made from pork loin,  for  the  health-conscious consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  also  has  gourmet ba kua for the  connoisseurs.   It\r\n\r\nsells  ba chang with ba kua filling.  And it collaborates\r\n\r\nwith  Pizza Hut and BreadTalk to offer pizza with ba kua,\r\n\r\nas well as ba hu in the bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will ensure that\r\n\r\nSingapore is pro-business, and conducive to starting  and\r\n\r\ngrowing a company.  We have reduced business registration\r\n\r\nand  renewal  fees.  We have now allowed  people  to  run\r\n\r\nbusinesses  from  their homes.  The  Government  is  also\r\n\r\nimproving  access to financing, especially for  SMEs  and\r\n\r\nstart-ups  with  little or no track record.   Yes,  there\r\n\r\ncould  still be red tapes, and, perhaps, if our  MPs  can\r\n\r\npoint  out  where the red tape is, we will be  more  than\r\n\r\nhappy to give them a pair of scissors to help us cut  the\r\n\r\nred tape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by putting our current difficulties\r\n\r\nand prospects in perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last six years have been extremely uncertain and\r\n\r\npainful  for the world and for Singapore.  We encountered\r\n\r\ncrisis  after crisis, which severely dampened the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.  In 1997 and 1998, the loss of confidence in the\r\n\r\nThai   baht  sparked  off  the  Asian  financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  was  the  most badly  hit.   It  plunged  into\r\n\r\nseveral  years  of  instability  and  uncertainty.    The\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  also  damaged other  economies:  South\r\n\r\nKorea,   Hong   Kong,  Malaysia,  and  the   Philippines.\r\n\r\nSingapore, too, was hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th September 2001, Al Qaeda terrorists\r\n\r\nshattered  America's sense of invulnerability.   A  month\r\n\r\nlater,   America,  supported  by  international   forces,\r\n\r\ndeclared  war  against  the  terrorists.   They   pounded\r\n\r\nTaleban and Al Qaeda positions in Afghanistan, and rolled\r\n\r\ninto  the  country.  Throughout 2002 and  2003,  security\r\n\r\nforces across the world cracked down on terrorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the terrorists struck back. In October 2002,\r\n\r\nJemaah Islamiyah terrorists killed several hundred people\r\n\r\nin Bali.  Last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth,  they  claimed more lives in  the  Marriott  Hotel\r\n\r\nbombing in Jakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2003, President George Bush went to war\r\n\r\nagainst Iraq.  The war was over quickly.  But even as the\r\n\r\nUS  worked  to restore order in Iraq, we were hit  again,\r\n\r\nthis  time by a health crisis.  SARS struck Singapore  in\r\n\r\nMarch.   Travellers returning from Hong Kong  unwittingly\r\n\r\nbrought  the  virus  home.  Thus began  the  outbreak  in\r\n\r\nSingapore that caused several months of anguish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no control over these external events, which\r\n\r\nbadly  affected the confidence of investors and  tourists\r\n\r\nin the region.  Unfortunately, these crises are not over.\r\n\r\nThe international terrorist network is still functioning,\r\n\r\nand SARS may make a comeback.  So we must be prepared for\r\n\r\nmore  shocks,  and  maybe another sudden  plunge  to  our\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also prepare for a permanent change in the\r\n\r\nexternal  competitive  environment.   Before,   we   were\r\n\r\ncompeting  in  the league of emerging economies,  without\r\n\r\nChina  and  India.  We did well.  Now, these  two  giants\r\n\r\nhave  joined  the  games.  India  is  a  rising  star  in\r\n\r\nservices  sectors  such  as  IT,  accounting  and   other\r\n\r\nbackroom work.  China joined the World Trade Organisation\r\n\r\nin   2001  and  since  then,  has  dominated  the  global\r\n\r\nmanufacturing market for lower-end products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these external developments - the crises and the\r\n\r\nstronger  competition  -  have  slowed  down  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.   This  is  because  ours  is  a  small\r\n\r\neconomy,  very  much  dependent on external  markets  and\r\n\r\nforeign  investments. External demand accounts  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  two  thirds of our total demand.  Trade  is  nearly\r\n\r\nthree  times the size of our GDP.  And 80 cents of  every\r\n\r\ndollar  invested in the manufacturing sector  is  foreign\r\n\r\nmoney.   As  for jobs, 50 out of every 100  jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, and 20 out of  every  100  in  the\r\n\r\nservices sector, are in foreign companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are like a sailboat, dependent on the wind to\r\n\r\nmove.  If the wind is behind us,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  can  sail very fast.  But if the wind dies, our  boat\r\n\r\nwill crawl.  If the wind is against us, it requires a lot\r\n\r\nof  skill  just  to  stay in the same  spot  and  not  go\r\n\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this difficult global economy, you will find\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  moving  slowly.  But when  the  conditions\r\n\r\nimprove,  and I believe they will by next year,  we  will\r\n\r\npick up speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the external environment is brightening.\r\n\r\nThe  US  economy picked up momentum in the second quarter\r\n\r\nand  has continued to accelerate.  It is expected to grow\r\n\r\nby 2.3% this year and 3.7% next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good news. Stronger US growth will benefit\r\n\r\nthe  EU and Japanese economies.  Already, Europe has seen\r\n\r\nsustained  improvement  in  business  sentiments.   Clear\r\n\r\nsigns of stronger growth are also visible in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economies too, should improve their\r\n\r\nperformance.    Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Thailand   are\r\n\r\nexpected to grow by a higher 4% to 5% next year.  China's\r\n\r\ngrowth  will likely remain at more than 7% this year  and\r\n\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the global electronics industry\r\n\r\ncontinues  to recover.  Worldwide sales of semiconductors\r\n\r\nare likely to grow by 11% this year and 21% next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in the external economy will have an\r\n\r\nuplifting  effect  on Singapore.  Already,  visitors  are\r\n\r\nreturning.  The manufacturing sector is seeing signs of a\r\n\r\npickup.   Our  businesses too, are more optimistic.  Many\r\n\r\nanalysts,  therefore,  expect the  Singapore  economy  to\r\n\r\nrebound  by  between 4% and 5% next year.   MTI  is  also\r\n\r\nconfident of stronger growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a further reason why we should not delay the\r\n\r\nchanges to our CPF system.  When global demand picks  up,\r\n\r\nwe  want to be there to catch the wind.  We want  to  put\r\n\r\nourselves  in  the most advantageous position.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, cutting CPF costs is like throwing overboard some\r\n\r\nof the weight in our sailboat.  Then when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwinds  blow again next year, we are lighter and  will  be\r\n\r\nable to go much faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply appreciative that MPs have supported the\r\n\r\nchanges to the CPF.  I hope fellow Singaporeans will also\r\n\r\nstand  solidly behind the changes.  Let us show the world\r\n\r\nour  solidarity  and  our  firm resolve  to  recover  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.    If   we  reinforce   our   hardheaded\r\n\r\nreputation,  we will give investors even more  confidence\r\n\r\nto invest in Singapore for the long-term.  They will know\r\n\r\nthat  rain or shine, wind or no wind, they can  count  on\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore.  They will know that  here,  we\r\n\r\nhave a people who will never give up, who will never give\r\n\r\nin,  and  who  will always pull together  as  one  united\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the music stopped for Singapore? Is the party\r\n\r\nover?  No.  We are merely changing the Elvis Presley  and\r\n\r\nJailhouse Rock records, to something more modern on  CDs.\r\n\r\nThe  songs may be slower, and you may have to change your\r\n\r\ndance steps.  But you can still enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will Singapore be in 38 years' time? No one\r\n\r\ncan tell for sure.  But if I have to bet, I would put  my\r\n\r\nmoney on Singapore remaining in the First World.  Because\r\n\r\nI  know  that a nation's destiny lies in its people,  and\r\n\r\nhere, in this little nation, we have a great people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I have your\r\n\r\npermission to clarify something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I believe that our CPF\r\n\r\nshould  not be cut below 35%, more so after listening  to\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's speech.  Neither am I convinced that\r\n\r\nthe  proposed 3% cut in CPF to 33% would help much in our\r\n\r\neconomic recovery.  With job creation or saving jobs,  PM\r\n\r\nhas  rightly pointed out that the key factor is  actually\r\n\r\nexternal environment.  He said that he wanted to  send  a\r\n\r\nstrong signal to investors.  What I want to know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis:  how many signals do we have to send?  In 1998,  when\r\n\r\nwe  cut  the CPF, we said we wanted to send a  signal  to\r\n\r\ninvestors.  How about PAP's resolve to be lean - to  send\r\n\r\na  signal as well?  How about cutting red tapes, waste or\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers'  salaries  - to  send  a  signal  to  the\r\n\r\ninvestors?  Why must he always choose to cut the workers'\r\n\r\nCPF  and  wages  in  order to send  a  signal?   That  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which I do not understand.   I  hope  PM  will\r\n\r\nclarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the CPF cuts do help in some way, I am\r\n\r\nof   the   view   that  the  suffering,   the   long-term\r\n\r\nimplications ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, you are making a speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am clarifying because\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister asked me whether the Opposition  MPs\r\n\r\nhave  all supported the cuts.  It is not correct,  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  to let him know.  So I am now letting him know.   I\r\n\r\nam not supporting and clarifying why I am not supporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suffering and the long-term implication of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF cuts on the people do not justify the short-term\r\n\r\nbenefit, which I think PM has outlined.  The PM has  also\r\n\r\nin  his speech said that there are sufficient jobs to  go\r\n\r\nround,  and he lamented that Singaporeans do not want  to\r\n\r\ntake them up.  In that case, what is the problem?  Why do\r\n\r\nwe  need  to cut the CPF further?  To save jobs, as  what\r\n\r\nmany people have said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to clarify the Prime Minister's speech\r\n\r\non  the question of amnesia or selective amnesia.  I hope\r\n\r\nPM  will  clarify.  Did the PAP not promise  jobs  and  a\r\n\r\nsecure  future  at  the  last  election?   And  he   also\r\n\r\nmentioned  in his speech that, to be a political  leader,\r\n\r\nyou  have to show results, albeit at a slower pace.  Yes,\r\n\r\nI  agree.   But  could he tell us then,  since  the  last\r\n\r\nelection until now, what were the results compared to the\r\n\r\npromise  given  to the people and the people's  trust  by\r\n\r\ngiving the PAP 75% of the votes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has also criticised MPs and\r\n\r\nsaid  that he objects to the word \"betrayal\" which  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  strong  word.  But would he offer some suggestions?\r\n\r\nHow  does he describe the situation in which the PAP  had\r\n\r\npromised and committed to restoring the CPF to 40% at the\r\n\r\nlast election?  Many Ministers, including the unions, had\r\n\r\nsaid,  loud and clear, before the election, that we would\r\n\r\nrestore  CPF.  And now, after the election, you  cut  the\r\n\r\nCPF.   There  is  no return to 40%, and it  is  going  to\r\n\r\nfluctuate.  How would the people square with  that?   How\r\n\r\ndoes the Government square with that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been\r\n\r\ndebating this issue in the House for the last four  days,\r\n\r\nand  Mr Low is raising the same questions again.  We  can\r\n\r\nhave another four days to go through the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that Mr Low agrees with us that we must\r\n\r\nmake  some  changes  to the CPF.  I say  33%  is,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, the best rate.  As I said, nobody knows  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term which is the appropriate rate.  He again,  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake of playing opposition politics, says  35%.   We\r\n\r\nhave thought of that.  35% is neither here nor there.  We\r\n\r\nmight  as  well stay at 36%.  But if we want  to  make  a\r\n\r\nchange,  we make one which is sizeable enough,  which  is\r\n\r\n3%,  or  go right down to 30%.  But we have gone  through\r\n\r\nall this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why we are in the current\r\n\r\neconomic  situation, and I, for one, believe that  demand\r\n\r\nis  a  very important factor in the equation.  So I would\r\n\r\nnot myself support going down to 30%.  Once we go down to\r\n\r\n30%  and, later on, if we want to go up to 33%, or  more,\r\n\r\nit is difficult.  So let us settle for something which we\r\n\r\nthink is doable, which is 33%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few years from now, if our wages go up because\r\n\r\nthe  demand for workers has shot up suddenly  and  it  is\r\n\r\nhigh, we can then adjust the CPF upwards, not necessarily\r\n\r\nto  36%.  When we do that, we would put the funds for the\r\n\r\nnew  rates  into  the Special Account, not  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount, and Singaporeans should plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the basis when they are buying a house, on 33%.   But\r\n\r\nif we are wrong, and indeed we need to cut costs further,\r\n\r\nthen  we  have room to move down by 3%.  But the crux  of\r\n\r\nthe matter is that Mr Low is not in disagreement with  us\r\n\r\nthat we must tackle the CPF as one of the instruments  to\r\n\r\nbring about economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for amnesia, I have gone through this just now.\r\n\r\nYes,  we  made  a  promise.  I  made  a  promise  at  the\r\n\r\nelections.  But the difference between the Member and  me\r\n\r\nis  that I tell the people the truth.  When the situation\r\n\r\nhas  changed, I told them that these are the setbacks  we\r\n\r\nhave  suffered, these are the problems, let us move  from\r\n\r\n40% to 36% to 33%.  Whereas here, as I said, even at this\r\n\r\nstage, after my speech, he is still fanning the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he seriously recommend that we go back to 40%?\r\n\r\nI  made the promise that we should go back.  I am telling\r\n\r\nthe  people  now  that if we go down to  33%,  would  the\r\n\r\nMember stand up and tell the people that 40% is right for\r\n\r\nSingapore now?  Would he?

The current\r\n\r\nBill    implements    12   of   the   CLRF    Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  aimed at reducing the  cost  of  raising\r\n\r\ncapital  in  Singapore, by rationalising and  simplifying\r\n\r\nthe  requirements in the SFA for offers  of  investments.\r\n\r\nWe  are also taking this opportunity in amending the  SFA\r\n\r\nto  incorporate some technical amendments to the  SFA  in\r\n\r\nthe light of industry developments and feedback on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation of the Act over the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase of amendments, targeted for the\r\n\r\nsecond   half  of  2004,  will  implement  the  remaining\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  CLRF Committee,  and  introduce\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the regulatory framework for the  securities\r\n\r\nand  futures  industry requiring more substantive  policy\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) invited\r\n\r\nfeedback  from the industry and the public on  the  draft\r\n\r\nBill  in  April  this year, and has posted  its  detailed\r\n\r\nresponses   to   the   comments  received   during   this\r\n\r\nconsultation on its website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the main\r\n\r\namendments in the Bill, beginning with those implementing\r\n\r\nthe CLRF Committee's recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Facilitating capital raising</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory framework for capital raising has to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  needs  of issuer companies  with  those  of\r\n\r\ninvestors.  This is achieved by imposing requirements  on\r\n\r\nthe conduct of public offers, such as requiring offers to\r\n\r\nbe  accompanied  by a prospectus.  The Bill  rationalises\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  for public offers of  investments.   The\r\n\r\nthrust  of the amendments is to make it easier  and  less\r\n\r\nexpensive   for   companies  to   raise   funds   without\r\n\r\ncompromising investor protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exemption from prospectus requirements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA already exempts several classes of offers\r\n\r\nfrom prospectus requirements.  These exemptions cater  to\r\n\r\noffers  where it would not be prejudicial to  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest to dispense with a prospectus, such as when  the\r\n\r\noffer  is  not available to the general public, or  where\r\n\r\ninformation  in the prospectus is already available  from\r\n\r\nother sources.  Clause 76 exempts three further types  of\r\n\r\noffers of investments from the prospectus requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there will be a new exemption for offers made\r\n\r\nin  connection  with a takeover of a foreign-incorporated\r\n\r\ncompany,   if  the  offer  complies  with  the   relevant\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  country  where  the  company   was\r\n\r\nincorporated.   This  extends the current  exemption  for\r\n\r\noffers  that comply with the Singapore Code on  Takeovers\r\n\r\nand   Mergers  to  foreign  companies  subject  to  other\r\n\r\ncomparable regulations, and allows Singapore shareholders\r\n\r\nof  such  companies  to  participate  in  these  takeover\r\n\r\noffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, issues of units of securities, including\r\n\r\ncovered  warrants, to be listed on a securities  exchange\r\n\r\nwill  be  exempted,  if  the  underlying  securities  are\r\n\r\nalready  listed.  Information on listed companies  should\r\n\r\nalready  be  readily available to investors, given  their\r\n\r\nobligations  to  disclose  material  information   on   a\r\n\r\ncontinuous basis.  Further, as the listing rules  of  the\r\n\r\nExchange  require that the terms and conditions  of  such\r\n\r\nlisted units be disclosed, there is therefore no need  to\r\n\r\nrequire a fresh prospectus for the offer of such units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the exemption for offers by a corporation\r\n\r\npursuant  to  an  employee investment  scheme,  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  restricted  to  current  employees,  will   be\r\n\r\nextended.   The  amendment  will  allow  all  bona   fide\r\n\r\nemployees  and former employees to participate  in  these\r\n\r\nschemes.   There  are no strong reasons to  restrict  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  such employee investment schemes to  just  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  employees.   The  changes  will  give  companies\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility in responding to market  conditions,\r\n\r\nand  in  structuring  their  incentive  and  compensation\r\n\r\npackages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Resale of securities exempt from prospectus requirements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SFA, offers made only to sophisticated or\r\n\r\ninstitutional investors are exempted from the  prospectus\r\n\r\nrequirements.   To  prevent  the  circumvention  of   our\r\n\r\nprospectus   requirements,  any  resale   of   securities\r\n\r\npurchased pursuant to such exemptions to persons who  are\r\n\r\nnot sophisticated or institutional investors will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe regarded as a public offering requiring a prospectus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction does not apply for the resale of\r\n\r\nlisted  shares  and debentures, if the transactions  take\r\n\r\nplace six months or more after the initial acquisition of\r\n\r\nthe  securities.  However, the resale of unlisted  shares\r\n\r\nand  debentures requires a prospectus, whether or not six\r\n\r\nmonths  have elapsed.  This is restrictive and  does  not\r\n\r\naccord  with  the  practice in other major  international\r\n\r\nfinancial centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 78, therefore, aligns the practice for listed\r\n\r\nand unlisted shares and debentures.  Resale of shares and\r\n\r\ndebentures,  whether listed or unlisted,  acquired  under\r\n\r\nthe  institutional or sophisticated investor  exemptions,\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  deemed a public offer, if six months  have\r\n\r\nelapsed since the initial purchase.  Unlisted shares  and\r\n\r\ndebentures   may   be  resold  to  persons   other   than\r\n\r\ninstitutional  or sophisticated investors  after  the  6-month  period without a prospectus, as long as  the  sale\r\n\r\ndoes not amount to a public offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For collective investment schemes, the CLRF\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommended allowing the secondary trading  of\r\n\r\nschemes    purchased   under   the   institutional    and\r\n\r\nsophisticated investor exemptions.  Clauses 91, 92 and 93\r\n\r\nremove the requirement that units in such schemes be non-transferable   and   allow   subsequent    sales    among\r\n\r\ninstitutional and sophisticated investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Replacing  certain  offer documents with  an  information statement</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn next to\r\n\r\nreplacing  certain  offer documents with  an  information\r\n\r\nstatement.   When a listed company makes  a  renounceable\r\n\r\nrights  issue, clause 68 replaces the current requirement\r\n\r\nfor the company to issue an abridged prospectus with that\r\n\r\nof an offer information statement.  The offer information\r\n\r\nstatement will be a shorter and more relevant document in\r\n\r\nsuch circumstances.  As mentioned earlier, information on\r\n\r\nsuch  listed issuers would be publicly available, as they\r\n\r\nalready    comply   with   the   continuous    disclosure\r\n\r\nobligations.  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclause  79  provides  that  a listed  company  may  offer\r\n\r\nadditional  issues  of shares using an offer  information\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of reporting requirements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several provisions in the SFA have been repealed to\r\n\r\nfurther  streamline the fund-raising process.  Clause  77\r\n\r\nremoves  the  need  to  lodge, with MAS,  an  information\r\n\r\nmemorandum  used  for offers to sophisticated  investors.\r\n\r\nClause  80  dispenses with the need to lodge a notice  to\r\n\r\ninvoke  exemptions from the prospectus requirements,  and\r\n\r\nrepeals   the   requirement  for   Singapore-incorporated\r\n\r\nissuers to maintain a register of securities issued under\r\n\r\nan exemption from the prospectus requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no countervailing public interest to\r\n\r\nbe  served in requiring MAS to be the depository of  such\r\n\r\nexempted   offering   documents,  such   as   information\r\n\r\nmemoranda   and   notices  invoking   exemptions.    Such\r\n\r\nrequirements  only add to administrative  and  regulatory\r\n\r\ncosts.   The  CLRF  Committee also found  no  reason  why\r\n\r\nSingapore-incorporated issuers should maintain a register\r\n\r\nof exempted issues, when foreign-incorporated issuers are\r\n\r\nnot subject to this requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of requirements on trustees for debentures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA currently requires issuer companies to\r\n\r\nappoint   trustees  and  to  include  certain  prescribed\r\n\r\ncovenants  in  the  trust deed for  public  offerings  of\r\n\r\ndebentures.   These requirements are not  stipulated  for\r\n\r\nshare  offers,  even  though the  risks  associated  with\r\n\r\ndebentures  are  generally lower than those  for  shares.\r\n\r\nClause  72,  therefore,  repeals  these  provisions   and\r\n\r\nremoves the current differential treatment between  share\r\n\r\nand  debenture  offers.  The differential treatment  also\r\n\r\ndoes  not  accord  with the prevailing practices  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  bond  market and increases  the  cost  for\r\n\r\ndebenture issuers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the other amendments that\r\n\r\naddress industry feedback and market developments in  the\r\n\r\nlast two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regulation of clearing facilities for OTC derivatives</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the long title and expands the scope\r\n\r\nof  the  SFA to include clearing facilities for Over-the-Counter  (OTC) derivatives.  MAS' oversight  of  clearing\r\n\r\nfacilities  under  the  SFA is  currently  restricted  to\r\n\r\nfacilities  that  clear securities and futures  contracts\r\n\r\nthat  are traded on exchanges or other organised  trading\r\n\r\nplatforms.   This  has  worked well  in  the  past,  when\r\n\r\nclearing facilities were largely limited to clearing  for\r\n\r\nexchange-traded instruments.  Trades in  the  OTC  market\r\n\r\nwere  negotiated and settled bilaterally, usually between\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the increasing use of sophisticated\r\n\r\nOTC  contracts,  clearing facilities for these  contracts\r\n\r\nhave  emerged.   These facilities pose risks  similar  to\r\n\r\nthose    of   facilities   that   clear   exchange-traded\r\n\r\ninstruments.  It would, therefore, be prudent for MAS  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  power  to  regulate such  clearing  facilities\r\n\r\noperating in Singapore or targeting Singaporean investors\r\n\r\nwhere they pose risks to MAS' regulatory objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Temporary licensing regime</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of MAS' ongoing review of the licensing\r\n\r\nregime,  and  in response to feedback from the  industry,\r\n\r\nMAS  will be introducing a temporary licensing regime for\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Clause  36 allows MAS  to  issue  temporary\r\n\r\nlicences  to  individuals residing outside Singapore  who\r\n\r\nplan  to engage in regulated activities in Singapore,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of a locally-licensed entity, but for a short-term\r\n\r\nbasis.   The  application process will be simplified  and\r\n\r\nprocessing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime   will  be  shortened.   This  will  give  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions   flexibility   in   deploying    specialist\r\n\r\nexpertise on a short-term basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Flexibility of administration</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Bill will seek to give MAS greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  carrying out its duties.   For  example,\r\n\r\nclause 45 will empower MAS to issue rules on the training\r\n\r\nand  qualifications  of representatives  through  written\r\n\r\ndirections rather than subsidiary legislation.   MAS  may\r\n\r\nchange  these requirements without needing to go  through\r\n\r\nthe  process of promulgating subsidiary legislation,  and\r\n\r\nany changes can then come into effect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 100 will empower MAS to appoint its senior\r\n\r\nofficers   to   grant  or  revoke  specified   regulatory\r\n\r\nexemptions on a case-by-case basis.  Such exemptions need\r\n\r\nnot  be  published in the Government Gazette.  MAS  needs\r\n\r\nonly  notify the exempted entity in writing.   This  will\r\n\r\nshorten  MAS'  response  time to  applications  for  such\r\n\r\nexemptions.   For  example, time-sensitive  requests  for\r\n\r\nexemptions  from prospectus rules are quite common.   The\r\n\r\nresult  is  that  MAS  will  then  be  able  to  be  more\r\n\r\nresponsive to the needs of a rapid changing marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reduction in regulatory and compliance costs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to reduce regulatory and\r\n\r\ncompliance  costs, where these do not afford commensurate\r\n\r\nprotection  to the investors.  Clause 49 will remove  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  licence holders to sign  circulars  and\r\n\r\nother written communications sent by them, and to shorten\r\n\r\nthe retention period for such materials from seven to six\r\n\r\nyears.    This  is  in  line  with  the  record   keeping\r\n\r\nrequirements  in other parts of the SFA,  and  consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the statutory period of limitations for contractual\r\n\r\nactions under the Limitation Act (Cap. 163).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other changes aimed at cutting regulatory and\r\n\r\ncompliance costs will be made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the subsidiary legislation promulgated by MAS, as part\r\n\r\nof  MAS'  ongoing review to ensure that its rules  remain\r\n\r\nrelevant and business-friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Opportunity to be heard</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, MAS has been vested, under the SFA, with\r\n\r\nadministrative  powers, including  powers  to  revoke  or\r\n\r\nsuspend    licences    of    corporations    and    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, approve markets and clearing facilities,\r\n\r\nand  issue  stop  orders on offers of  investment.   Such\r\n\r\npowers will be exercised judiciously by MAS to pursue its\r\n\r\nstatutory  objectives.   In line with  rules  of  natural\r\n\r\njustice,  the SFA provides for opportunities to be  heard\r\n\r\nto  parties  who  are  aggrieved by  MAS'  administrative\r\n\r\ndecisions.  The Bill extends the opportunity to be  heard\r\n\r\nto a wider range of MAS' decisions that could potentially\r\n\r\naffect an applicant's interests adversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFA currently provides a list of exceptions to\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to be heard.  The intent  behind  these\r\n\r\nexceptions  was  to dispense with the opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\nheard  where the original decision was based on objective\r\n\r\nfacts  and it would be improbable for MAS to reverse  its\r\n\r\ndecision as a result of new information introduced  at  a\r\n\r\nhearing.   An example would be when the aggrieved  party,\r\n\r\nor  a  related entity, was insolvent or near  insolvency.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill further narrows the list of exceptions  to  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  be  heard to cases where  the  aggrieved\r\n\r\nparty  is already insolvent, or has been convicted of  an\r\n\r\noffence  involving fraud or dishonesty.  These exceptions\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  small  and  unambiguous  subset   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances under which MAS would want to exercise  its\r\n\r\nadministrative powers in protecting the interests of  the\r\n\r\ninvesting  public.  Nevertheless, parties who are  denied\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to be heard will still have the right  to\r\n\r\nappeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the capital markets are constantly evolving,\r\n\r\nand the regulatory framework must therefore keep pace  to\r\n\r\nremain  responsive and relevant.  But we must be  mindful\r\n\r\nthat  the  SFA  is a relatively new piece of  legislation\r\n\r\nthat both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAS  and the industry are still growing into.  Thus, only\r\n\r\nminor  changes  have been introduced  in  this  round  of\r\n\r\namendments and other more substantive policy reforms have\r\n\r\nbeen deferred to the second half of 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives us a chance to improve and clarify\r\n\r\naspects  of the SFA. Many of these amendments, especially\r\n\r\nthose to implement the Company Legislation and Regulatory\r\n\r\nFramework  Committee's recommendations, will help  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness costs in Singapore.

These rules  were\r\n\r\npreviously  found in separate legislation -  the  Futures\r\n\r\nTrading  Act, the Insurance Intermediaries  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry  Act.

The second  phase,\r\n\r\nwhich involves more in-depth policy reviews, is scheduled\r\n\r\nto be completed in the second half of 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS conducted a public consultation review in April\r\n\r\n2003.   MAS'  detailed reply to the comments received  in\r\n\r\nthe course of the public consultation is published on its\r\n\r\nwebsite.   Madam, let me now highlight the key amendments\r\n\r\nthat are proposed in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exclusion of life reinsurance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the definition of \"life policy\" in\r\n\r\nsection  2(1)  to  exclude  any contract  of  reinsurance\r\n\r\nbecause life reinsurance activities are already regulated\r\n\r\nby  MAS under the Insurance Act (Chapter 142).  With this\r\n\r\namendment,  a  person conducting any  activity  involving\r\n\r\ncontracts   of  reinsurance  is  only  subject   to   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the Insurance Act.

This  ensures\r\n\r\nproper accountability by the principal for the conduct of\r\n\r\nthe representative.  Corporate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentities  will not be permitted to act as representatives\r\n\r\nof financial advisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Greater scope for MAS to issue written directions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General or specific written directions are legally\r\n\r\nenforceable.  Clause 19 amends section 58 to empower  MAS\r\n\r\nto  issue written directions to representatives of exempt\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers. This amendment  will  harmonise  the\r\n\r\napplication of section 58 for representatives of licensed\r\n\r\nfinancial   advisers   and  representatives   of   exempt\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisers.  While  representatives  of   exempt\r\n\r\nfinancial   advisers   are  not  required   to   hold   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative's licence, the business conduct  rules  of\r\n\r\nthe FAA will apply to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable MAS to respond quickly to time-sensitive\r\n\r\nindustry  developments  or  requests  from  the  industry\r\n\r\nparticipants,  the amended section 58  also  expands  the\r\n\r\nscope  that written directions can cover.  I have earlier\r\n\r\nnoted  a  similar amendment in the Securities and Futures\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the following are also amendments that are\r\n\r\ncommon to the SFA Bill and this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Communications containing recommendations on securities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial advisers will no longer be required to\r\n\r\nsign  circulars  or  other  communications  that  contain\r\n\r\nrecommendations on securities.  MAS has received feedback\r\n\r\nfrom the industry that the requirement for a signature is\r\n\r\nadministratively  difficult.  MAS has  decided  that  the\r\n\r\nrequirement   can   be   removed   without   compromising\r\n\r\ninvestors'  interest  because  financial  advisers   will\r\n\r\nremain  accountable for their recommendations.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, section 126 of the Evidence Act safeguards\r\n\r\nconfidential   official   communications    from    being\r\n\r\ndisclosed,  when disclosure would be detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, this protection is only applicable with\r\n\r\nrespect  to confidential official communications made  to\r\n\r\n\"public officers\".  The term \"public officer\" as used  in\r\n\r\nthe  Evidence Act does not include officers and employees\r\n\r\nof  statutory  bodies,  even  when  they  are  exercising\r\n\r\nofficial   functions  similar  to  those  of   Government\r\n\r\nagencies and receive confidential communications  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of discharging their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 126 was drafted at a time when almost all\r\n\r\ngovernmental   functions  were   performed   within   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Over the years, however, many  governmental\r\n\r\nfunctions  have increasingly been devolved  to  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.   There  are  merits to such devolution.   A  key\r\n\r\nbenefit is the flexibility of statutory bodies to  better\r\n\r\nharness  their professional capabilities and  concentrate\r\n\r\non developing their core competencies.  This ensures that\r\n\r\nthe   public  sector  continues  to  remain  nimble   and\r\n\r\nresponsive to challenges of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with the devolution of functions from\r\n\r\nMinistries to statutory bodies, officers in the statutory\r\n\r\nbodies   would   receive   such   confidential   official\r\n\r\ninformation  in  the course of their work.  They  require\r\n\r\nsuch  information in order to discharge  their  functions\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to conversion into a statutory body, the same\r\n\r\ninformation would have been protected by section  126  of\r\n\r\nthe  Evidence Act because the officer would have received\r\n\r\nsuch  information  as  a  Ministry  official.   With  the\r\n\r\nconversion,  these  officers  are  no  longer  considered\r\n\r\n\"public  officers\" within the scope of the Evidence  Act.\r\n\r\nThey  will not be protected under the Evidence  Act  from\r\n\r\ndisclosing confidential official communications in  court\r\n\r\nproceedings  even  if this would be  detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\npublic interest.  Madam, this is not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this Bill seeks to extend the protection of\r\n\r\nsection 126 to confidential official communications  made\r\n\r\nto  officers  in selected statutory bodies.  In  essence,\r\n\r\nthe  effect  is to restore the position to  what  it  was\r\n\r\nbefore the formation of the statutory body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to assure the House that\r\n\r\nsafeguards  are  in place to ensure that  this  amendment\r\n\r\nwill  not  lead  to  information being  unduly  withheld.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this protection is not extended to all statutory\r\n\r\nbodies,  but  only  to  those that  are  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Secrets  Act.  Currently,  there  are  23  such\r\n\r\nlisted entities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout of about 70 statutory bodies.  Hence, we have avoided\r\n\r\na  wide  blunderbuss  approach, adopting  a  focused  and\r\n\r\ncalibrated one instead.  These statutory bodies that  are\r\n\r\nlisted  handle  official information  vital  to  national\r\n\r\nsecurity  or  national  interest.   Let  me  mention  two\r\n\r\nexamples  as  illustrations. The  Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (MAS) handles information that can impact  our\r\n\r\neconomic  security and that contain market sensitivities.\r\n\r\nThe  Defence  Science and Technology  Agency  (DSTA)  has\r\n\r\naccess   to   information   on  the   SAF's   development\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  defence plans and weapons  capabilities.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the protection against disclosure of  official\r\n\r\ncommunications,  especially that between  the  Government\r\n\r\nand  such organisations, is a logical extension of  their\r\n\r\ncoverage under the Official Secrets Act by virtue of  the\r\n\r\nsensitive nature of the information they receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new section 126(2) will not be\r\n\r\nautomatically invoked to prevent disclosure of all or any\r\n\r\ninformation or communications that is reposed in a listed\r\n\r\nstatutory  body. It will only be invoked when  disclosure\r\n\r\nof  the  information or communication  harms  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the track record on the invoking of section\r\n\r\n126  should  give  some assurance.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\ninvoked  the existing section 126 sparingly thus far  and\r\n\r\nonly  after  careful consideration.  We  only  do  so  if\r\n\r\ndisclosure  will  harm the public  interest.   This  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be our approach under the expanded  section\r\n\r\n126.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the courts will continue to play a role in\r\n\r\nensuring that the privilege under section 126 will not be\r\n\r\ninvoked to prevent all disclosures of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will ensure that official information\r\n\r\ncontinues to be properly safeguarded and managed for  the\r\n\r\noverall interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I rise in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  of this Bill, but I have some concerns  which  I\r\n\r\nhope the Senior Minister of State can address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fundamental principle of justice that\r\n\r\nwhenever  evidence is required of a case in  a  court  of\r\n\r\nlaw,  such  evidence  should be  provided  unless  it  is\r\n\r\nprotected   by   well   established   privileges.    Such\r\n\r\nprivileges include legal professional privilege and state\r\n\r\nprivilege for affairs of state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this Bill extends the privilege, as explained\r\n\r\nby  the Senior Minister of State, to officers other  than\r\n\r\npublic officers.  The Senior Minister of State says  that\r\n\r\nit  extends  mainly to the statutory officers working  in\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  and  that,  currently,  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncovered  under  the original section 126(1).   Does  that\r\n\r\nmean  that such officers are not to be regarded as public\r\n\r\nofficers  because of the devolution of statutory  bodies?\r\n\r\nThis is the first point I want to ask.  And if it is  the\r\n\r\ncase  then,  obviously, there is a reason to  extend  the\r\n\r\nprovision as suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on the discretion given to such\r\n\r\npersons.   It is quite obvious, listening to  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State, that there would be about  70  bodies\r\n\r\nthat could be listed under the Official Secrets Act.   Is\r\n\r\nit  a good idea to provide such a wide discretion to such\r\n\r\na  large  group of officers?  If we look at the  proposed\r\n\r\nprovision,  it says that the officer himself will  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  it is in the public interest or not to  disclose\r\n\r\nthe information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many jurisdictions, this is not the case. The\r\n\r\ncourt  usually has the authority to go behind the  public\r\n\r\nofficer's  reasons or any officer's reasons, including  a\r\n\r\nMinister's reasons, for disclosure.  They can examine the\r\n\r\nofficial  communications before they allow such  evidence\r\n\r\nto be withheld or order for disclosure.  So, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  whether  it is intended, in this  provision,  to\r\n\r\nprovide such officers with the absolute discretion to say\r\n\r\nwhether  a  piece of evidence is or is not in the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  to  disclose.  If so, I think the provision  is\r\n\r\nfar too wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that\r\n\r\nthere are important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  for  which such  provisions  are  very\r\n\r\ncritical for the proper working of such statutory bodies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the MAS.  But it has come to my notice that  the\r\n\r\nschedule of the Official Secrets Act includes such bodies\r\n\r\nas  the  National  Heritage Board.  If  such  bodies  are\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the Schedule, I wonder why should  officers\r\n\r\nserving  such  bodies,  firstly, be  under  the  Official\r\n\r\nSecrets  Act and, secondly, be allowed to decide  whether\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of  historical  documents,  for  example,  be\r\n\r\nregarded as detrimental to the public interest.  So,  the\r\n\r\nquestion that I have for the Senior Minister of State is:\r\n\r\nhow do we ensure that when such an officer makes a claim,\r\n\r\nthere will be a check on whether such a claim is valid or\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is that, as I look at the section, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Senior Minister of State to confirm\r\n\r\nthat  any  officer  within this  provision  actually  can\r\n\r\nconsent to give evidence of such official communications,\r\n\r\nand that even if the court were to disagree with him that\r\n\r\npublic  interest  would suffer but  if  he  decides  that\r\n\r\npublic  interest would not suffer by such disclosure,  he\r\n\r\nwould  be allowed to give the evidence.  I think this  is\r\n\r\nimplicit in the section.  Perhaps the Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState can clarify on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with concern the proposed amendment in the\r\n\r\nEvidence Bill.  The Bill, in its original form and in the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment,  gives too much  discretion  to  the\r\n\r\nperson called to give evidence in court.  First, how  can\r\n\r\nany  person, whether a member, officer or an employee of,\r\n\r\nor  is  seconded to, any organisation under the  Official\r\n\r\nSecrets Act or otherwise by his own consideration  refuse\r\n\r\nto  give evidence and not be compelled by the court to do\r\n\r\nso  to give evidence?  There must be a better determinant\r\n\r\nthan  the personal feeling and consideration from such  a\r\n\r\nperson.   The law should provide for a clearer  and  more\r\n\r\nspecific  determinant than a subjective phrase  \"when  he\r\n\r\nconsiders\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the meaning of \"public interest\" is not\r\n\r\ndefined,  explained or elaborated.  Who and what  defines\r\n\r\npublic interest?  What is of interest and concern to  the\r\n\r\npublic  may  be  pronounced  as  State  secrets  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  not in the interest of Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nknow.  Abuse of power and official positions could set in\r\n\r\nif  anything that is not in the favour of the  Government\r\n\r\nor  officials is then classified as State secret and  not\r\n\r\npublicly disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current definition of \"public interest\", like\r\n\r\nthe OB markers, is subjective, evasive and free floating.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Senior Minister of State can  give  a  more\r\n\r\nspecific meaning and definition of \"public interest\" and,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, give a better determinant to a person\r\n\r\ncalled  to  give  evidence  how  and  when  not  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the proposed\r\n\r\namendment  would allow more information  to  be  withheld\r\n\r\nfrom the courts.  This will have the effect of increasing\r\n\r\nsecrecy  and make more organisations less transparent  to\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing section 126, Government officials\r\n\r\nalready   have   the  right  not  to  disclose   official\r\n\r\ncommunication if they feel that it is not in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest to do so.  \"Public interest\" is not defined  and\r\n\r\nthere is no requirement that the public official needs to\r\n\r\nbe  of  any rank.  Anyone in the public service can  make\r\n\r\nthis decision.  It can be subjective and arbitrary.  If a\r\n\r\ndocument  is potentially embarrassing for the Government,\r\n\r\ncould  it be also under public interest to cover  up,  so\r\n\r\nthat people will still have confidence in the Government?\r\n\r\nIf  releasing  the document may result in the  Government\r\n\r\nlosing  a case, should the Government be the one deciding\r\n\r\nwhether it should be released?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts in Singapore have already said that under\r\n\r\nsection 126, the public officer's assessment that  public\r\n\r\ninterest  will suffer is conclusive, and the  court  will\r\n\r\nnot  question it.  This already places a heavy burden for\r\n\r\nanyone who sues the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment and wants to get access to the documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, by extending such a privilege now to 19 more\r\n\r\norganisations, some of which are statutory boards, we are\r\n\r\nputting more blindfolds on the eyes of the court.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned that such an amendment may render the court not\r\n\r\nbeing  able to ascertain the facts of the case and  allow\r\n\r\njustice  to slip away under the guise of public interest.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if an employee of the CPF  Board  believes\r\n\r\nthat  he was unfairly dismissed, CPF Board officials  may\r\n\r\nbe  able  to resist disclosing communications surrounding\r\n\r\nhis  dismissal,  and he will be hampered in  proving  his\r\n\r\ncase in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scenario could be that a death occurs at the\r\n\r\npremises of one of these organisations.  At the Coroner's\r\n\r\ninquiry  into  the circumstances of the death,  even  the\r\n\r\nCoroner will not be able to compel production of official\r\n\r\ncommunications if the officials feel that it  is  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest to disclose it.  This could lead  to\r\n\r\neither an open verdict or even a verdict which is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, staff of these organisations are already\r\n\r\nbound  under  the  Official Secrets  Act  not  to  reveal\r\n\r\nofficial    communications   to   unauthorised   persons.\r\n\r\nHowever,  what  the  Government  wants  to  do  by   this\r\n\r\namendment  will  deprive the courts of information  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  critical  in order to come to a  fair  and  just\r\n\r\ndecision.  We should protect the court's rights  to  have\r\n\r\nall relevant information, as its decision will affect the\r\n\r\nparties  and  also  the  public.   Moreover,  all   these\r\n\r\norganisations    are   financed    by    public    funds.\r\n\r\nAccountability   to   the  public   will   be   seriously\r\n\r\ncompromised if we allow the officials to decide  what  is\r\n\r\nor is not in the public interest to disclose in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, in his speech, said\r\n\r\nthat there would be some safeguards on when to invoke the\r\n\r\nprovision.

I  just  want a clarification  on  a  practical\r\n\r\npoint.    How   does   an  employee,   in   a   protected\r\n\r\norganisation,  know which documents are  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nprotection of section 126(2) of the amended Evidence Act?\r\n\r\nThere  are so many documents floating around.  And if  it\r\n\r\nis  by chance that an employee takes out a document  from\r\n\r\nthe  office,  he  may be charged under  the  new  section\r\n\r\n126(1).   In  case an employee takes out a document,  how\r\n\r\ndoes  he  know that the document is protected  under  the\r\n\r\nAct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Madam, first, I think I\r\n\r\ncan deal quite quickly with Mr Chiam's point.  If we look\r\n\r\nat  the  amendment under discussion, it  is  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  a  person has been asked to participate  in  court\r\n\r\nproceedings to either give information on the  stand,  or\r\n\r\nthrough  interrogatory or discovery, to produce documents\r\n\r\nbefore  the  court.  But if, in his view, the  disclosure\r\n\r\nwould  harm  public interest, then he will  say,  \"No,  I\r\n\r\ncan't  do it.\"  What the provision says is that the court\r\n\r\nwould  then  not  be able to compel him,  because  he  is\r\n\r\nexercising  a  privilege.  That is  the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three general points that I want to make\r\n\r\nfirst.   The  first  point  is that  the  thrust  of  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of  the  Members who have spoken  is  that  the\r\n\r\nsection  is  too wide, either because public interest  is\r\n\r\nnot  defined or on the question of who is to decide.  But\r\n\r\nthe  backdrop  to this whole amendment  is  that  we  are\r\n\r\nrestoring  the  former  position, before  a  Ministry  or\r\n\r\ndepartment  is  converted to a statutory board,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office in the Ministry of Law, which was  converted\r\n\r\ninto the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).  The SLA is  one\r\n\r\nof  the  bodies  listed  in  the  Schedule.   Before  the\r\n\r\nconversion, the officers who were part of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLaw would have handled confidential information as public\r\n\r\nofficers.  And in the case of the Land Office,  it  would\r\n\r\nbe  information  that  can impact,  for  example,  market\r\n\r\nsensitivities  and  policy decisions on  how  we  acquire\r\n\r\nland.   After the conversion to a statutory board,  these\r\n\r\nofficers who join the statutory board would be doing  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing.   They  would  still  have  access  to  such\r\n\r\ninformation.  So, we are saying, \"No, this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not a satisfactory position.\"  We have to continue to\r\n\r\nprotect  this  information from compulsory disclosure  in\r\n\r\ncourt  if  it  is against public interest.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is these 23 statutory bodies have\r\n\r\nbeen  carefully selected.  If you look at the list, which\r\n\r\nis  set  out  in the Official Secrets Act, there  are  23\r\n\r\nbodies  listed there.  So it is not 70 bodies.   I  think\r\n\r\nProf. Chin mentioned 70 bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> You mentioned that\r\n\r\nthere  were 70 bodies.  With the possibility  of  all  of\r\n\r\nthem on it, that would make 70.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Correct. But to the\r\n\r\nMinistries' credit, a careful analysis has been  done  to\r\n\r\nascertain  which  are the statutory  bodies  that  handle\r\n\r\ninformation that is vital and disclosure of which, if  it\r\n\r\nis  not  controlled, would be detrimental to the national\r\n\r\ninterest.  So, for example, you will see statutory bodies\r\n\r\nthere such as MAS, Defence Science and Technology Agency,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Land Authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority,\r\n\r\nJurong Town Corporation and others.  So it is a carefully\r\n\r\nselected  list,  showing that we have  taken  a  targeted\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach we take in the new section 126(2) is\r\n\r\nreally  based on the existing approach in section  126(1)\r\n\r\nor  the current section 126.  That is an important  point\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  basically taking an approach  that  has\r\n\r\nworked.   The section has been there for many years,  and\r\n\r\nhow section 126 has been operated will give an indication\r\n\r\nas to how new section 126(2) will be operated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we need section 126(2) because, and this is in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  Prof.  Chin's  point,  the  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards will no longer be public officers.   So\r\n\r\nthey  are not covered under the current section  126  and\r\n\r\nthat is why we have a new section 126(2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though, prima facie, on the wording of the\r\n\r\nsection, the officer himself decides - if you look at how\r\n\r\nsection 126 has been operationalised over all these years\r\n\r\n-  if  and  when an officer receives, as Prof. Chin  will\r\n\r\nknow, an application for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterrogatories or discovery of documents or information,\r\n\r\nor subpoenaed to give evidence in court, or subpoenaed to\r\n\r\nproduce  documents,  he  will,  of  course,  consult  his\r\n\r\nsuperiors  because  he  is doing  it  on  behalf  of  his\r\n\r\norganisation.  And he will then decide whether or not the\r\n\r\ndisclosure will harm public interest, with the benefit of\r\n\r\nlegal  advice,  which  will include  the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers  who  after   all   is   the\r\n\r\ncustodian  of  public  interest.   So,  that  is  how  in\r\n\r\npractice  this process will continue, both under  section\r\n\r\n126,  as  it has been for many years, and under  the  new\r\n\r\nsection 126(2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is public interest? Mr Low Thia Khiang gave\r\n\r\ncertain  examples of whether or not if the officer  feels\r\n\r\nthat disclosure will harm his own interest, would he then\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  public  interest?  As I have  described  the\r\n\r\nprocess, this will never happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public interest is certainly not the interest of the\r\n\r\nofficer  concerned.  It is not even the interest  of  the\r\n\r\norganisation itself.  It is not even the interest of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because  public  interest  really  means  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest,  ie, the interest  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  like  you  and me,  and  Singaporeans  out\r\n\r\nthere.   So that is the context in which section 126  has\r\n\r\noperated  for  many  years and as I  have  said,  it  has\r\n\r\noperated satisfactorily.  It has not been invoked  willy-nilly,  but  only  after careful consideration,  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith, and only with regard to information, disclosure of\r\n\r\nwhich will harm public interest.  In other words, not all\r\n\r\ninformation  that  reposes in the 23  selected  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  will be subject to this section.  There  will  be\r\n\r\ncareful consideration whether or not this privilege  will\r\n\r\nbe invoked.  So there are safeguards, both in the process\r\n\r\nas well as in the courts playing a role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin mentioned the role of the courts in other\r\n\r\ncountries.  In Singapore, in fact, there have been  cases\r\n\r\nwhere the courts have shown how they will play a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole.  For example, the court will decide whether or  not\r\n\r\nthe  communication or information has been given  to  the\r\n\r\nofficer in official confidence.  That they will do.  And,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the determination of whether or not disclosure\r\n\r\nwill  harm  public interest, as Prof. Chin rightly  said,\r\n\r\nwill be for the person to decide.  But it must be made in\r\n\r\ngood   faith.    I   do   not  think  Parliament   should\r\n\r\ncircumscribe  how the courts will decide the  application\r\n\r\nof  the  section.  But from the decided cases,  it  shows\r\n\r\nthat the courts do play a role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point is that Prof. Chin mentioned the\r\n\r\nNational Heritage Board.  I am sure he knows the National\r\n\r\nArchives is part of the National Heritage Board.  In  the\r\n\r\nNational   Archives  will  be  found   many   unpublished\r\n\r\nGovernment documents and other Government documents which\r\n\r\nneed  the protection. I think I have covered most of  the\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A clarification from the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State.

When  he\r\n\r\nreceives  that,  of  course, he will surface  it  to  his\r\n\r\nsuperiors  -  head  of  department,  probably  the  legal\r\n\r\nofficer  in  the  statutory body would be  involved,  and\r\n\r\ninputs  would  then be sought from the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> So it is the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  that will decide whether to disclose,  and  not\r\n\r\nthe  organisation  concerned.

But  that\r\n\r\nis  a practice and practice can change, and this practice\r\n\r\nis not documented in words.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me explain why the\r\n\r\nflexibility is needed as worded in section 126.   In  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of cases, there would be time  to  consult\r\n\r\nbecause  there  would be interrogatories  and  discovery.\r\n\r\nBut  section 126 is framed in this way - and new  section\r\n\r\n126(2) is based on the current section 126 which has been\r\n\r\nthere  for many years, and it works very well - to  cater\r\n\r\nto  a  specific situation, rare though it may be, but  it\r\n\r\nmay  happen,  when  an  officer  is  actually  in  court,\r\n\r\ninvolved  in a court case, and he is asked on  the  stand\r\n\r\ncertain  questions  which  may require  him  to  disclose\r\n\r\ninformation which, in his view, may harm public interest.\r\n\r\nThe  section  must  be  wide  enough  to  allow  him  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to say \"no\".  As far as I know, this has  not\r\n\r\nhappened,  but I think in the wisdom of the  drafters  of\r\n\r\nthe original section 126, and the section has worked well\r\n\r\nall these years, it is better to keep it like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, what\r\n\r\nhas  worked  in the past may not represent that  it  will\r\n\r\nwork  in the future.

That is where I am contending.  How\r\n\r\nmuch  flexibility  should we give to the  person  by  his\r\n\r\npersonal  consideration?  I think  we  have  to  be  more\r\n\r\nspecific   in  that  determination.   Would  the   Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  agree with  me  that  this  original\r\n\r\nposition  that was crafted 30 years ago is already  vague\r\n\r\nand  unclear?

We  cannot  just pluck  examples  from  other\r\n\r\ncountries   and   say  they  must  apply  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I have said, the courts actually do  have  a\r\n\r\nrole.  It is not as though they do not play a role.  And,\r\n\r\nindeed,  there  have been cases which show  there  is  an\r\n\r\nestablished test as to how the courts would look  at  the\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just briefly say that, from the cases, the\r\n\r\ncourts  would apply a two-stage test to determine whether\r\n\r\nthe  privilege can be claimed.  First, the court must  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the communication in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion was, in fact, made in official confidence.  And,\r\n\r\nsecond, while it is for the person claiming the privilege\r\n\r\nto  determine whether the public interest would suffer by\r\n\r\nthe  disclosure,  the court must be satisfied  that  such\r\n\r\ndetermination  was,  in fact, made  in  good  faith.

Currently,   our  building   regulations   are\r\n\r\nprescriptive in nature.  They are time-tested  and  well-proven  design  practices  and solutions.   However,  the\r\n\r\nweakness  of such a system is that it does not allow  the\r\n\r\nQualified  Persons (QPs) to propose alternative  building\r\n\r\ndesign solutions.  QPs have also told us that this system\r\n\r\ndoes  not  promote  innovation and may  create  technical\r\n\r\nbarriers to designers who are creative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-based building codes, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nrequire the QPs to comply with objectives and performance\r\n\r\nrequirements   for   the  design  and   construction   of\r\n\r\nbuildings.  It is not mandatory that the QP must follow a\r\n\r\nspecific  design  solution.   Design  QPs  are  free   to\r\n\r\nexercise  greater  flexibility and  creativity  in  their\r\n\r\ndesign   solutions   so  long  as  the   objectives   and\r\n\r\nperformance requirements are met.  In this way,  QPs  can\r\n\r\nbe  more  responsive to market requirements  and  propose\r\n\r\nmore  cost-effective  solutions  which  best  meet  their\r\n\r\nclients' needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-based building codes are not new. They\r\n\r\nhave been adopted in developed countries, like the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  in  1987, New Zealand in 1992 and  Australia  in\r\n\r\n1994.  However, it is a significant change in the concept\r\n\r\nof building control in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has\r\n\r\nconsulted  extensively with the industry in  working  out\r\n\r\nthe  performance-based  regulatory  system.   A  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Regulations (BCR) Committee comprising  industry\r\n\r\nrepresentatives was formed in the year 2000 to study  the\r\n\r\nimplications of this new regime to industry practice, and\r\n\r\nto   review  the  scope  and  contents  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nperformance-based building regulations.  Proposed changes\r\n\r\nwere posted on BCA's website for public feedback and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomments.   BCA  also organised a forum  last  year  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   from   the   Singapore   Institute   of\r\n\r\nArchitects, Institution of Engineers Singapore and  other\r\n\r\nrelevant  professional bodies to clarify queries  in  the\r\n\r\nnew system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me elaborate on the specific amendments\r\n\r\nto  the Building Control Act.  The Bill amends section 49\r\n\r\nto   provide   for   the   objectives   and   performance\r\n\r\nrequirements to be specified in the building regulations.\r\n\r\nIt  also amends section 9 to provide two options for  the\r\n\r\ndesign   QP   to   comply   with  the   performance-based\r\n\r\nregulations.   First,  the  QP  can  continue  to   adopt\r\n\r\nacceptable  solutions  set out  by  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nBuilding Control and be deemed to have complied with  the\r\n\r\nperformance  objectives.   The  QP  can  also  adopt   an\r\n\r\nalternative design solution so long as he certifies  that\r\n\r\nhis  solution  satisfies  the  specified  objectives  and\r\n\r\nperformance requirements.  He can also engage a second QP\r\n\r\nto  jointly certify his design.  This allows a design  QP\r\n\r\nto  collaborate  with a specialist QP on the  alternative\r\n\r\ndesign solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current regulatory framework places\r\n\r\nresponsibility on the QPs for their work.  This continues\r\n\r\nto  be the underlying regulatory philosophy under the new\r\n\r\nsystem.  The amended section 9 requires the design QP  to\r\n\r\ntake all reasonable steps in ensuring that building works\r\n\r\nare designed in accordance with the provisions of the Act\r\n\r\nand  the  building regulations.  Greater  flexibility  in\r\n\r\ndesign   solutions  comes  with  the  responsibility   of\r\n\r\nensuring  that the alternative design is safe  and  meets\r\n\r\nthe  specified performance objective.  If the  design  QP\r\n\r\nproposes  an  alternative  design,  he  should  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to take responsibility for his design.   If  he\r\n\r\nengages  a  second  QP,  that second  QP  must  take  all\r\n\r\nreasonable  steps  to exercise that the  design  complies\r\n\r\nwith the requirements of the Act before certifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Design and Build (D&B) methods of procurement</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I shall now move on to the\r\n\r\namendments to facilitate Design and Build (D&B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the traditional \"design-bid-build\" (DBB)\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  design  QP will complete  the  design  with\r\n\r\nlittle  input  from  the builder.   Once  the  design  is\r\n\r\nfinalised,  it  is  difficult for  the  builder  to  make\r\n\r\nchanges  or  to suggest alternative construction  methods\r\n\r\nwithout major redesign works upstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1999 Construction 21 (C21) Report on Re-inventing Construction, one of its key strategic thrusts\r\n\r\nis  to adopt an integrated approach to construction.   It\r\n\r\nidentified  the Design and Build process as  one  of  the\r\n\r\nprocurement  methods for construction which  can  achieve\r\n\r\ncloser  integration.   In a D&B arrangement,  the  client\r\n\r\nenters into a single contract with one entity.  And  this\r\n\r\nentity  is  responsible  for both the  architectural  and\r\n\r\nengineering   designs   as   well   as   the   subsequent\r\n\r\nconstruction  works.  The inputs of the  various  players\r\n\r\ncan be integrated upfront at the design stage.  Incidents\r\n\r\nof re-works will be minimised.  And the result is savings\r\n\r\nin cost and time for the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&B is being practised in some projects today.\r\n\r\nBuilders   can   approach  architects  and   professional\r\n\r\nengineers  to  work on projects as a team  on  an  ad-hoc\r\n\r\nbasis.  In these projects, the client pays and treats the\r\n\r\nbuilder  and  professionals as different  entities.   The\r\n\r\ndrawback  of such arrangements is that the D&B teams  are\r\n\r\nnot  permanent.  Any synergy and experience will  not  be\r\n\r\naccumulated and built upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also legal impediments to other types of\r\n\r\nD&B  arrangements.  The Architects Act  and  Professional\r\n\r\nEngineers   Act  do  not  allow  any  person   to   offer\r\n\r\narchitectural  and  professional  engineering   services,\r\n\r\nunless   he   is  a  registered  architect,  professional\r\n\r\nengineer  or  licensed  corporation.   An  architect  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  engineer  also cannot  supply  professional\r\n\r\nservices in respect of any project in which he is  acting\r\n\r\nas a builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C21 Report recommended reviewing the relevant\r\n\r\nlegislation  to remove any legal impediments against  D&B\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBCA  therefore  set  up  a committee  in  2000  involving\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   from   the   Singapore   Institute   of\r\n\r\nArchitects, Institution of Engineers Singapore, Singapore\r\n\r\nContractors   Association  Limited  and  other   relevant\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies  to  review  the  legislation.    It\r\n\r\nrecommended  several  amendments  to  be  made   to   the\r\n\r\nArchitects  Act, the Professional Engineers Act  and  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Act.  The Board of Architects  and  the\r\n\r\nProfessional  Engineers Board were also  consulted.   The\r\n\r\nproposed amendments have been incorporated in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, without the amendments in this Bill, D&B can\r\n\r\nstill  carry on the way it has always been done with  the\r\n\r\nbuilders  and professionals working together, but,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, on an ad-hoc basis and as separate entities.   With\r\n\r\nthe  amendments, there are more avenues for D&B  to  take\r\n\r\nplace.   Architects or professional engineers  can  offer\r\n\r\nD&B  without tying up with a builder firm.  Builders  can\r\n\r\noffer   D&B   packages   jointly  with   architects   and\r\n\r\nprofessional engineers.  Licensed corporations can  offer\r\n\r\nD&B services.  The amendments will provide a single point\r\n\r\nof  contact for the client.  The industry will have  more\r\n\r\nchoices  of D&B arrangements to meet its needs.   Let  me\r\n\r\nnow elaborate on the specific amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Facilitate  builders and professionals to  undertake  D&B projects</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new subsection is added to section 10 of both Acts\r\n\r\nto  allow  a  builder  to offer to the  developer  all-in\r\n\r\nservices jointly with architects and engineers as  a  D&B\r\n\r\nteam.  The Regulations of the two professional Acts  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  amended  to allow an architect or  professional\r\n\r\nengineer to supply the professional services in the  same\r\n\r\nproject in which he is acting as a builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Facilitate licensed corporation to undertake D&B projects</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations licensed by the Board of Architects and\r\n\r\nProfessional Engineers Board are currently not allowed to\r\n\r\nprovide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesign  services and be the builder for the same project,\r\n\r\nunless   specifically  requested  by  the  client.    The\r\n\r\nRegulations of the two professional Acts will be  amended\r\n\r\nto allow licensed corporations to provide D&B services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage builders to form licensed corporations\r\n\r\nto  offer  a  full  range  of  services  from  design  to\r\n\r\nconstruction, the Bill proposes to relax the requirements\r\n\r\non  the  chairman  and directorship control  of  licensed\r\n\r\nlimited  corporations  in  the  two  professional   Acts.\r\n\r\nDirectorship  control  by  registered  professionals   in\r\n\r\nlicensed  limited corporations will be lowered from  two-thirds  to a simply majority.  The need for the  chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  licensed limited corporation to be a  registered\r\n\r\nprofessional is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Corresponding changes in Building Control Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding amendments are made to the Building\r\n\r\nControl  Act to facilitate the D&B arrangement.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, sufficient safeguards are maintained to ensure\r\n\r\nbuilding safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends section 6 of the Building Control\r\n\r\nAct  to allow the builder in a D&B project to appoint the\r\n\r\ndesign  QP and supervising QP for the project.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  supervising QP for a project that is required to  be\r\n\r\nchecked  by  an  accredited  checker  (AC)  has   to   be\r\n\r\nindependent  of  the builder.  Hence, the supervising  QP\r\n\r\ncannot  be a partner, officer or employee of the  builder\r\n\r\nor  any  of  the  builder's  associates.   Projects  that\r\n\r\nrequire  checks  by ACs are usually the bigger  and  more\r\n\r\ncomplex projects.  The independence of the supervising QP\r\n\r\nis  necessary in such projects to minimise situations  of\r\n\r\nconflict  of  interest.  This will also ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  works  can  be  constructed  with  proper   and\r\n\r\nimpartial supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my Ministry is also proposing other\r\n\r\namendments  to  streamline and improve the regulation  of\r\n\r\nbuildings and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe architectural and professional engineering services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Streamlining building work process</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, after obtaining approvals for building\r\n\r\nplans,  owners  are  also required to obtain  permits  to\r\n\r\ncommence works from the Commissioner of Building  Control\r\n\r\nbefore they can start construction.  This is to allow the\r\n\r\nCommissioner to revoke the permit and stop works,  should\r\n\r\nthe  construction  works pose danger  to  the  public  or\r\n\r\nneighbouring properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as non-structural building works usually do\r\n\r\nnot  have safety issues, clause 5 amends section  7  such\r\n\r\nthat  only  structural  works are required  to  obtain  a\r\n\r\npermit  to commence work.  This will allow non-structural\r\n\r\nbuilding works to commence immediately after approval  of\r\n\r\nplans.   As a safeguard, a new section 7A is inserted  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Commissioner  to  stop  any  non-structural\r\n\r\nbuilding  works,  if  they pose a  danger  to  public  or\r\n\r\nneighbouring properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, amendments are made to section 49 to\r\n\r\nallow  the Commissioner to require additional information\r\n\r\nand  documents to be submitted during the application  of\r\n\r\nTemporary  Occupation Permit and Certificate of Statutory\r\n\r\nCompletion.   This will enable better evaluation  of  the\r\n\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recovery of cost of engaging an expert</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, there had been cases in the past where\r\n\r\nbuilding  works were constructed in such  a  manner  that\r\n\r\nrendered   the  works  unsafe  or  likely  to   lead   to\r\n\r\ninstability.   In  such incidents,  BCA  had  to  put  in\r\n\r\nadditional  manpower and resources to monitor the  safety\r\n\r\nof the affected building or building works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation into the causes of the building's\r\n\r\ninstability  is  highly technical  and  complex.   It  is\r\n\r\nprudent  for  the Commissioner to engage  an  independent\r\n\r\nspecialist  consultant to give him an independent  second\r\n\r\nopinion.  However, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissioner  had to bear such costs in the  past,  which\r\n\r\nfar  exceeded the plan fees collected.  The problem could\r\n\r\nbe due to either design or construction inadequacies.  As\r\n\r\nsuch, instead of paying such costs with public funds, the\r\n\r\nowner  or developer of the project should bear the  costs\r\n\r\nof  engaging  the specialist consultant.   To  this  end,\r\n\r\nsection 23 has been amended to enable the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control  to  recover  the  costs  incurred   in\r\n\r\nengaging  the expert from the developer or owner  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review  of  penalties  for  offence  under  the  Building Control Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my Ministry has also reviewed the penalty\r\n\r\nprovisions for the different types of offences under  the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Act.  I shall now explain these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the collapse of the roof of\r\n\r\nCompassvale  School in 2001, which was  attributed  to  a\r\n\r\nstructural  design flaw, section 9(5A) was introduced  to\r\n\r\nrequire the QP responsible for structural design to  take\r\n\r\nreasonable steps and exercise due diligence in  complying\r\n\r\nwith  the Act and the building regulations.  The  maximum\r\n\r\npenalty  for a design QP for structural works for failing\r\n\r\nin  this duty is a fine of $100,000 and/or a jail term of\r\n\r\nnot more than 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a QP fails in his professional duties,\r\n\r\nit   should  not  matter  whether  he  is  dealing   with\r\n\r\nstructural design or non-structural design.  He should be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the same penalty provision  for  the  same\r\n\r\noffence  of not exercising due diligence in carrying  out\r\n\r\nhis professional duties.  Lapses in non-structural design\r\n\r\ncould also result in serious consequences.  Section 9(5A)\r\n\r\nis, thus, amended to extend the same duty and penalty  to\r\n\r\nthe QP for non-structural designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A builder's responsibility to carry out building\r\n\r\nworks in accordance with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproved design and under the supervision of a QP  is  as\r\n\r\nimportant  as the design QP's responsibility in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthe  safety  of his design.  If the design is robust  but\r\n\r\nbuilding  works  are not carried out  according  to  this\r\n\r\ndesign, then the result could be an unsafe building.  The\r\n\r\namendments  in  sections 8(2), 9(5A) and  11(5)  set  the\r\n\r\nmaximum penalty for a builder who fails to discharge  his\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to be on par with that of a  design  QP,\r\n\r\nie, $100,000 fine and/or 12 months' jail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervising QP and Accredited Checker (AC)\r\n\r\nperform  similar check-and-balance roles  in  supervising\r\n\r\nthe  builder's  work  and checking  the  QP's  structural\r\n\r\ndesign,  respectively.  The Bill, therefore, proposes  to\r\n\r\nset  the  maximum  penalty for  the  supervising  QP  for\r\n\r\nfailure  in  carrying out his role at the same  level  as\r\n\r\nthat  of the Accredited Checker, ie, $50,000 fine  and/or\r\n\r\n12  months'  jail.  The relevant amendment  is  found  in\r\n\r\nsection 9(4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend section 5 to increase the\r\n\r\nmaximum   penalty  for  any  person  who   commences   or\r\n\r\nauthorises the commencement of any building works without\r\n\r\napproval  or  permit.  The increase is from  the  current\r\n\r\n$50,000  fine  and/or 12 months' jail  to  $100,000  fine\r\n\r\nand/or  12  months' jail.  The upward revision underlines\r\n\r\nthe severity of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the changes which I have mentioned are the\r\n\r\nmaximum penalties for the various parties involved in the\r\n\r\nconstruction process.  It is for the courts to  mete  out\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate  penalty,  based  on  the  severity  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction of continuing professional development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the Architects Act and\r\n\r\nProfessional  Engineers  Act  to  require  a   registered\r\n\r\narchitect   or  professional  engineer  to  comply   with\r\n\r\nprescribed    requirements   relating    to    continuing\r\n\r\nprofessional development as part of the criteria to renew\r\n\r\nhis  practising certificate.  This is to ensure that  the\r\n\r\narchitects and professional engineers continue to stay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabreast  of developments in their respective fields.   It\r\n\r\nemphasises  the  importance of training and  professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment   to   maintain   the   high   standards   of\r\n\r\narchitectural and professional engineering  practices  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Streamlining of requirement for licensed corporations and partnerships</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill proposes to remove the requirement\r\n\r\nfor  the  director  overseeing the professional  services\r\n\r\noffered  by  a licensed corporation or partnership  under\r\n\r\nthe Architects Act and the Professional Engineers Act, to\r\n\r\nbe  resident  in Singapore.   This is in  view  that  the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Act is already holding the appointed QPs\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   the  certification   of   plans   and\r\n\r\nsupervision of building works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this Bill proposes changes that will\r\n\r\nenable the construction industry to be more efficient and\r\n\r\nintegrated.   D&B  arrangements will be  facilitated  and\r\n\r\nbuilding  processes streamlined.  It will also allow  for\r\n\r\ngreater  design  flexibility and innovation.   Continuous\r\n\r\nlearning   amongst   our  architects   and   professional\r\n\r\nengineers is encouraged through implementing performance-based    regulations    and    continuing    professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I rise in support of the Bill.  Let me highlight\r\n\r\nthree  key  areas of the Bill, which I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Performance-based regulatory system</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries have implemented performance-based\r\n\r\nbuilding regulations but found that most designers  still\r\n\r\nfollow   the  prescriptive  solutions.   In  fact,   many\r\n\r\ndesigners  have  developed a strong  dependence  on  test\r\n\r\nmethods  that  do  not  clearly  demonstrate  real  world\r\n\r\nperformance.    This   situation  occurs   because   many\r\n\r\ndesigners are not familiar with performance-based\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulatory  system.  Some do not have  the  expertise  to\r\n\r\nimplement the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the initiative to move towards a\r\n\r\nperformance-based regulatory system in Singapore.  But  I\r\n\r\nwish  to seek clarifications from the Minister concerning\r\n\r\nthe  desired outcomes of such a proposal, and what is the\r\n\r\nstate  of  readiness  of  our  construction  industry  to\r\n\r\nimplement the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, a performance-based regulatory system\r\n\r\nshould achieve three desired outcomes, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) It should provide more flexibility in design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand construction solutions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) It should encourage more innovation in the\r\n\r\nindustry; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) It should reduce the total life cycle costs of\r\n\r\na building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must clearly define these desired outcomes\r\n\r\nand   quantify  them  to  monitor  the  success  of   the\r\n\r\nperformance-based  system.   With  the  performance-based\r\n\r\napproach,  designers  and builders  will  now  have  more\r\n\r\nflexibility to propose more innovative solutions to their\r\n\r\nclients.   This  will encourage the use of more  building\r\n\r\nmaterials and systems, thus facilitating more trades.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may be good to give a boost to the\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  must  make sure that the industry  has  the\r\n\r\nnecessary expertise to evaluate the performance of  these\r\n\r\nbuilding  materials  and  systems.   In  Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nbuilding  booms  in the 80s and 90s had  resulted  in  an\r\n\r\ninflux  of a wide range of building materials and systems\r\n\r\nin our built environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, town councils, management corporations and\r\n\r\nbuilding  owners  are  faced with a host  of  maintenance\r\n\r\nproblems,   such  as  high  maintenance,  operation   and\r\n\r\nreplacement  costs  of all these materials  and  systems.\r\n\r\nWhile  some  of these innovative solutions  have  worked,\r\n\r\nothers have failed, due to various reasons, such as  poor\r\n\r\ndesign, poor selection of materials, poor workmanship  or\r\n\r\nwrong usage.  For example, town\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncouncils  have  to  maintain so many different  types  of\r\n\r\nlighting   systems  in  our  estates  due  to  innovative\r\n\r\ndesigns.     This   has   increased   maintenance    cost\r\n\r\ndrastically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am indeed concerned about the repercussions\r\n\r\nof   a   performance-based  system  in   our   \"immature\"\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.   I  would  like  to  seek   some\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Minister on the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How will the performance-based system change\r\n\r\nthe industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What are the key benefits of the system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How will it affect the laws?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) How will it impact upon our building standards,\r\n\r\nie, Singapore Standards, and Codes of Practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) What are the liabilities and risk transfers\r\n\r\nbetween the authorities and building practitioners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Are the authorities and practitioners equipped\r\n\r\nwith the expertise to implement the system?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to adopt a holistic approach to\r\n\r\nensure  that the performance-based regulatory  system  is\r\n\r\ncomplemented by expertise, accountability and responsible\r\n\r\nallocation  of  risks.  We must clearly set  quantitative\r\n\r\nperformance  measures  to facilitate  the  fulfilment  of\r\n\r\ncontractual  obligations.  Experience in New Zealand  has\r\n\r\nshown  that one of the key reasons that led to  the  slow\r\n\r\nembracement of performance culture is that the  benchmark\r\n\r\nof  skills  is  too  low.  Thus, we  need  to  conduct  a\r\n\r\nthorough  evaluation to ensure that we have the expertise\r\n\r\nto support a performance-based system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Design and Build procurement arrangements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the amendments to facilitate the\r\n\r\nDesign   and  Build  procurement  arrangements   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  This arrangement will facilitate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteamwork among the designers and builders in the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the perennial problems faced by the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry is the separation of the design and\r\n\r\nconstruction processes, which are undertaken by different\r\n\r\nparties,  namely, the designers and builders.   This  has\r\n\r\nled  to the development of an \"adversarial culture\" among\r\n\r\nthe  design  and building teams, which often  results  in\r\n\r\nmuch  unproductive and abortive work.  To  aggravate  the\r\n\r\nsituation, standard contract forms for building  projects\r\n\r\nare  usually  not  drafted with fair  contract  terms  to\r\n\r\nallocate the risks and responsibilities among contractual\r\n\r\nparties.   Under such an operating environment,  building\r\n\r\nprojects   usually  encounter  lots  of  problems,   thus\r\n\r\naffecting productivity and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to address this undesirable state of\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry and make changes to facilitate\r\n\r\na  \"teamwork\" approach in carrying out building projects.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Design and Build procurement arrangements\r\n\r\nis  one  way  in  which  we can \"house\"  the  design  and\r\n\r\nconstruction teams under one roof.  It provides a  single\r\n\r\npoint  responsibility,  and  facilitates  teamwork  among\r\n\r\ndesigners and builders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful completion of a building project\r\n\r\ndepends on many parties, namely, the architect, engineer,\r\n\r\nquantity  surveyor and the builder.  Therefore,  we  must\r\n\r\nadopt   an   integrated  approach  to   encourage   joint\r\n\r\nresponsibility among the parties involved in the project.\r\n\r\nInstead  of appointing a qualified person who  is  either\r\n\r\nthe architect or engineer, we should appoint qualified or\r\n\r\nlicensed  corporations which have a team  of  architects,\r\n\r\nengineers,  quantity  surveyors and builders  to  provide\r\n\r\ndesign and construction services.  Thus, I would urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take the lead in promoting Design and Build\r\n\r\nconstruction in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers of Commissioner of Building Control</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof Building Control can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecover the cost of engaging an expert to investigate and\r\n\r\nadvise on rectification works from the developer or owner\r\n\r\nif  the  Commissioner is of the opinion that the on-going\r\n\r\nconstruction  works  are,  or  are  likely  to  lead   to\r\n\r\ninstability or collapse of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, section 23 of the Building Control Act\r\n\r\nclearly  states that the Commissioner of Building Control\r\n\r\nmay  make an order to require building owners to take the\r\n\r\nnecessary measures for dangerous buildings, and  penalise\r\n\r\nthe owner accordingly for non-compliance.  As such, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why the Commissioner needs additional power  to\r\n\r\nengage an expert for investigations and tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the liabilities of the Commissioner, if the\r\n\r\nexpert  whom he commissions makes omissions  or  acts  of\r\n\r\nnegligence in the investigations or tests?  Can the owner\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  findings of the  expert  engaged  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner?  Are the findings final?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I do not think it is the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  to investigate and conduct  tests  for\r\n\r\ndangerous buildings. This should be the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe  developers  or  owners.  I hope the  Minister  could\r\n\r\nclarify  on  the need for the Commissioner to  have  such\r\n\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Madam, I would like a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the Minister.  Not  that  long  ago,\r\n\r\nsomebody complained in the local newspapers that  he  had\r\n\r\nto  pay  about  $2,600  for  his  building  plans  to  be\r\n\r\napproved.  My question is: why should such an application\r\n\r\nbe  so costly?  I also understand that if the applicant's\r\n\r\nplans  are  rejected, all his application fees  shall  be\r\n\r\nforfeited.  Why should this be so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first of all,\r\n\r\nlet  me  address the points which Dr Teo Ho Pin made.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to thank him, first of all, for supporting the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made three very pertinent points. I would\r\n\r\naddress them in turn. First of all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  performance-based regulatory system.  As Dr  Teo\r\n\r\nsaid,  and  I agree with him, even though many  countries\r\n\r\nhave implemented these performance-based regulations,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  mean  that  they  will automatically  follow  these\r\n\r\nregulations.   In fact, I understand most  designers  and\r\n\r\ndesign  qualified  persons still follow the  prescriptive\r\n\r\nsystem.  It is quite understandable because it is a safer\r\n\r\nroute  as  it is well-established.  Why should  they  try\r\n\r\nsomething  different?  But this is precisely  the  point.\r\n\r\nEven  though it is a safer route, the prescriptive system\r\n\r\ndoes impose certain restrictions.  This is why we want to\r\n\r\ntry   to   implement  the  performance-based  system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore to encourage innovation and flexibility.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not saying that with this implementation of\r\n\r\nthe performance-based system in Singapore, we want design\r\n\r\nqualified  persons  to  move away from  the  prescriptive\r\n\r\nsolution.   What we are saying is that you can  do  both.\r\n\r\nYou  can either stick to the prescriptive solution if you\r\n\r\nwish  to, or now you are given this flexibility  to  look\r\n\r\nfor  more innovative solutions, something which hopefully\r\n\r\ncan  cut costs and give more flexibility. That is  why  I\r\n\r\nagree with Dr Teo that the three desired outcomes of more\r\n\r\nflexibility, more innovation and cost reduction  must  be\r\n\r\nborne in mind when we implement this system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also concur with Dr Teo's point that the system\r\n\r\nmust  be  complemented  by expertise  accountability  and\r\n\r\nresponsible allocation of risks.  I think the  amendments\r\n\r\nthat  we  are going to make in this Bill have  adequately\r\n\r\ntaken   these   into  consideration.   The   duties   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  the  design  QPs   are   adequately\r\n\r\ndefined.   The  engagement of  a  second  QP  to  certify\r\n\r\nalternative solutions is meant to address this  issue  of\r\n\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of transfer of risks and\r\n\r\nliabilities  between  the authorities  and  the  building\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  I  wish to assure him that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  risk.  Currently, the  design  QP  has  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  duty to comply with the prescriptive solutions\r\n\r\nunder  our  current  building  regulations.   Under   the\r\n\r\nperformance-based  system,  his  statutory   duties   are\r\n\r\nunchanged. They remain the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Dr Teo has rightly pointed out, this is\r\n\r\nsomething new for the local industry.  I expect that  the\r\n\r\nlocal industry and the local professionals will take time\r\n\r\nto  get  used  to  the idea, and also  to  build  up  the\r\n\r\nexpertise, experience and the confidence to try out  this\r\n\r\nnew  system.   What  BCA can do will be  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nsystem  by organising seminars, answering queries through\r\n\r\nworkshops, explaining the implementation details  to  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  Hopefully, if we can allow  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to  take this performance-based  approach,\r\n\r\nand   in  the  process,  come  up  with  more  innovative\r\n\r\nsolutions which will give them more flexibility  and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  reduce costs for  them  and  for  their\r\n\r\nclients, then it will have been worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On design and build, Dr Teo has reiterated the point\r\n\r\nthat  this is a good approach, ie, the teamwork approach,\r\n\r\nthat  all  professionals involved must work  together  in\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve the desired outcome and for Government\r\n\r\nto  take  the  lead. Certainly, he would know  that  many\r\n\r\npublic  sector agencies have actually taken  this  design\r\n\r\nand  build approach - the HDB, the old PWD, MINDEF.   The\r\n\r\ndesign  and build approach has produced results.  It  has\r\n\r\nshown  itself to be a good way of doing things.  What  we\r\n\r\nare doing now is to facilitate this and to make sure that\r\n\r\nwe  remove any impediments in the Acts which currently do\r\n\r\nnot allow design and build arrangements to be carried out\r\n\r\nin  the private sector.  I would like to thank Dr Teo for\r\n\r\nhis   support  for  this  amendment  to  facilitate  this\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point he made was about the powers of the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Building Control.  He asked why there  is\r\n\r\na  need  to  engage an expert for investigation  and  for\r\n\r\ntesting  major buildings.  As I mentioned in  my  speech,\r\n\r\nthis is mainly for investigation and testing on major and\r\n\r\ncomplex  structures  and  buildings  which  show  serious\r\n\r\ndesign  or structural faults or distress, which may  lead\r\n\r\nto    catastrophic   consequences.    It   is   in   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances that we reckon that the investigations  can\r\n\r\nbe highly complex and technical in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why we are providing for the Commissioner to have\r\n\r\nthe  ability  to engage another expert to seek  a  second\r\n\r\nopinion.   Not  only that, it is to make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\ncosts so incurred do not land with the public sector, but\r\n\r\nwith  those who are responsible for such an investigation\r\n\r\nto  be  conducted  in the first place.  What  the  expert\r\n\r\nwould do is to be an adviser to the Commissioner. He will\r\n\r\nassess  the  situation.  He will  investigate.   He  will\r\n\r\ncheck  on  the  adequacy of the works, both  the  current\r\n\r\nworks and also the proposed rectification works and  will\r\n\r\ngive  an  expert advice to the Commissioner.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  owner or the developer can also similarly engage  an\r\n\r\nexpert but, ultimately, what the Commissioner would  have\r\n\r\nto  approve  are  the qualified person's recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is an important provision because, as I have said, the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  such distress or  shortcomings  may  be\r\n\r\ncatastrophic.   It is erring on the side  of  caution  to\r\n\r\nseek  this  second opinion.  I hope I have  answered  the\r\n\r\nquestions raised by Dr Teo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked two questions which are unrelated to\r\n\r\nthe  Act  in question but, nevertheless, I would try  and\r\n\r\nexplain.  There is a fee that is levied on the submission\r\n\r\nof  building plans.  Mr Chiam mentioned $2,600.  I am not\r\n\r\nexactly  sure  whether this is a flat  fee.  I  think  it\r\n\r\nvaries,  depending on the complexity of the plans.   This\r\n\r\nfee is to compensate the authority, ie, the public sector\r\n\r\nagency,  for the costs incurred in processing the  plans.\r\n\r\nAs  he  may  know,  a building plan is a  highly  complex\r\n\r\ndocument.   In  fact,  it can be  quite  voluminous.   It\r\n\r\ninvolves many different agencies, from roads to drainage,\r\n\r\nto  fire  safety, to structural safety, conformance  with\r\n\r\nenvironmental requirements and so on, and so  forth.   It\r\n\r\ninvolves many different agencies, although we have  tried\r\n\r\nto streamline the process by having a one-stop submission\r\n\r\nfacility.   Nevertheless, even though it  is  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nsubmission, many different experts and professionals  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in processing the plan.  So, the costs that  are\r\n\r\nincurred are not insubstantial.  In fact, if you  add  up\r\n\r\nall  the manpower costs involved, you will find that  the\r\n\r\nfee barely covers the costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the fee still levied, even if the plans are\r\n\r\nrejected?  It is because the work has already been  done.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  plan  is processed and it does  not  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements, ie, it is rejected, it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nyou  return  the plan.  If that were the case,  everybody\r\n\r\njust  submits any plan and just hopes for the plan to  be\r\n\r\nrejected,  or, worse still, for the agency to  point  out\r\n\r\nwhere the shortcomings are in the plan, tell them, return\r\n\r\nthe  plan  with the notes as to how to rectify  them  and\r\n\r\nthen  after that, get its feedback as well.  I think that\r\n\r\nis really asking a bit too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you seeking a new\r\n\r\nclarification on the last point because that is  not  the\r\n\r\nsubstance of the Bill?

The  Commission  noted\r\n\r\nthat the Management Executive (MX) Scheme was implemented\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service on 1st January 2002  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of new technologies and innovations  emerging\r\n\r\nevery  day and rising public expectations.  The MX Scheme\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  to carve out a meaningful and  rewarding\r\n\r\ncareer  in  the  civil service, as an officer  can  enjoy\r\n\r\nperformance-based pay, clear and timely progress and self-directed career development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Senior Officer Scheme, the salary\r\n\r\nscale  comprises an annual fixed increment together  with\r\n\r\nthe  basic  salary, the monthly variable component  (MVC)\r\n\r\nand  the  non-pensionable component (NPC)  and  does  not\r\n\r\ninclude the non-pensionable variable payment (NPVP)  (NWC\r\n\r\nwage  adjustments) and non-pensionable  variable  payment\r\n\r\n(salary  revision).   Whereas under  the  new  Management\r\n\r\nExecutive Scheme (MXS), the salary range, which  is based\r\n\r\non  performance, includes all the above components,  thus\r\n\r\nshowing  the  gross  salary that an officer  draws.   The\r\n\r\nconversion to the new Scheme would not give rise  to  any\r\n\r\nincrease in salary of the five incumbents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also following the other schemes in the civil\r\n\r\nservice by dropping the reference to \"superscale\" grades.\r\n\r\nAll  the  staff  under the new scheme will  be  known  as\r\n\r\nParliamentary Officers.  They will be eligible for annual\r\n\r\nmerit   increments  if  their  performance  exceeds   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of their grade.  Any Parliamentary  Officer\r\n\r\ncan go up to the apex of the scheme, ie, Grade 7, but  he\r\n\r\nwill  not automatically be the Clerk of Parliament unless\r\n\r\nhe is so appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, having considered the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nScheme  (2003),  has  advised that  this  new  scheme  be\r\n\r\napplied to officers in the Parliamentary Service,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is at present pegged to the Senior Officer Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the Commission is contained in\r\n\r\nparagraph 10 of the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is asked to accept the recommendation of\r\n\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the\r\n\r\nCommission  on  Parliament Staff as  contained  in  Paper\r\n\r\nMisc.  5  of  2003,  accepts the  recommendation  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  as  contained  in paragraph  10  thereof  and\r\n\r\nresolves in accordance with such recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fourteen Minutes to Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
