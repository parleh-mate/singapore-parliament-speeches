I\r\n\r\nexpect  that  the  hon. Member and  the  House  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  would  like  to have  more  than  a  bare\r\n\r\nnegative on this matter. I will therefore go  into\r\n\r\nsome detail so that the hon. Member can understand\r\n\r\nthe  scientific  complexities of the  problem  of\r\n\r\nflood prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply to a similar question last July, I\r\n\r\nindicated  that  there  were  two  factors  which\r\n\r\nprevent   rapid   and  immediate  action   against\r\n\r\nflooding.  First,  it  is necessary  to  undertake\r\n\r\nlengthy hydrological and topographical surveys\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  ascertain  the  exact  causes  and  nature  of\r\n\r\nflooding  in each area where it occurs. Since  all\r\n\r\nsubsequent flood prevention measures must be based\r\n\r\non these preliminary surveys, it is necessary that\r\n\r\nthe  survey should be completely accurate in order\r\n\r\nthat  mistakes  can be avoided  and  public  money\r\n\r\nshould not be wasted. There is thus a considerable\r\n\r\ntime  factor involved between the occurrence of  a\r\n\r\nflood  and  the taking of measures to prevent  its\r\n\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a cost factor which is very\r\n\r\nserious. Preliminary investigations indicate  that\r\n\r\nfor  the  city area alone, flood prevention  works\r\n\r\nmight cost as much as $60 million. Expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthat  nature  must  obviously be balanced  against\r\n\r\nother necessary public expenditure, and if it were\r\n\r\nto  be  undertaken,  it  would  deserve  the  most\r\n\r\nserious  and careful study by all Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may better understand the nature\r\n\r\nof   the  problem  if  I  tell  him  that  it   is\r\n\r\nessentially  one  of scientific  control  of  vast\r\n\r\nnatural  forces.  In  this  particular  island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is complicated by the fact that  the\r\n\r\nnatural  forces were not sufficiently  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount in the earlier development of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to assure the hon. Member that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is acutely aware of the suffering  and\r\n\r\nthe waste which result from recurrent flooding. I\r\n\r\npersonally  had experience of this in past  years;\r\n\r\nit is a problem that frequently recurs to my mind.\r\n\r\nAny attempt, however, to deal with the problem of\r\n\r\nflooding  on  a vote-catching basis  of  temporary\r\n\r\nmeasures, stop-gap measures, would do little  good\r\n\r\nand  almost certainly involve a considerable waste\r\n\r\nof public money. We must proceed scientifically in\r\n\r\nthis matter if we are to get any useful result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the hon. Member's question is\r\n\r\npartly  answered  already, but I  will  give  some\r\n\r\nfurther    details.   He   mentions   the    Bedok\r\n\r\nResettlement area. I shall make a statement  later\r\n\r\nin  connection with a Report that has been tabled.\r\n\r\nIt  is  enough to say now that the bund  has  been\r\n\r\nstrengthened  and  the drainage channel  has  been\r\n\r\nstraightened and deepened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also mention that the City Council has\r\n\r\nundertaken  a  number  of minor  flood  prevention\r\n\r\nworks  at the Stamford/Orchard Canal, Bukit Timah/\r\n\r\nRochore  Canal,  Sungei Whampoa,  Sungei  Kallang,\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai and Geylang River, and in  the  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan area. At Kampong Tai Seng to which the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  refers, the flood problem arises from  the\r\n\r\nlow-lying nature of the land, and the problem  may\r\n\r\nhave been increased to some extent by agricultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The Chief Drainage Engineer  will  be\r\n\r\nrecommending measures for Kampong Tai Seng as soon\r\n\r\nas his investigations have been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will see, therefore, that though\r\n\r\nit  is  scientifically impossible to give him  the\r\n\r\nassurance he asks for, hard work has been done  to\r\n\r\nassess  the  need  and to recommend  measures  for\r\n\r\nflood  control. I may add a final word of comfort.\r\n\r\nMeteorologically  speaking,  the  probability   of\r\n\r\nflooding  on  last year's scale is  rather  small.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the daily rainfall at Kallang on\r\n\r\nthe  9th  and 10th December, 1954, has  only  been\r\n\r\nexceeded  once in the last 72 years; and similarly\r\n\r\nthe   total  monthly  rainfall  at  Kallang   last\r\n\r\nDecember was the highest for 86 years. We can hope\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall  not  have  two  record  years  of\r\n\r\nflooding in immediate succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications and  Works  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance that requests for deepening of  channels\r\n\r\nbe  taken in hand as soon as possible, in view  of\r\n\r\npossible flooding due to the monsoon that is about\r\n\r\nto break in a month's time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I have already dealt with this, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in my answer to the first question.\r\n\r\nWhatever  can be done will be done. It is  no  use\r\n\r\ngoing   ahead  until  you  are  able  to  have   a\r\n\r\nscientific  assessment of  the  problem.  You  can\r\n\r\ntransfer  the  water  from  one  area  to  another\r\n\r\nwithout getting it off the land and into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE TRACTION COMPANY STRIKE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare whether he will give a detailed\r\n\r\nreport on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  present  strike  of  the  Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany employees; and state what steps have  been\r\n\r\ntaken by the Government to settle this dispute and\r\n\r\nrelieve the public from this inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July this\r\n\r\nyear  the  Singapore  Traction  Company  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  submitted demands relating to  increase  in\r\n\r\nwages  and improved conditions of service for  all\r\n\r\nemployees  in the Company. The management  replied\r\n\r\nthat  they were unable to entertain these  demands\r\n\r\nfrom  the Union, as they were in violation  of  an\r\n\r\nagreement  signed between the management  and  the\r\n\r\nUnion in February 1954. This agreement was binding\r\n\r\non  both  parties and precluded either party  from\r\n\r\nsubmitting or entertaining fresh demands  relating\r\n\r\nto terms and conditions of employment for a period\r\n\r\nof two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th September a 14-day strike notice was\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the Union to the management.  During\r\n\r\nthis  period the Labour Department contacted both\r\n\r\nparties,  who agreed to a joint meeting.  At  this\r\n\r\nmeeting the management stated that they would  be\r\n\r\nprepared within a week to begin negotiations on  a\r\n\r\nnew  agreement  to be effective from  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1956. The Union, however, stated that negotiations\r\n\r\nshould  commence immediately and that any  revised\r\n\r\nwage rates should become effective from 14th July,\r\n\r\n1955, the date on which the original demands  were\r\n\r\nsubmitted.  The management offered  to  refer  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the validity of the agreement  to  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General. This was rejected by the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26th September the 14-day strike notice\r\n\r\nexpired  and  resulted in a complete  stoppage  of\r\n\r\nbuses run by the Singapore Traction Company. Since\r\n\r\nthat  date Government has maintained contact with\r\n\r\nboth  parties with a view to seeking  a  means  of\r\n\r\nresuming negotiations on an effective basis so  as\r\n\r\nto bring the dispute to an early settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the arrival of the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company, Sir Thomas Strangman,\r\n\r\nthe  parties  met again yesterday  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Union  urged  that  the  management  should\r\n\r\nreconsider their stand on the previous  agreement\r\n\r\nin view of the recent wage increases in other bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The  Union also  contended  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company's wage policy  tended\r\n\r\nto  encourage  corruption among  conductors.  The\r\n\r\nmanagement, however, were not prepared to  modify\r\n\r\ntheir  stand  on  the sanctity of  the  agreement\r\n\r\npreviously entered into by the Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nUnion  and  endorsed  by  a  general  meeting  of\r\n\r\nmembers.

I  think the House may be glad  to  hear\r\n\r\nwhat  action  is being taken. The recommendations\r\n\r\nof  this Report have been accepted by Government,\r\n\r\nand we are getting on with the necessary work  as\r\n\r\nfast as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will observe, from the last paragraph in\r\n\r\nthe  Report, that the first work to be undertaken\r\n\r\nis  the construction of the dam and spillways for\r\n\r\nthe  impounding reservoir. Action to acquire  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  land  for  this  project  is  now   in\r\n\r\nprogress, and work on the reservoir will start as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  we are entitled to enter on  the  land.\r\n\r\nThereafter  the construction of the dam  and  the\r\n\r\nerection of the spillways should be completed  in\r\n\r\nabout two months, if the weather is not too  bad.\r\n\r\nThis  means that if we can get possession of  the\r\n\r\nland  before the end of this month, a very  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  of protection to the Bedok and  Ketapang\r\n\r\nareas  may have been afforded by the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.  We can only hope and pray that there  will\r\n\r\nbe no abnormally heavy rains before that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the bund below the\r\n\r\nChangi   Road   has  already  been   raised   and\r\n\r\nstrengthened, and the main drainage  channel  has\r\n\r\nbeen  straightened and deepened.  These  measures\r\n\r\nshould  give  some  degree of protection  against\r\n\r\nflooding.  The  real  protection  will  only   be\r\n\r\nassured   when  the  flood  reservoir  has   been\r\n\r\ncompleted. It is unfortunate that large works  of\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnature  cannot be planned and executed in  a  few\r\n\r\nweeks  or  a few months.

This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly the case when there are complicating\r\n\r\nfactors  like the coral reef out at sea  off  the\r\n\r\nBedok  River  outlet which necessitates  special\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed that the Report\r\n\r\nenvisages   that  the  area  of  the   impounding\r\n\r\nreservoir should be used as an open space  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  when it is not holding  floodwaters.\r\n\r\nThe  City  Council  has now  suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nreservoir should be used as a reservoir the whole\r\n\r\nyear  round.  The  City  Council  Water  Engineer\r\n\r\nbelieves  that it should be possible  to  get  an\r\n\r\naverage of almost two million gallons of water  a\r\n\r\nday  from  the water impounded in the  reservoir.\r\n\r\nThis will be a very useful addition to the water\r\n\r\nwhich  the City Council expects to get  from  the\r\n\r\nwells  which are being sunk in the Bedok plain,\r\n\r\nand  this  additional water supply  is  an  added\r\n\r\njustification for spending a considerable sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney on the drainage scheme and on the necessary\r\n\r\nland acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOSPITALS BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Hospitals Board Ordinance (Chapter 187 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Health (Mr  A.

If we are to overcome\r\n\r\nracial consciousness and racial antagonisms,  and\r\n\r\nif  we  are to build up a nation, it seems to  me\r\n\r\nthat there should be no reference to race on  our\r\n\r\nnational  registration  card.

But for us, who are conscious that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  change, I think  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nwithout  value to weigh the significance of  that\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity card was a product of the war,\r\n\r\nimported  from Britain into Singapore at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the Government felt that it was in a  state\r\n\r\nof  war.

But\r\n\r\nnow  it  is  proposed to make it a  part  of  our\r\n\r\nnormal  lives.  There is not even a  pretence  of\r\n\r\nmaking  it last for only a matter of three years.\r\n\r\nIt  is an attempt, without too much publicity, to\r\n\r\nmake  the  identity card part and parcel  of  our\r\n\r\nlives. I am not going into the merits of having a\r\n\r\nnational  registration  system  by  which  social\r\n\r\nsecurity can be equitably apportioned and all the\r\n\r\nother   useful  by-products  of  having  national\r\n\r\nregistration.  I  do  not wish  to  debate  these\r\n\r\npoints.  But  I wish to point out,  as  one  who,\r\n\r\nperhaps  unrealistically, believes in  a  liberal\r\n\r\nway  of life, that it is a marked departure  from\r\n\r\nthe  normal  traditions of  a  liberal  civilised\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

May I tell the\r\n\r\nChief Minister, Mr Speaker, Sir, that one of the\r\n\r\nfirst  things they were pleased to do in England,\r\n\r\nsome  years  after the war - because they  had  got\r\n\r\ntied up with the identity card system by tying it\r\n\r\nup  with  rationing and all the  other  necessary\r\n\r\nregulations in a Socialist state - was  to  abolish\r\n\r\nthe  identity card system? A state of affairs was\r\n\r\nreached  where judges refused to convict citizens\r\n\r\nwhen they refused to produce their identity cards\r\n\r\non the demand of a police officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the evil by-products of this\r\n\r\nidentity   card  system  is  that  everytime   a\r\n\r\npoliceman sees you, he asks, `Teng-kee'? Where is\r\n\r\nyour   identity  card? \" 'Teng-kee  manah'?\"   The\r\n\r\nunfortunate  hawker or pedestrian or  cyclist  or\r\n\r\nmotorist or lorry-driver begins to look upon this\r\n\r\nscrap of paper as something which, somehow or the\r\n\r\nother, gets him down every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been spirited citizens in\r\n\r\nSingapore - and I had the privilege of fighting for\r\n\r\nsome of them - who, for traffic offences, have been\r\n\r\nasked  to produce their identity card. It becomes\r\n\r\na  habit - a policeman asking you, \"I want  to  see\r\n\r\nwho  you  are, and I want to 'fix' you! Where  is\r\n\r\nyour   identity  card?\"  It  is  not  an  offence\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  Emergency.  It  is  not  an\r\n\r\noffence connected with the security of the State.\r\n\r\nIt  is  just a bad habit. These traffic offenders\r\n\r\nthen  have  to go to court. The police  prosecute\r\n\r\nand say, \"Emergency Regulation so and so, on such\r\n\r\na day, so and so demanded the identity card.\" But\r\n\r\nthe citizen who is keenly aware of his democratic\r\n\r\nrights  refused to produce his identity  card.  I\r\n\r\nknow  of a case in England where a British judge,\r\n\r\nwell-known  for  his  asperity,  had  refused  to\r\n\r\nconvict and had castigated the Police for  having\r\n\r\nabused  the  identity  card  system.  Sir,   this\r\n\r\nidentity card system has got nothing to  do  with\r\n\r\nmotoring offences and all the other minor  things\r\n\r\nin life. But it has become a habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, when I tried to put forward this\r\n\r\nliberal  point of view, I was smacked  down  very\r\n\r\nvigorously  and told, \"This is quite a  different\r\n\r\nworld  and,  therefore, we have  quite  different\r\n\r\nstandards. Any citizen, even though he  has  done\r\n\r\nnothing  to  warrant a policeman asking  for  his\r\n\r\nidentity card, must produce it in conformity with\r\n\r\nthe law, and there must be proper respect for the\r\n\r\nlaw.\"  So, the spirited citizen, because  he  was\r\n\r\nconscious of his fundamental rights, was properly\r\n\r\nsmacked  for $25 and asked to behave  himself  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope we are aware that what we are doing\r\n\r\ntoday  is  to  accept a system which  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndefended as democratic. It is not that  I  am  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of people going off on lost weekends  and\r\n\r\nnot wishing to sign their identity cards on hotel\r\n\r\nregisters; though I think that even such  persons\r\n\r\nshould be entitled to certain human liberties and\r\n\r\nthey should not have to put their mark everywhere\r\n\r\nthey  go  to  show  that they  have  been  there.\r\n\r\n\"Identity card? - I know mine by heart, because  I\r\n\r\nhave  signed it so often as 'Four E, 00635'.\"  It\r\n\r\nis  part of the regimentation of a police  state,\r\n\r\nand one of the things we accuse the Communists of\r\n\r\ndoing,  that they document people; they  regiment\r\n\r\nthem;  they  get everybody docketed in  dossiers.\r\n\r\nWe,  in  a liberal democracy, believe in  liberal\r\n\r\nconditions.  We  value  human  freedom  and   the\r\n\r\nliberty of the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not heard sufficient argument debated as\r\n\r\nto  why  the social schemes which the Government\r\n\r\nproposes to introduce could not be done in  some\r\n\r\nway  other than by the identity card. It is quite\r\n\r\npossible  that it is a convenient  way,  but  the\r\n\r\ndifference  is  this:  we  are  now  making  this\r\n\r\nidentity  card part and parcel not  only  of  our\r\n\r\nlives  for the period of the Emergency in Malaya,\r\n\r\nbut part and parcel of our normal lives. This,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Chief Minister will agree, will  not\r\n\r\nbe  one  of  those legislative acts of  which  he\r\n\r\ncould  be  proud as a democratic  and  a  liberal\r\n\r\nhumanitarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew), Mr Speaker, Sir, referred to the\r\n\r\nidentity  card  as an irritating  restriction  on\r\n\r\npersonal  liberty. I rather agree that all  these\r\n\r\nthings are irritating restrictions. They have  to\r\n\r\nbe very often, but they have positive advantages.\r\n\r\nTraffic  lights are often exceedingly irritating,\r\n\r\nas are restrictions about where you can park your\r\n\r\ncar.

Although the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nsays he does not wish to debate the usefulness of\r\n\r\nthe  identity card system, I think it is fair  to\r\n\r\npoint  out,  from  my  personal  experience,  its\r\n\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the floods which took place last year - I\r\n\r\nhave  already  mentioned them this morning - I  was\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  organising a  relief  centre  at\r\n\r\nwhich  we  had  some hundreds of  people  passing\r\n\r\nthrough. The maximum was 900 refugees sleeping in\r\n\r\nthe  centre in a single night. We organised large\r\n\r\ndistributions of food, clothing, money,  chickens\r\n\r\nand  all sorts of things. All passed through  the\r\n\r\ncentre,  and  for  that work  (which  had  to  be\r\n\r\nimprovised  among largely illiterate people)  the\r\n\r\nidentity  card was absolutely essential.  It  was\r\n\r\nthe  only possible way of seeing that people pass\r\n\r\nthrough the queue once, and not two, three,  four\r\n\r\nor five times. It was also essential for a house-to-house  survey. Our survey teams went  out  and\r\n\r\nsome went through about a thousand households and\r\n\r\nrecorded  details; and in order to be  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  was no confusion of any kind, the identity\r\n\r\ncard  was  solid  documentary evidence;  where  a\r\n\r\nChinese name, spoken by a Hokkien, recorded by  a\r\n\r\nCantonese,  is  written down in English,  it  may\r\n\r\nbecome an exceedingly different name and may lead\r\n\r\nto  confusion. Therefore, especially in times  of\r\n\r\nemergency,   in   my  personal  experience,   the\r\n\r\nidentity card is a most valuable and useful piece\r\n\r\nof social mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance of the hon. Member's argument\r\n\r\nagainst identity cards was the occasional  abuses\r\n\r\nthat  occur, that they are troublesome  and  that\r\n\r\nsort of thing. Well, the answer to that, I think,\r\n\r\nis  that  if abuses occur, they can be  remedied,\r\n\r\nand  this Assembly, as I have pointed out before,\r\n\r\nis the place to remedy them. It is the fashion at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  in  Singapore to run around  talking\r\n\r\nvery  vigorously  in  public assemblies - not  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - but  in Kampong Tai Seng  or  in  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark, or wherever it may be, and to put out a lot\r\n\r\nof  highly contentious propaganda which has  very\r\n\r\nlittle  basis in fact, if there is any. In  fact,\r\n\r\nit is sometimes completely contrary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the facts. That is a way of winning a certain\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  popular support,  but  it  does  not\r\n\r\naffect the law. The place to deal with the law is\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly. The way to deal with any  abuse\r\n\r\nof  the  law is to bring it to the notice of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly for its joint consideration and  action.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that abuses may have occurred  in  the\r\n\r\npast  is  an  argument for the Assembly  to  take\r\n\r\naction  to ensure that they do not occur  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.

As regards his  second  point,\r\n\r\nwhich  was to ask that a rule should be  made  to\r\n\r\nensure that holders of identity cards keep  their\r\n\r\naddresses  up to date, may I remind him  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  of  Singapore  that  that  is  already  a\r\n\r\nrequirement of the system of registration?  I  do\r\n\r\nask  all Members of this House, and everybody who\r\n\r\nhas  any influence, to try and make sure  that  a\r\n\r\ngreat number of persons in this territory do keep\r\n\r\ntheir  addresses up to date, because, of  course,\r\n\r\none  of  the,  I  hope, merits of our  system  of\r\n\r\nnational  registration is that it has enabled  us\r\n\r\nto prepare our electoral roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar managed to walk his\r\n\r\ntight  rope without making it clear to me whether\r\n\r\nhe   was   prepared  to  say   he   was   against\r\n\r\nregistration  or  he  was for  it.

They\r\n\r\nare  the people, Sir, that contribute largely  to\r\n\r\nthe  smooth  working of commerce,  and  they  are\r\n\r\nnecessary in every department of trade or labour.\r\n\r\nWe  have  not  in  the  past witnessed  too  many\r\n\r\nstrikes, and we believe that this has been due to\r\n\r\nthe  good  sense of responsibility of the  clerks\r\n\r\nand  shop  assistants. Perhaps, Sir, it might  be\r\n\r\nthat they have not been well organised; but it is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of this Assembly to protect all  those\r\n\r\nwho are not organised as well as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  those who are organised. It is also the duty\r\n\r\nof  this  Assembly  to enact, wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nfair legislation for all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell shortly on the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the clerical workers as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe shop assistants. Today we do find that clerks\r\n\r\nand  shop  assistants have no  regular  hours  of\r\n\r\nwork.  It is a fact that is known to all  that  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  them work  overtime;  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber work 12 hours or even 14 hours a day;  and\r\n\r\nalso  that their work includes not only  clerical\r\n\r\nwork  or work appertaining to the terms of  their\r\n\r\nemployment, but sometimes they do have to perform\r\n\r\nwork  just  like  manual labourers.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nwithin  the knowledge of all the Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and everybody in Singapore, that  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  do  have no leave. Clerical  workers,\r\n\r\ntoo, may not be able to utilise their leave or to\r\n\r\nget  their  leave because there  is  always  that\r\n\r\npressure of work as stated by the employers. I am\r\n\r\nsure that even City Council employees as well  as\r\n\r\nGovernment    employees   do   experience    such\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

There should be  medical\r\n\r\nleave, free medical attention, annual leave,  and\r\n\r\nmore  important still, they should  get  overtime\r\n\r\npay.  The last important point, Sir, is that  the\r\n\r\npresent  wave of strikes is probably due  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that no legislation has been enacted to give\r\n\r\nthem  a  fair  wage. If we can  legislate  for  a\r\n\r\nminimum  wage for this class of workers here  who\r\n\r\ndo  a  set  of  duties  not dissimilar  to  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues - and   I  think  it  is   possible   to\r\n\r\nlegislate  for  such  a  minimum  wage - we   would\r\n\r\nprobably   have   removed  discontent   in   this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that all those who are interested in\r\n\r\nthis Bill - if leave were granted and the Bill were\r\n\r\nintroduced -  will come forward and work  with  us\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of all concerned.

The fact that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a delay in tabling these two Bills  is\r\n\r\nbecause  I am awaiting the passage of the  Labour\r\n\r\nBill,  which has gone to a Select Committee,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Report has now been tabled. I will move  the\r\n\r\nadoption  of  the Report at the next  sitting  in\r\n\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Ministry have found difficulty in\r\n\r\nregard  to interpretation. That is why there  has\r\n\r\nbeen some delay. To find out when a clerk is  not\r\n\r\na  clerk - that is a question that has occupied us\r\n\r\nfor  some  time.  Regarding shop assistants  too,\r\n\r\nwhat kind of shop assistants should be protected?\r\n\r\nAs   to   shop   assistants,  what  should   they\r\n\r\ncover? - people  working  in  restaurants,   people\r\n\r\nworking  in dispensaries, people working in  food\r\n\r\nshops, and all sorts of other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy, Sir, to introduce legislation to\r\n\r\nprotect  the interests of workmen, but  it  must,\r\n\r\nfirst   of  all,  be  necessary  for  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  to have an adequate staff to  supervise\r\n\r\nand  to see that legislation is not abused.  Take\r\n\r\nthe  Weekly Holidays Ordinance introduced by  the\r\n\r\nProgressive    Party    during    the    previous\r\n\r\nadministration. There have been so  many  abuses.\r\n\r\nSo there is that worry that, unless we strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  staff  in  the  Labour Ministry  and  unless\r\n\r\nworkers get more united and form unions of  their\r\n\r\nown, whatever legislation we provide can and will\r\n\r\nbe abused by unscrupulous employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The then  Progressive  Party\r\n\r\nconsidered  the matter for some time.  There  was\r\n\r\nsome caustic correspondence in the English Press\r\n\r\npointing out the delay, and it was even suggested\r\n\r\nthat they were against it. Then came a firm Party\r\n\r\ndenial  and  after  that  it  just  subsided  and\r\n\r\nnothing further was done. Now the lesson has been\r\n\r\nsharply administered on the Councillors - I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  many deposits they lost  in  the  last\r\n\r\nelection,  but  I  am  told  that  it   was   not\r\n\r\ninconsiderable. The Chief Minister is hoping that\r\n\r\nit  is  not too late for them to repent. I  think\r\n\r\nthat they have missed the bus.

It was recently decided  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom to amend this Ordinance so  as  to\r\n\r\ndefine  more  closely  trade description,  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular to include under the heading of  \"Trade\r\n\r\ndescription\" the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"as to the standard of quality of any goods\r\n\r\naccording  to  a classification commonly  used  or\r\n\r\nrecognised in the trade\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and also again to include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"as to the fitness for purpose, strength,\r\n\r\nperformance or behaviour of any goods\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these additions is to make it an\r\n\r\noffence  to  apply  a false description  of  these\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  to  goods. In future,  misleading\r\n\r\ntrade  descriptions, as distinct from false  trade\r\n\r\ndescriptions,  will become an offence  under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   These  amendments   are   a   further\r\n\r\nsafeguard  for the public against the exploitation\r\n\r\nby unscrupulous traders or manufacturers who apply\r\n\r\nfalse or misleading descriptions to their goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Bar Committee and the Singapore\r\n\r\nTrade  Advisory  Council have been consulted,  and\r\n\r\nare  of the opinion that similar amendments should\r\n\r\nbe  made  in  the local legislation.

Section 5 of the  Civil\r\n\r\nLaw  Ordinance provides that in all  issues  which\r\n\r\narise in Singapore with respect to mercantile  law\r\n\r\nand  regarding which there are no local laws,  the\r\n\r\nlaw  to be administered shall be the same as would\r\n\r\nbe  administered in England. Under  this  section,\r\n\r\nthe  English Sale of Goods Act, 1893,  is  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act in\r\n\r\nEngland  was  repealed by the English  Law  Reform (Enforcement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Contracts) Act, 1954, so that contracts for the\r\n\r\nsale of goods of the value of \ufffd10 and upwards need\r\n\r\nno  longer be evidenced in writing by the party to\r\n\r\nbe  charged,  nor  need  there  be  acceptance  of\r\n\r\nsomething  given in earnest or in part payment  to\r\n\r\nmake the contract enforceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business transactions in Singapore differ from\r\n\r\nthose in England in that more often than not  they\r\n\r\nare  carried out through the medium of  a  broker.\r\n\r\nThe  broker, working on a commission, is therefore\r\n\r\nan  interested party and he would now be  able  to\r\n\r\ngive evidence on oral contracts as a corroborative\r\n\r\nwitness. Litigation could thus take place, heavily\r\n\r\nweighted on one side, which would be impossible if\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of the repealed section 4 of the\r\n\r\nSale  of  Goods Act were in force. Representations\r\n\r\nhave   been  received,  including  those  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bar  Committee that, the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  4 of the Sale of Goods Act should  be  in\r\n\r\nforce  in Singapore.

The\r\n\r\neffect  of it is to amend section 44 of the Police\r\n\r\nForce  Ordinance which at present  provides  that\r\n\r\ngratuities  and  pensions may  be  prescribed  for\r\n\r\nspecial  police  officers who  are  mobilised  for\r\n\r\nactive  service.  That  does  not  enable  us   to\r\n\r\nprescribe   pensions   and  gratuities   for   the\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Special Constabulary who  are  not,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  mobilised  for active service.  Appropriate\r\n\r\npensions and gratuities for those members of  that\r\n\r\nforce who suffer injuries or death in carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir  duties have been provided for in a  set  of\r\n\r\nregulations made as Emergency Regulations in 1948.\r\n\r\nI am sure the House will agree that it is right in\r\n\r\nprinciple   that   provision  for   pensions   and\r\n\r\ngratuities for these men should be made under  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive law and not be dependent on  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations,  and,  in any  event,  as  the  House\r\n\r\nknows, the Emergency Regulations will lapse  later\r\n\r\nthis  month.  It is for this reason, Sir,  that  I\r\n\r\nseek  this  House's  approval for  the  amendments\r\n\r\ncontained in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion, I should like to take up\r\n\r\na  minute  or  two  of  the House's  time  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething  of  the Volunteer Special  Constabulary\r\n\r\nwho are the people most affected by this piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation.  They consist of some 1,200  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore who voluntarily, in their spare time,\r\n\r\ngive  assistance  to  our  regular  police  force.\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House will well recall  the  part\r\n\r\nthat those men played in the riots that we had  in\r\n\r\nMay  and we paid tribute to them on that occasion.\r\n\r\nMembers  may  not appreciate that  every  day  and\r\n\r\nevery night there are members of Volunteer Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary who turn out on ordinary police  duty\r\n\r\nwith the regular members of the police force,  and\r\n\r\nI   am  sure  the  House  will  join  with  me  in\r\n\r\nexpressing our appreciation of the public  service\r\n\r\nthat these men give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in the few years that the force has been\r\n\r\nin  existence,  it  has won  formal  recognition.\r\n\r\nThree  members  of  the force have  been  awarded\r\n\r\nColonial  Police medals for meritorious  service.\r\n\r\nOne  member has received a Colonial Police  medal\r\n\r\nfor  gallantry, and one a King's Commendation for\r\n\r\nbrave  conduct.

They have had the candour to admit  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  wrong,  and,  in  fairness,  we  must\r\n\r\ncommend that candour; but in view of this, is  it\r\n\r\nreasonable for a popularly-elected Government  to\r\n\r\nswing  almost to the other extreme  and  ask  for\r\n\r\ndebate  on  their  operation  of  these  two  new\r\n\r\nOrdinances  to be put in cold storage  for  three\r\n\r\nyears?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of such a length of time should be\r\n\r\nobvious. We of the Progressive Party are  anxious\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the people of this country - and by\r\n\r\nthat  I  mean  the  95 per cent law-abiding  good\r\n\r\ncitizens of this country - are reminded at  regular\r\n\r\nintervals that these laws have been enacted for a\r\n\r\nparticular purpose to fight a particular  battle.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say too firmly and too often that these\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, or rather laws,  as  they\r\n\r\nwill  now  be, are intended to protect  all  law-abiding  citizens  who have nothing  whatever  to\r\n\r\nfear from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the people are not regularly reminded of this\r\n\r\ntruth, many will, through ignorance and inability\r\n\r\nto think clearly for themselves, become a prey to\r\n\r\nthe insidious propaganda of the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty,  or  of  the  travelling  circus  of  tub-thumpers of the People's Action Party who try  to\r\n\r\nhoodwink  the unwary into thinking that they  are\r\n\r\nbeing oppressed. On this ground alone, therefore,\r\n\r\nI think that the Government will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  making  a  grave  mistake if  they  reject  our\r\n\r\namendment and refuse to have their actions  weighed\r\n\r\nand  examined  at the end of a year,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nordinary man-in-the-street can be reminded  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers which surround him, if these dangers  still\r\n\r\nexist, as I fear they may well be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another point. Nobody on the\r\n\r\nGovernment Benches will disagree with  me  when  I\r\n\r\nsay  that these Bills before us are no better than\r\n\r\nlimited  preventive measures - not measures designed\r\n\r\nto  remove  the evil influences that  are  in  our\r\n\r\nmidst - but only to hold them in check. To revert to\r\n\r\nan  old saying - Cure is better than prevention  in\r\n\r\nthe grave problems which face the Government. And\r\n\r\nwe  are  entitled  to ask this:  If  we  give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  carte blanche for three years  to  use\r\n\r\nthese preventive measures, what guarantee have  we\r\n\r\nthat curative measures will not be neglected? What\r\n\r\nbetter  guarantee  could we  have  but  that  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  and through this House the people,  should\r\n\r\nbe  informed at least once a year of what positive\r\n\r\ncurative  measures the Government is  adopting  to\r\n\r\ncleanse  the body politic? By demanding,  Sir,  an\r\n\r\nannual review of this Bill, we want to ensure  not\r\n\r\nmerely  that the Government is operating it fairly\r\n\r\nand  justifiably,  but we also want  to  ask  what\r\n\r\npositive  measures they have taken to  render  its\r\n\r\ncontinuation unnecessary at the earliest  possible\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has said that it is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  the  measures would  only  be  for  a\r\n\r\nlimited  period  during  which  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  may \"learn by experience to distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween  liberty and licence, between good leaders\r\n\r\nand  bad  leaders\".  This is just  the  point.  An\r\n\r\nannual  review of this Bill will make it necessary\r\n\r\nfor  Government  to  render  an  account  of  what\r\n\r\npositive  steps  they have taken  to  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore into making this distinction.\r\n\r\nThis  is something which an Opposition Party  has\r\n\r\nevery   right  to  demand  of  the  hon.   Members\r\n\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate this point. Of the famous Four\r\n\r\nFreedoms which form perhaps the best definition of\r\n\r\na  free  world  and a free democratic  country,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that Singapore is most sorely in need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof freedom from fear, freedom from intimidation by\r\n\r\ngangsters,  thugs and their agents,  freedom  from\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of the consequence of speaking  one's\r\n\r\nown mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if the men and women of this\r\n\r\ncountry had the confidence to speak out what  they\r\n\r\nknow  and  what  they  feel,  without  threat   of\r\n\r\nreprisals, this island would be turned in  a  very\r\n\r\nshort time into the sunny happy country which most\r\n\r\nof us wish it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because intimidation makes this impossible,\r\n\r\nunfortunately  a  large  percentage  of  the  law-abiding people have an ingrained distrust  of  all\r\n\r\nset  in authority over them - whether it is the  unlicensed threatening authority of the gangster, or\r\n\r\nthe  licensed  protective sheltering authority  of\r\n\r\nthe  police  force - here again it is necessary  to\r\n\r\neducate the people to learn to distinguish, and  a\r\n\r\nheavy responsibility lies with the first popularly-elected Government to tackle this problem with the\r\n\r\nutmost    resolution.   Equally,   it    is    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of  an  Opposition   Party   like\r\n\r\nourselves to keep the Government on their toes  in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect this fundamental Singapore\r\n\r\nproblem  to  be solved in a year or  even  in  the\r\n\r\nlifetime of one government; but we do ask that  we\r\n\r\nshould be given an annual account of what is being\r\n\r\ndone - not in the form of social services or  social\r\n\r\nlegislation which is one aspect of it - but  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the Emergency Bill, and that we  should\r\n\r\nhave  the right to criticism if we feel that  more\r\n\r\neffort is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister, during his\r\n\r\nspeech  on  this Bill in this House,  in  inviting\r\n\r\namendments for its improvement, stated:\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We would be glad to consider each and every\r\n\r\nsuggestion,   and   would   gladly   accept    any\r\n\r\nimprovements  which  do  not  destroy  the   basic\r\n\r\nneeds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the  light of this statement, I do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  can  fail  to  accept  this\r\n\r\namendment.  Many  of  the hon. Gentlemen  opposite\r\n\r\nhave  had  the courage to swallow a part of  their\r\n\r\nelection    platforms - a   not   too   indigestible\r\n\r\noperation, I hope - and I trust that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  now  have  the  courage and  the  wisdom  to\r\n\r\nsubject their handling of the considerable  powers\r\n\r\nasked for in this Bill to the closest scrutiny  of\r\n\r\nthis  House in a year's time. I trust that, if  by\r\n\r\nany  mischance this amendment is rejected, it will\r\n\r\nnot  be  because  of the threats of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party. I hope, Sir, that the hon.  Members\r\n\r\nopposite will not seek refuge in the argument that\r\n\r\nthe anti-social demonstrations of this group prove\r\n\r\nonly too clearly that this Bill is necessary - every\r\n\r\nsensible  citizen knows that - and  that  we  should\r\n\r\ntherefore not quibble about a little matter of two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, we wish to support - indeed it is our\r\n\r\nduty  in the interests of Singapore to support - the\r\n\r\nmain  principles of this Bill, but we regret  that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  go all the way with the Government  on\r\n\r\nthis  particular  measure, because  we  feel  very\r\n\r\nstrongly of the correctness of our stand.  Let  it\r\n\r\nalso be noted that we do not ask for a three-month\r\n\r\nperiod but a halfway house of one year, because we\r\n\r\nconsider  that the Ordinance must have  that  much\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents in the rural area in the Tanglin\r\n\r\nDivision - and  they by far outnumber those  in  the\r\n\r\nresidential  area - are in favour of  this  Bill  so\r\n\r\nlong  as there are safeguards and so long  as,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, it protects them and can be seen  to\r\n\r\nprotect them. I understand this to be true  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in their constituencies, as I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt   it  is  true  of  the  majority   of   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies, though I have also no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies  of Tanjong  Pagar  and  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  must  be entirely different. It so  happens\r\n\r\nthat  the  Tanglin Division borders that of  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  for a considerable distance along the Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah/Clementi  Roads, and if the people  on  each\r\n\r\nside  of  the border think so differently,  I  can\r\n\r\nonly  suppose - though I have not seen it - that there\r\n\r\nmust  be a fence along it, or perhaps one of those\r\n\r\nnice  new  non-anti-Communist curtains! No  doubt,\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member will enlighten us. But,  because\r\n\r\nthe  kampong dwellers in Tanglin think as they do,\r\n\r\nI want them to continue to be convinced and not to\r\n\r\nbe misled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember not only that the price of peace\r\n\r\nis  eternal vigilance, but also that the  test  of\r\n\r\njust   and   democratic  government   is   eternal\r\n\r\nvigilance.  Without vigilance  there  can  be  no\r\n\r\npeace and no democratic government. Not only, Sir,\r\n\r\nmust  the  Government  opposite  watch  their  own\r\n\r\nhandling  of  the  considerable powers  this  Bill\r\n\r\ngives them, but they must give the Opposition  the\r\n\r\nfullest  opportunity to share their  watchfulness.\r\n\r\nOnly  in this manner can the rights of the  people\r\n\r\nand the way of democracy be served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,   by   their  admission,  the  Labour   Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government,  in presenting  this  Bill,\r\n\r\naccepts the fact that this is a temporary measure.\r\n\r\nOne   fails  to  understand,  however,  why   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  considers  a  three-year   period   as\r\n\r\ntemporary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give wide powers of detention and search to\r\n\r\nthe  Police  is against all democratic ideals  and\r\n\r\nprinciples.

I will say quite frankly that\r\n\r\nfrom     the     first,    when    I     received\r\n\r\nit - representations   from   the   Trades    Union\r\n\r\nCongress,   the  Chinese  Chamber  of   Commerce,\r\n\r\nprivate representations from the hon. Members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Progressive   Party - it   seemed   to   have\r\n\r\nconsiderable  validity, and in  truth  it  still\r\n\r\nhas.  There is good sense in saying that  a  law,\r\n\r\nwhich, though immeasurably improving the existing\r\n\r\nlaws, is, nevertheless, one that is of preventive\r\n\r\narrest   and  detention,  should  be  under   the\r\n\r\nconstant  and  watchful eye of this  Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say this to hon. Members: that if it  were\r\n\r\nonly  a question of a review by this Assembly,  I\r\n\r\nwould  never  place  any  obstacle  in  its   way\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, any obstacle in the exercise  of  its\r\n\r\ncomplete  powers of control over the  Government.\r\n\r\nBut  that is not what is really in issue, because\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Bill is for one year or  for  three\r\n\r\nyears,  this  House has at all  times  powers  to\r\n\r\nquestion  at every sitting; powers of motions  on\r\n\r\nadjournment;  powers of motion  for  repeal;  and\r\n\r\neven  powers  of  compelling repeal  by  Members'\r\n\r\nBills.  So  its powers of control are completely\r\n\r\nunrestricted, and at any time that hon.  Members\r\n\r\nmay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire the Chief Secretary, or any other  Member\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, to answer for  his  conduct,\r\n\r\nthey have only to table a motion and to call  for\r\n\r\na  debate.  We have never in the past obstructed,\r\n\r\nand  certainly never will in the future, Sir - this\r\n\r\nis   not  a  matter  in  our  hands,  it  is   in\r\n\r\nyours - obstruct  hon. Members in the  exercise  of\r\n\r\ntheir legitimate powers of control of Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough desirous of meeting a valued request for\r\n\r\nperiodical  review,  I would suggest  to  Members\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps  a  periodical review  is  not  the\r\n\r\nanswer;  they should retain rather in mind  their\r\n\r\npowers to call for a review in the normal course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent weeks have brought to light somewhat\r\n\r\nforcibly  the  extent  to  which  the  worker  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and others can be duped by the  forces\r\n\r\nof  destruction. It must be remembered  that  the\r\n\r\ncommon man of Singapore has, in the past, had but\r\n\r\nlittle  opportunity for education;  has,  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  had genuine grounds for grievances against\r\n\r\nthe  Government; has, in the past, learnt  to  be\r\n\r\nembittered  towards Government. In the  words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanglin they are  traditionally\r\n\r\n\"agin the Government\". Therefore, Sir, the common\r\n\r\nman   of  Singapore  is  easy  prey  to  cleverly\r\n\r\nmanipulated, dishonest political propaganda aimed\r\n\r\nat destroying democratic government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read, Sir, reports in the Press of\r\n\r\nmeetings held condemning this Bill - meetings  held\r\n\r\nby   P.A.P. unions.  Gullible  reporters   have\r\n\r\nexaggerated the attendances at these meetings, no\r\n\r\ndoubt   receiving  the  figures  from  thoroughly\r\n\r\ndishonest organisers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Radio Malaya included?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

But some of  the\r\n\r\nstatements,   Sir,   are   significant   of   the\r\n\r\nreceptivity  of  the common man in  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nHitlerian  falsehoods. It was, I believe,  Hitler\r\n\r\nwho  laid down the principle that the bigger  the\r\n\r\nlie,  and the more often you repeat it, the  more\r\n\r\ncertain you are that it will be believed. Some of\r\n\r\nthese  lies, Sir, say that this Bill is aimed  at\r\n\r\nwrecking  the trade union movement and  murdering\r\n\r\ntrade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunionists.  These are the people who were  on  the\r\n\r\nsame platform as the Member for Tanjong Pagar. The\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement, Sir, has never  flourished\r\n\r\nmore  than  it has flourished under my Government.\r\n\r\nIt has never had more power; it has never had more\r\n\r\nfreedom;  it  has never had more protection,  even\r\n\r\nfor  the  dishonest.  The  only  danger  to  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  comes  from  the dishonest  professional\r\n\r\nagitators who have never been labourers  in  their\r\n\r\nlives,  but take paid posts as agitators in P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  As for murdering trade  unionists,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  will just draw your attention  to  it  to\r\n\r\nindicate the extent to which these plague-carrying\r\n\r\nrats can carry their falsehoods. They do not wince\r\n\r\nfrom  lies,  Sir.  Lies are part  of  their  daily\r\n\r\nbread.  They will tell you that they are not  pro-Communists; they are not anti-Communists; they are\r\n\r\nnot Communists; whatever lies best suit them - lies\r\n\r\nevery one! By lies they live, and lies have ridden\r\n\r\nthe streets these past weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of their lies from public platforms, on\r\n\r\nwhich the hon. Member sat - two hon. Members sitting\r\n\r\nopposite - is that any detective can arrest anyone\r\n\r\nand   detain  him  for  two  years.  I  repeat - any\r\n\r\ndetective can arrest anyone and detain him for two\r\n\r\nyears. Nothing about the fact that he can only  be\r\n\r\ndetained  by  order of the Council  of  Ministers;\r\n\r\nthat  he can only continue to be detained by order\r\n\r\nof  the Tribunal of Judges; that you have to  have\r\n\r\nthat  detention  reviewed every  six  months.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers has to look at the case every\r\n\r\nsix  months.  This, it seems, is  worse  than  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations! They are  welcome  to  the\r\n\r\nEmergency   Regulations,  if   they   want   them.\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  is  a jail with no difference  whether\r\n\r\nyou  are  in  or out.\" Some of those  persons  who\r\n\r\nspoke  have experience, and I trust they will  one\r\n\r\nday give me an opportunity for giving them further\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of the falsehoods in public, without\r\n\r\nshame,  no mincing of these foul lies - that is  the\r\n\r\ntechnique employed on platforms on which the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite have stood.

If you permit me, Sir, and if it  please\r\n\r\nyou - no  place  in Cairnhill, Sir, to  meet  me - no\r\n\r\nplace  at  all -  a division where I had  campaigned\r\n\r\nday  in and day out for more than two months.

It  is  this\r\n\r\ndishonest   conduct,  Sir,  which  Government   is\r\n\r\ndisturbed  to  note.  We are  disturbed  by  these\r\n\r\nactivities  of  dishonest agitators  who  seek  to\r\n\r\norganise unrest, which can at the appropriate time\r\n\r\nbreak out in violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true we have had - and let us make a note\r\n\r\nand be grateful for - a large group of labour in the\r\n\r\norganisation  of the Trades Union Congress  which\r\n\r\nhas reacted with responsibility. They do not, like\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. trade unions, ask the  world  to  put\r\n\r\nblack bands on to mourn the death of truth - for  it\r\n\r\nis  the  death of truth that they seek,  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  perpetrate. Though the Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nhas  shown  itself  responsible,  there  are  many\r\n\r\nresponsible persons, Sir, even in this very House,\r\n\r\nwho  have  been  enmeshed by  Communist  and  pro-Communist propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read in the Press, Sir, that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  has  suggested  that  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion people should shout so that my hair should\r\n\r\nfall out.

Even if we ourselves were to go down, to\r\n\r\nthem  it  does not matter.

There\r\n\r\nmust  have  been  very good  reasons  for  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision. I think it was because some officers in\r\n\r\nthe  past  were not too scrupulous as to how  they\r\n\r\nobtained  their  statements,  and,  therefore,  no\r\n\r\nstatements,  unless they amounted to a  confession\r\n\r\ntaken before a magistrate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  due warning, could be used in court  against\r\n\r\nan    accused   person.   Under   the    Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations,  which follow the English  law,  this\r\n\r\nlong-standing practice has been changed so that  a\r\n\r\nstatement by a person in custody to or within  the\r\n\r\nhearing  of a Police Inspector can be used against\r\n\r\nhim in his trial in court provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that he has not been induced or threatened to\r\n\r\nmake a statement, and,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that he has been cautioned to the effect that\r\n\r\nhe  is  not obliged to say anything, but  what  he\r\n\r\nsays may be used as evidence against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accepted this principle that\r\n\r\nextraordinary    times    require    extraordinary\r\n\r\nmeasures, and I, for one, do not quarrel with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  so  far.

Nevertheless, I must emphasise again that I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Government will be making  an  equally\r\n\r\ngrave mistake if they reject the amendment to this\r\n\r\nBill. Having built up a case for the retention  of\r\n\r\nthe     Emergency     Regulations     which     is\r\n\r\nunassailable - and their retention has  never  been\r\n\r\ndisputed  by the Progressive Party even though  we\r\n\r\nmay  not like their translation into law - it  seems\r\n\r\nto  us  the height of folly for the Government  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  a  good deal of that case,  even  to  the\r\n\r\nextent   of  making  their  motives  suspect,   by\r\n\r\nsticking to the period of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make only one point. Certain\r\n\r\nirresponsible   groups - I  need   not   name   them\r\n\r\nagain - have tried to make out that Part V,  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  illegal strikes in essential services, is  a\r\n\r\nblow aimed at destroying the trade union movement.\r\n\r\nThis,  of  course, is nonsense. These  Regulations\r\n\r\nhave been in force for several years and I see  no\r\n\r\nsigns  of  the  trade union movement  having  been\r\n\r\ndestroyed. Nevertheless, Sir, colour can  be  lent\r\n\r\nto  that  argument  if the hon.  Members  opposite\r\n\r\nremain  adamant.  Let us be quite  clear  that  to\r\n\r\ndelay  the  right of striking is a curtailment  of\r\n\r\nliberties for emergency purposes only, and  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  be the subject of regular review.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  very  least that the honest  and  sincere\r\n\r\ntrade  unionist has a right to expect. Sir, I  beg\r\n\r\nto move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to\r\n\r\nbe left out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, as the mover of this amendment\r\n\r\nforesaw,  we have already made our position  clear\r\n\r\nin  principle on this matter in the previous  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  we considered this morning, and I will  not\r\n\r\ndetain the House longer than to say again that we,\r\n\r\non  this  side of the House, are always  ready  to\r\n\r\nface our responsibility to this House at any time;\r\n\r\nand  it is open to Members opposite to ensure that\r\n\r\nwe  discharge that duty by means of questions  and\r\n\r\nother  procedures in this House.

Reference is invited to my reply to a question on this subject on Wednesday, 29th June, 1955 (Legislative Assembly Debates, Official Report Vol. I No. 6, Col. 331).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary discussions have taken place with Ministers in the Federation on proposals for promoting industrial development. It is intended to seek further discussions at an early date with a view to the creation of an Industrial Development Board which I am anxious to establish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present trade discussions with Indonesia are also of considerable importance to our local industries. It is hoped that as a result of these talks local industries will once more be able to export to the Indonesian market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Departments and public bodies have been instructed to give preference in all cases to local manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following steps have been or will shortly be taken for providing guidance and assistance including the grant of loans for the welfare and development of small operators in -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Fishing Industry: -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fisheries Loans Board provides financial assistance to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffshore fishermen and the Fisheries Division purchases equipment for sale cheaply to fishing boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division also assists fishermen in obtaining land for their houses and generally looks after their welfare and that of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspectors of the Fisheries Division visit fishing villages to license boats so that fishermen can obtain licences locally. There is a Central Control point at Telok Ayer which provides a 24-hour service to assist the arrival and departure of fishing boats, facilities for water supply, the discharge of fish and the loading of stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mobile unit tours fishing villages giving instruction in the care and maintenance of outboard engines and sells stocks of spare parts at cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The M.V. \"Dunvegan\" has acted as a mother ship for drift netters and continues to search for new fishing grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term research is also undertaken by the Regional Fisheries Research Station. A specially equipped vessel, the \"Manihine\", arrived in Singapore on 12th August, 1955, to assist in this research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Farming Industry: -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of Government's plans for the provision of veterinary and animal husbandry services were given in a written answer to Mr. M.
