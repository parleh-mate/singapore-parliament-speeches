Does he not think that these investments\r\n\r\nare  too  small a sum for foreigners  to  be  given\r\n\r\npermanent  residence in Singapore? There  are  also\r\n\r\npeople who have invested millions of dollars either\r\n\r\nin  industries  or  hotels. These  people  are  not\r\n\r\npermanent residents but are living in Singapore  on\r\n\r\nvisas  granted  to them on a yearly  basis  by  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department. If they apply for permanent\r\n\r\nresidence,  will their applications be approved  on\r\n\r\nthe strength of their investments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the entry of non-citizen wives into\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Minister answered an oral  question\r\n\r\non  this  topic  asked by the Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai on 9th March, 1970. My question is this: will\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  consider  asking  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  maintain  close  liaison  with  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Marriages? In this respect, perhaps  a\r\n\r\nquestionnaire  can be given to those  citizens  who\r\n\r\nwish  to  marry non-citizen wives to  complete  and\r\n\r\nreturn  either to the Registry of Marriages or  the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Department.  If   this   measure   is\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it will caution Singapore citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe consequences of taking\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnon-citizen  wives. They will then be more  careful\r\n\r\nabout  marrying non-citizens. However, this measure\r\n\r\nperhaps deserves consideration, especially when our\r\n\r\nmale  population exceeds our female  population  by\r\n\r\nabout 85,000, according to a recent census taken in\r\n\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

His\r\n\r\nparents,  brothers  and sisters are  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  are staying here,  and  he  used  to\r\n\r\ntravel  up and down Malaysia. One day, while coming\r\n\r\ndown  to  Singapore  to visit his  family,  he  was\r\n\r\ncaught  unawares by the travel restrictions imposed\r\n\r\nat  the  Causeway, and his blue Singapore  identity\r\n\r\ncard  was taken away by the Immigration authorities\r\n\r\nat  the  Woodlands checkpoint, as he did not follow\r\n\r\nthe proper procedure.

He  then\r\n\r\ncabled  his  father  in Singapore  saying  that  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  join his family.

Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, from the list of Members who have given notice\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nspeak  on  this  subhead, it  is  clear  that  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department  is  in  for  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ncriticism. However, I will confine myself to  just\r\n\r\none   aspect,   and   that  is,  locally-domiciled\r\n\r\nresidents who are non-citizens. When these  people\r\n\r\nwish  to  travel  abroad, they  are  issued  with\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  identity,  and  only  on  urgent\r\n\r\ngrounds. Generally they are allowed to travel only\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore to Malaysia, and their certificates\r\n\r\nof  identity are good for one journey  only.  Sir,\r\n\r\nmost  of  these people travel for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nvisiting sick relatives or urgent private matters;\r\n\r\nin  certain  cases  they travel for  some  festive\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Department charges something\r\n\r\nlike  $24.60  for  this certificate  of  identity,\r\n\r\nwhich includes reentry permit charges, etc. In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  $24.60 is a little too much,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  only one trip can be made, and in some cases\r\n\r\nthis  trip  is  made only as far as Johore  Bahru.\r\n\r\nSir,  for  a  Singapore resident to visit  a  sick\r\n\r\nrelative in Johore Bahru, and to have to pay a fee\r\n\r\nof  $24.60  is, in my opinion, too much  when  you\r\n\r\nconsider  the fact that an international passport,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  a life span of five years, costs  only\r\n\r\n$25  and  can  be used for as many  trips  as  one\r\n\r\nlikes.  On  the one hand, we charge $24.60  for  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  of  identity for  one  trip  to  East\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  On  the  other hand,  we  are  generous\r\n\r\nenough  to maintain the archaic practice of paying\r\n\r\ngood conduct allowances to our policemen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of these certificates of identity is\r\n\r\nalso  a  little too restrictive. When one  applies\r\n\r\nfor  a  certificate of identity to  visit  a  sick\r\n\r\nrelative  in  Malaysia, one has to show  proof  of\r\n\r\nillness  in  the form of either a  telegram  or  a\r\n\r\nletter,  etc.  Our telephone system is  efficient,\r\n\r\nand  more often than not, the news of the  illness\r\n\r\nof  a  relative across the Causeway is often  made\r\n\r\nvia  the telephone. Therefore, requiring proof  of\r\n\r\nillness in the form of a letter or a telegram  is,\r\n\r\nI  think,  making  it a little too  difficult  and\r\n\r\ninconveniencing the local residents. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that more liberal consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven to this\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nissue   of   certificates  of  identity   by   the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department. At the same time, I  would\r\n\r\nbe  grateful to the Minister if he would look into\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  reducing  the  cost  for   a\r\n\r\ncertificate of identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the past many of our citizens have  gone\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway to seek employment. The recent\r\n\r\naction  by  the Malaysian Government  to  restrict\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities  to  our  citizens   has\r\n\r\nforced many of them to return to Singapore to earn\r\n\r\na living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During their period of residence in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nmany of these citizens have raised families there.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons, the members of their families\r\n\r\nhave  taken out Malaysian identity cards. The men-folk,  however, were allowed entry into  Singapore\r\n\r\nwithout  any  restriction, but not the  wives  and\r\n\r\nchildren of these citizens.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this problem with the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment, and was surprised to receive  a  reply\r\n\r\nstating that the people concerned could only apply\r\n\r\nfor  social visit passes for the members of  their\r\n\r\nfamily  in this instance, as there is no provision\r\n\r\nin  the  regulations to enable them to  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  permanent  residence.   Will   the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider measures to assist the families\r\n\r\nof  these  Singapore citizens who are affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Government's action to  return  and\r\n\r\nreside permanently in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  informed that there are quite a few  cases  of\r\n\r\npeople   who  were  denied  entry  into  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause their passports had expired. These people,\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  citizens,  were  in  Indonesia  or\r\n\r\nsomewhere  else,  and, for one  reason  or  other,\r\n\r\ncould  not renew their passports. Later  on,  when\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to renew their passports,  they  were\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to  do  so. Without  renewing  their\r\n\r\npassports,  they  were  not allowed  reentry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. Will the Minister state whether  it  is\r\n\r\nhis  policy  to deny such people readmission  into\r\n\r\nSingapore?

With  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  independence, it is  our  duty  to\r\n\r\ncreate   employment  opportunities  for   our   own\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  for   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department to  take  measures  against\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants entering our country to share in\r\n\r\nour  prosperity. I think everyone agrees with  this\r\n\r\npolicy. However, I think the Immigration Department\r\n\r\nshould  relax some of its regulations. For example,\r\n\r\none  regulation is that if a person wishes to apply\r\n\r\nfor  his relative to come to Singapore, he  has  to\r\n\r\nstate   the   age   of  his  relative   and   their\r\n\r\nrelationship before he or she can be admitted  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If a son wants to apply for his  mother\r\n\r\nto  come to Singapore, he must first prove that she\r\n\r\nis  more  than 65 years old and that  she  has  no\r\n\r\nother  people abroad to support her. If  a  husband\r\n\r\nwants  to  apply for his wife to come to Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere are certain regulations which state that  she\r\n\r\ncan  be allowed into Singapore to be reunited  with\r\n\r\nhim  provided  they have met each  other  within  a\r\n\r\ncertain period. All these regulations are laid down\r\n\r\nby the Government and everybody must abide by them.\r\n\r\nAlthough   sometimes   I  feel   that   all   these\r\n\r\nregulations  must  be observed, I  still  think  we\r\n\r\nshould relax them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one example of a husband who applied for\r\n\r\nhis wife, who is in China, to come to Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  reunited  with him. However, according  to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department, if the husband has not  met\r\n\r\nhis  wife for five years, it means that the husband\r\n\r\nand  wife relationship has been broken off.  It  so\r\n\r\nhappened that when this person applied for his wife\r\n\r\nto  come  to Singapore, she fell sick. As a result,\r\n\r\nshe  was  not  able to come here.  So  he  was  not\r\n\r\nsuccessful\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nin  his  application. He wanted to  visit  her  in\r\n\r\nChina but was not able to do so. Five years later - his wife had by then recovered from her sickness  -\r\n\r\nhe reapplied for her to come to Singapore. However,\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration  Department  rejected  it  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that she was not eligible for  entry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  he had not  met  her  for  five\r\n\r\nyears, and, according to the regulations, she could\r\n\r\nnot come here. This person came to me for help, and\r\n\r\nI  informed the Minister concerned about it. But he\r\n\r\nsaid,  since there were so many women in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhy  did  he  not  want  to marry  a  local  female\r\n\r\ncitizen? I told him that this man was already  past\r\n\r\n60  years  of  age, so how could he  marry  another\r\n\r\nyoung girl locally? I also told him that, according\r\n\r\nto  Chinese  custom, a man is not allowed  to  take\r\n\r\nanother wife if the present wife still lives.  This\r\n\r\nman  also said that he had married his wife out  of\r\n\r\nlove.  It was not an arranged marriage. Their  love\r\n\r\nfor  each other was very deep and they were willing\r\n\r\nto  live  together  to  the  end  of  their  lives.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  how  could we force them  to  separate?\r\n\r\nThis person was in despair and he asked his son  to\r\n\r\napply  for his mother to come to Singapore. As  she\r\n\r\nwas   then   67   years  of  age,  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  said that at this age she was  eligible\r\n\r\nto come to Singapore. However, when the son applied\r\n\r\nfor  an  entry permit for his mother,  it  was  not\r\n\r\ngranted  because  another application  had  already\r\n\r\nbeen made on her behalf by his father. I then asked\r\n\r\nthe son to try again. However, when he was about to\r\n\r\nsend   in   his   application  to  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment, the father died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all human and laws are\r\n\r\nmade  by man. Therefore, all these troubles created\r\n\r\nby man should be resolved by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this case, we should be sympathetic\r\n\r\nto certain applicants in future. In this particular\r\n\r\ncase,  we  should have tried our best to  help  him\r\n\r\nreunite with his wife before he died. That was  his\r\n\r\nwish.  But  under the circumstances  this  was  not\r\n\r\nfulfilled because he could not see her. This is  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  our Government not being  in  sympathy\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nthe applicant.

I hope the Minister  will  be\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  applications  of  this  nature  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will reply first to the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  before proceeding to the other Members  who\r\n\r\nhave raised almost the same points. The Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi  wants to know how many foreigners who  have\r\n\r\ninvested  between $125,000 and $250,000  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven permanent residence in Singapore. I regret to\r\n\r\nsay  that I do not carry the figures around  in  my\r\n\r\nhead.   But   if   the  Member  still   wants   the\r\n\r\ninformation, he can put in a question and  it  will\r\n\r\nbe made available. He also wants to know whether  a\r\n\r\nlocally-domiciled resident who invests in  industry\r\n\r\nwill  be given permanent residence. If a person  is\r\n\r\nlocally-domiciled, it means that he is  allowed  to\r\n\r\nstay here and, in time to come, he will qualify for\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Is that what the Member wants to know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> No, Sir. I am referring to a\r\n\r\nperson staying in Singapore but who holds a foreign\r\n\r\npassport. Therefore, he is not domiciled  here.

It is not because\r\n\r\nof  ignorance.  If a man is astute enough  to  have\r\n\r\nearned  a few million dollars, I think he is astute\r\n\r\nenough to take advantage of any scheme that we  may\r\n\r\nhave so that he can obtain permanent residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come to the other Members, I think there\r\n\r\nare two points in common which they raised. One  is\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the entry of non-citizen wives  and\r\n\r\nchildren  of  Singapore  citizens.  What  they  are\r\n\r\nasking  for  is a liberalisation of the  law  which\r\n\r\npermits non-citizen wives and children of Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  come into Singapore  on  a  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence basis. I think it will help a great  deal\r\n\r\nand  will  save a lot of time if I mention  briefly\r\n\r\nthe  conditions under which non-citizen  wives  and\r\n\r\nchildren  of  Singapore citizens  are  eligible  to\r\n\r\napply  for  permanent residence  in  the  Republic.\r\n\r\nThese   are  laid  down  in  section  10   of   the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Ordinance,   1955,   and    in    the\r\n\r\nconsideration of applications various  factors  are\r\n\r\ntaken  into consideration; namely, (a) whether  the\r\n\r\nmarriage  is  lawful;  (b)  whether  the  wife  and\r\n\r\nchildren  qualify under paragraphs 4 and 5  of  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  (Prohibition of  Entry)  Order,  1966.\r\n\r\ni.e.,   whether  the  wife  has  not  been   living\r\n\r\nseparately from the husband for a continuous period\r\n\r\nof  five years after the date of the marriage, and\r\n\r\nwhether the children are under six years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, may I digress a little and take up the\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Delta on a specific\r\n\r\ncase? She probably knows more about Chinese customs\r\n\r\nthan I do. But my understanding is that the Chinese\r\n\r\nof this generation of about 50 years and over, more\r\n\r\noften than not, would prefer to take more than  one\r\n\r\nwife!  Here  again,  without going  into  the  case\r\n\r\nspecifically, I have my doubts whether  this  is  a\r\n\r\nbona   fide  case  of  husband  and  wife  because,\r\n\r\nnormally,  again I stand to be corrected, according\r\n\r\nto  Chinese  custom, usually the  husband  is  much\r\n\r\nolder  than  the wife. In this instance,  the  wife\r\n\r\nappears  to be seven years older than the  husband.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think the application was not approved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause the Immigration officials may have doubts \r\n\r\nwhether that was a bona fide case of love at first \r\n\r\nsight, or whatever it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also mentioned that they had\r\n\r\nnot been living together for five years because attempts had\r\n\r\nbeen made during that time for the wife to gain entry\r\n\r\nhere. First, the wife was sick and there was the\r\n\r\nquestion of permits. If they were so much in love\r\n\r\nand if the husband really required the presence of\r\n\r\nhis wife here, it would not have taken five years to \r\n\r\ngo through the official procedure. And if he could\r\n\r\nlive - I presume that he lived well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir. The Minister should not forget that the cause of the\r\n\r\ndelay was that the wife could not come here unless she is older\r\n\r\nthan the specified age limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is a different matter,\r\n\r\nThe Member says the woman had not reached the specified\r\n\r\nage. At first, probably the application was prepared\r\n\r\nwrongly. As far as I understand, the application was\r\n\r\nmade on the ground that she is the wife of a local\r\n\r\nresident. If she is the wife of a local citizen, it is\r\n\r\nnot the age that is to be taken into consideration. It\r\n\r\nis the other factors which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the third factor to which consideration will be given for admitting non-citizen wives and children of Singapore citizens. It is whether the husband is in a position to support his wife and children. We are not a hard-hearted Government and\r\n\r\nI believe the Ministers here have got feelings. At the same time, in deciding upon policy, we must not allow ourselves to be swayed by sentiment. The only sentiment we should allow ourselves to be swayed by is, is it for the good of Singapore? If it is for the good of Singapore, then we will carry out the policy. And once a policy has been decided, as my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, has said, we must stand firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the question of entry permits, we do relax \r\n\r\nthe regulations sometimes under exceptional \r\n\r\ncircumstances, because of our feelings, our sentiments, and on humanitarian grounds. We are not that hard-hearted as was \r\n\r\nmade out to appear by the Member for Delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take up the suggestion put up by the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi that there should be closer liaison\r\n\r\nbetween the Registry of Marriages and the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment. He suggests that Singapore citizens who\r\n\r\nintend to marry non-citizens should be provided with\r\n\r\na questionnaire. I do not know what questions he has in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Questions like how much money the person has and\r\n\r\nwhether he can support the woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as I said, if a man is intent on, marrying a woman out of love, no amount of prevention\r\n\r\nby any Government official will stop that marriage. But I think we have\r\n\r\nannounced time and time again - and I have just made it clear - the conditions under which we will allow a non-citizen wife to enter Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take up the point again that we have no feelings,\r\n\r\nas my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the\r\n\r\nother day, it is only those cases which have not \r\n\r\nbeen approved that come to Members' notice. Cases that have been\r\n\r\napproved do not come back to thank them for their assistance. For the information of Members, I would like to give some figures. In 1968, there were a \r\n\r\ntotal of 910 applications of Malaysian\r\n\r\nwives of Singapore citizens. Out of these\r\n\r\n910 applications, 742 were approved. In\r\n\r\n1969, out of 902 applications. 795 were\r\n\r\napproved. So you will see that we have\r\n\r\nnot been very hard-hearted in enforcing\r\n\r\nthis regulation, and whenever we can,\r\n\r\nwe will let them through and make life\r\n\r\nhappier for our citizens who have\r\n\r\nmarried non-citizen wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as regards\r\n\r\napplications which were not approved,\r\n\r\nnamely, 168 in 1968 and 107 in 1969,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese were mainly due to the fact that\r\n\r\nthe husbands' income was low and they\r\n\r\nwere not considered to have capacity\r\n\r\nlo support their wives, much less their\r\n\r\nchildren, later on in Singapore.

As a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen, you have certain\r\n\r\nprivileges. Surely we should treat our\r\n\r\ncitizens better than non-citizens. And\r\n\r\nfor these certain privileges - privileges\r\n\r\nover and above those not enjoyed by\r\n\r\nnon-citizens, and I think every country\r\n\r\ndoes that - our citizens have got more\r\n\r\nresponsibilities than non-citizens. I think\r\n\r\nthe Member is also mistaken because the\r\n\r\nfee for a restricted certificate of identity\r\n\r\nfor travelling to West Malaysia is only\r\n\r\n$5 and not $24.60.

If there is a\r\n\r\ndifferent charge for citizens and non-citizens, there is a very good reason for\r\n\r\nit. As far as possible, I will keep this\r\n\r\ndistinction because it indicates how valuable Singapore citizenship is. A Singapore citizen has more privileges than a\r\n\r\nnon-citizen. This is as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I clarify how a certificate of\r\n\r\nidentity is issued? It is governed by\r\n\r\nArticle 28 of the United Nations Final\r\n\r\nAct and Convention. It is an International Geneva Agreement. It requires\r\n\r\nthat before we can issue a certificate of\r\n\r\nidentity to a person, he must produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary evidence from his country\r\n\r\nof birth that he is stateless, and if he\r\n\r\ncan produce that evidence, then he will\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  issued with a certificate of identity with  re-entry  facilities  upon  application.

That  is  why  the\r\n\r\napplicant    is   covered   by   an   international\r\n\r\nconvention. That is the law and, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta  has said, laws are made by man and they  can\r\n\r\nbe  un-made by man.

That is why\r\n\r\nin   genuine   cases  where  special  consideration\r\n\r\njustifies it, we issue a certificate of identity to\r\n\r\na  person  who  is normally not eligible  for  such\r\n\r\ntravel facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has suggested that\r\n\r\nwe  should  accept a telephone call as evidence.

There  are  many\r\n\r\nreasons, some of which I cannot divulge.

As  I  am  very interested  in  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities, I am pleased to see marked progress  in\r\n\r\nthis   direction.   I  have  spoken   on   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  during the Adjournment debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  two occasions. This was as long  ago  as\r\n\r\n1966.

Let me quote what I said on  5th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1966. It is in Hansard, Vol. 25,  No.  7,\r\n\r\ncol.  515. I said then that a healthy culture could\r\n\r\nimbue  fine  thinking in our people.

I\r\n\r\nam  quoting  from  page 8. I  made  the  following\r\n\r\npoints  then. Ours is a multi-racial  society.  We\r\n\r\nmust  develop  the  traditional  cultures  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  races.  We do not mean to  do  away  with\r\n\r\nWestern  culture or to impose the culture  of  one\r\n\r\nrace upon the other races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another paragraph deals with imported cultures.\r\n\r\nWe  should  stop the import of poisonous cultures.\r\n\r\nAs  a  newly independent Republic we should create\r\n\r\nour  own culture and try to enrich it. Our culture\r\n\r\nshould aim at enriching the life of our people. We\r\n\r\nshould   participate   in   and   enjoy   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities   which  will  help  us   achieve   our\r\n\r\nobjective of nation building. I will stop  quoting\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should pursue a healthy cultural policy to\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in nation building. The People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty's  policy  is to promote a healthy  culture.\r\n\r\nBut  the question is whether the officials in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture, or even the Minister  himself\r\n\r\nand  his Parliamentary Secretary, have carried out\r\n\r\nthis  policy.  I  would like  to  quote  from  the\r\n\r\nmagazine, the Singapore Monthly, published on 15th\r\n\r\nMarch, wherein you will find some criticism of our\r\n\r\nculture. It says that the Government has  put  the\r\n\r\nonus  on public officers to execute the policy  of\r\n\r\npromoting a healthy culture to achieve its purpose\r\n\r\nof  nation  building. However, public officers  do\r\n\r\nnot   understand  the  full  significance  of  our\r\n\r\npolicy. What with the administrative machinery and\r\n\r\ntheir   poor   understanding  of   the   political\r\n\r\nsituation,  public officers do not understand  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this policy and cannot implement  it.\r\n\r\nThey  are,  therefore, behind  time.  How  can  we\r\n\r\nexpect anything good out of them? In the hands  of\r\n\r\nsuch  people, the policy implemented is  different\r\n\r\nfrom what is envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious deviation. This goes to\r\n\r\nshow   that   when   certain  officers   implement\r\n\r\nGovernment policy, they do so not in the interests\r\n\r\nof  the country or to meet the requirement of  the\r\n\r\nage,  but  according to their personal  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies. They totally disregard the policy of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this we can see that the Minister in\r\n\r\ncharge  should  seriously reconsider  how  best  to\r\n\r\npromote our cultural policy. In fact, I should  say\r\n\r\nthat in the Adjournment debate in this House on 5th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1966, I made ten proposals on the  matter\r\n\r\nof  promoting  culture in nation building.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister has the time, he can refer to my speech to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  any  use can be  made  of  these  ten\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two suggestions to make here. First, we\r\n\r\nshould  organise  a  large-scale cultural  festival\r\n\r\nevery year to enable our youths to perform cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  for mutual emulation and study  by  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races. Second, a certain  professor  has\r\n\r\nrecently   suggested   the   establishment   of   a\r\n\r\nscholarship for cultural pursuits. I think this  is\r\n\r\na  very good suggestion. I wonder what the Minister\r\n\r\nthinks  of  it. If we can introduce this award  for\r\n\r\nnational cultural pursuits, then we will be able to\r\n\r\nhelp cultural activists to create more artistry  in\r\n\r\ntheir  songs, novels, dramas, and other  fields  of\r\n\r\ncultural activity. Thus they will be able to enrich\r\n\r\nthe spiritual life of our people and make Singapore\r\n\r\nvery  much advanced in culture. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider my suggestions seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Sembawang has raised a  number\r\n\r\nof points on cultural policy. I would like to raise\r\n\r\na few points too. These relate to what the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture should do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that it has for a very long time not done\r\n\r\nmuch.  Singapore is not a cultural desert. Quite  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  people are engaged  in  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and  what they produce  is  of  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard.  But  the Ministry has not established  a\r\n\r\nclose and proper relationship with cultural workers\r\n\r\nin  improving our culture that is more  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  policy of our Government.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould set up something like an Academy of Arts  so\r\n\r\nthat the people can engage in cultural activities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: other than the artistes\r\n\r\nand  actors who have gone abroad, many of our local\r\n\r\ntalent  have not been able to go abroad to  further\r\n\r\ntheir  artistic pursuits because of their financial\r\n\r\nlimitations.  They have to rely  on  self-study.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this type of people - actors, artistes,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  who are quite large in numbers  -  can  at\r\n\r\npresent have an opportunity to express their talent\r\n\r\nonly in a limited way in the field of culture. They\r\n\r\ndo  not  have much scope for expression, much  less\r\n\r\nachieve the complete fruition of their talents.  As\r\n\r\na  result,  we  have lost a great number  of  these\r\n\r\ntalented people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, those amateurs who are engaged\r\n\r\nin  the  activities staged at the National Theatre.\r\n\r\nVery  often  they collect a few dollars'  transport\r\n\r\nallowance whenever there is a rehearsal., If  there\r\n\r\nis  no rehearsal, they do not get any allowance for\r\n\r\ntransport.  They are only amateurs.  Most  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  their own jobs. Their working hours are long,\r\n\r\nand  they  do not have an opportunity to engage  in\r\n\r\nthese cultural activities properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Culture should set up\r\n\r\nsomething  like  a  national  institute  for   our\r\n\r\nartistes, so that those people engaged in  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities can become professionals. They can  also\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on their own fields, such  as  how  to\r\n\r\npromote the standard of culture and how to give the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore a more colourful  and  richer\r\n\r\ncultural life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Very often these days, the\r\n\r\nprogrammes we see on T.V. are, in fact, part of our\r\n\r\ncultural activities. These programmes have not been\r\n\r\nproperly  organised, and the cultural workers  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  given an opportunity to develop  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate talent. They become the tools and are at the\r\n\r\nbeck  and  call  of  businessmen who  organise  the\r\n\r\nshows.  If  they are not wanted, they  are  chucked\r\n\r\ninto  the  rubbish  bin. I am afraid  these  people\r\n\r\ncannot survive on stage for very long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to express is that\r\n\r\nmany  of our talented people have not been properly\r\n\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of Culture very often makes  use  of\r\n\r\nartistes   and  singers  from  abroad   for   their\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and  they have been  elevated  to  the\r\n\r\nheight of heaven. Very often these foreign artistes\r\n\r\nare the main attraction of the shows, and the local\r\n\r\npeople   are  only  supporting  stars.   I   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand the logic of this. We are not doing  our\r\n\r\nbest  to  help local artistes express  and  develop\r\n\r\ntheir  talents. This is contrary to what we  should\r\n\r\ndo to develop fully our local talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suggested just now that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture should set up an institute for our artistes\r\n\r\nso  that they can fully develop their ability.  Our\r\n\r\nT.V. producers  can then make use  of  their  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of ability. In this way our T.V. viewers\r\n\r\nwill receive proper educational and cultural values\r\n\r\nfrom  these programmes. Otherwise we will only hear\r\n\r\nforeign stars singing such songs as \"I am not going\r\n\r\nhome  today,\" which is a popular Chinese song. Very\r\n\r\noften we see the two comedians, the fat one and the\r\n\r\nthin  one, on T.V. Other than these, we do not have\r\n\r\nvery  many  programmes.  I am  afraid  the  present\r\n\r\nprogrammes are rather empty in cultural  values.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister will be able to do something  in\r\n\r\nthis direction and give an opportunity to our local\r\n\r\nartistes to develop their talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Ministry of Culture was set up in\r\n\r\n1959.  At  that time it was given a lot of  duties,\r\n\r\nfor  example, to develop a sense of patriotism, and\r\n\r\nto  instil in the people a higher set of values  in\r\n\r\norder  to eliminate racial prejudices, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAll these are but beautiful and grand talk and very\r\n\r\npleasing to the ear. But what I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nis:  what has the Ministry of Culture done  in  all\r\n\r\nthese  years? What contribution has it made towards\r\n\r\nits  objectives, especially in the  field  of  mass\r\n\r\neducation? What has it done to instil in our people\r\n\r\na higher set of values?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to know what\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture has contributed in the past\r\n\r\n10 years\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ntowards  the  cultivation of  spiritual  values?

I remember the former  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture,  who  is  now  the  Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs,  said  in 1960, \"Man is a product  of  his\r\n\r\nculture.  Whether one is a Chinese, Malay,  Jew  or\r\n\r\nAmerican   is   largely  the  result  of   cultural\r\n\r\nconditioning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after all these 10 years, what\r\n\r\nsort  of cultural environment have we given to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore? How are we going to create the\r\n\r\nsort of environment that a Singaporean should have?\r\n\r\nOf  course, the Acting Minister for Culture can say\r\n\r\nthat  we cannot suppress whatever the people  would\r\n\r\nlike to have, such as the new style of soul dances.\r\n\r\nBut  if  we  just  allow things  of  this  sort  to\r\n\r\ncontinue, and if the Government can only  give  our\r\n\r\npeople  this, then we have wasted all  the  efforts\r\n\r\nmade over the past 10 years. We have prolonged this\r\n\r\nunhealthy life of the people for 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and during the time when we were in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the Ministry of Culture  did  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nuseful  things  in promoting some of our  political\r\n\r\ntasks.  Very often Government departments paid  too\r\n\r\nmuch  attention to politics and, as a result,  they\r\n\r\nneglected their other duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am ashamed that very often I\r\n\r\nhear my friends describe the people of Singapore as\r\n\r\nbeing  too materialistic. If we continue like this,\r\n\r\nwe will become soulless animals. What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nwe   hear   and   talk   about   is   materialistic\r\n\r\nachievements.  For example, how  to  climb  up  and\r\n\r\nstruggle for greater materialistic success.  If  we\r\n\r\njust concentrate on materialistic pursuits, we will\r\n\r\ngradually   and   slowly  lose   the   ability   to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate between right and wrong. We will begin\r\n\r\nto   disregard   the  fundamental   principles   of\r\n\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the time has come for a change.\r\n\r\nI  would like to ask the Minister for Culture  what\r\n\r\nhe   has  prepared  for  the  new  environment  for\r\n\r\nSingapore. What sort of adjustment has he  made  to\r\n\r\nour  cultural  policy? I would also  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry of Culture has any new set  of\r\n\r\nobjectives  in giving our people a new  and  richer\r\n\r\nspiritual  life, and what adjustments it  has  made\r\n\r\nsince  last  May  in  cultivating  right  attitudes\r\n\r\ntowards our neighbours amongst our people.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will pay a great deal more  attention\r\n\r\nto  these matters, because we cannot afford to make\r\n\r\nmistakes,  to go wrong. I hope he will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncorrect any past mistakes because we cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  go  wrong.  I am sure our acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  who,  in the last ten years or  more,  has\r\n\r\nworked  closely  with our people and  has  actively\r\n\r\ntried  to  understand their aspirations,  will  not\r\n\r\nhimself  be  affected  by  the  new  style  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical arena. I am sure he understands it better\r\n\r\nthan  I  do.  I  hope he can express  our  cultural\r\n\r\npolicy better and achieve better results, because I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that, going on his past history,  he  will\r\n\r\nnot  do  anything wrong to the people. He will  not\r\n\r\nlet  them  down. He will not do anything to  please\r\n\r\nthe new style or the new fashion in our culture. He\r\n\r\nwill  only  do  what he absolutely believes  to  be\r\n\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch upon the environment\r\n\r\nof  our writers. Writers in any progressive society\r\n\r\nhave  their  status. In Singapore we believe  in  a\r\n\r\nprogressive  and democratic policy. Writers  should\r\n\r\nhave  their rightful place in our society, but  the\r\n\r\nfact  is  that  this  is not  so.  Let  me  draw  a\r\n\r\ncomparison. Whether a person is just a singer or  a\r\n\r\nsinging star,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhe  is still a person who sings. In one case, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  local singer or singing star and he  cut  a\r\n\r\nlove song record. High officials in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  gave a press conference for  him.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  Mr Speaker, Sir, a well  recognised,\r\n\r\nvery  capable  and intelligent writer  had  to  run\r\n\r\naround  looking for advertisements so as to publish\r\n\r\nhis  works  and  make  a cultural  contribution  to\r\n\r\nsociety.  This  writer is not  given  his  rightful\r\n\r\nplace  in  our democratic and progressive  society.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  history has witnessed the  rise  and\r\n\r\nfall  of  great powers and writers were responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  fall  of some regimes. Are  we  going  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an  environment  of  discontent  among  our\r\n\r\nwriters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the Minister to take immediate steps to\r\n\r\nraise the social status of our writers. I have  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions to make. I will not say that they  will\r\n\r\ncompletely solve our problem, but at least  I  hope\r\n\r\nour  acting Minister for Culture will consider them\r\n\r\ncarefully.  I  am sure he can, with his  experience\r\n\r\nand expertise, come up with better suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my suggestions is the granting of honours\r\n\r\nto  people  of distinction in cultural  fields.  We\r\n\r\nhave  all sorts of awards, for example, the  Public\r\n\r\nService Award, the Sportsman of the Year Award  and\r\n\r\nvarious  other  kinds of awards. But  what  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  to raise the social  status  of  our\r\n\r\ncultural  workers and writers? Are we going  to  do\r\n\r\nnothing, to leave them out of all these? We  should\r\n\r\ngive them some sort of award too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that the Ministry should\r\n\r\nset  up  a publication bureau to help local writers\r\n\r\npublish their works. This will also help us in  our\r\n\r\ntask  of nation building. Of course, I cannot shift\r\n\r\neverything on to the shoulders of the Government. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  writers themselves must also bear  some\r\n\r\nshare  of this responsibility. They should organise\r\n\r\nthemselves and I am sure some of them have  already\r\n\r\ndone  so.  In  this way, they can  consolidate  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  their position, exert an  influence  on\r\n\r\nour  society, and strengthen the democratic  forces\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, scholars and writers are\r\n\r\nimportant  people.  I  am  sure  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture   will  do  his  best  to  cater  for   the\r\n\r\naspirations of our scholars and writers. I hope  he\r\n\r\nwill  do  something for them so that they can  take\r\n\r\ntheir rightful place in society, and to thank  them\r\n\r\nfor carrying out their sacred duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I made my\r\n\r\nspeech just now, did I say something about the T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes?

I cannot agree with the statement  that\r\n\r\nthis represents the cultural life of our people. In\r\n\r\nfact,   this  should  not  represent  the  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I said\r\n\r\nwas  completely different from what the Member  has\r\n\r\nsaid.

I  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  speak on subhead 1371, and although  she\r\n\r\nhas  already mentioned T.V. programmes, I would  like\r\n\r\nto add some of my own views now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, television in Singapore today\r\n\r\nis  a very popular form of entertainment. According\r\n\r\nto  statistics, at the end of 1967  the  number  of\r\n\r\ntelevision licences exceeded 80,000. Up to now  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people who have purchased television sets\r\n\r\nhas increased quite a lot. Almost all the community\r\n\r\ncentres  are  equipped  with  television  sets   to\r\n\r\nprovide   entertainment  for  our   people.   Since\r\n\r\ntelevision sets are so widely\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nscattered  in our country, we can see how important\r\n\r\ntelevision  programmes are in our  task  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding. The arrangement, design and production of\r\n\r\nour  T.V. programmes will exercise a great deal  of\r\n\r\ninfluence,  either directly or indirectly,  on  our\r\n\r\npeople,  so  they  must  be  undertaken  with   the\r\n\r\ngreatest care and in keeping with the values we are\r\n\r\ntrying  to inculcate at this initial stage  of  our\r\n\r\nnation   building.  We  should  not  go  about   it\r\n\r\nhaphazardly.   We   should   not   concentrate   on\r\n\r\nentertainment  alone. We should  pay  attention  to\r\n\r\nthis  problem  - how are we going to encourage  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  play  their  part  in  nation  building\r\n\r\nthrough  the aid of these programmes?  There  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  that  in  everything  we  do,  the\r\n\r\nbeginning is the most difficult. The task of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  is in the initial stage and it depends  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal upon our work. We can depend  upon  our\r\n\r\nhuman  resources only in this task. The  foundation\r\n\r\nand  development of nation building will depend  on\r\n\r\nthe  incessant efforts and hard work of our people.\r\n\r\nThus  will  our nation building grow, flourish  and\r\n\r\nbear fruit. If our people do not work hard, if they\r\n\r\nare  weak, slow and unintelligent, and indulge  all\r\n\r\nthe time only in unhealthy activities, then I think\r\n\r\neven  if  we have the best plans in the world,  our\r\n\r\nnation  building  will  completely  collapse.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, what I mean to say is that Television\r\n\r\nSingapore    should   not   produce   entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes  only. These must go hand in  hand  with\r\n\r\nother  kinds  of programmes in our task  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our Radio and Television Singapore have\r\n\r\nfailed to do this. The programmes they produce  are\r\n\r\nsimply  for the sake of entertainment and are  full\r\n\r\nof  unhealthy sounds. These programmes are  popular\r\n\r\nwith  our young people and small children, so  much\r\n\r\nso  that they are completely absorbed in them. Even\r\n\r\nin  their  dreams,  as  the Member  for  Delta  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  they will utter sentences  like,  \"I\r\n\r\nwill  never forget you,\" and \"I am not coming  home\r\n\r\ntoday.\"  Some of them do the twist or the  Hawaiian\r\n\r\ndance on their beds. If we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nallow  this state of affairs to continue, then  our\r\n\r\nyoung people who will be the future pillars of  our\r\n\r\nsociety will become decadent and rotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have seen certain countries\r\n\r\nproducing  programmes  of recreational  value,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  programmes of songs and dances. And  they\r\n\r\nmake  use  of them to educate, guide and  encourage\r\n\r\nthe people to play their part in the task of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  how to make their country  stronger  and\r\n\r\nmore  prosperous, and how to love and protect their\r\n\r\ncountry.  These programmes have not only  made  the\r\n\r\ncountry  more lively and energetic, but  they  have\r\n\r\nalso  enriched the people's lives. This is  what  I\r\n\r\nmean  when  I  say  that  entertainment  programmes\r\n\r\nshould  also  go  hand in hand with  programmes  on\r\n\r\nnation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are democratic and pragmatic socialists.\r\n\r\nWe  believe in the truth of the Chinese saying that\r\n\r\nwe  must  learn from the good points of  others  so\r\n\r\nthat we can improve ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the\r\n\r\nprogramme   Woman's  World  over   Radio   and   on\r\n\r\nTelevision  Singapore. The items in this  programme\r\n\r\ncover cookery, dress-making, flower arrangement and\r\n\r\napplication  of cosmetics. I do not see  how  these\r\n\r\ntopics  are going to encourage our women folk,  who\r\n\r\nnumber  almost one million, in the task  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding, and to tackle our challenging and  trying\r\n\r\nera.  Furthermore, I have my doubts  whether  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  can  raise  the social  values  of  our\r\n\r\nwomen.  I  think the producers of these  programmes\r\n\r\nwill  only  tie our women down. As such, fifty  per\r\n\r\ncent of the motivating force of our country will be\r\n\r\ntied  down in the kitchen and in the bedroom.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe want to encourage our women to stand by the side\r\n\r\nof  the  men  and play their part in  the  task  of\r\n\r\nnation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  programme called  Breakfast  Bulletin\r\n\r\nwhich  is  broadcast at 7.10 a.m. every morning.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the time allotted to it is too short\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand  it is impossible to give a full report of  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  proceedings in this  programme.  The\r\n\r\nacting  Minister for Culture may say  that  a  full\r\n\r\nreport of the parliamentary debates is broadcast in\r\n\r\nthe evening. But then most people watch T.V. in the\r\n\r\nevening  and  may  not listen  to  this  programme.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I urge the Minister to extend  the  time\r\n\r\nfor Breakfast Bulletin, so that our people may know\r\n\r\nall about the parliamentary debates. The Ministers'\r\n\r\nand  Parliamentary Secretaries' speeches are  fully\r\n\r\nbroadcast,  but  the speeches of  Backbenchers  are\r\n\r\nnot.  Therefore,  the Minister should  request  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Broadcasting  to  broadcast  all  the\r\n\r\nspeeches of Back-benchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore is a small country, it\r\n\r\nhas many industries. We should inform our people of\r\n\r\nthe  success of our industrialisation programme and\r\n\r\nthe  progress  of  our country. In  this  way,  our\r\n\r\npeople  will  know what is happening in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   appropriate  programme  to  do  this  is  the\r\n\r\nBreakfast Bulletin. Therefore, if the time of  this\r\n\r\nprogramme is extended, these items can be included.\r\n\r\nI   have   been   informed  that  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nauthorities  have allotted only a limited  time  to\r\n\r\nBreakfast  Bulletin. I do not know  on  what  basis\r\n\r\nthey  allot  times  for programmes.  The  Breakfast\r\n\r\nBulletin   should   not  only  include   Ministers'\r\n\r\nspeeches,  but  should  also  include  speeches  of\r\n\r\nBackbenchers.  In  this way, the people  will  know\r\n\r\nwhat  their M.P.s have said in Parliament.  And  in\r\n\r\nthe elections, they will know what their M.P.s have\r\n\r\ndone  for  them. Otherwise they may ask, what  have\r\n\r\ntheir  M.P.s done for them if they do not  hear  or\r\n\r\nread about their speeches in Parliament?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Toon Boon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr, Speaker, Sir, I believe there are many\r\n\r\nMembers who wish to speak on Broadcasting.

Culture should be coordinated with\r\n\r\npolitical development in order to enrich the\r\n\r\nspiritual lives of our people and also to educate,\r\n\r\ninspire and instil enthusiasm in them through\r\n\r\nartistic forms, especially at this juncture of\r\n\r\nnation building. The people are entitled to\r\n\r\nhealthy cultural activities in order to encourage\r\n\r\nthem to take part in nation building. Radio and\r\n\r\ntelevision are important media for educating our\r\n\r\npeople. However, it is regrettable that our radio\r\n\r\nand television programmes have not followed a\r\n\r\nspecific cultural policy. If there is any policy\r\n\r\nat all, it is the policy of the Director of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting himself. Sir, if the Director is well\r\n\r\nversed in culture, then there will not be so many\r\n\r\ncomplaints. Unfortunately, in the past few years\r\n\r\nthe incumbents in this post have been civil\r\n\r\nservants and they are not cultural workers. In\r\n\r\nother words, they do not specialised in cultural\r\n\r\nactivities. Hence, in the last few years, radio\r\n\r\nand television programmes have not been able to\r\n\r\nkeep up with our political development. Although\r\n\r\nRadio and Television Singapore has made\r\n\r\nimprovements recently, most of the programmes, as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar has said, consist of\r\n\r\ndecadent songs. Some comic sketches are\r\n\r\nmeaningless and vulgar. Television has degenerated\r\n\r\ninto a night club where singers perform their art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also note that many members\r\n\r\nof  the  audience  made criticisms  and  suggested\r\n\r\nimprovements  to  R.T.S. in the press.  At  first,\r\n\r\nthey  were replied to. However, lately R.T.S. has\r\n\r\nstopped  replying to the complaints made.  Instead\r\n\r\nthey have even blamed the editors of the press for\r\n\r\ncriticising   the   Television  and   Broadcasting\r\n\r\nServices\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand for publishing letters of complaints. Not only\r\n\r\nhave  they  not  accepted the  criticisms  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  but they have also reprimanded those  who\r\n\r\nmade such complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is that too many\r\n\r\nadvertising programmes are shown on T.V.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  sense  exercised in selection. The  impression\r\n\r\ngiven  is that Television Singapore has now become\r\n\r\na  forum where commercial enterprises may make use\r\n\r\nof T.V. to sell their products. We must not give too\r\n\r\nmuch  thought to making money in this manner.  Our\r\n\r\nT.V. policy should not be based solely  on  making\r\n\r\nprofit out of commercial advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed their discontent\r\n\r\nwith  our  cultural policy. I agree with them.  We\r\n\r\nare  trying to instil a sense of patriotism in our\r\n\r\nstudents  and build a rugged society. However,  in\r\n\r\ncultural matters we are not giving our people  the\r\n\r\nright  material.  This will  have  a  demoralising\r\n\r\neffect  on  them. In view of what I have  said,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will  seriously  review   the\r\n\r\ncontent   of   our   T.V.   programmes   and   radio\r\n\r\nbroadcasting. He should overhaul the whole  policy\r\n\r\nand  keep  it  in line with our policy  on  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

Sir, we were told  that  in\r\n\r\ncommemoration  of  the 150th  anniversary  of  the\r\n\r\nfounding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nof   Singapore,   stereophonic   broadcasting   was\r\n\r\ncommenced  last year. I am told that  in  order  to\r\n\r\nreceive  stereophonic broadcasts, the radio  should\r\n\r\nbe  fitted  with an attachment known as a  decoder.\r\n\r\nUnless  this is done, no stereophonic sound can  be\r\n\r\nheard.  Can the Minister inform this House  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Broadcasting  Department has  ascertained  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of receivers in Singapore which are  fitted\r\n\r\nwith  this  device  in order to enjoy  stereophonic\r\n\r\nmusic? If it has not undertaken such a survey,  can\r\n\r\nit do so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that there are very few radio\r\n\r\nsets  in Singapore equipped to receive stereophonic\r\n\r\nmusic.  I  am, therefore, wondering if  the  amount\r\n\r\nthat   we  have  spent  on  the  purchase  of   the\r\n\r\nstereophonic  equipment has been worthwhile.  I  am\r\n\r\nalso told that nowadays dealers who sell radio sets\r\n\r\nequipped   with  decoders  remove  the  attachments\r\n\r\nbefore  they  sell  the radio  sets  in  order,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to sell the decoders separately  and  make\r\n\r\nmore money. I am told that sometimes a decoder  may\r\n\r\ncost  as  much  as  $50.  I  am  wondering  if  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Department can undertake to  see  that\r\n\r\nwhere   radio   sets  are  already  equipped   with\r\n\r\ndecoders, such decoders are not removed before  the\r\n\r\nsale  of the radio sets to the public. If there  is\r\n\r\nno  such tampering, the people who buy modern radio\r\n\r\nreceivers  can enjoy stereophonic music  which  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Department is able to produce now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Broadcasting Department has expanded very\r\n\r\nrapidly  during the last few years. However,  going\r\n\r\nthrough the estimates, I see that the establishment\r\n\r\nhas  not  kept  pace  with  the  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nservices that it is trying to provide. As a result,\r\n\r\nthe services are not very satisfactory. We hear  of\r\n\r\ninnumerable  mistakes  both  from  the   Television\r\n\r\nService  and the Broadcasting Service.  There  have\r\n\r\nbeen  no less than three instances in the last year\r\n\r\nor  so  when I myself heard broadcasts of  speeches\r\n\r\nattributed to me when, in actual fact, they  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  attributed to my colleague, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson. I do not mind if what the Member for\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnson  has said is attributed to me. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what his feelings will be. What is  a  little\r\n\r\nmore  disturbing  is the fact that  the  Television\r\n\r\nService  and Broadcasting Service could not  differentiate between a Back-bencher on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  a Parliamentary Secretary on the  other\r\n\r\nside. Recently, the Member for Moulmein had a  bash\r\n\r\nat  the  government and he was referred to  as  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary having a dig at Government.\r\n\r\nMy  sympathy  is  with the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nreferred   to  for  the  embarrassment  which   the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department caused  him.  Mistakes  of\r\n\r\nthis   nature  should  not  be  made  that  easily.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the staff in the Broadcasting  Department\r\n\r\nmay  be overworked, I think they should be a little\r\n\r\nmore  careful  when making reports of this  nature.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister made a speech recently  in  Joo\r\n\r\nSeng  Community Centre. However, the very next  day\r\n\r\nit  was  reported that he made a speech at the  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  Community Centre. I know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nJoo Chiat Community Centre is in your constituency.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  is  better known  than  the  Joo  Seng\r\n\r\nCommunity  Centre. Anyway, I do not know  how  this\r\n\r\nsimple mistake could have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister has noted these matters. I\r\n\r\nhope he will take the necessary precautions to  see\r\n\r\nthat  mistakes of this kind are not repeated often.\r\n\r\nIt  is  understandable if it is made once or twice,\r\n\r\nbut when the Member for Anson says something and my\r\n\r\nphotograph appears on T.V., I begin to wonder  when\r\n\r\nI have said these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has referred just now to\r\n\r\nthe  frequency of advertisements on T.V. and  that\r\n\r\ntoo  much  consideration should  not  be  given  to\r\n\r\ncommercial  advertising. The frequency  with  which\r\n\r\nthey  interfere  with  the regular  programmes  can\r\n\r\nsometimes  be  very upsetting. I  do  not  see  any\r\n\r\nreason  why  the  advertisements  cannot  be  shown\r\n\r\neither  at the beginning or the end of a programme.\r\n\r\nTo  show advertisements every five minutes will not\r\n\r\nmake  people  enjoy watching the T.V. programme  as\r\n\r\nmuch as they would like to. Sometimes it helps,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, if one is going for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\ndrink  when there is an advertisement on,  but  not\r\n\r\neverybody  would  like  to  do  that.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will take this into consideration and look\r\n\r\ninto  the  possibility  of showing  commercials  in\r\n\r\nbetween  programmes and not during  the  programmes\r\n\r\nevery five or ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is selectiveness in\r\n\r\ncommercial advertisements. We have heard so much of\r\n\r\ncigarettes and the spread of cancer and  so  on.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether it is worth the amount we make  from\r\n\r\ncommercial  advertisements to  continue  with  this\r\n\r\nform  of  advertising cigarettes. In  almost  every\r\n\r\nprogramme   at   one  time  or   another   we   see\r\n\r\nadvertisements  for  cigarettes  staring   at   us.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly,  Sir,  the tunes  that  they  use  in\r\n\r\nadvertising  cigarettes are so catchy that  I  have\r\n\r\nheard children sing them. Sir, let us not waste too\r\n\r\nmuch  on this aspect of commercialisation. I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  we  be a little  more  selective  in\r\n\r\ncommercial advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F.

With regard to the points  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen   raised   by  Members  about   relating   our\r\n\r\nbroadcasting policy to national purposes,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that greater attention be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  what I might describe  as  cross-cultural education. By this I imply that I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  sufficient  is  being  done  to  familiarise\r\n\r\npeople  of  one cultural background with the  forms\r\n\r\nand expressions of another cultural background. For\r\n\r\nexample,  it would be interesting to know how  much\r\n\r\nIndian   music   and   dance,  Chinese   opera   or\r\n\r\ntraditional Malay art is being put across to  those\r\n\r\nwho  view programmes in the English medium. I think\r\n\r\nthis  kind of activity would be a big step  forward\r\n\r\nin raising the cultural\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlevel of programmes about which we have had several\r\n\r\nsuggestions from the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another point to make. It is not enough\r\n\r\njust  to give a presentation of a bare performance.\r\n\r\nThere should be an explanation as well. In this way\r\n\r\npeople will find it easier to understand, and, with\r\n\r\nthis   understanding,  there  may  come  a   deeper\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  the programme, so  that  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis  we  hope that the climate may be appropriate\r\n\r\nfor   patronage  and  encouragement  of   all   the\r\n\r\nperforming arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point has also been raised regarding commercial\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  I would like to add  my  voice  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  what the Member for Telok Blangah  has\r\n\r\nsaid,   that  consideration  should  be  given   to\r\n\r\nremoving   all   commercial   advertisements    for\r\n\r\ncigarettes  from  the air. I  do  feel  that  these\r\n\r\nadvertisements  are  couched  in  such  persuasive,\r\n\r\nseductive and alluring terms that they may have  an\r\n\r\neffect  on  those of our people who  have  not  yet\r\n\r\nacquired the habit of smoking. With regard to those\r\n\r\npeople  who have already become addicts, I  do  not\r\n\r\nsuppose  much  can  be done. But  thinking  of  the\r\n\r\nyounger  people  I suggest it would  be  better  to\r\n\r\nbalance the health of the young people against  the\r\n\r\nrevenue    that    we   get   out   of    cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say that since we have\r\n\r\nresearch officers in the Ministry of Culture,  some\r\n\r\nattempt should be made to find out what the  people\r\n\r\nreally  think about our programmes -  to  find  out\r\n\r\ntheir tastes, and what the audience-rating is like.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way  we can provide them with  what  they\r\n\r\nwant.  And  if  what they want is healthy,  we  can\r\n\r\nprovide  it; if not, we can devise some  method  of\r\n\r\neducating   our  listeners  by  giving  them   more\r\n\r\ndesirable programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me permission\r\n\r\nto speak.

Many people  dare\r\n\r\nnot  watch this kind of films. This means that they\r\n\r\nhave  no  spiritual food to feed on. It seems  that\r\n\r\nthis   is   due  to  a  lack  of  healthy  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  in our country. Therefore, I  sincerely\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to import certain  films  from\r\n\r\nChina  to  give  Chinese viewers an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nwatch  them. Films from China should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe  imported.  We  should  not  be  afraid  of  the\r\n\r\npropaganda influence of these films, because  these\r\n\r\nfilms  have  a  healthy cultural  and  recreational\r\n\r\ncontent. If they smack of Communist propaganda,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  must  not import  them.  I  think  our\r\n\r\nenlightened  Minister for Culture  should  consider\r\n\r\nthis, otherwise he will die, and I will also die, a\r\n\r\nspiritual  death.  Why? Because we  lack  spiritual\r\n\r\nfood.  Therefore, spiritual food is very  essential\r\n\r\nto our cultural life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on fire crackers on\r\n\r\nChap Goh Meh and Chinese New Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, what have fire crackers to\r\n\r\ndo with culture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, they have\r\n\r\nsomething  to  do with culture.

I appreciate the concern\r\n\r\nexpressed by Members on programmes which do not\r\n\r\neffectively contribute to a sense of participation\r\n\r\nin national construction and development, and which\r\n\r\nlack educational and cultural values. It would\r\n\r\nappear that Members have come to this conclusion\r\n\r\npurely on the basis of local entertainment\r\n\r\nproduction, like the Chinese variety shows, and of\r\n\r\nimported films, particularly those which depict\r\n\r\ncrime, violence and sex. However, before I deal\r\n\r\nwith these criticisms, may I be permitted to put in\r\n\r\nproper perspective the general planning and\r\n\r\npresentation of programmes which will have the\r\n\r\ndesired psychological and sociological impact?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme structure is broadly divided into\r\n\r\nthree  main groups, namely, information, education,\r\n\r\nand   entertainment.  Information   and   education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are of two categories. One category  is\r\n\r\nour  own  production,  and the  other  category  is\r\n\r\nforeign production. Our own production covers  such\r\n\r\nitems   as   news,  social  and  current   affairs,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  children  and  youths,  programmes\r\n\r\nespecially designed for women, programmes on music,\r\n\r\nliterary and art appreciation and criticism,  etc.,\r\n\r\nand  finally, sports programmes. It is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  itemise the programmes in detail  but,\r\n\r\nvery  broadly,  social  and current  affairs  would\r\n\r\ninclude  topics on Singapore's development, debates\r\n\r\nand forums on various matters of national interest,\r\n\r\nopinions  and  discussions,  and  interviews   with\r\n\r\nprominent personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to foreign productions, films or video\r\n\r\ntapes are obtained for programmes for children,  on\r\n\r\nmusic,  literary and art appreciation, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThere  are also programmes on general matters  such\r\n\r\nas  science, business management, foreign  affairs,\r\n\r\nanimal  life, adult education, history, and so  on.\r\n\r\nEntertainment programmes involve drama,  the  arts,\r\n\r\nand variety shows, and they\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\ncomprise both local and foreign productions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above prospectus of the programmes,\r\n\r\nMembers will appreciate that every effort is  being\r\n\r\nmade  to  achieve  an  overall  balanced  programme\r\n\r\nstructure. It is not entirely true that  all  local\r\n\r\nand  imported  items lack cultural  or  educational\r\n\r\nvalue.  Members  seem  to  have  arrived  at   this\r\n\r\nconclusion  by  merely  pin-pointing  the   Chinese\r\n\r\nvariety  show.  I  agree that this  show  does  not\r\n\r\npossess   either  a  cultural  or  an   educational\r\n\r\nbackground,  as its purposes is merely  to  provide\r\n\r\npure  entertainment. Some of the songs and sketches\r\n\r\nleave much to be desired, because of the suggestive\r\n\r\ncontent,  and  so  are  the  dances  in  which  the\r\n\r\nparticipants are sometimes inadequately attired. In\r\n\r\nso  far  as  the songs are concerned, Members  will\r\n\r\nappreciate that we have to depend to a large extent\r\n\r\non imported material. Until we are in a position to\r\n\r\nproduce  our own songs of good quality, however,  I\r\n\r\nhave instructed the producers to exercise more care\r\n\r\nin  the  selection and production of items in  this\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the present inadequacies in the\r\n\r\noverall  programme structure arise mainly from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there  is a paucity of locally-produced\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of songs, dances, plays, and  sketches,\r\n\r\nwith a cultural or educational theme. It is through\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes that we can inculcate a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging and a sense of participation in  national\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out the existing\r\n\r\ninadequacies  to my officials who are  now  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess   of   reviewing   and   reorganising   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  the  current  year.  There   are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  limitations at the  moment  in  producing\r\n\r\nthese  types  of programmes because,  unlike  other\r\n\r\ncountries  where  professional  talent  is  on  tap\r\n\r\neasily,  we  in Singapore do not have an  organised\r\n\r\npool of talent which can be easily tapped for radio\r\n\r\nand T.V. purposes. There is a lack of creative skills\r\n\r\nfor  composing  music, writing plays and  sketches,\r\n\r\nand  producing  dances. If  there  are  more  local\r\n\r\nwriters and composers with creative\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nskills,  who could produce work reflecting national\r\n\r\nand  cultural values, we could get a greater supply\r\n\r\nof suitable material for such programmes. There is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an urgent need of our local writers  and\r\n\r\ncomposers to produce more plays, songs and  dances.\r\n\r\nDramatic  societies, music and dance  schools,  and\r\n\r\nother  cultural organisations should  come  forward\r\n\r\nand  actively participate in the production of such\r\n\r\nprogrammes. This would facilitate the production of\r\n\r\nprogrammes of an aesthetic and cultural value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to address some caution in\r\n\r\nthis   regard.   R.T.S. is   not   a   commercial\r\n\r\norganisation  with  monetary profit  as  the  prime\r\n\r\nobjective.  It is a public service and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsubject   to  limitations  of  funds.   Those   who\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the programmes cannot  expect  high\r\n\r\nmonetary reward. But in the interest of the  nation\r\n\r\nand,  in  particular,  in the pursuit  of  cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  I  sincerely hope that  local  talent\r\n\r\nwill  actively  co-operate  in  the  production  of\r\n\r\nbetter  and  meaningful programmes. The  result  of\r\n\r\nsuch   co-operation  would  be  of  immense  value;\r\n\r\nfirstly,  writers and artistes will find an  avenue\r\n\r\nto  display their talents and, secondly, they would\r\n\r\nhave,   through  their  works,  developed  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness and stimulated cultural values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as films are concerned, in the absence of\r\n\r\na  film  industry in Singapore, we have  to  import\r\n\r\nforeign films in selecting films, care is taken  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  those  which  over-emphasise  crime,\r\n\r\nviolence  and sex are not screened. Films depicting\r\n\r\nhuman   interest,   like   \"Then   Came   Bronson\",\r\n\r\nadventures such as \"Tarzan\", and domestic  comedies\r\n\r\nlike \"My Three Sons\", are also screened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the review and\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of the programme structure  now  in\r\n\r\nprogress, R.T.S. should be able to correct existing\r\n\r\ninadequacies  and  provide  wholesome  and  healthy\r\n\r\nprogrammes  containing  educational  and   cultural\r\n\r\nvalues consonant with our national needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if it is time for a tea break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may carry on, Mr Wee.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Up to what\r\n\r\ntime, Mr Speaker, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> How long will you\r\n\r\ntake, Mr Wee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> I will take some\r\n\r\ntime to finish my reply, although I\r\n\r\nhave dealt with the subject of broad-casting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can carry on,\r\n\r\nMr Wee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nreally do not know how much time I\r\n\r\nhave, but I shall attempt to answer all\r\n\r\nthe queries raised by Members. As far\r\n\r\nas criticisms on the Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment are concerned, I have given\r\n\r\nthe general policy of the Department on\r\n\r\nthe proposed reconstruction and organisation of the programmes. I shall reserve\r\n\r\nthe other details later if I have the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nCrawford seems not to understand what\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture has done for\r\n\r\nthe past ten years to promote culture.\r\n\r\nHe must appreciate that we became an\r\n\r\nindependent country only a few years\r\n\r\nago. Prior to that, we had self-government status, and did not have\r\n\r\nabsolute political power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to promote culture, you\r\n\r\nhave to achieve political freedom first.\r\n\r\nWithout political freedom you will not\r\n\r\nbe able to develop your culture. That is\r\n\r\nwhy in the past we often accused the\r\n\r\ncolonial power of suppressing our culture\r\n\r\nduring  our  struggle  for  political\r\n\r\nfreedom. I think this fact will refute\r\n\r\nthe Member for Crawford's allegation\r\n\r\nthat for the past ten years we have been\r\n\r\ntoo absorbed in the political struggle\r\n\r\nand have neglected the cutural development of our nation. Now that we have\r\n\r\nacquired our political power, that is,\r\n\r\nwe are a people of our own, we can\r\n\r\npromote our own culture. In this respect,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, may I say that we                         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare a migrant society. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nhave first to create a sense of belonging\r\n\r\namong those of our people who are\r\n\r\ncitizens of this country. Then we have\r\n\r\nto try to promote and develop a culture\r\n\r\nof our own. So I fail to understand the\r\n\r\nallegation from the Member for Crawford that in the past ten years we have\r\n\r\nnot achieved anything in this respect.\r\n\r\nCulture is not something which you can\r\n\r\ndevelop overnight. It takes years.\r\n\r\nFurther, it cannot be done on instructions or orders or policy directives from\r\n\r\nthe Government. Everyone in the country\r\n\r\nhas to co-operate, to work and to\r\n\r\ndedicate himself to the cause. Therefore\r\n\r\nit takes time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Crawford and\r\n\r\nSembawang raised the question of\r\n\r\ncultural awards. I consider this a very\r\n\r\ngood idea. Although Singapore is an\r\n\r\nindependent country, there is a relative\r\n\r\ndearth of creative cultural works in\r\n\r\nmusic, dance and literature. Before we\r\n\r\ncan consider any plans to award prizes,\r\n\r\nwe should endeavour earnestly to\r\n\r\nstimulate the growth of cultural works\r\n\r\nin various areas. Members will appreciate\r\n\r\nthat there are difficulties in the immediate implementation of a system of\r\n\r\ncultural awards. For instance, there may\r\n\r\nbe a few outstanding persons in some\r\n\r\nof the fields, and it would appear that\r\n\r\nthey would merit awards, when, in point\r\n\r\nof fact, they have very little or no\r\n\r\ncompetition to face. When more individuals  come  forward  with  high\r\n\r\nstandards, then the outstanding ones\r\n\r\nwill be forced to improve their standard,\r\n\r\nand this will make for a raising of\r\n\r\nstandards as a whole. Then there will\r\n\r\nbe competition and any awards will be\r\n\r\nmeaningful. Then again, in some fields,\r\n\r\nthe standard, as the persons themselves,\r\n\r\nI think, will readily admit, has much\r\n\r\nroom for improvement. Members will\r\n\r\nappreciate that to give an award to the\r\n\r\nbest candidate among many mediocre\r\n\r\nentries will not be a very appropriate\r\n\r\ntoken. Thirdly, such awards must be\r\n\r\nproperly organised and the inherent\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the scheme must be carefully worked out. For instance, it must\r\n\r\nbe clearly defined what standards ought\r\n\r\nto be set for each area of culture, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay qualify for such awards, distinguishing the professionals from the\r\n\r\namateurs, and the extent, the value and\r\n\r\nThe status of such awards. On balance,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I am of the opinion that there\r\n\r\nshould firstly, be general encouragement\r\n\r\nfrom the public and organisations, and\r\n\r\nfunds to improve the general standards\r\n\r\nand, secondly, when the standards have\r\n\r\ngenerally improved, appropriate schemes\r\n\r\ncan be worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to illustrate, by way of\r\n\r\nexample, what happened when the\r\n\r\nNational Library in 1968 organised on\r\n\r\nbehalf of U.N.E.S.C.O. a national\r\n\r\ncontest for award of a prize to the\r\n\r\nauthor of the best manuscript written\r\n\r\nin any of the four official languages in\r\n\r\nSingapore on a cultural, literary or\r\n\r\npopular science topic most suitable for\r\n\r\nnew reading audiences and/or children\r\n\r\nand juveniles. A sum not exceeding\r\n\r\n$1,525, representing one prize, was to\r\n\r\nbe awarded to the prize-winning author.\r\n\r\nThe response to the contest was surprisingly poor. Only a total of 15\r\n\r\nmanuscripts were received - two\r\n\r\nMalay,   five   Chinese   and   eight\r\n\r\nEnglish.  As none of the entries\r\n\r\nwas of sufficient merit, no award was\r\n\r\nreceived by any of the contestants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the object in raising\r\n\r\nthis matter is probably that cultural\r\n\r\nawards would stimulate the growth of\r\n\r\ncultural pursuits. However, from the\r\n\r\nexample of the U.N.E.S.C.O. competition, which I have just illustrated, it will\r\n\r\nbe seen that we will be putting the cart\r\n\r\nbefore the horse if, at this juncture,\r\n\r\nwe decide to give cultural awards before\r\n\r\nstandards are improved. The immediate\r\n\r\nproblem, as I see it, is one of generating\r\n\r\nthe necessary stimuli to our cultural efforts. There are, however, certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrawbacks. For example, a person may\r\n\r\nhave a flair for writing or composing\r\n\r\nmusic, but he is precluded by economic\r\n\r\nrealities from pursuing his preference.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that those\r\n\r\nwho would otherwise be able to contribute to the enrichment of cultural\r\n\r\nactivities find refuge in some other more\r\n\r\nremunerative employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of overcoming this difficulty\r\n\r\nwould be for those interested in different\r\n\r\nareas of culture to organise themselves\r\n\r\ninto working groups or associations with\r\n\r\nthe object of co-ordinating their activities\r\n\r\nand improving standards. The Ministry\r\n\r\nwill, as far as possible, assist them in\r\n\r\nsetting up such an association. Let us\r\n\r\ntake the case of writers who unfortunately have not been able to come\r\n\r\ntogether because of factionalism and\r\n\r\nunprincipled vituperation. If they avoided this, they could create an atmosphere\r\n\r\nconducive to the development of literary\r\n\r\nwork, and mass media like newspapers,\r\n\r\ntelevision and radio could be utilised\r\n\r\nto publicise their vvorks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways and means can also be found\r\n\r\nto stimulate reading habits among our\r\n\r\npeople. Wherever possible, educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions could be encouraged to use\r\n\r\nsuitable works as reading material for\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the assistance\r\n\r\nin the world will not help if the local\r\n\r\npeople do not dedicate themselves to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of cultural pursuits in\r\n\r\ndifferent areas. If this is done, then\r\n\r\nSingapore could, with the co-operation\r\n\r\nof all concerned, enhance her cultural\r\n\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to put across is not\r\n\r\nthat we do not want to encourage culture.\r\n\r\nWe want to encourage and build our own\r\n\r\nculture. Here I must say once again that\r\n\r\nthis is not the job of the Government\r\n\r\nalone, but is the work of everyone,\r\n\r\nespecially the artistes, the writers and\r\n\r\nthose who are involved in cultural work.\r\n\r\nApart from these people who are directly\r\n\r\nconcerned with cultural work, others\r\n\r\ncould also help in the development of\r\n\r\nculture. Take the Member for Crawford,\r\n\r\nfor instance. If he is really sincere in\r\n\r\nwanting to assist in the development of\r\n\r\nour culture, he could, in his capacity\r\n\r\nas adviser to his community centre, the\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee and\r\n\r\nother committees, assist cultural development in a practical way. For instance,\r\n\r\nwe have encouraged many local talents,\r\n\r\nsuch as Mr Lee Kum Sing, a well-known pianist, to put up shows and\r\n\r\nrecitals. When Mr Lee Kum Sing is\r\n\r\nperforming abroad, he is very well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nreceived. People have to pay exorbitantly  to  hear\r\n\r\nhis recitals. However, when he comes back here and,\r\n\r\nwith  our encouragement, stages a recital  at  very\r\n\r\ncheap  admission fees so that the people are  given\r\n\r\nan   opportunity  to  appreciate  his  music,   the\r\n\r\nattendance,  much  to  my disappointment,  is  very\r\n\r\npoor. This is where the Member for Crawford, as  an\r\n\r\nadvocate of the promotion of culture, can help, if\r\n\r\nhe has any function in his community centre, either\r\n\r\nin   commemoration  of  an  anniversary  or   other\r\n\r\nceremonies, I would suggest to him that, instead of\r\n\r\nwasting  his  time and money on organising  dinners\r\n\r\nand  variety shows, he could hold, say, exhibitions\r\n\r\nof  paintings  and stage serious music performances\r\n\r\nand  the  like. This would be a direct contribution\r\n\r\nto the development of our culture, because the fact\r\n\r\nis that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee, would you like to give way\r\n\r\nto Mr Low Yong Nguan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> With due respect to the\r\n\r\nMinister,  firstly, I hope he is  not  doubting  my\r\n\r\nsincerity as a Member of Parliament, because, if he\r\n\r\ndoes,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I will  of  course  take\r\n\r\nstrong  objection to it.

This concerns the setting up\r\n\r\nof a fire station in Jurong. I am sure the Minister\r\n\r\nmust  be aware that the development of Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nhas  been  very rapid. At present, there  are  more\r\n\r\nthan  200 factories in Jurong and more than  20,000\r\n\r\nresidents.  Many factories are engaged in  chemical\r\n\r\nwork, and inflammable materials are used. Jurong is\r\n\r\na big town and yet there is no fire station at all.\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in 1968, there were 25 fire\r\n\r\ncalls  in Jurong, four of which were false  alarms.\r\n\r\nIn  1969,  there were 21 fire calls, four of  which\r\n\r\nwere  false alarms.

And with the joint\r\n\r\nefforts  of  sports organisations, they  have  been\r\n\r\nlively. In this respect, the Sports Division  under\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Social Affairs has  made  a  good\r\n\r\ncontribution. Undoubtedly, the Government has tried\r\n\r\nits   best   to  promote  sports  activities.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  every  year  the  Government  has   been\r\n\r\nholding  sports  festivals in order  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  our sports. What is more laudable  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has allocated a large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  set  up  a  grand  National  Stadium  at\r\n\r\nKallang.  The foundation stone was laid in  January\r\n\r\nthis  year  by  the Minister for Finance.  On  this\r\n\r\noccasion, the Minister said that the Government had\r\n\r\nlaid down its policies on defence, sports and other\r\n\r\nactivities.  As  regards sports,  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy is to encourage more and more people to take\r\n\r\npart  in  it. The second objective is to raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of sports and athletics in order  to  win\r\n\r\nmore  international  awards and  prizes.  When  the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium is completed, we will be  able  to\r\n\r\norganise international and regional competitions to\r\n\r\npromote sports and athletics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me talk about how to raise the standard\r\n\r\nof  sports.  First  of all. I  would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the Sports Promotion Division is  able  to\r\n\r\nengage national coaches. We must engage them if  we\r\n\r\nare to raise the standard of sports. Of course,  we\r\n\r\ndo have coaches for\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbasket-ball, football and volley-ball, but they are\r\n\r\nmostly  amateur coaches whose knowledge and methods\r\n\r\nare  too  limited to be really effective.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  whether the Ministry is prepared  to\r\n\r\nengage full-time national coaches for athletics and\r\n\r\nother  sports, for example, badminton, volley-ball,\r\n\r\nand table-tennis, in order to raise the standard of\r\n\r\nthe participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved a high standard in swimming. Our\r\n\r\nswimmers   have   won   awards   in   international\r\n\r\ncompetitions. I hope they will continue to maintain\r\n\r\nthis  record.  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  has any plans to develop  further  our\r\n\r\npotential in swimming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, can the Minister inform the House whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  any  plans  to  inculcate  a  sense  of\r\n\r\npatriotism in our athletes and sportsmen? It is not\r\n\r\nenough  for  sportsmen  to excel  in  sports.  They\r\n\r\nshould have a sense of patriotism so that they  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  work  hard  to  attain  the   highest\r\n\r\npossible  standard and win honour for our  country.\r\n\r\nIf  they lack a sense of patriotism, then they will\r\n\r\ntend  to  take  things easy. They will  think  that\r\n\r\nwinning  or  losing in competition  means  nothing.\r\n\r\nThis will nullify our efforts to raise the standard\r\n\r\nof  sports. That is why I wish to know whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  any plans to inculcate  a  sense  of\r\n\r\npatriotism   and   civic   consciousness   in   our\r\n\r\nsportsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should send more teams abroad to take part in\r\n\r\ntournaments. Only in this way can we hope to  raise\r\n\r\nour  standards.  For  instance,  in  the  case   of\r\n\r\nbadminton,  there  is  only one  open  championship\r\n\r\ntournament  in Singapore a year. There are  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  occasions when our badminton players go abroad\r\n\r\nto  take part in international tournaments. Thus we\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult to raise our badminton standard.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to do so, we should send our players  to\r\n\r\ncountries like Malaysia and Indonesia and take part\r\n\r\nin  international meets. At present  the  badminton\r\n\r\nstandard  of Malaysia and Indonesia is higher  than\r\n\r\nthat of Singapore. If we can have badminton matches\r\n\r\nwith them, we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nperhaps  learn  something from  them  and  in  this\r\n\r\nmanner raise our badminton standard. May I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether  he  has  any  plans   in   this\r\n\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can he tell us when the National Sports\r\n\r\nStadium   will  be  completed  and  what  are   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  that will be provided? I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthis stadium with all its facilities will go a long\r\n\r\nway towards promoting sports in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first\r\n\r\nanswer  the  last  question  from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang. The National Stadium is scheduled to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  on  1st June, 1972. This  is  the  first\r\n\r\nphase  of  the National Sports Complex. The  second\r\n\r\nphase  will  commence in 1972 with the building  of\r\n\r\ntwo  indoor  stadium, nine tennis  courts  and  one\r\n\r\nOlympic-sized  swimming pool.  It  is  an  open-air\r\n\r\npool.  It  is hoped to commence the third phase  in\r\n\r\n1975  with  the  construction of  a  rapid  transit\r\n\r\ntransportation system, a multi-storey car park,  an\r\n\r\nentertainment centre, an exhibition centre, a first-class hotel and a floating restaurant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry is aware of the importance of\r\n\r\ninstilling a feeling of national pride, or what the\r\n\r\nMember has said a sense of patriotism, not only  in\r\n\r\nour   sportsmen  but  also  in  every  citizen   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The higher the achievement  in  sports,\r\n\r\nthe  more  will our sportsmen be proud to represent\r\n\r\nour  country.  In spite of its limited  staff,  the\r\n\r\nSports  Promotion Division is doing all it  can  to\r\n\r\npromote sports in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the means to improve the standard of\r\n\r\nsports  is by encouraging and holding international\r\n\r\nand  local competitions. For example, in the annual\r\n\r\nPesta  Sukan last year, 19 countries took part  and\r\n\r\nabout    1,027    local   and   foreign    athletes\r\n\r\nparticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of improving standards is by\r\n\r\narranging  for foreign coaches to come to Singapore\r\n\r\nto  coach our sportsmen and sportswomen. The Member\r\n\r\nhas asked whether the Ministry is thinking\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nof  engaging national coaches. In the past  we\r\n\r\ndid  engage  three coaches. One was a  professional\r\n\r\nfootball  coach. He has gone back  to  his  country\r\n\r\nnow. We still have professional coaches for basket-ball  and  rugger.  Both  of  them  are  still   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The engagement of professional  coaches\r\n\r\nis  a  very  expensive business. However,  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  arrange for them to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe have also been able to find sponsors to meet the\r\n\r\ncost  of  engaging  these  coaches.  Part  of   the\r\n\r\nexpenses have come from the Sports Promotion Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Sports Promotion Division also\r\n\r\ngives financial grants to our teams to go abroad to\r\n\r\ncompete  in  international  tournaments,   and   to\r\n\r\nassociations to invite foreign teams to compete  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Here  again  it  is  a  very  expensive\r\n\r\nbusiness.  We  would  like to send  more  teams  to\r\n\r\ncompete  in international competitions abroad,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is always the question of finance.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat  our  sportsmen and sportswomen  will  improve\r\n\r\ntheir standard by all these means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  reply,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of\r\n\r\nMadam Chan Choy Siong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1121.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan Choy Siong is not here.

All collections of tithes  have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed  to those Muslims who are  entitled  to\r\n\r\nthem under the laws of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis can play its role not only by way of\r\n\r\nenforcing  the  laws of Islam but also  by  helping\r\n\r\nthose  Muslims  who are in need of assistance.  For\r\n\r\nexample, it can increase the number of scholarships\r\n\r\nnow  being  given to Muslim students whose  parents\r\n\r\nare   poor  and  are  not  able  to  support  their\r\n\r\nchildren's education. If we study their  cases,  we\r\n\r\nwill find that many Muslim students are not able to\r\n\r\ncarry on with their education because their parents\r\n\r\nare  not able to support them even though they  can\r\n\r\nstudy. This is where the Majlis can help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the Majlis is not yet in a\r\n\r\nposition  to take on the responsibility of  looking\r\n\r\nafter pilgrimages. As a pilgrimage to Mecca is  one\r\n\r\nof  the five tenets of Islam, it is hoped that  the\r\n\r\nMajlis  will consider this matter. A pilgrimage  to\r\n\r\nMecca  requires a lot of money by way of  fares  to\r\n\r\nand  fro, and I, therefore, suggest that the Majlis\r\n\r\nestablish  a Pilgrimage Fund to assist  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  group. They can  deposit  their\r\n\r\nmoney  in  this  fund, and in this  way  many  more\r\n\r\nMuslims  will  be  able to go on a pilgrimage  from\r\n\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Minister for Social Affairs\r\n\r\ngive  guidance and assistance to the Majlis so that\r\n\r\nit  can  discharge  its duties and responsibilities\r\n\r\nfor  the well-being of the Muslims in Singapore and\r\n\r\nalso the Muslim religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 41\r\n\r\nscholarships were offered by the Majlis Ugama Islam\r\n\r\nlast year - 21 of them at university level\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand 20 at Higher School Certificate level. A sum of\r\n\r\n$3l,000 was spent out of the $49,000 set aside for\r\n\r\neducation  by the Majlis. This year the Majlis  has\r\n\r\napproved  an expenditure of $58,000 from  the  1969\r\n\r\nFitrah  collections  for  scholarships  and   other\r\n\r\npurposes related to education. There is, therefore,\r\n\r\nan  increase in the amount, and as such there  will\r\n\r\nbe  an  increase  in  the  number  of  scholarships\r\n\r\noffered to Muslim students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis will, I am sure, welcome the Member's\r\n\r\nsuggestion to increase the number of awards. It  is\r\n\r\nvery  keen  to  help children of poor parents,  but\r\n\r\npoverty alone is not a sufficient qualification for\r\n\r\na  scholarship. Applicants must convince the Majlis\r\n\r\nof  their  diligence and intelligence so  that  the\r\n\r\naward may not go to waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually there are more applicants for\r\n\r\nscholarships   than  the  number  of   scholarships\r\n\r\navailable,  and  some applicants are  bound  to  be\r\n\r\ndisappointed. The Member for Geylang Serai can rest\r\n\r\nassured  that, other things being equal, preference\r\n\r\nwill be given to the poor students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Pilgrimage Fund, Sir, the Majlis Ugama\r\n\r\nIslam is now considering introducing what is called\r\n\r\nthe  Tabong Haji Scheme, or Pilgrimage Fund Scheme.\r\n\r\nThis scheme will enable Muslims who wish to make  a\r\n\r\npilgrimage  to  Mecca to make regular contributions\r\n\r\nof  whatever sums they can afford to a fund set  up\r\n\r\nby  the  Majlis. Once the accumulated  savings  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  sufficient to enable a  contributor  to\r\n\r\nproceed on his pilgrimage, he will be allowed to do\r\n\r\nso,   and   all  necessary  arrangements  for   his\r\n\r\ndeparture and return will be taken care of  by  the\r\n\r\nMajlis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai for his confidence in the Minister in\r\n\r\nasking  him  to  take  over the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nlooking after the Majlis Ugama Islam.

Since  its\r\n\r\ninception  on 1st July 1968, it has done very  good\r\n\r\nwork, and I do not think there is any reason at all\r\n\r\nfor the Minister to take over the responsibility of\r\n\r\nlooking after the Majlis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the Minister's explanation,  and  I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n1261.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a question on fishing\r\n\r\nand  farming co-operatives. According to statistics\r\n\r\nproduced by the Primary Production Department,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  farmers  and  their  families  now   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is 170,000. Their annual produce is worth\r\n\r\n$250  million.  This shows that they  play  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  part  in  the economy  of  our  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they should receive proper treatment and\r\n\r\nprotection from the Government. But if  we  take  a\r\n\r\nclose look at their life, we will find that it  is,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, a hard one. They get up  very  early\r\n\r\nin  the  morning to work in the fields  and  return\r\n\r\nvery   late  at  sunset.  Their  income   is   just\r\n\r\nsufficient to cover their basic necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main reason for their hard\r\n\r\nlife  is  that they are exploited by the middlemen.\r\n\r\nThey put in a lot of effort to produce a crop,  but\r\n\r\nthe  profits are taken by the middlemen. The prices\r\n\r\nwe  pay in the market for their produce are two  or\r\n\r\nthree  times  higher than the prices  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen. We should pay attention to this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristic of our farming industry is the\r\n\r\nsmallness  of the farm. If a farmer transports  his\r\n\r\nproduce to a market which is a great distance away,\r\n\r\nit  will not be worth his while as there are  other\r\n\r\nfactors  involved. The best solution, I  think,  is\r\n\r\nfor the Government\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nto help the farmers set up farming co-operatives. I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what the Government has done for  them\r\n\r\nin  the past, but if I understand it correctly, the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Co-operatives is adopting  a  passive\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the farmers  in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of co-operatives for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will agree with me that our\r\n\r\nfarmers generally have a low education. They  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  set up co-operatives, but they  lack  the\r\n\r\nexperience. Therefore, Government should help  them\r\n\r\nby   organising   and   administering   these   co-operatives.  Perhaps the Registrar of Co-operatives\r\n\r\ncould  take the initiative to set up these  farming\r\n\r\nco-operatives,  and  in  the  initial  stages  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  charge of their administration. Then  the\r\n\r\nfarmers   could  gradually  take  over  these   co-operatives  in  stages. This arrangement  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   impose  an  additional  burden   on   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Co-operatives, but as it will directly\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  farming community,  I  am  sure  this\r\n\r\nsocialist   Government   will   not   neglect   its\r\n\r\nresponsibility in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been\r\n\r\nfound  that  co-operatives formed by fishermen  and\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  not been functioning as successfully\r\n\r\nas other co-operatives. Many of these co-operatives\r\n\r\nhave  been  dormant for a number of years.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthis  may  be  due to the fact that  generally  the\r\n\r\nsmall  fishermen or farmers lack capital, and  this\r\n\r\nmakes  it difficult for them to compete with  other\r\n\r\nbusiness  enterprises which have  strong  financial\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is difficult to find suitable,\r\n\r\ncapable  and  efficient personnel from amongst  the\r\n\r\nfishermen  and  farmers with the necessary  minimum\r\n\r\nstandard  of education to run co-operatives.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,   Sir,   these   co-operatives   experience\r\n\r\ndifficulty in keeping proper records of minutes  of\r\n\r\nmeetings   and   maintenance   of   accounts.   The\r\n\r\nindividualistic attitude amongst some fishermen and\r\n\r\nfarmers  is also another reason for the failure  of\r\n\r\nfishing and farming co-operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to mention these to the Member because it\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult for the Registrar to make  the\r\n\r\nfirst move if there is no reciprocal move from the\r\n\r\nother  side. However, in spite of his small staff,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  will  try his  best  to  help  the\r\n\r\nfishermen  and  farmers form new co-operatives  if\r\n\r\nthey wish.

That is exactly why I have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the initial stages  of  operating\r\n\r\nthese co-operatives should be looked after by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Co-operatives.

For  example,  the  various\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare  institutions  produce  furniture,\r\n\r\nhome  ornaments, toys, haberdashery, cakes, garden\r\n\r\nitems, and so on. I believe that if there could be\r\n\r\nco-ordination in the sale of these goods  produced\r\n\r\nby  social welfare institutions through some  sort\r\n\r\nof  a  central  agency,  it  might  contribute  to\r\n\r\ngreater success in the sale of these goods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience is that these goods are put on\r\n\r\nsale perhaps once a year in some sale of work.  It\r\n\r\nwas  through this sale of work that I came to know\r\n\r\nthat  these goods are available and of quite  good\r\n\r\nquality.  So  if  there  is  a  central  marketing\r\n\r\nagency,  so to speak, the lesson could  be  driven\r\n\r\nhome  clearly  to  the residents of  these  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  homes  that their work  has  indeed  some\r\n\r\nuseful  end.

Of this sum, $5,000 was\r\n\r\nderived from\r\n\r\nthe sale of noodles produced by the Gimson School for Boys to the\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department homes, and $5,000 from the laundry\r\n\r\nservices undertaken by the Mount Emily Girls' Home. The balance of\r\n\r\napproximately $8,800\r\n\r\nprofit was earned from the sale of handicraft articles, carpentry\r\n\r\nproducts, embroidery and sewing work by the girls and the food catering\r\n\r\nservice. From the\r\n\r\nabove, it will be noted that the two main profit-making\r\n\r\nactivities are noodle-making and laundry services. Both of these do not require the\r\n\r\nformation of\r\n\r\na private company, or what the Member for Katong has suggested, a\r\n\r\ncentral marketing agency, to boost sales, as the production capacity is\r\n\r\nquite limited. As\r\n\r\nfor the other products sold, it is unlikely that the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department\r\n\r\nhomes will be in a position to mass produce such articles. This is\r\n\r\npartly\r\n\r\nbecause of the lack of machinery equipment and partly because a\r\n\r\nlarge percentage of the residents are delinquents and wayward children.\r\n\r\nSome of the residents in the girls' homes will help produce children's wear and\r\n\r\nwoollen knit-wear on a piece rate basis for a commercial firm. The giris will\r\n\r\nnot have much\r\n\r\ntime left to engage in other activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members, I would like to say that the\r\n\r\nresidents are\r\n\r\npaid for the work they do, and the profits are credited to the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare\r\n\r\n(Homes) Fund which is used for the benefit of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of the Singapore Council of Social Service to set\r\n\r\naside one\r\n\r\nwhole floor of the new building for the display and sale of Social\r\n\r\nWelfare products, both from the Social Welfare Department homes and voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations, will provide an additional sales outlet for Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department products.

In 1962, the scheme was extended  to\r\n\r\ninclude  the fostering of children up to ten  years\r\n\r\nold.  In  1963, the scheme was further extended  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  the  fostering  of  mentally  defective\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of fostering is to provide an alternative\r\n\r\nto  institutional  care for  orphans  and  children\r\n\r\nwhose  mothers or guardians are temporarily  unable\r\n\r\nto  care  for  them.  Foster  care  can  give  such\r\n\r\nchildren a substitute home approximating closely to\r\n\r\ntheir  own  homes. An institution is not  the  best\r\n\r\nsubstitute for a home as it cannot give  the  child\r\n\r\nindividual  care and affection. Nor can it  provide\r\n\r\nthe  security  and  warmth of a normal  home  life,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  important influencing  factors  in  the\r\n\r\nproper development of a child's personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to place a child in foster care may\r\n\r\narise  from  circumstances such as illness  of  the\r\n\r\nmother, overcrowded conditions, breakdown of family\r\n\r\nlife through death, desertion, neglect, destitution\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, a total of 218 children (160 infants\r\n\r\nunder  the  age of two years and 58 children)  were\r\n\r\nfostered out under the scheme.

There  were several  fires  lately,\r\n\r\nparticularly  during the Chinese New  Year  period.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, there were 1,300 cases  of\r\n\r\nfire  last  year  and the loss ran to  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on the measures the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade can take in order to prevent any occurrence\r\n\r\nof  fires  and to teach the people how  to  prevent\r\n\r\nfires.   For  instance,  perhaps  we  can  set   up\r\n\r\nvolunteer fire-fighting teams in various  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If a fire were to occur  in  a  certain\r\n\r\narea,  a fire-fighting team could deal with  it  at\r\n\r\nthe  initial stage without waiting for the  arrival\r\n\r\nof  the  Fire  Brigade.  In the  past,  there  were\r\n\r\nseveral  fire-fighting teams in  various  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and they provided a useful service. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether they are still in existence,  and\r\n\r\nif  they  are,  whether drills  and  exercises  are\r\n\r\nconducted for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our island is well developed. There are\r\n\r\nmany, many blocks of flats. In the past, there were\r\n\r\nkampongs  with attap and plank houses which  caught\r\n\r\nfire. At present, we still have kampongs with attap\r\n\r\nand  plank  houses.  Can  the  Fire  Brigade  teach\r\n\r\nkampong folks the art of fire-fighting and get them\r\n\r\norganised into fire-fighting teams?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also received complaints about the\r\n\r\ndelayed arrival of fire engines at the scene  of  a\r\n\r\nfire.  In  future,  I hope that  fire  engines  can\r\n\r\narrive at a fire site as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some complaints that about half an\r\n\r\nhour  would elapse before a fire engine could reach\r\n\r\nthe  fire  site,  and when it finally  arrived  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  had already been razed to the  ground.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   Minister  will  supervise   the   Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment and keep it efficient so that  a  better\r\n\r\nfire-fighting service will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all,  I would like to draw  the  House's\r\n\r\nattention  to  Command Paper No. 36 of  1969.  This\r\n\r\nlittle   book  of  16  pages  contains   the   Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment's  Annual  Report  for  1967.  The  Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  apparently  taken  two  years   to\r\n\r\nprepare  it.  What was the reason  for  the  delay?\r\n\r\nCould  it  be  that  the department  was  too  busy\r\n\r\nfighting fires?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the past few years have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  tremendous changes in the  landscape  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  brought about by rapid industrialisation\r\n\r\nand  intensive urban renewal schemes. In  place  of\r\n\r\nthe  small backyard type of workshops, we now  have\r\n\r\nfactories involving capital investments of millions\r\n\r\nof dollars. The traditional terrace-type of two- to\r\n\r\nthree-storey shophouses are also giving way to high-rise  buildings of 20, 30 and even 50 storeys. With\r\n\r\nall  these changes, I feel that it is time the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade   adopted  a  rather  more  realistic   and\r\n\r\nenlightened  approach  to  the  subject   of   fire\r\n\r\nprevention and fire fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as fire prevention in the context of\r\n\r\nlegislative control is concerned, I do not know when\r\n\r\nlast  we reviewed our rules and regulations. But  I\r\n\r\ndo  know  that the existing regulations  are  based\r\n\r\nlargely  upon  a  set of rules  applicable  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom. I do not know to what extent  these\r\n\r\nforeign  rules  are  relevant to local  conditions.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI  feel that there is some urgency for us to take a\r\n\r\ngood look at them, not only to ensure that they are\r\n\r\nadequate  for our purposes, but also  to  see  that\r\n\r\nthey   do   not  involve  the  private  sector   in\r\n\r\nunnecessary  waste  of money on some  fanciful  and\r\n\r\nexpensive equipment which may be totally unsuitable\r\n\r\nfor use in tropical countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to fire-fighting. Going through\r\n\r\nthe   latest   available  Annual  Report   of   the\r\n\r\ndepartment for the year 1967 to which I  have  just\r\n\r\nreferred,  I see that apart from a 65-foot  Snorkel\r\n\r\nand  two  Turntable Ladders of 100 feet  each,  our\r\n\r\nFire  Brigade  does not appear to  be  particularly\r\n\r\nwell  equipped  either to fight a  fire  which  may\r\n\r\noccur  beyond the fifth or sixth floor of a  multi-storey  building  or  to save  people  who  may  be\r\n\r\ntrapped on the higher floors of such a building  in\r\n\r\nthe event of a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Minister will\r\n\r\ninform the House what plans he has in hand to bring\r\n\r\nour Fire Brigade up to date in keeping with present\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nshare the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jalan Kayu. It does  not  appear  that\r\n\r\nthere  has been any revision of our fire prevention\r\n\r\nrules and regulations fast enough to keep pace with\r\n\r\nmodern   industry.  Every  year  new   construction\r\n\r\nmethods  are  evolved and new materials  are  used.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  seem  to apply  the  same  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  on  fire  prevention  which,  in  many\r\n\r\ninstances,  seem  to  have  caused  annoyances  and\r\n\r\nfrustration to industrialists who have set  up  new\r\n\r\nfactories or plants here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating a reduction in the\r\n\r\nstandard of our fire-prevention requirements.  What\r\n\r\nI  am  quarrelling with is that the civil  servants\r\n\r\nconcerned will just go on saying that certain rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations must be complied with. Sir,  these\r\n\r\nmust   not   only   be  complied  with   but   also\r\n\r\nintelligently    complied    with.    The     rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the  various  forms  that   our\r\n\r\nfactories  may take, as well as the enormous  range\r\n\r\nof products\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  being  manufactured, make  it  impossible  for\r\n\r\ncomprehensive rules to be drawn up for  every  type\r\n\r\nof factory and every type of product, let alone our\r\n\r\npresent   set   of   fire-prevention   rules    and\r\n\r\nregulations. Sir, I would request the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ngive this matter his constant attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal\r\n\r\nfirst  with the Member for Havelock and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu on the question of using  the  same\r\n\r\nold  rules on fire prevention for new factories and\r\n\r\nplants.  Sir, it should be noted that  it  is  only\r\n\r\nfairly    recently   that   we   have   large-scale\r\n\r\nindustries,   high-rise   buildings,   hotels   and\r\n\r\nshopping  complexes in Singapore. Therefore,  there\r\n\r\nare no rules and regulations for these premises. It\r\n\r\nis  necessary then to refer to the various building\r\n\r\ncodes,  fire codes and codes of practice  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries that are industrially advanced and  whose\r\n\r\nindustries are heavily built up. However, I wish to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that any information derived from  these\r\n\r\nsources is used only as a guide. It is not strictly\r\n\r\nadhered  to.  Some  of  the  by-laws  of  the  Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment  are  out of date. Of course,  they  are\r\n\r\nbeing revised to bring them into line with accepted\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform both Members that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  set  up  an Ad Hoc  Fire  Prevention\r\n\r\nRequirements Appeals Committee which hears  appeals\r\n\r\nfrom members of the public who are aggrieved at the\r\n\r\nfire-prevention   requirements    of    the    Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment.  We have considered quite a  number  of\r\n\r\nappeals. Sir, and in some cases we have allowed the\r\n\r\nappeals,  as  long  as there  is  a  minimum  guard\r\n\r\nagainst fire risk for these factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Singapore Fire Brigade Annual\r\n\r\nReport  for  1967. I regret very much that  it  has\r\n\r\ncome out two years late. I suppose this was due  to\r\n\r\npressure of work in the Fire Brigade, but this will\r\n\r\nbe remedied immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the query from the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, I would like to assure him that from the\r\n\r\ntime of\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nreceiving  a fire call to the time of turn-out,  it\r\n\r\nusually takes the fire-engine crew between  45  and\r\n\r\n60  seconds  to  be ready to go to  the  fire.  The\r\n\r\nMember  complains that in some instances  the  fire\r\n\r\nengines  were late in arriving at the site  of  the\r\n\r\nfire. It takes 45 to 60 seconds for the crew to  be\r\n\r\nready  and dash off to the fire. However, the  time\r\n\r\nthe  fire  engine takes to reach the scene  of  the\r\n\r\nfire  depends  on  various  factors,  such  as  the\r\n\r\ndistance of the fire from the fire station, whether\r\n\r\nthere  is heavy or light traffic on the road,  one-way    routes, weather   conditions   and    road\r\n\r\nobstructions. Even fire engines have  to  obey  the\r\n\r\ntraffic rules! However, every effort is made by the\r\n\r\nfire  engine to arrive at the scene of  a  fire  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of giving lectures to\r\n\r\nfire-fighting teams. There are still in  existence,\r\n\r\nfire-fighting teams in some villages in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOfficers  of  the Fire Brigade do give lectures  on\r\n\r\nfire  fighting  and  fire prevention  not  only  to\r\n\r\nkampung  fire-fighting squads  but  also  to  youth\r\n\r\norganisations,    schools,    hospitals,    factory\r\n\r\nemployees, Government employees, the Armed  Forces,\r\n\r\nand  the  Vigilante Corps. If Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nare  interested, these officers can also give talks\r\n\r\non  fire  prevention to them. The  Department  also\r\n\r\nparticipated in a Home Safety Exhibition  sponsored\r\n\r\nby  the  National Safety First Council in 1969  and\r\n\r\nwill  also  take part in another one  in  May  this\r\n\r\nyear. Any individual or organisation which requests\r\n\r\nadvice  on matters of this nature is given all  the\r\n\r\nassistance the Fire Department can offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised\r\n\r\nthe question of fire fighting and rescue equipment,\r\n\r\nbut it has not been answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the equipment of the Fire\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  reviewed  constantly  to  suit  the\r\n\r\nconditions in our country.

On 28th  February\r\n\r\nthis year, there was a fire in Changi Village.  The\r\n\r\nonly  fire  hydrant was located at one end  of  the\r\n\r\nvillage and had water lasting only four minutes  to\r\n\r\nfight  the  fire.  This was an  alarming  fact  and\r\n\r\nshould  be noted by the Minister. While the firemen\r\n\r\nwere  looking  frantically for  another  source  of\r\n\r\nwater supply, the fury of the fire was such that it\r\n\r\nlicked  through  nine  shop buildings  and  damaged\r\n\r\nproperty  valued  at  more  than  half  a   million\r\n\r\ndollars.  As  a  result,  tremendous  distress  was\r\n\r\ncaused  to the victims. I gather that if there  had\r\n\r\nbeen enough water pressure in the fire hydrant, The\r\n\r\nRoyal Air Force Fire Service which was on the scene\r\n\r\nof  the fire within minutes, could have put out the\r\n\r\nfire  in  the particular shop from which it started\r\n\r\nand  it would not have damaged the other shops.

On being tested, after the  fire,  it\r\n\r\nwas   found  that  the  hydrant  had  a   flow   of\r\n\r\napproximately  370  gallons of  water  per  minute,\r\n\r\nwhich is quite good but insufficient to deal with a\r\n\r\nfire   of  that  intensity.  In  order  to   obtain\r\n\r\nadditional supplies, a pump was set into the  river\r\n\r\nabout  a quarter of a mile away to draw water.

Besides\r\n\r\ntheir   arrogance  and  discourtesy,  some   civil\r\n\r\nservants have also other defects and deficiencies.\r\n\r\nFor  example, showing a lack of co-ordination  and\r\n\r\nliaison  among the various Government departments.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  matter involves more than one department,\r\n\r\neach  department tries to shift the responsibility\r\n\r\nto  another  department.

When farmers want to  build\r\n\r\npigsties  and  chicken pens, they have  to  obtain\r\n\r\npermission  from various departments such  as  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office, the Chief Building Surveyor's Office\r\n\r\nand  the  Primary Production Department. The  past\r\n\r\nregulations  stated  that  the  height  of   these\r\n\r\nstructures  should not exceed 6\ufffd feet. If  chicken\r\n\r\npens   were  built  according  to  the  prescribed\r\n\r\nheight, chickens could not be reared because  the\r\n\r\nheight  was  too  low. After representations  were\r\n\r\nmade by the farmers, it was agreed that the height\r\n\r\nwould  be  increased  to  eight  feet.  This   new\r\n\r\nregulation came into force more than a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently some farmers made applications to build\r\n\r\ntheir chicken pens.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTheir  application  forms went round  the  various\r\n\r\ndepartments,  and finally ended up in  the  Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor's Department. Their applications\r\n\r\nwere  not  approved  because  the  height  of  the\r\n\r\nchicken  pens was more than six feet three inches.\r\n\r\nFrom  this  we  can see that there is  no  liaison\r\n\r\namong  the various departments although they  come\r\n\r\nunder  one Ministry. What has been agreed  by  one\r\n\r\ndepartment has not been communicated to the  other\r\n\r\ndepartments. The farmers are at a loss as to  what\r\n\r\nshould  be done. They have wasted a great deal  of\r\n\r\ntime making inquiries in various departments. This\r\n\r\nlack  of  co-ordination  and  liaison  among   the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments has caused a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case involved me. In 1967 I was a member\r\n\r\nof  the  Urban and Rural Services Committee  which\r\n\r\nwas responsible for the Punggol, Sembawang and Nee\r\n\r\nSoon areas. I have gone to these areas many times.\r\n\r\nAfter  a term of one year, I was not appointed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  again.  However,  the  Electricity\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the Public Utilities  Board  still\r\n\r\nregards  me  as a Committee member  and  sends  me\r\n\r\nnotices of completion of projects. Is this  not  a\r\n\r\njoke? I am no longer a member of the Committee but\r\n\r\nthey still send me these notices!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year before last, the exercise of removal of\r\n\r\nstand-pipes was initiated in order to economise on\r\n\r\nthe  consumption of water. This was a  good  move,\r\n\r\nbut their removal should have been done in stages.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to say, the department concerned  should\r\n\r\nhave  made  a careful investigation into  how  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  the  stand-pipes  would  affect   the\r\n\r\npeople.  If  the  stand-pipes  were  found  to  be\r\n\r\nredundant I have no objection that they should  be\r\n\r\nremoved.  But  the removal of stand-pipes  without\r\n\r\njustification had caused a great deal of  hardship\r\n\r\nto  those  who used them. I know that the question\r\n\r\nof removing these stand-pipes was dealt with by an\r\n\r\nAd Hoc Committee. This Committee consisted of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nmembers  from  the  Property  Tax  Department,  the\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities Board and other departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when it was notified that 89\r\n\r\nstand-pipes were going to be removed in the  Jurong\r\n\r\narea,  the  people  through  the  Jurong  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative   Committee,  after  considering   the\r\n\r\neffect  it  would  have on them,  advanced  several\r\n\r\nreasons  to the Ad Hoc Committee requesting  it  to\r\n\r\ndelay the removal of ten stand-pipes. But I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why  the  Ad Hoc Committee did  not  consider\r\n\r\ntheir request at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Citizens Consultative Committee's request\r\n\r\nwas  not  even considered by this Ad Hoc Committee,\r\n\r\nand  it  removed the stand-pipes. I  say  that  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  this committee did not  do  their  job\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall give a few reasons why it was a mistake\r\n\r\nfor the Ad Hoc Committee to have removed the stand-pipes. The first stand-pipe was situated at the end\r\n\r\nof  Gek  Poh Road. It was the only source of  water\r\n\r\nsupply  for the residents in the village of  Lorong\r\n\r\nKabong  which was opposite to Gek Poh Road. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Committee saw that there were water  mains  in\r\n\r\nGek  Poh  Road  and so they removed the  stand-pipe\r\n\r\nfrom  this  area. Recently there was a drought  and\r\n\r\nthe  wells  in this area dried up. The  authorities\r\n\r\nhad  to  use  water wagons to supply water  to  the\r\n\r\nvillagers.  This goes to show that the  removal  of\r\n\r\nthis stand-pipe was a wrong move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance - a pipe had been installed at\r\n\r\nthe  13\ufffd  m.s.  Jurong Road,  near  a  hawkers'\r\n\r\ncentre. The hawkers here used to get water from the\r\n\r\nstand-pipe  to  clean their stalls at  the  end  of\r\n\r\ntheir  business. I do not know why this  stand-pipe\r\n\r\nwas  also removed. Our Government started the \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean\" Campaign and we should  therefore\r\n\r\nencourage hawkers to clean their stalls at the  end\r\n\r\nof  their  business. Can we say that this  was  the\r\n\r\nright thing to do to remove this stand-pipe?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further example - a stand-pipe numbered 998 had\r\n\r\nbeen installed at Joo Koon Road. About 100 families\r\n\r\ndepended on this stand-pipe for their water supply.\r\n\r\nWhen  it  was removed, the people appealed  to  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to have it reconnected, but the request\r\n\r\nwas   not  acceded  to.  The  people  pooled  their\r\n\r\nresources  and  tried to install water  mains,  but\r\n\r\nthat  also  did  not receive the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nauthorities. Recently, there was a drought and  the\r\n\r\nwells dried up; there was not a drop of water.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health investigated and confirmed  that\r\n\r\nthe  people suffered from a shortage of  water  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should reconnect  the  stand-pipe.   This  goes  to  show  that,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, the removal of this stand-pipe was wrong.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope the Minister will see that this mistake\r\n\r\nis  not repeated. He should rectify the mistakes of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  and, for the good of  the  people,\r\n\r\nreconnect  all  the stand-pipes that  were  wrongly\r\n\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I have forgotten to bring my notes that I have\r\n\r\nprepared.  Sir, can I speak on matters  which  come\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of Law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I want to\r\n\r\nraise  two points. The first point is in connection\r\n\r\nwith  Magistrates and Judges. The term  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nfor  them is Fah Kuan. But if we use this  term  in\r\n\r\nChinese, it loses the democratic meaning. The  term\r\n\r\nkuan  means a bureaucrat or an official. This  term\r\n\r\nis   in   strong   contrast  to   our   system   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, because it is used only in\r\n\r\nimperialist  countries or colonies. In our  Courts,\r\n\r\nthe  Magistrates and Judges should  not  be  called\r\n\r\nkuan  in  Chinese.  We  do not  call  jurors  kuan.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have abolished the jury system, we call\r\n\r\nthem  jurors as in Chinese, and we do not  use  the\r\n\r\nterm  kuan.  But Magistrates and Judges are  called\r\n\r\nkuan. They are all in charge of trial cases. If  we\r\n\r\ncan use the term yuan for jurors, I think we should\r\n\r\nuse another Chinese term for Magistrates and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nJudges  such as sern pang yuan or sern  pang  chan,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  a person who is in charge of trying  the\r\n\r\ncase. For example, we should call the Chief Justice\r\n\r\nkau  chi sern pang chan, that is, a senior official\r\n\r\nwho  tries a case. Therefore, we should revise  the\r\n\r\nChinese term for Magistrates and Judges, so that we\r\n\r\ncan  differentiate between their ranks.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nthis,  it  will  be  more appropriate  because  our\r\n\r\ncountry  practises democracy. We  should  not  give\r\n\r\npeople the feeling that there are other people  who\r\n\r\nare  head  and shoulders above them. If Magistrates\r\n\r\nand  Judges  are  called kuan, it means  that  they\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  people.  I know  many  offenders  and\r\n\r\naccused persons are tried in Court, and because  of\r\n\r\nthe  solemnity and sternness therein,  the  accused\r\n\r\npersons  who are innocent are not able  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir  views.  They  are not  able  to  declare  or\r\n\r\nexplain  their  innocence. Quite  often,  they  are\r\n\r\ninhibited by the stern and solemn atmosphere of the\r\n\r\ncourts. I hope we can revise the term kuan and that\r\n\r\nthere will be an improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point that I want to speak on is in\r\n\r\nconnection   with  the  Ministry   of   Law.   When\r\n\r\nParliament passes Bills, many of them are  directly\r\n\r\nconcerned with the welfare and political rights  of\r\n\r\nour  people. But after the passage of these  Bills,\r\n\r\nthey  are just published in a book and put  in  the\r\n\r\nLibrary  of Parliament and in the National Library.\r\n\r\nThe book looks like an article for exhibition. This\r\n\r\nis  not  the  way  to  give  the  public  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the contents and meanings  of  our\r\n\r\nlaws.   The  people  of  Singapore  are   not   all\r\n\r\nspecialists  in  law.  Their  knowledge  of  it  is\r\n\r\nlimited.  Only lawyers are well versed in the  law.\r\n\r\nThe  majority of our people do not know much  about\r\n\r\nit.  Even in a small matter involving the law, they\r\n\r\nare  often  at a loss as to what to do. Very  often\r\n\r\nthey  have  to consult a lawyer on points  of  law.\r\n\r\nEvery  time  they consult one, they have  to  spend\r\n\r\nsome  money.  Sometimes it is a simple  matter  and\r\n\r\nthere is no need to consult a lawyer because it  is\r\n\r\na waste of money. Therefore, I suggest\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of  Law should  publicise  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  our  new  laws  over  radio  and   on\r\n\r\ntelevision  in the four languages. The meanings  of\r\n\r\nthe  various sections should also be explained  so\r\n\r\nthat the people will understand our laws better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when the Abortion Bill was passed,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister said that it was a valuable piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation.  But the general public  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhere  the  value of the Bill lies, especially  the\r\n\r\nwomen  folk who are interested to know the  meaning\r\n\r\nand  the contents of the Abortion Act. The Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Abortion Act  would  liberate  our\r\n\r\nwomen.  But  they do not know how it will  liberate\r\n\r\nthem.  If the Ministry of Law can liaise with Radio\r\n\r\nand  Television Singapore to publicise the contents\r\n\r\nof  Bills that have been passed, then they will  be\r\n\r\nmade  known  to the people of Singapore in  greater\r\n\r\nand clearer detail. The business of the lawyers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will not, however, be seriously  affected\r\n\r\nif this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, lawyers know the law. But we believe\r\n\r\nin  the  maintenance  of law and  order  and  hence\r\n\r\neverybody  should know something  about  it.  Quite\r\n\r\noften  people  have  to consult  lawyers.  However,\r\n\r\ntheir  business will not be seriously  affected  if\r\n\r\ngreater publicity is given to the contents  of  the\r\n\r\nBills  that  have been passed. I hope consideration\r\n\r\nwill be given to this suggestion so that our people\r\n\r\nwill understand our laws better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to speak on\r\n\r\nthe   following  matters  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law and National Development.  First,\r\n\r\nour  Government  is in the process of  implementing\r\n\r\nthe   urban   renewal  schemes.  These  are   being\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Government as well as by  private\r\n\r\nenterprise.   Where  the  efforts   made   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or by private enterprise  are  for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of  our country, we should support  them.  We\r\n\r\nshould  assist the Government in its  objective  of\r\n\r\npulling down old buildings and building new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nones.   By  giving  support  to  this  policy,   we\r\n\r\nfacilitate the task of nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot deny that it is only from\r\n\r\nthe  ruins that we can build something new.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to destroy the old buildings  before  we\r\n\r\ncan  reconstruct new ones. People who are  affected\r\n\r\nby  the  urban  renewal schemes  should  understand\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people have been affected by the urban\r\n\r\nrenewal schemes ever since they were implemented by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development. From what  I\r\n\r\nknow, the people affected are dissatisfied with the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal schemes because the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot    give   them   adequate   compensation    for\r\n\r\nresettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has two minutes more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Because they\r\n\r\nhave  to vacate their shops and accommodation, they\r\n\r\nare  entitled  to  compensation. But  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  is not adequate. For  instance,  very\r\n\r\nfew  shopkeepers in Chinatown have a large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  enable them to move from  one  place  to\r\n\r\nanother.  Very often they live from hand to  mouth.\r\n\r\nThey  are  beset with worries. When the  Government\r\n\r\nallots a shop to them, the rent for it will come to\r\n\r\na  few  hundred dollars. In addition, they have  to\r\n\r\nincur   expenditure   for   renovation   and    the\r\n\r\ninstallation of various appliances and equipment on\r\n\r\nthe  premises.  The amount of money  they  have  to\r\n\r\nspend   is  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  average\r\n\r\nbusinessman. My suggestion is that, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe usual amount of compensation, Government should\r\n\r\nallow  them a choice of two alternatives. We either\r\n\r\ngive them a sum of $10,000 or $20,000 or --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is up. Mr Lim Cheng Lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in speaking\r\n\r\non  this  amendment,  I am drawing  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nattention, through his Parliamentary Secretary, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  the maximum total  family  income\r\n\r\nqualification  for  renting or  purchasing  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats. The present regulations are such  that\r\n\r\npeople  who wish to rent or purchase Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats must not have a total income exceeding $1,200\r\n\r\nper  month. I am aware that this qualification  has\r\n\r\nbeen  revised recently to allow more people to take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  this revision to  rent  or  purchase\r\n\r\ntheir  own  house. It is quite right  that  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning when the Housing Board commenced to build\r\n\r\nhouses  for  the  people it  had  to  restrict  the\r\n\r\nallocation  of houses to those in the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup so that they could enjoy this facility first.\r\n\r\nBut  over  the  years, our standard of  living  has\r\n\r\nrisen  and  the incomes of people have also  risen.\r\n\r\nRecently  we have introduced legislation increasing\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Central Provident  Fund.  Will\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   consider  revising  this   maximum\r\n\r\nfurther,  so that the total family income is  fixed\r\n\r\nat  a  higher  figure to enable the middle  of  the\r\n\r\nmiddle income group to enjoy this facility also? At\r\n\r\nthe  present moment, I would say that, with over  a\r\n\r\nhundred thousand flats built by the Housing  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of the lower income group are  more  or\r\n\r\nless satisfied. I think the people in the middle of\r\n\r\nthe  middle income group who are at present  denied\r\n\r\nthis facility should also be given a chance to rent\r\n\r\nor own houses under the Housing Board scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are there any other Members who\r\n\r\nwish to speak on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, the Member may speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you very much. I was saying just now that the\r\n\r\ncompensation  given to those who are evicted  under\r\n\r\nthe  urban  renewal schemes should be reviewed.  At\r\n\r\nthe moment, the compensation given is not adequate.\r\n\r\nThose  evicted  should have a choice  in  accepting\r\n\r\ncompensation. In addition to the scheme of granting\r\n\r\nalternative shopping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\npremises  to those who are evicted, there  should\r\n\r\nbe  another scheme whereby those evicted may  opt\r\n\r\nto  receive  cash compensation to  the  value  of\r\n\r\n$10,000,  $20,000 or $30,000. In this way, those\r\n\r\nwho   are   evicted   have  a   choice   of   two\r\n\r\nalternatives. This is a better way to  compensate\r\n\r\nthose  evicted. Not every one of  them  is  rich.\r\n\r\nThey do not have a big amount of ready cash at  a\r\n\r\nmoment's notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, many small merchants have\r\n\r\nbeen  evicted  from their premises following  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the urban renewal schemes. They\r\n\r\nhave  been resettled in Toa Payoh and Queenstown.\r\n\r\nSince  they  have no cash in hand, they  have  to\r\n\r\nborrow  money at high interest rates. It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for them to get an overdraft  from  the\r\n\r\nbanks.  Very often they have to close down  their\r\n\r\nshops  soon after they opened business  in  their\r\n\r\nnew  place. That is why the banks are not willing\r\n\r\nto  give  them  an overdraft. As a result,  these\r\n\r\npeople  have  to borrow money at a high  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest.  Sometimes  they  avail  themselves  of\r\n\r\nloans  provided  by  the  new  finance  companies\r\n\r\ncalled   \"Chit  fund\"  companies.  The   interest\r\n\r\ncharged  by  these companies is of  course,  very\r\n\r\nhigh.   The  time  for  repaying  the   loan   by\r\n\r\ninstalments comes very quickly. Before  they  can\r\n\r\nmake  any  profit  from the loan  capital,  these\r\n\r\npeople  will have to pay several hundred  dollars\r\n\r\nin  part  settlement of the loan. They  are  even\r\n\r\nforced to commit suicide!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is that these evicted people\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  the choice of  receiving  cash\r\n\r\ncompensation to help\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthem  resettle in other areas. It is not  just  a\r\n\r\nsimple  matter of providing them with alternative\r\n\r\nshopping premises. Everything is different  in  a\r\n\r\nnew  environment.
