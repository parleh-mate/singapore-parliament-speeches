Mr Loke  Weng\r\n\r\nChee, as Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, has led us through a\r\n\r\nperiod  of Parliamentary and Constitutional development  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore. In this sense, therefore, his contribution\r\n\r\ntowards our Constitutional progress is considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Clerk of the Assembly, Mr Loke has to be correct in his\r\n\r\nattitude, not only to Members on the Opposition Benches but also\r\n\r\nto  Members  on the Government Benches. And from our observation\r\n\r\nof  his  conduct in the affairs of the House, Mr Loke has  been\r\n\r\nscrupulously  fair  to both sides. This, I am  quite  sure,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  himself can attest to, as he has  been  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Benches  as well as being on the Government  Benches\r\n\r\ntoday,  and  during  this  period Mr  Loke  was  Clerk  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Mr Speaker, again to associate ourselves with\r\n\r\nyour  sentiments that Mr, and Mrs Loke enjoy a peaceful  and  a\r\n\r\nhappy  retirement, although knowing Mr Loke as we do,  that  he\r\n\r\nlooks  far  younger than his age, we believe he at  some  future\r\n\r\ndate could put himself to more active service in some other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  my colleagues, congratulate Mr Loke Weng Chee,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Clerk  of  this House, on the service  rendered  by  him\r\n\r\nduring the last 34 years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although most of my colleagues, including myself, are new\r\n\r\nto  this  House  in regard to many rules and procedures  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, we did really have an interesting time with  Mr  Loke\r\n\r\nduring  the  last two years of his term of service. Besides  the\r\n\r\nproficiency and high efficiency in his work, he is a man of fine\r\n\r\ncharacter,  without  prejudice  whatsoever.

W. Barker (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nMembers will recollect that in June last year we introduced  two\r\n\r\ncomplementary Bills to amend the law relating to the acquisition\r\n\r\nof  land  for  public purposes. The Land Acquisition (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, which was taken through on a Certificate of Urgency, froze\r\n\r\nthe  position  of appeals pending the enactment  of  substantial\r\n\r\nalterations   to  the  law  embodied  in  the  Land  Acquisition\r\n\r\n(Amendment  No.  2)  Bill,  which was  referred  to  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee for study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provision in the Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2)\r\n\r\nBill  is to ensure that increases in land values as a result  of\r\n\r\npublic  development  should not benefit the  owner,  but  should\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  community at large. The Bill  aimed  to  save  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from having to give land-owners windfall  gains  and\r\n\r\nincreases in value as a result of public expenditure incurred in\r\n\r\nthe  area. Since the Bill was introduced into the House, further\r\n\r\nconsideration   has  been  given  to  the  problems   of   urban\r\n\r\nredevelopment, and, in particular, to the pressures from private\r\n\r\ndevelopers on the old squatter settlements in the urban and\r\n\r\nsemi-urban  areas. Unable to evict squatters and tenants  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  freezing  of certain clauses of the Control of  Rent  Ordinance,  private  developers  are finding  it  profitable  to  pay\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  squatters to move out of the areas  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen living in for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social problem is created in that quite a number of these\r\n\r\ncommunities, after taking compensation, have moved out into  the\r\n\r\nouter  rural  areas, adding to the Government's difficulties  in\r\n\r\nproviding  water,  electricity, roads, rails  and  other  social\r\n\r\namenities at high cost in remote areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed that where private development necessitates\r\n\r\nthe  removal of these old established kampongs in the urban  and\r\n\r\nsemi-urban  areas,  the  Government should  have  the  power  to\r\n\r\nacquire  a  portion of the land sufficient for  enough  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  units  to be put up to re-house families  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens who have been there since 1958. In this way, when urban\r\n\r\nre-development  takes place, all sections of the community  will\r\n\r\nshare  in  the advantages of re-development. In order that  such\r\n\r\nschemes can be practicable and do not become prohibitive in cost\r\n\r\nto  the Government, compensation rates for the acquisition of  a\r\n\r\nportion of the land for re-housing should take into account what\r\n\r\nthe developers would have had to pay these squatters to move out\r\n\r\ninto  other  areas,  and the fact that the  Government  will  be\r\n\r\nundertaking the responsibility not only of low-cost housing  for\r\n\r\nall  citizens regardless of their race, but also in the case  of\r\n\r\nMalays  who are Singapore citizens and whose family incomes  are\r\n\r\nless than $200 per month, or perpetual subsidy of 20 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General's Chambers have looked into these\r\n\r\nmatters and have advised that, in order to remove any doubts  on\r\n\r\nthe  validity of this new legislation, it will be necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Parliament  to  exempt  such  a  Bill  from  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  Article  13 of the Constitution,  which  provides\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`no law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition or use of\r\n\r\nproperty without adequate compensation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation will be made to the Central Government for such\r\n\r\nan exemption provision to be passed in Parliament in order that\r\n\r\nthese projects can be carried out in Singapore without any\r\n\r\nuncertainty about the constitutional validity of the formula for\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, it may be relevant to note that the Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment, when faced with a similar problem in connection with\r\n\r\ntheir plans for land reform, had to effect a constitutional\r\n\r\namendment to a corresponding provision in the Indian\r\n\r\nConstitution in order that their land reforms could be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to re-introduce this Bill\r\n\r\nafter  the  necessary additional provisions have been added  for\r\n\r\nacquisition  of land under private developers for re-housing  of\r\n\r\nsquatters  who are Singapore citizens and have been there  since\r\n\r\n1958. If the Government were to carry the responsibility of \r\n\r\nre-housing  squatters  arising out of private  development  without\r\n\r\nbeing  held to ransom by private landlords, then we must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  land  acquired  for public projects  can  be  obtained  at\r\n\r\neconomic  cost so that the private landlord, while he  does  not\r\n\r\nlose,  would  not gain any windfalls as a result  of  Government\r\n\r\ndevelopment   expenditure   and  because   the   Government   is\r\n\r\nundertaking the burden of public re-housing of their  encumbered\r\n\r\nland.  Increase  in value attributable to public expenditure  in\r\n\r\nlaying  sewers, roads and supplying community facilities in  the\r\n\r\narea  should  not  go into the pockets of a few land-owners  who\r\n\r\nhave  done  nothing to add to the value of the land, hut  should\r\n\r\naccrue to the State for the benefit of the whole community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government expects to re-introduce the\r\n\r\nBill  with necessary amendments at the appropriate time  at  the\r\n\r\nnext sitting of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The\r\n\r\narticle  states briefly that they had intended to move  at  this\r\n\r\nsitting of the Assembly a motion which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House resolves that the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  urge the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur  to  achieve\r\n\r\nhonourable   peace   in  North  Borneo  and  Malaya, including\r\n\r\nSingapore, on the principles as stated below:'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1), (2) and so on. And the article goes on to read as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What the motion propounds is the correct way to settle the\r\n\r\nMalaysia issue in order to free the people from imperialist rule\r\n\r\nand  realise a peaceful, prosperous, independent and  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety.  However, the day before yesterday, the Assemblyman  of\r\n\r\nour  Party [that is, the Barisan Sosialis] received a note  from\r\n\r\nthe  Clerk  of  the  Assembly stating that the  motion  was  not\r\n\r\nallowed  by the Speaker to be tabled for debate. The reason  is,\r\n\r\nit  criticises  the resolution of the House on the  question  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia and merger, and discusses internal matters which affect\r\n\r\nother territories outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before receiving the letter, comrade Assemblyman Chia Thye Poh\r\n\r\nof  our  Party  [that is, the Barisan Sosialis  Party]  saw  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker  to  express his views about whether or not  the  motion\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to be debated. According to comrade Chia,  as\r\n\r\nregards the question of criticising Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  bogus  merger, the fact is that if any  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement  or  any ordinance which is dissatisfactory  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  has proved to be extremely disadvantageous  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Legislative  Assembly should  suggest  and  review\r\n\r\nrevision,  repeal  such  as in the case  of  the  former  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the motion which involves the matters of other\r\n\r\nterritories,  it  is  because  Malaysia  includes  North  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  So  it is impossible that what  happens  in  North\r\n\r\nBorneo  will  not  affect Singapore at  all.  Such  measures  as\r\n\r\nconscription and increased taxation are clear proofs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article goes on to criticise that, because of the Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  7  days' notice being required before a motion  can  be\r\n\r\nmoved  in  the  Assembly, the Barisan Sosialis  Assemblymen  complained that they did not have adequate time in which to present\r\n\r\nany  revised  version of the motion which they had presented  to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points, Mr Speaker, arising out of this article.\r\n\r\nThe  first point is that it is critical of the Speaker's ruling.\r\n\r\nWhether  this  criticism  of  the  Speaker's  ruling  should  be\r\n\r\npublished  beforehand, before this Assembly meets, or should  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in this Chamber is to be judged a breach of privilege\r\n\r\nor  even  a  reprimand of the Speaker, I leave it  to  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the Pineapple Industry Marketing  Corporation\r\n\r\nwas  among  one  of the recommendations made by a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  appointed in 1959 jointly by the Federal and  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments   following  a  crisis  in  the  Malayan   pineapple\r\n\r\nindustry.  The  Commission recommended the  establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nmarketing  corporation  in  order  to  handle  sales  of  canned\r\n\r\npineapple   on  behalf  of  the  packers  so  as  to   eliminate\r\n\r\ncompetition among themselves and thereby introduce stability  in\r\n\r\nthe pineapple industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has given careful thought and\r\n\r\nconsideration to the recommendation and is satisfied  that  such\r\n\r\nan  establishment  would be of benefit  to  both  the  pineapple\r\n\r\nindustry and trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the corporation will be to promote, manage and\r\n\r\ncontrol the marketing of canned pineapple. For this purpose, the\r\n\r\nproposed corporation will act as the sole marketing agent for\r\n\r\nregistered canners in the sales of canned pineapple. All\r\n\r\nregistered canners will be required to sell their canned\r\n\r\npineapples through the corporation which will fix minimum\r\n\r\nprices. In this way, the corporation will be able to eliminate\r\n\r\nunhealthy competition and price-cutting, as has often happened\r\n\r\nin the past. It is generally believed that the establishment of\r\n\r\nan orderly market will assist in creating confidence in Malayan\r\n\r\ncanned pineapple in overseas markets and enhancing the\r\n\r\nreputation of the Malaysian product. Furthermore, the proposed\r\n\r\ncorporation will be able to overcome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties of some canners during the slack  period\r\n\r\nof  sluggish  sales at the end of each year by making  loans  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's interest in such a corporation is enhanced by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  over 95 per cent of canned pineapples  produced  are\r\n\r\nexported  through  Singapore. In  1964,  for  instance,  out  of\r\n\r\n2,450,000 cases valued at $38\u00bd million produced, 2,351,000 cases\r\n\r\nvalued  at $37 million were exported through Singapore. Although\r\n\r\nSingapore's  share  of production of canned  pineapple  is  only\r\n\r\nslightly  over  20  per cent, it is the seventh  most  important\r\n\r\ncommodity  in  Singapore's exports, in addition, there  are  two\r\n\r\ncanneries  in  Singapore  supporting employment  for  about  450\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership of the corporation will be confined to six\r\n\r\nexisting pineapple canneries: two in Singapore and four  in  the\r\n\r\nStates  of  Malaya,  including the newly  established  Pineapple\r\n\r\nCannery  of  Malaya,  Limited,  at  Pekan  Nanas,  Johore.   The\r\n\r\ncorporation  will be managed by its members and the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Pineapple Industry Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government financial backing is required during the initial\r\n\r\nrunning-in  period of the corporation so that it  may  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  assist  canners  as  mentioned  before.  For  this\r\n\r\npurpose,  both  the  Central and Singapore Governments  have  to\r\n\r\nunderwrite  an  initial working capital guarantee  of  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $2 million to the corporation through  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nPineapple Industry Board before the corporation can build up its\r\n\r\nown  capital from members' subscriptions. The Central Government\r\n\r\nhas  already agreed to undertake 75 per cent of the  $2  million\r\n\r\nguarantee  and the Singapore Government has agreed to underwrite\r\n\r\nthe  balance of 25 per cent or $\u00bd million. The corporation  will\r\n\r\nmake  loans  to canners against stock of canned pineapples.  Any\r\n\r\nmonies borrowed by the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board will  be\r\n\r\na  debt  due  to the Singapore Government and shall be  a  first\r\n\r\ncharge on the assets of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Government presented its amendment Bill to\r\n\r\nParliament and it was duly passed on 15th July, 1964.

The  Bill  will  now  afford  a  measure   of\r\n\r\nprotection particularly to future purchasers of houses  in  that\r\n\r\nthey would have properly constructed access roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me deal with the question of public streets. Under\r\n\r\nexisting   provisions   in  the  Local  Government   Integration\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the Director of Public Works may recover the cost  of\r\n\r\nacquiring the land and the cost of construction when he has made\r\n\r\nup  a new street. The amendment now proposed in clause 2 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  will  provide that, in addition to the making  up  of  new\r\n\r\nstreets, there should be powers to recover the costs in  respect\r\n\r\nof   the  widening  or  improvement  of  a  public  street  from\r\n\r\nfrontagers. This is a necessary provision, as, in the past,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  cost of such street works has been at public expense.  It\r\n\r\nis reasonable that Government should be in a position\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  recover  costs from owners who have obtained  benefits  from\r\n\r\nsuch  works.  This  power  will be  discretionary  and  will  be\r\n\r\nexercised  only when owners have benefited, as  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  that Government should recover costs  of  minor  road\r\n\r\nwidenings or improvements to public streets by the provision  of\r\n\r\nfootpaths,  drains, and so on. The power will be exercised  only\r\n\r\nin  cases where road improvements have benefited frontagers  as,\r\n\r\nfor  example, in the case of road deviations whereby  tracts  of\r\n\r\nland  hitherto without means of approach have now proper  access\r\n\r\nto  a  public  street, arising from which an increment  in  land\r\n\r\nvalue accrues to the owners. It is therefore equitable that such\r\n\r\nowners should be called upon to bear a reasonable proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe costs of the road works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are provisions in this Bill, Mr Speaker, concerning\r\n\r\nprivate   developers  making  up  new  streets.  While   private\r\n\r\ndevelopers  are required to submit street plans to the  Director\r\n\r\nfor approval, the existing law does not empower the Director  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the street works actually constructed do, in  fact,\r\n\r\nconform  to  the  approved plans and specifications.  Under  the\r\n\r\namendment  in clause 3 of the Bill, it will now be incumbent  on\r\n\r\nthe  person  whose  plan has been approved by  the  Director  to\r\n\r\nconstruct the street in accordance with the plan approved.  This\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that any road constructed will not be sub-standard\r\n\r\nand  will not be unacceptable to the Public Works Department for\r\n\r\ntaking  over  as a public street. Cases of applications  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department for taking over of  private  roads  in\r\n\r\nhousing  estates are not infrequent, and many had to be rejected\r\n\r\non the grounds that they were below specifications. As a result,\r\n\r\npurchasers  of  houses  in  such private  housing  estates  have\r\n\r\ngenuine  grounds for complaint, having been given to  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  roads  would be constructed to proper  standards  and\r\n\r\nwould be taken over as public streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause 5, Mr Speaker, Sir, will prohibit any person\r\n\r\nfrom  commencing work on a new building having a frontage  on  a\r\n\r\nprivate  street, until he has deposited an appropriate sum  with\r\n\r\nthe  Director for the making up of such private street. This  is\r\n\r\nto guarantee that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstreet  works  will be constructed according to  approved  plan.\r\n\r\nThese  are  necessary powers to restrain unscrupulous developers\r\n\r\nwho  do  not carry out their obligations to build the  roads  or\r\n\r\nwill  build  only  sub-standard roads to the  detriment  of  the\r\n\r\npurchasers. The procedure for obtaining the deposit will  be  by\r\n\r\nway  of  a  notice from the Director of Public Works determining\r\n\r\nthe  amount  that is required for the execution  of  the  street\r\n\r\nworks  and the date by which such works shall be completed.  Any\r\n\r\nperson who is aggrieved by such an order may, within ten days on\r\n\r\nreceipt  of the order, appeal to the Minister. In the  event  of\r\n\r\nstreet works not being commenced or executed satisfactorily, the\r\n\r\nDirector  may cause the street works to be carried out  and  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  such  works shall be recovered from the deposit  made.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  developer has completed the roads  satisfactorily,  a\r\n\r\nrefund of the deposit will be made. There is also provision  for\r\n\r\na  refund  of deposit, when, owing to circumstances, a developer\r\n\r\ndoes  not  intend to proceed with the development and wishes  to\r\n\r\nhave his approval cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has constantly received complaints that private\r\n\r\nstreets have been made impassable or extensively damaged because\r\n\r\nof  the  development of housing estates. But under present  law,\r\n\r\nthe  repair of these public streets can only be carried  out  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of the owners of premises fronting or abutting such\r\n\r\nprivate  streets.  This is grossly unjust, as these  owners  are\r\n\r\nbeing  called upon to pay for the repair of their private  roads\r\n\r\nwhich have been rendered defective by the actions of persons  or\r\n\r\nfirms  who are not frontagers, such as private contractors whose\r\n\r\nlorries  cause  damage to the foundations  of  private  streets.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  amendment proposed in clause  8  of  the  Bill,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Director may now serve notice to compel any person,\r\n\r\nfirm or company who has caused the damage to repair such private\r\n\r\nstreets. The Director may also serve notice to prohibit a person\r\n\r\nfrom  making further use of a private street for the purpose  of\r\n\r\ntransporting building materials until a deposit has  been  made.\r\n\r\nThis amount of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeposit  will depend on the cost which would have to be incurred\r\n\r\nto bring the road back into a usable condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed in clause 9 is consequential on the\r\n\r\namendments  proposed  in clause 5. The Chief  Building  Surveyor\r\n\r\nwill  now  be prohibited from approving the plan of  a  building\r\n\r\nunless  the  new provisions relating to access to a  new  street\r\n\r\nhave been satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I support the amending Bill moved by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development on the grounds that with this amending\r\n\r\nBill I am confident that the residents in kampongs, particularly\r\n\r\nin  Kampong Kembangan, where there are factories and other small\r\n\r\nindustries, will not be faced with difficulties due to roads and\r\n\r\ndrains  which have been damaged as a result of work carried  out\r\n\r\nby contractors of such firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before elaborating further on this amending Bill,\r\n\r\nI  would like to draw the attention of the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment -  and I would like an explanation from him - to  clause\r\n\r\n2 regarding the provision that the \"Director may recover cost of\r\n\r\nnew  street or of widening, opening, - etc. of public street.\"  If\r\n\r\nthis  is implemented, I believe that towkays, such as the M.C.A.\r\n\r\ntowkays, owning brick houses, will have no financial difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut   what   happens  if  this  clause  affects  the  semi-urban\r\n\r\nresidents,  especially  those in the Kampong  Kembangan  \r\n\r\narea  - Lorong  Marican,  Lorong  Marzuki,  Lorong  Maideen, \r\n\r\nand  other lorongs?  In this area, the properties are owned \r\n\r\nby  Malays  who have inherited them and they are wage-earners\r\n\r\nwhose incomes  are barely  enough  to  feed their families. \r\n\r\nAnd some  of  them  are retired Government servants who have\r\n\r\nbought such properties with their  gratuities. I think such \r\n\r\nfrontagers, as I  have  referred to, will not be able to pay \r\n\r\nfor the cost of widening the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, Mr Speaker, Sir, the roads in\r\n\r\nLorong Marican, Lorong Marzuki, Lorong Melayu,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJalan Masjid, and other lorongs have been included in the scheme\r\n\r\nof  making  up of new roads in the areas referred to  under  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Integration (Amendment) Bill, because the  residents  concerned are apprehensive. I am anxious to know whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government will proceed with such a scheme and whether  the\r\n\r\nfrontagers  will  be exempted from having to  pay  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaking up such roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to explain my support of the\r\n\r\namendments.  I  support them because this will ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nusers   of   private   roads   will   not   damage   the   roads\r\n\r\nindiscriminately as mentioned in clause 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kampong Kembangan, Mr Speaker, it can be said that all the\r\n\r\nroads have been damaged by the lorries owned by contractors  and\r\n\r\ntimber merchants for the transportation of sand, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nheavy  loads  of earth have resulted in the roads in  this  area\r\n\r\nbeing  extensively  damaged. When these  roads  cannot  be  used\r\n\r\nfurther,  they use the by-roads. For this reason, all the  roads\r\n\r\nin  and  around  Kampong Kembangan are in a state of  disrepair.\r\n\r\nWhen  the Government steps in and repairs the roads the  process\r\n\r\nstarts  again. The roads begin to be damaged, as in the case  of\r\n\r\nJalan  Damai. In the Malay settlement in Jalan Eunos, the  roads\r\n\r\nhave  been  built  by  the Government for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents,  but lorries owned by contractors use the  roads  for\r\n\r\ntheir transport --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The residents are obliged  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to repair such roads for the use of the  people.\r\n\r\nBut  when  the roads have been repaired, they are again damaged.\r\n\r\nIt means that the Government is forever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincurring  people's money on these roads.

This Bill consists of  two  parts,  the\r\n\r\nfirst of which concerns the protection and preservation of  wild\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore, while the second part concerns the  import,\r\n\r\ntranshipment and export of wild animals and birds.  It  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  half a century since the first Ordinance was enacted,  and\r\n\r\nwith  rapid  social and economic development,  the  decline  and\r\n\r\nreduction  of  wild  life  in  Singapore  has  been  inevitable.\r\n\r\nAlthough wild life is no longer of significant importance in our\r\n\r\nState, we should all the same do whatever we can to protect  and\r\n\r\npreserve wild animals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, is of greater\r\n\r\nimportance, as Singapore is strategically situated in the region\r\n\r\nof  South-East Asia where wild life is abundant. A large  number\r\n\r\nof  captured wild animals and birds are being channelled through\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  export to distant destinations like  Europe  and\r\n\r\nAmerica. Many of the wild birds and animals in this region,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Orang Utan and the Bird of Paradise,  are  facing\r\n\r\nextinction due to indiscriminate hunting and killing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many governments in this region as well as international bodies\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the preservation of wild life are  agreed  that\r\n\r\nsteps must be taken to prevent the extinction of wild life,  and\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government has from time to time been requested to\r\n\r\nassist  in  the  prevention  of this  illegal  traffic  in  wild\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanimals  and birds and to discourage indiscriminate hunting  and\r\n\r\nkilling  of  these  animals in their natural habitat.

Not many years ago when our\r\n\r\nlivestock industry was in its infancy, farmers merely fed their\r\n\r\nlivestock with whatever feeding materials they could lay their\r\n\r\nhands on and mixing and cooking them in the farmyard. Such\r\n\r\nmethods of feeding were without regard to the nutritional value\r\n\r\nof the feeding stuffs, and the farmers did not have the benefit\r\n\r\nof scientific techniques of controlled feeding to determine the\r\n\r\ngrowth rate and the quality of the meat produced. But in order\r\n\r\nto achieve more efficient production, it is necessary to ensure\r\n\r\nthat better animal feed rations are prepared on a scientific\r\n\r\nbasis so that the optimum conversion from food to meat can be\r\n\r\nattained. Our farmers have realized this and have gone a long\r\n\r\nway in the utilization \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof specially prepared animal feedstuffs. A number of our\r\n\r\nenterprising citizens have set up factories to produce well\r\n\r\nbalanced animal feed rations on a scientific basis for sale to\r\n\r\nour farmers. The manufacture and supply of feeding stuffs to our\r\n\r\nfarmers is a flourishing business employing many people. It is\r\n\r\nestimated that the amount of animal feeds that are consumed in\r\n\r\nSingapore is well over $100 million annually. The time has now\r\n\r\ncome for some form of Government control to be exercised over\r\n\r\nthe quality of feedstuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any system of control there is bound to be, in such a\r\n\r\nthriving industry, unscrupulous persons who produce animal feeds\r\n\r\nwhich are well below the declared standards, or, what is worse,\r\n\r\nwhich may contain harmful materials that may cause illness and\r\n\r\ndisease to the animals and birds. There is the possibility that\r\n\r\nproperly compounded animal feeds may be adulterated during the\r\n\r\nprocess of storage, handling, and transport by distributors or\r\n\r\nagents before these feeds are sold to the farmers. There have\r\n\r\nbeen instances where feed-millers as a result of ignorance\r\n\r\nincluded materials in the manufactured feeds which have caused\r\n\r\nbad effects on livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore desirable that a system of control should at\r\n\r\nthis stage be introduced by the Government on the manufacture of\r\n\r\nfeeding stuffs in order to protect the farmer from frauds and to\r\n\r\nguarantee him the availability of good quality products. It is\r\n\r\nalso necessary to protect feedstuff producers and distributors\r\n\r\nagainst any unscrupulous practices which may upset the normal\r\n\r\nconditions of competition. Control of the quality of the\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs will give the farmer the right to know the precise\r\n\r\nquantity, the nature of the ingredients and the type of feeding\r\n\r\nstuffs suitable for particular types of livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this Bill will ensure proper standards of\r\n\r\nquality to be prescribed for animal feeds. Stockfeed\r\n\r\nmanufacturers will then be able to expand their sales by\r\n\r\nexporting to overseas markets with the support of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficial documents provided by the Singapore Government to\r\n\r\ncertify the standards of their products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up an Animal Nutritional Unit to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into the utilisation of locally available animal\r\n\r\nfeeding materials and to formulate balanced rations for\r\n\r\nlivestock. The results will be published from time to time for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of farmers and stockfeed manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe Government for introducing the Feedstuffs Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can be sure that such a move wins the all-round\r\n\r\nsupport of the farmer population in Singapore, and this goes to\r\n\r\nshow that the Government has the interests of the farmers at\r\n\r\nheart. Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment has pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is to\r\n\r\ncontrol the manufacture of feedstuffs which are locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured to ensure that, when consumed by poultry or\r\n\r\nanimals, they will not bring ill-consequences to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some time ago, when the price of animal feeds\r\n\r\nand feed concentrates for the manufacture of feedstuffs shot up\r\n\r\nfor obvious reasons, some feedstuffs manufacturers attempted to\r\n\r\nincrease the price of such feeds. This attempt was vigorously resisted by the farmers. Some farmer representatives from my\r\n\r\nconstituency met me and pointed out that if the proposed price\r\n\r\nincrease was to be instituted, many of them, if not all, would\r\n\r\ngo bankrupt. They alleged that they were already suffering from\r\n\r\nthe decrease in egg price on the market. The slump had brought\r\n\r\nabout a sharp decrease in the local egg price. Many farmers\r\n\r\nalleged that some of our feedstuff manufacturers produced a\r\n\r\npoorer quality of feedstuffs when the proposed price increase in\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs was postponed. Consequently many poultry died, and\r\n\r\nalso the eggs that were specially selected \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  hatching purposes did not hatch.  They  had  to  be\r\n\r\npushed on to the market. Mr Speaker, Sir, on this point, I seek\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of this Chamber. With the sharp increase in local\r\n\r\negg production, plus the unhatched eggs on the market, the local\r\n\r\negg   price  has  decreased  sharply,  thereby  threatening  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of many farmers. Fortunately, steps have been  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Government Departments concerned to remedy this serious\r\n\r\nsituation, and I can proudly say that it has been remedied to  a\r\n\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that with the subsequent\r\n\r\nlegislation  of the Feedstuffs Bill, the farmer  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  be sure of being provided with feedstuffs  of  a\r\n\r\nsuitable quality for their poultry as a whole and they can  have\r\n\r\nno   fear  of  their  poultry  perishing  due  to  poor  quality\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs.  Without  proper control  over  the  manufacture  of\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs, they may be driven to financial difficulties if  the\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs manufactured are of poorer quality. Therefore, to sum\r\n\r\nup,  I  say  that this Bill is going to benefit each  and  every\r\n\r\nfarmer in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, as\r\n\r\nthis Feedstuffs Bill affects the livelihood of the farmers - and I\r\n\r\nam  quite conversant with their conditions - I would like to say\r\n\r\na few words on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister and the Backbencher who spoke just\r\n\r\nnow, it seems as if this Bill can resolve all the problems\r\n\r\nconfronting the farmers and can look after the interests of the\r\n\r\nfarmers. But in my view, the passage of this Bill perhaps may\r\n\r\nlead to a situation where the farmers will be burdened with more\r\n\r\nproblems. In actual fact, the provisions of the Bill do not\r\n\r\nclearly provide anything to safeguard the interests of the\r\n\r\nfarmers. I would like to give my views on these two points. I\r\n\r\nhope my views will help the Government to implement something\r\n\r\nthat will not contribute anything adverse to the farmers. From\r\n\r\nmy point of view, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government has not done anything good for the farmers of\r\n\r\nSingapore. For instance, if this Bill were passed, I hope that\r\n\r\nthe situation in future can be somewhat better if feedstuff\r\n\r\nmanufacturers have to get licences for their business and if\r\n\r\nthere are brands and labels for their products. This process can\r\n\r\nbe carried out through the Primary Production Department. In\r\n\r\nthis respect, perhaps the Department concerned may or may not\r\n\r\ncause delay or any inconvenience to the farmers concerned. If\r\n\r\nthere is any inconvenience, then the farmers will have to incur\r\n\r\nmore expenses. I hope that the passage of this Bill will remove\r\n\r\nall anomalies that have existed in the past. For instance, the\r\n\r\nBill provides that there should be certain components to make up\r\n\r\nthe feedstuffs. But if the Bill provides also for the percentage\r\n\r\nof the components of the feedstuffs and the ingredients to be of\r\n\r\na stipulated quality and quantity, then this will be to the\r\n\r\ngood. And there should also be provisions as to the labelling of\r\n\r\nsuch products. Now, the manufacturers concerned, I think, are\r\n\r\nwell prepared. They are well aware of the situation. For instance, a few months ago the farmers of Singapore and those in\r\n\r\nthe business of hatching chickens suffered greatly because of\r\n\r\ncertain inferior feedstuffs These were adulterated with cotton\r\n\r\nseeds, thus leading to the deterioration of the condition of the\r\n\r\nchickens. Although there is a high protein content in cotton\r\n\r\nseeds, there are poisonous ingredients. So, as a result, when\r\n\r\nchickens feed on this, the eggs would not hatch, and the egg\r\n\r\ncontent --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

As far as I\r\n\r\nknow,  cotton  seeds  are  still  being  incorporated  into  the\r\n\r\nfeedstuffs by some of the present manufacturers. So the  adverse\r\n\r\neffect is still there. It is an open secret, because it is quite\r\n\r\na good business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to provide in the Bill a\r\n\r\nformula  of  the components of the ingredients of the feedstuffs\r\n\r\nand  a  scientific table, and so on, in order to  help.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  tabulate  all these  and  give  the  feedstuff\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  a  certain standard to abide by, stipulating  the\r\n\r\npercentages  of  components and ingredients  in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture   of  feedstuffs,  then  it  will   eradicate   the\r\n\r\nmalpractices.  This is also good for the chickens,  because  the\r\n\r\nprotein  content will also be maintained. If the  Government  is\r\n\r\nnot able to do that, and there are any losses and harm done,  it\r\n\r\nis  only  the farmers who will suffer. And if the inspectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  department concerned are lax in their duty in investigating\r\n\r\nthe  situation, then the farmers will also suffer. So I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will look well into this. Do not think  that  by  just\r\n\r\nenumerating  a few clauses in the Bill, he can resolve  all  the\r\n\r\nproblems  and help the farmers.

This Ordinance is administered by two authorities, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health with regard to human health, and the\r\n\r\nVeterinary Division of the Ministry of National Development with\r\n\r\nregard to animal diseases. With the growth of livestock\r\n\r\nindustries in the State over the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlast  decade  and the increased flow of animal traffic  both  in\r\n\r\nnumber  and frequency through Singapore, the legislative  powers\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance\r\n\r\nare no longer adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this inadequacy, the veterinary authorities in\r\n\r\nSingapore have to rely on other legislation such as the  Control\r\n\r\nof  Imports and Exports Ordinance to carry out measures for  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  animal  diseases and the movement  of  animals  and\r\n\r\nanimal  products. However, even this remedy is found  inadequate\r\n\r\nto deal with present-day problems of animal movements and animal\r\n\r\ndiseases.  In  addition,  new subjects such  as  improvement  of\r\n\r\nlivestocks,  the control of livestock products and  the  use  of\r\n\r\nveterinary  drugs  and biologics are matters which  require  new\r\n\r\nlegislation and the close attention of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can take pride in the success and achievements in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  poultry and pig industries over  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears.  It  is  common  knowledge that we  are  not  only \r\n\r\nself-sufficient  in pigs, poultry and eggs, but we are also  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce  and export these items to our neighbouring territories.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, be contented with this but should continue\r\n\r\nto  find ways and means to lower the cost of production of  meat\r\n\r\nand  meat  products in Singapore by improving the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nproduction further. Among the things which we must do  in  order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this  objective is the control and  eradication  of\r\n\r\nlivestock  diseases.  Livestock  diseases  once  introduced   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  will  do  irreparable damage  to  the  livestock  in\r\n\r\ndustries with consequential losses to our farmers. These  powers\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  Bill now before the House  are  necessary  to\r\n\r\ncontrol and eradicate animal diseases. Regulations will be  made\r\n\r\nand enforced to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases from\r\n\r\noverseas,  to  control the movements of livestock and  to  treat\r\n\r\nlivestock diseases through the use of veterinary biologics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and eradication of animal diseases is also of\r\n\r\nparamount importance to public health, as many such diseases are\r\n\r\ncommunicable from animal to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well aware of the danger of the transmission of rabies\r\n\r\nfrom  dogs  to human beings. However, it is comforting  to  know\r\n\r\nthat Singapore has been free from rabies for more than 10 years.\r\n\r\nWe  must  ensure that this will continue, and to do so, constant\r\n\r\nvigilance  and  strict enforcement of rules and  regulations  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  movements  of  dogs  and  cats  is  required.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the  Animals and Birds  Bill  will  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary powers for this work to be carried out effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention of cruelty to animals is at present administered\r\n\r\nunder the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance which is of\r\n\r\n1930 vintage. This subject has now been included as part of  the\r\n\r\nAnimals  and Birds Bill, and the existing Prevention of  Cruelty\r\n\r\nto Animals Ordinance will be repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is at present, Mr Speaker, Sir, an Animals Ordinance for\r\n\r\nthe States of Malaya enacted in 1953. The Animals and Birds Bill\r\n\r\nfollows closely the substance as well as the format of the\r\n\r\nAnimals Ordinance of the States of Malaya. In the Animals\r\n\r\nOrdinance of the States of Malaya, provisions have been made for\r\n\r\nthe Director of Veterinary Services to issue licences permitting\r\n\r\nsuch licensees to treat animals or birds, to possess live\r\n\r\ncultures or vaccines, and to inoculate animals or birds with\r\n\r\nsuch cultures or vaccines. Similar provisions are included in\r\n\r\nclauses 68 and 69 of the Animals and Birds Bill. These two\r\n\r\nsections provide control over the use of dangerous veterinary\r\n\r\nbiologics and the registration and licensing of persons who use\r\n\r\nthem for the treatment of animals and birds. There is at present\r\n\r\nno such control, and unscrupulous persons take advantage of the\r\n\r\nignorance of the farmers and with glib sales-talks persuade\r\n\r\nthese farmers to purchase veterinary biologics at exorbitant\r\n\r\nprices for the treatment of diseases in their animals. Such\r\n\r\ntreatment usually does more harm than good. What is more\r\n\r\ndangerous is that some of these veterinary biologies contain\r\n\r\nlive virus which may themselves cause the spread of diseases\r\n\r\namong animals. Every effort must therefore be made to prevent\r\n\r\nfurther exploitation of farmers and to safeguard livestocks and\r\n\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The States of Malaya are at present contemplating the enactment\r\n\r\nof a Veterinary Surgeons Act which will provide stricter control\r\n\r\nover persons who are to engage in the treatment of animals.  The\r\n\r\nposition in Singapore is somewhat different from that of Malaya.\r\n\r\nWe have a much smaller number of veterinary surgeons and most of\r\n\r\nthem  are  in Government Service. The necessity for  a  parallel\r\n\r\nOrdinance is not apparent. Clauses 68 and 69 of the Animals  and\r\n\r\nBirds  Bill  are  adequate for the present  to  control  persons\r\n\r\ntreating  animals and birds and the use of veterinary  biologics\r\n\r\nuntil  such  time  when  separate comprehensive  legislation  is\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the carrying out of statutory functions\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill,  the  Government  will  build  a  new  animal\r\n\r\nquarantine station costing more than $1 million to be sited next\r\n\r\nto  the  proposed new abattoir at Jurong. Details  of  this  new\r\n\r\nanimal  quarantine station have been finalised and  construction\r\n\r\nwork  is  expected  to  begin soon. In  addition,  a  veterinary\r\n\r\ndiagnostic laboratory has beeen planned during the last 2  years\r\n\r\nto  conduct tests and examination of animals to be imported into\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  well as to carry out a systematic  programme  of\r\n\r\nprevention  and eradication of livestock diseases in the  State.\r\n\r\nThe  first phase of the veterinary diagnostic laboratory costing\r\n\r\n$100,000  has  been  completed  and  the  second  phase   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the laboratory will be included in the next \r\n\r\nFive-year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is a comprehnsive Bill for the control of\r\n\r\nanimals  and  animal diseases to meet the needs of  the  growing\r\n\r\nlivestock  industry in the State.

But can the Government do so? I have great\r\n\r\ndoubts indeed. In the past, the P.A.P. has been bragging about\r\n\r\nits efficiency in controlling diseases and the spread of\r\n\r\ndiseases. But up to date diseases are not truly under control.\r\n\r\nInstead there is a spread of diseases in Singapore, as a result\r\n\r\nof which many farmers have gone bankrupt. I think that many\r\n\r\nfarmers and poultry rearers have gone into bankruptcy mainly\r\n\r\nbecause of the spread of diseases among their livestock on the\r\n\r\none hand, and, on the other hand, because of the marketing\r\n\r\ndifficulties. The marketing problems are not solved, the\r\n\r\ndiseases are not controlled, and so the farmers engaged in\r\n\r\npoultry farming are gravely affected and they have lost\r\n\r\nconfidence in this industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill deals with the import and export\r\n\r\nand transhipment of animals. I do not see anything in the second\r\n\r\npart to make people believe that the Government is encouraging\r\n\r\nthe export of pigs and poultry, our pigs, our chickens and eggs\r\n\r\nare enough for our own consumption, and there is a surplus for\r\n\r\nexport as well. That being so, we should find ways and means to\r\n\r\nestablish our overseas market for our livestock and eggs and\r\n\r\ngive facilities to the farmers. For example, the pigs and eggs\r\n\r\nfrom the Federation are not enough for their own consumption,\r\n\r\nand we can export to the Federation. We understand that\r\n\r\none-third of the production of eggs is exported to the Federation,\r\n\r\nbut there are difficulties arising that confront the farmers,\r\n\r\nand they have to pay one cent on every egg exported to the\r\n\r\nFederation. There is also a provision in the Bill to say that if\r\n\r\nlivestock is exported to the Federation of Malaya, then approval\r\n\r\nand consent has to be obtained from the Malayan Veterinary\r\n\r\nAuthority. This again will give rise to some difficulties. There\r\n\r\nis nothing in the Bill to say how the problems relating to\r\n\r\nmarketing are to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third part of the Bill, as far as I can see,\r\n\r\nthe main points are in clauses 19, 21, 22, 23 and 24. From the\r\n\r\ncontents of this particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection,  I  gather that its main intention is to authorise  and\r\n\r\nempower  the  veterinary officer to conduct an examination  into\r\n\r\nany  birds or animals suspected of disease. There should  be  no\r\n\r\ndissension to this section, but what will be the effect  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination  conducted by the veterinary officer?  For  example,\r\n\r\nthere is one provision in this part to say that if the livestock\r\n\r\nof  any farmer is suspected to have any diseases, then it is the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  the  farmer  to send  the  livestock  to  a  place\r\n\r\nappointed by the veterinary officer for cure or treatment or any\r\n\r\nother necessary examination. On this point, my view is that this\r\n\r\nis  not quite proper. For example, if a farmer has 50 pigs among\r\n\r\nall  his pigs suffering from or suspected of any diseases,  then\r\n\r\nyou  will have to carry all the 50 pigs weighing, say, about  50\r\n\r\npounds or 50 katties each to a place appointed by the veterinary\r\n\r\nofficer. Now, if it is a matter of one or two pigs, it is not so\r\n\r\ndifficult. But if it comes to 50 pigs, then what about the  cost\r\n\r\nof  transportation? Is it to be borne by the farmer  or  by  the\r\n\r\nauthority  concerned? If there are 50 pigs to be sent, then  at\r\n\r\nleast  two lorries will be required to convey them to the  place\r\n\r\nappointed  by the officer concerned and this will give  rise  to\r\n\r\nsome difficulties, financially and physically --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification? The Member will not give\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  will  have time to talk later on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision in this Bill to say that exemption\r\n\r\nmay be granted to a farmer  living  three  miles  beyond  the  limit\r\n\r\nand,  by  this exemption,  the  veterinary officer  will  send  an \r\n\r\nofficer  or somebody else to examine the livestock in question. In my  view,\r\n\r\nI wonder whether the Government has given thought to the setting\r\n\r\nup of a veterinary station within three miles of any farm in the\r\n\r\nState to solve the problems of transporting animals suspected of\r\n\r\ndisease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a  place  appointed by the veterinary officer. I think  more\r\n\r\nveterinary centres should be set up to help the farmers. Clauses\r\n\r\n21, 22 and 25 of the third part of the Bill relate to the points\r\n\r\nI  have  raised. The main aim of those clauses is  that  if  the\r\n\r\nveterinary  officer  thinks that any animals  or  livestock  are\r\n\r\nfound to have any diseases, he can not only examine such animals\r\n\r\nbut  also take steps to isolate or separate or even condemn them\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary. He has even got the power to burn  the  chicken\r\n\r\nruns  and  destroy  the  places in which the  farmer  keeps  the\r\n\r\nanimals suspected of any disease. The tools and other appliances\r\n\r\nused in connection with the feeding of such animals may also  be\r\n\r\ndestroyed. So under such powers if a farmer comes to  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  veterinary officer is coming along to destroy his property,\r\n\r\nhe  is afraid that his own hut may be involved in the process of\r\n\r\ndestruction  and  so  he  will be deterred  from  reporting  any\r\n\r\ndisease  of the animals to the authorities concerned. We  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that  some farmers are conservative in their attitude  and\r\n\r\nsome  have common sense, and they will take their own  steps  to\r\n\r\ncure the animals of their diseases instead of reporting them  to\r\n\r\nthe  authority concerned. All this is because they want to avoid\r\n\r\ntrouble and difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is also a provision in the Bill in\r\n\r\nconnection  with any disease of an animal, but such  things  are\r\n\r\nnot  specified in the Bill. For example, if we have 50  chickens\r\n\r\namong  hundreds of them affected by any disease. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  it is necessary for the farmer to send only the  50  or\r\n\r\nall the chickens for examination. He may be worried about what\r\n\r\nwill happen to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 of the Bill concerns the infected areas. This clause\r\n\r\nprovides that animals suspected of any disease are not to  leave\r\n\r\nthe infected areas. There is no definition of the infected areas\r\n\r\nor  boundaries defined for the infected areas. For  example,  in\r\n\r\nPunggol,  there is a farmer rearing 3.000 chicks of  which  some\r\n\r\nare affected by diseases. Then the rest of the chickens that  he\r\n\r\nhas  will  not be permitted to leave his place for  sale.  So  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfected areas include the whole area of Punggol or that\r\n\r\nparticular area in which the farmer lives. There is no\r\n\r\ndefinition for the term \"infected areas\". If this term includes\r\n\r\nthe whole area of Punggol, then if it so happens that in this\r\n\r\nparticular area of Punggol there is a spread of one disease in\r\n\r\none farmer's family, then the other farmers will be affected in\r\n\r\nthat their chickens and pigs will not be allowed to leave the\r\n\r\nPunggol area for sale in another area. Perhaps this lack of\r\n\r\ndefinition of infected areas is an oversight. But it will give\r\n\r\nrise to difficulties and fears on the part of farmers. In fact,\r\n\r\nfarmers do not know when their animals are affected by any\r\n\r\ndisease. They do not know under what conditions and circumstances they are not to move their animals out of the area\r\n\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have already mentioned this point basically. It\r\n\r\nmay give rise to some undesirable side effects and they may be\r\n\r\ntermed the loopholes of this Bill. So how to eradicate and\r\n\r\nprevent the diseases of animals? Has the Government given\r\n\r\nthought to the employment of more veterinary officers or\r\n\r\nsurgeons? It is clear that a few veterinary centres are not\r\n\r\nenough to carry out the provisions of this Bill. I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat it should be for the farmers themselves to try and help in\r\n\r\nthe eradication and prevention of animal diseases. For this\r\n\r\npurpose, we must educate the farmers. But now it is too late, as\r\n\r\nit appears to me. I can give you an illustration. In the past,\r\n\r\nsome farmers found that their pigs suffered from certain\r\n\r\ndiseases. They went to the veterinary centre, but the officer in\r\n\r\ncharge insisted that the pigs suffering from animal disease\r\n\r\nshould be sent to the centre for an operation and this operation\r\n\r\nmight take two days and the farmer might not like the idea,\r\n\r\nalthough the veterinary officer might well be justified.\r\n\r\nSupposing in the course of two days the other animals infected\r\n\r\ndied? What was to happen to them? So because of this the farmers\r\n\r\nthemselves have lost some confidence in the veterinary centres\r\n\r\nand veterinary officers, and so the better way would be for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government to educate the farmers on how to treat their own\r\n\r\nanimals  when  they  are  suffering  from  a  disease.  If   our\r\n\r\nveterinary officer is able to educate the farmers and give  them\r\n\r\nadvice before the disease is spotted, then with the knowledge of\r\n\r\nhow to treat diseased animals, this will be one step forward  in\r\n\r\nthe prevention of animal diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister has also mentioned just now that\r\n\r\ncertain  clauses  in this Bill are necessary to control  persons\r\n\r\nwho give treatment to animals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The Government\r\n\r\nhas  introduced  this  Bill  with  the  intention  that  private\r\n\r\nveterinarians should be prevented from exploiting  the  farmers.\r\n\r\nThis   shows   that  farmers  do  not  approach  the  Government\r\n\r\nveterinary officers for treatment of their livestock,  but  seek\r\n\r\nthe  services of private veterinarians. Why is this so?  Why  do\r\n\r\nthey  shy away from Government veterinary officers? What is  the\r\n\r\nmain  cause  for this phenomenon? All along the Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen  saying  that they are looking after the farmers'  interest\r\n\r\nvery  well,  taking  good care of them and  looking  into  every\r\n\r\ndetail concerning the livelihood of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nfarmers.  Why  then  are there farmers  who  want  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nservices  of  private veterinarians instead of the  services  of\r\n\r\nGovernment veterinary officers? This shows that the Government's\r\n\r\ntreatment and efforts in respect of veterinary services have not\r\n\r\nbeen adequate in the past, and even up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point about the eradication of diseases of\r\n\r\nlivestock, the Government will have to depend on the cooperation\r\n\r\nof the farmers. The farmers should be educated and taught modern\r\n\r\nmethods of veterinary science, such as inoculation and treatment\r\n\r\nof  animals. They should also be given facilities to enable them\r\n\r\nto  treat the diseased animals themselves. This will, I believe,\r\n\r\ngo  a  long  way  towards helping the farmers and improving  the\r\n\r\nsituation generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister also touched on the examination of\r\n\r\nanimals  imported  from foreign countries in  order  to  prevent\r\n\r\nanimal diseases from spreading to Singapore. The Government has,\r\n\r\non  the other hand, allowed the import of dead pigs and chickens\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore! For instance, there have been imports of frozen\r\n\r\nchickens,   pork,  bacon  and  ham  from  Australia  and   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Such  imports  are not  livestock.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  say that such meat has been processed  and  is\r\n\r\nfree  from any disease. But how can we be sure of that? Have  we\r\n\r\nconsidered the possibility of such imports affecting  our  local\r\n\r\nmarkets in respect of prices for local livestock --- [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was never the\r\n\r\nintention  of  this  Bill  to branch  off  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nmarketing.  The Member for Bukit Panjang has earlier on,  before\r\n\r\nthe tea-break, spoken for quite a long time on marketing matters\r\n\r\nand is now coming back to marketing problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I feel that  this\r\n\r\nsort  of provision in the Bill is unnecessary. If such livestock\r\n\r\nconstitutes  the property of the farmers concerned,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  farmers will have no reason to maltreat or be cruel to  it.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has provision to kill stray animals found on the\r\n\r\nroad.  So  anyone who is inclined to treat animals with  cruelty\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  a  free  hand to do so.  This  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are not really genuine when they say that  they  wish\r\n\r\nto  look  after  the  farmers'  interest  by  providing  various\r\n\r\nfacilities and benefits.

Sir, In actual fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Member's objective is to give a bad impression of us to the\r\n\r\nfarmers and to create fear among the people, so that the farmers\r\n\r\nwill  view with much fear and suspicion all Government  measures\r\n\r\nto  help  them, and thereby prevent them from coming forward  to\r\n\r\nseek help from the Government veterinary officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the Barisan Sosialis have all along  been  saying\r\n\r\nthat  what they can see in the kampongs and rural areas are only\r\n\r\nbankrupt farming communities. If that were so, then it would  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  the  Barisan Sosialis. Our Government  has  been\r\n\r\nimplementing  measures to benefit the people,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.  They  are beginning to awaken to the real  truth,  and\r\n\r\nthey  do  not believe any more in the utterances of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  The  people  appreciate very  much  the  Government's\r\n\r\nfacilities and services offered to improve their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that the whole Bill is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  serve the interests of the farmers. I  cannot  see\r\n\r\nanything  in  it that is bad or detrimental to the  farmers,  as\r\n\r\nstated  by the Member for Bukit Panjang. For instance,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat when a farmer has to convey 50 pigs to a veterinary station\r\n\r\nwhich   happens  to  be  far  away,  it  will  cause  him  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty. I would suggest to the hon. Member that if there  is\r\n\r\nany  disease among the animals, then the farmer concerned should\r\n\r\napproach the veterinary officers. If he does not do this,  then,\r\n\r\nof course, the Barisan Member will be happy because the disease\r\n\r\nwill spread all round and many farmers will suffer loss. The \r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis will then have more capital for propaganda purposes\r\n\r\nto say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government is no good and does not look after the farmers'\r\n\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what the Member for Bukit Panjang has said about clauses\r\n\r\nin  the Bill preventing private veterinarians from practising in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas,  I  would  say that  most  of  these  private\r\n\r\nveterinarians  are not properly trained, and because  they  lack\r\n\r\nexperience and knowledge, they usually do more harm than good to\r\n\r\nthe  farmers, in  this respect, therefore, the Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  legislate  to restrict the practice  of  these \r\n\r\nunder-qualified veterinarians, who may also be inexperienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also mentioned another point. He says that when\r\n\r\nthere  is an outbreak of animal disease or chicken disease,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will then abuse his powers under this Bill. In  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Minister  has no such intention  at  all.  When  the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants  to  declare  a certain  area  infected  with  a\r\n\r\ndisease,  there  must first be many such cases  of  the  disease\r\n\r\nprevailing in that area before he declares it to be infected. In\r\n\r\nmany  cases, only when the disease is spreading among  the  livestock will the Minister declare a certain area infected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang assumes the existence of bankrupt\r\n\r\nrural  farms, and he does not like to see farmers in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  prosper and progress. He says that he has never  been  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit Panjang rural areas - that is why he is talking through\r\n\r\nhis  hat! The Barisan Sosialis is trying every means to  make  a\r\n\r\nmountain out of a molehill for their propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I want to say to the Member for Bukit Panjang who\r\n\r\nseems not to have been to his area at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nexplained  this  matter very well.

He alone will know. The law and regulations provide\r\n\r\nclearly that if the Director of the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment sees fit, then the Government will have the power to\r\n\r\ndestroy all the structures, including livestock, in a certain\r\n\r\narea, without prescribing any compensation for them. Will this\r\n\r\nnot cause fear in the hearts of the farmers? How would you feel\r\n\r\nif the law provides for such possibilities and power? Of course,\r\n\r\nthe farmers are afraid and are living in fear and suspense. Yet\r\n\r\nthe Government turn round and accuse us of wanting to see the\r\n\r\nrural farmers becoming bankrupt!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are in a position to help the farmers, we should carry\r\n\r\nout our responsibilities to them. We should also look into every\r\n\r\ncomplaint from the farmers. This is our hope, that all the\r\n\r\nfarmers can live a comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary has said that certain\r\n\r\nveterinarians are not experienced and are under-qualified. This,\r\n\r\nI think, is not quite true. Sometimes, I myself treat diseased\r\n\r\nanimals. Even my neighbour who lives next to me, in order to\r\n\r\nsave money, also treats his own diseased animals. We also engage\r\n\r\nprivate veterinarians because, in our view, their practice is\r\n\r\neffective and is worth the price we pay them. But Government\r\n\r\nveterinary officers are not so experienced as private\r\n\r\nveterinarians. Just look at what we have experienced ourselves.\r\n\r\nCan you say that private veterinarians are not experienced when\r\n\r\nthey produce better results? How do you explain that? Even a\r\n\r\ncertain officer of the Primary Production Department is looking\r\n\r\nfor private veterinarians to help in the rural areas. Certain\r\n\r\nofficers in high positions and the Chairmen of certain\r\n\r\ncommittees in the relevant trades also have a very high regard\r\n\r\nfor these private veterinarians.

The Minister for National Development says that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken good care of the farmers over the past few\r\n\r\nyears and that production in the farms has increased\r\n\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whenever Members on this side raise certain\r\n\r\nmatters  of actual fact, they are prevented from doing  so.  The\r\n\r\nMinisters  do  not  seem to know of such facts,  and  they  just\r\n\r\nlisten  in  surprise! Certain diseases are widespread among  the\r\n\r\nlivestock  and the Government is unable to control  them.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of Government's inability to control the diseases,  many\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  suffered  losses and they have  become  bankrupt.\r\n\r\nTheir debts are mounting and they are far from being able to  pay\r\n\r\ntheir  debts.  Feedstuffs manufacturers are also unable  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  money  from the farmers to whom they have supplied  their\r\n\r\nfeedstuff. The Government has not carried out its duty  properly\r\n\r\nand  adequately  to look after the interest of  the  people  and\r\n\r\nfarmers by trying to solve their everyday difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases of disease spreading among the livestock\r\n\r\nof  some farmers, and it takes a few days before the officers of\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department come to look into the matter.\r\n\r\nThis  delay results in losses. The Government, it is  true,  has\r\n\r\ntaken  steps  to inoculate animals and poultry,  but  still  the\r\n\r\ndiseases are not prevented from spreading. In fact, before inoculation,  some  chickens were even fatter, but after inoculation,\r\n\r\nthey grew thinner day by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear that in spite of the so called medical care\r\n\r\ngiven by the Government, the livestock has not enjoyed any good\r\n\r\nhealth, or better health. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development said a moment ago that the points\r\n\r\nraised by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  colleague with regard to the diseases of certain  pigs  were\r\n\r\nof,  minor  importance. This is what he said. We  can  see  that\r\n\r\nwhenever there is a spread of diseases in the livestock of pigs,\r\n\r\nthis  spread will cause the farmers to convey their animals  and\r\n\r\nchickens over a long distance for treatment, even when there  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  suspicion  of  a few animals or chickens  among  a  few\r\n\r\nhundreds  or  thousands.  Now, is  this  not  a  difficulty  and\r\n\r\ninconvenience  for the farmers? Will not the farmers  themselves\r\n\r\nbe put in fear of the troubles? If the Government intends really\r\n\r\neffectively to look after the health of livestock in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  then  I suggest that it is the business of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department to instil common medical  knowledge  into\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  so  that they themselves will be  able  to  detect\r\n\r\ndiseases and treat minor cases by themselves, instead of  having\r\n\r\nto   go  through  the  rigmarole  of  sending  chickens  to  the\r\n\r\nveterinary centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen\r\n\r\nthe performance of the Barisan Members in this House. They\r\n\r\ntry  to get even some votes over the problems of the pigs.  They\r\n\r\nhave  been most inconsistent in their speeches. As the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National  Development has put it clearly,  because  of  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy  of  existing  Ordinances,  the  Government  have  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  new laws to improve the conditions of the farmers  to\r\n\r\ncatch  up with time. This is realistic in approach, but  instead\r\n\r\nof getting support, we have seen the Barisan Members criticising\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  When we want to put aside one million  dollars\r\n\r\nfor the improvement of the farmers' livelihood, they want us  to\r\n\r\nput  in  ten million dollars. They are expecting much more  than\r\n\r\nrealistic things from us, and they do so in order to attract the\r\n\r\nfarmers to their side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we can see very clearly from our daily life\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for National Development is often seen to  be\r\n\r\ndiscussing  problems with the farmers themselves  to  get  their\r\n\r\nviews, so that steps will be taken in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordance  with such views and to improve the living  standards\r\n\r\nof  the  farmers and to improve the primary production services.\r\n\r\nWe  have  already  taught the farmers the modern  techniques  in\r\n\r\nrearing pigs and other animals, so that their production will be\r\n\r\nincreased  and their income similarly increased.  This  has  all\r\n\r\nalong  been our objective and we have been doing pretty well.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see how the Barisan Members can deny this fact, instead\r\n\r\nof  talking  about the actual needs of the farmers  at  present.\r\n\r\nthey have sidetracked and talked about something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as the Member for Bukit Panjang has said just\r\n\r\nnow,  when a pig falls sick, it is not necessary for the  farmer\r\n\r\nto  carry  it to the veterinary officer. Instead the  veterinary\r\n\r\nofficer  must  go to the farmer's house and treat  the  pig.  We\r\n\r\nagree  this is a better way if there are enough pigs to  justify\r\n\r\nthe  visit of the veterinary officer at the farm. But if  it  is\r\n\r\nonly an individual case, that would be too much trouble and most\r\n\r\nuneconomical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he really mean that the National Development Ministry\r\n\r\nshould not send out properly trained veterinary officers to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  diseases  of  the livestock  or  does  he  want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  encourage  the  farmers  to  prefer   untrained\r\n\r\nveterinary personnel to trained personnel, resulting in a  great\r\n\r\nloss of lives of the animals? All this talk is most unrealistic\r\n\r\nand beside the point. If they really desire to help the farmers,\r\n\r\nthen  they  should study the main points in the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development. Then they would realise  that\r\n\r\nit is the intention of the Government to look after the farmers'\r\n\r\ninterest in a practical manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwe  have  heard  the  Member for Jalan  Besar  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to look after the interest of the farmers  and\r\n\r\nthat is why the Government has introduced this Bill. But this is\r\n\r\na great humbug. The Member for Bukit Panjang has said just now,\r\n\r\nvery  clearly, that there are many loopholes in this Bill  which\r\n\r\nmight  give  rise to actual difficulties. But in his  reply  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  unable  to  give us a clearer picture in relation  to  the\r\n\r\npossible difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the performance of the Government over the past\r\n\r\nfew  years.  Over the radio the Government has said that  it  is\r\n\r\nlooking  after the interests of the people very well.  You  must\r\n\r\nnot  ill-treat the dogs, you must not ill-treat the cats,  ducks\r\n\r\nand  chickens. And that is what they say, they are looking after\r\n\r\nthe interests of the farmers. Now if you do not give them actual\r\n\r\nhelp  to  develop  their farm and increase their  production  in\r\n\r\npoultry  and in vegetable gardening, what is the actual  use  of\r\n\r\nsuch talk? In fact, there are many farmers in the State who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to continue farming because they cannot make ends  meet.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  difficult for them to continue farming  or  poultry\r\n\r\nrearing. The Government has not been able to give them practical\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the form of assistance that the Government is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  give?  The Government is  not  able  to  put  into\r\n\r\npractice effective measures to control the spread of diseases or\r\n\r\nto prevent the spread of any diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of marketing land and the\r\n\r\nfluctuation of the price in poultry and other primary  products.\r\n\r\nAll  these  years has the Government been able to put forward  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to improve generally the rural areas? Because\r\n\r\nof  the absence of any comprehensive plan, the rural economy  is\r\n\r\nnearing  bankruptcy.  One  can see that  the  cost  of  eggs  is\r\n\r\ndecreasing. What is the Government doing to increase  the  price\r\n\r\nof  eggs?  Instead  of doing something practical,  it  is  only\r\n\r\ntrying  to  legislate  to see that better quality  feedstuff  is\r\n\r\navailable. Then we come to the --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been very patient. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  must really go back to the Animals and Birds Bill.  Will\r\n\r\nhe come back to the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in this Bill\r\n\r\nthe Government seeks to control the diseases of animals, but the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  should be shouldered by the farmers  themselves.\r\n\r\nbecause  if  the  Government thinks that there is  a  spread  of\r\n\r\ndisease  in  a certain area, then the animals will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncondemned,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand some chicken runs and other structures will have to be\r\n\r\ndestroyed without any compensation. Do you think the farmers\r\n\r\nwill report any suspicion of disease to the Government just to\r\n\r\ninvite such great loss? If such a report is made, then they will\r\n\r\nrun the risk of having their property destroyed; so they will\r\n\r\nnot seek the assistance of the Government in trying to detect or\r\n\r\ncure any disease in their livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has tried to say just now that the\r\n\r\nMinister would not abuse the powers of this Bill to declare any\r\n\r\nplace an infected area unnecessarily in any individual cases.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that in any section of a place there may be a\r\n\r\nspread of a disease and this will give rise to great\r\n\r\ninconvenience and trouble in view of the powers given by this\r\n\r\nBill. I think the farmers should be given the liberty to\r\n\r\ncomplain to the Government of any difficulties, otherwise they\r\n\r\nwill not report any suspicion or actual spread of disease to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Members on this side have already given their criticism of\r\n\r\nthe loopholes in this Bill, and the conclusion one can draw is\r\n\r\nthat the introduction of this Bill reflects the difficulties and\r\n\r\nthe near bankruptcy of the rural areas. And if this Bill must be\r\n\r\npassed, then I urge upon the Government to give some form of\r\n\r\ncompensation if any structure of the farmer is to be destroyed\r\n\r\non the discovery of any disease. And then the Government should\r\n\r\ntake practical steps to enlarge the market for poultry and eggs,\r\n\r\notherwise eggs will be falling in price, from six cents to five\r\n\r\ncents. Then there should be a comprehensive programme for the\r\n\r\ncontrol of diseases among the animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non the subject of the Bill which we are debating now, the\r\n\r\nopposition from the Barisan Sosialis Members appears to show\r\n\r\ntheir sympathy to whom they think will give their support to\r\n\r\nthem at some future time. They obviously are ignorant as to the\r\n\r\nbest method to be employed to raise the living standards of\r\n\r\npoultry rearers in the rural areas. As has been said by the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost  of  eggs should be increased. But the Opposition, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, are not aware that in order for the cost of eggs  to\r\n\r\nbe increased, the quality of the eggs should be improved, if the\r\n\r\neggs  produced are of a lower quality, naturally the prices  are\r\n\r\nlow,  then the Government is responsible for ensuring that  good\r\n\r\nquality  eggs are produced. Thus with the increased  prices  for\r\n\r\nthese   eggs,   their  standard  of  living   will   be   raised\r\n\r\nproportionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding transport mentioned by the Opposition, if this Bill\r\n\r\nis passed, it will cause inconvenience to the farmers to have to\r\n\r\ntransport  their animals and birds for the purpose of injection.\r\n\r\nThat  is  up to the farmers. If they want to see their  products\r\n\r\nimprove  in quality, then it is part of their duty to  transport\r\n\r\ntheir  animals or birds to the veterinary centres. If our  child\r\n\r\nis  sick and we want to see it treated, we have to bring  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  General Hospital even though we may have to travel  a  long\r\n\r\ndistance. This is an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of compensation, what is the rate of\r\n\r\ncompensation  paid to farmers who have diseased animals  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry?  Of  course, the Government is responsible  for  seeing\r\n\r\nthat the birds or animals which may be the cause of infection be\r\n\r\ndestroyed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. That  is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to consider. Not just by paying compensation to\r\n\r\nthe poultry farmers. As I have said earlier on, what is the rate\r\n\r\nof compensation to be paid to defaulting poultry farmers who are\r\n\r\nresponsible for spreading diseases so that diseases will not  be\r\n\r\nspread  further to the neighbours and so on? It is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  the Government to see  that  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nproductivity is increased, which means that it will  be  healthy\r\n\r\nto  the State of Singapore. That is all I have to say today, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I hear Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  saying that in the last five years  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has done nothing for the farmers and that most of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers  are  bankrupt or are going bankrupt. As to whether  the\r\n\r\nfarmers are going bankrupt or not, there are facts to show  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  five years, instead of  the  trade  in  eggs,\r\n\r\npoultry and pork being reduced, it has increased. From being  an\r\n\r\nimporter of chickens, eggs and pigs, we are now the exporter. It\r\n\r\nwhat  they say is true, that during the last five years we  have\r\n\r\ndone  nothing  for the farmers and that they are going  bankrupt\r\n\r\nquickly,  their trade would have been dead by now.  This  is  an\r\n\r\ninstance of where Members of the Opposition are trying to  bluff\r\n\r\nthe  public. I do not know whether they really have the interest\r\n\r\nof  the farmers at heart or they are just here to play politics,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  they really do have the interest of the farmers  at\r\n\r\nheart,  they  have  had more than five months  since  the  First\r\n\r\nReading  of this Bill to send in amendments and make suggestions\r\n\r\nfor  improvement.  On  the one hand, they say,  \"Look,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontrol diseases.\" On the other hand, when we bring up this Bill\r\n\r\nto  control diseases they say. \"This is in no way any aid to the\r\n\r\nfarmers at all.\" They say again that our veterinary surgeons and\r\n\r\nveterinary  centres are of no assistance at all to the  farmers.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are of no assistance to the farmers, how  is  it  that\r\n\r\nsuggestions come from them that we should build more  veterinary\r\n\r\ncentres? So all in all, Mr Speaker, Sir, they are talking with\r\n\r\ntheir  tongues in their cheeks. Absolutely, they do not  believe\r\n\r\nin what they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is evident that in order to improve our\r\n\r\nlivestock, some sort of control must be accepted by the  farmers\r\n\r\n-  control of disease, control of feedstuffs. And when enforcing\r\n\r\nany regulation, of course, there will be difficulties, and it is\r\n\r\nalways  the  policy of the Government when enforcing regulations\r\n\r\nto  see  that  our  officers carry out  our  policy  in  a  very\r\n\r\npractical  and  common  sense way. Some  of  the  administrative\r\n\r\ndifficulties  which  they have brought up will,  of  course,  be\r\n\r\nlooked into and I can give the farmers every assurance that this\r\n\r\nBill  is  not  there, as the Opposition alleges, to make  things\r\n\r\nmore  difficult for them.

I would like  now  to\r\n\r\ntouch on the main points of these representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill presented earlier, housing development was defined\r\n\r\nto  include the financing for development. It has been agreed in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee that banks and insurance companies, in so  far\r\n\r\nas  they provide money for housing development, will be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of the Bill. A suggestion has been made that\r\n\r\nthe  new  law  should  be made to apply  only  to  houses  under\r\n\r\nconstruction and for sale, and should not apply to houses  built\r\n\r\nfor   investment  which  should  not  be  construed  as  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment  coming within the provisions of the Bill.  To  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  it  must be emphasised that making  provisions  for\r\n\r\nsuch  exemption  would  create loopholes  in  the  Bill  leading\r\n\r\neventually to evasion and defeating the objects of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nbest  recourse, therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, would  be  that  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  developer building for investment,  he  should\r\n\r\napply for exemption from the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to stifle private enterprise in\r\n\r\nthe provision of housing for the middle and higher income\r\n\r\nsections of the population. If development is clearly intended\r\n\r\nfor investment and an application is made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the Minister, it is unlikely that exemption will be withheld.\r\n\r\nBut  in  providing  for legislation of this nature  we  have  to\r\n\r\nensure that there should be no loopholes whereby speculators, on\r\n\r\nthe  pretext  of  building houses ostensibly for investment  but\r\n\r\nwith  the real purpose of sale, can remain outside the scope  of\r\n\r\nthis law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objections have been raised against the penalties imposed under\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance,  particularly regarding  a  prison  sentence  in\r\n\r\naddition  to a fine. I must emphasise, however, that  in  laying\r\n\r\ndown  the scale of punishment under the Bill, the main objective\r\n\r\nis  to  serve a warning on unscrupulous developers and to  deter\r\n\r\nthem. Those who carry out their business in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nlaw will have nothing to fear. Hence, where a developer attempts\r\n\r\nto  carry out his business without a licence, he deserves to  be\r\n\r\npunished by both a fine and imprisonment. If notwithstanding our\r\n\r\nefforts  to regulate proper practice a housing developer  defies\r\n\r\nthe  law, then he does not deserve sympathy and only a  term  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment  will  be sufficient to discourage  this.  Although\r\n\r\nimprisonment has been laid down in the Bill, the length  of  the\r\n\r\nprison  term will be a matter for the court to decide, depending\r\n\r\non the gravity of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sorry plight of so many purchasers having been cheated\r\n\r\nwithout  any  redress  or remedy warrants the  imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nprison sentence for any person who undertakes the business of  a\r\n\r\nhousing  developer without a licence. In other cases of offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  after  a  licence has been issued,  the  imprisonment\r\n\r\nsentence is not mandatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important point which was raised in the Select Committee,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, was the condition under the  Bill  requiring\r\n\r\nthat  the company doing housing development must have a  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital  of  half a million dollars. It was suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  such  a large amount of  capital  would  stifle\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The Select Committee, after consideration of  their\r\n\r\nrepresentation, agreed to reduce this sum to $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should further like to point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthere is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister in his\r\n\r\ndiscretion can waive or vary the amount of the deposit in order\r\n\r\nthat reputable persons or companies with smaller capital but\r\n\r\ndesirous of carrying out housing development on a modest scale\r\n\r\nmay still be able to contribute towards housing development in\r\n\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have also been made for appeals against the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Controller to be referred to the High Court and\r\n\r\nnot to the Minister as intended in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has agreed that appeals against the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Controller in regard to the grant of a licence\r\n\r\nshall be made to the High Court. But if a housing developer is\r\n\r\naggrieved by the decision of the Controller in regard to the\r\n\r\nvarying or revocation of any existing conditions of the licence,\r\n\r\nor impose conditions or additional conditions, such appeals\r\n\r\nshall be referred to the Minister whose decision shall be final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, various minor amendments have also been\r\n\r\nincorporated into the Bill. The provision requiring a housing\r\n\r\ndeveloper to exhibit his audited accounts, balance sheet and\r\n\r\nparticulars of officers managing the business in the office, is\r\n\r\nsubstituted by the requirement that the audited accounts shall\r\n\r\nbe forwarded to the Controller and published in the Gazette\r\n\r\nwithin three months of the close of the financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Select Committee, having considered both\r\n\r\nthe oral and written representations received on this Bill, has\r\n\r\nagreed to make the amendments which I have indicated above. The\r\n\r\nBill as now amended is a piece of legislation which at this\r\n\r\nstage of Singapore's development is clearly desirable in order\r\n\r\nto promote a class of housing developers who besides making a\r\n\r\nprofit would ensure a square deal for purchasers of housing\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to ensure that buyers will not be cheated\r\n\r\nor forced into one-sided agreements or saddled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  sub-standard houses. This Bill is also timely  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  urbanisation and the re-development of  the  central\r\n\r\nareas  of  the City whereby large areas will be re-developed  to\r\n\r\nmake  way  for  well  planned  and properly  constructed  flats,\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, business districts complete  with  social  and\r\n\r\npublic amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of large-scale urban redevelopment is a task which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  cannot  handle adequately  by  itself.  Private\r\n\r\nenterprise would be invited or induced to participate. Thus, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is desirable that there should be  established\r\n\r\nby  licensing  and control a new generation of  private  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers    with    sufficient   financial    resources    and\r\n\r\norganisational  ability  to help the  Government  in  urban \r\n\r\nre-development to make Singapore a better and more prosperous city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill, as amended, accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SALARY OF SPEAKER</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move the motion* standing in my name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 25 of the Constitution of the States\r\n\r\nof Singapore, the salary of the Speaker with effect from the\r\n\r\n2nd November, 1964, shall be $1,750 a month.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I explain to the House the procedure under which  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker's salary has been decided at $1,750? Under the Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the salary and other emoluments  of  the  Speaker\r\n\r\nmust  be  determined  from  time  to  time  by  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly. Therefore, it is necessary that today we have to  move\r\n\r\nthis motion to decide on the Speaker's salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister first approached you, Mr Speaker, to\r\n\r\ndiscuss your appointment as Speaker of the Assembly, and you had\r\n\r\nindicated to him that you could only consider the appointment if\r\n\r\nyou  were allowed to continue your private practice as a  lawyer\r\n\r\nand solicitor. The Prime Minister agreed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  and,  therefore,  it  became  necessary  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  your  salary as Speaker of this  House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full salary of $3,000 payable to the Speaker was fixed on the\r\n\r\nbasis that  the Speaker would do no other job than that of the Speaker\r\n\r\nof the Assembly. It is apparent that if the Speaker were allowed\r\n\r\nto continue his private practice, an adjustment would have to be\r\n\r\nmade to the full salary of the Speaker, which had been fixed  on\r\n\r\na  different  basis. Therefore, it became necessary to  consider\r\n\r\nunder  these  circumstances what would  constitute  a  fair  and\r\n\r\nproper salary for a part-time Speaker. It was, therefore, agreed\r\n\r\nbetween Mr Speaker and the Prime Minister that $1,750 would  be\r\n\r\na  compromise.  In  addition to this salary, the  Speaker  still\r\n\r\nenjoys other perquisites in order to maintain the dignity of his\r\n\r\noffice; for example, a house, a gardener, a car, a chauffeur and\r\n\r\nan entertainment vote. The lowering of the salary, therefore, in\r\n\r\nno  way is intended to reflect on the duty and the status of the\r\n\r\npost of the Speaker, and if a future Speaker should take on this\r\n\r\njob on a full-time basis, then, of course, the salary would have\r\n\r\nto be reconsidered and possibly the full salary paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 25 of the Constitution of the State\r\n\r\nof Singapore, the salary of thc Speaker with effect from the 2nd\r\n\r\nNovember, 1964, shall be $1,750 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION AT SOUTH QUAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The project will take about four years and will cost\r\n\r\napproximately $53 million. The utilisation of the reclaimed land\r\n\r\nhas  as  yet not been decided. There is, however, no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthis  reclamation  will relieve the acute land shortage,  making\r\n\r\navailable  sites  for  much  needed  community  facilities.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  it is also proposed to construct a coastal road  from\r\n\r\nthe City to Katong, Bedok and Changi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am rising to\r\n\r\nexpress  my views on the motion tabled by the Minister for  Law.\r\n\r\nOn  the  25th of last month, the Minister for Law spoke  to  the\r\n\r\nPress about the reclamation programme  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the east coast. He said that we must  plan  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  in  regard to land in view of the increasing population.\r\n\r\nHe  also was reported to have said that the reclamation  on  the\r\n\r\neast  coast was to build a scenic area for Singapore. It is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult  for the people to see that the reclamation  programme\r\n\r\nof the Government is not intended to resolve the difficulties of\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  their livelihood, but is  intended  for  an  unrealistic  purpose,  because by 1990 there  will  be  4  million\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore and yet we still allow a lot of land  to  be\r\n\r\noccupied  by the British bases. In Siglap and Changi the  people\r\n\r\nare faced with problems arising out of land reclamation and they\r\n\r\nare  rather uneasy, because by 1990 the population will reach  4\r\n\r\nmillion  and they are more concerned, in fact, with the question\r\n\r\nof  resettlement.  People who live on this land  and  depend  on\r\n\r\nfarming  are not worried about whether there is any scenic  spot\r\n\r\non the island of Singapore. But they are more concerned with the\r\n\r\nrealistic  aspects of life. But the Minister for Law, in  trying\r\n\r\nto  pass  this  motion, will create some realistic problems  for\r\n\r\npersons  affected by the land reclamation programme.  Now,  they\r\n\r\nare occupying land and paying quit rent of two to three dollars.\r\n\r\nBut  when they are faced with the problem of resettlement,  they\r\n\r\nare worried whether they will be able to pay the rent in Selegie\r\n\r\nHouse  at the rate of $66.50 per month, or whether they will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to stay in Aljunied Road Housing Board flats at the  rate\r\n\r\nof $55 per month, instead of two to three dollars per month on a\r\n\r\nbigger piece of land. These are the problems that the people are\r\n\r\nmore  concerned with. There are many small shopkeepers  who  are\r\n\r\nconcerned with the possibility of being evicted out of shops  at\r\n\r\na lower rental, into shops at $500 to $600 rental per month. The\r\n\r\nGovernment is now asking some German architects and engineers to\r\n\r\nreclaim  the land. This will cost a lot of money. We  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is spending some $53 million on  the  land\r\n\r\nreclamation programme. On an average, every acre will cost about\r\n\r\n$52,000 to develop. The Government only pays $2,000 per acre  as\r\n\r\ncompensation to those who will be evicted from the land. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can allot only half of the sum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nused  on reclamation to these people who are evicted from  their\r\n\r\nown  land,  that will be much better than making  them  bankrupt\r\n\r\notherwise. The people evicted have been concerned by the  Government's  unreasonable  compensation. Why  should  the  Government\r\n\r\nspend  $53  million of the taxpayer's money on  contractors  and\r\n\r\nmerchants  from  Germany  and  other  places?  Why  should   the\r\n\r\nGovernment not use this sum of money on the people themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has also said that the\r\n\r\npeople  should be taken care of and that the compensation  terms \r\n\r\nshould be adequate to meet their losses. We are concerned  about\r\n\r\nthe  fate  and condition and troubles of the evicted people  who\r\n\r\nhave  been staying on the east coast. The Government has divided\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas into two classes. One is agricultural area  and\r\n\r\nthe other is non-agricultural area --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

The people staying in these areas are faced with\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. The price of eggs has gone down on the one hand, and\r\n\r\nthe price of feedstuffs has gone up on the other hand. The\r\n\r\npeople who are asked to move out from their land incur great\r\n\r\nlosses. They have spent several thousand dollars or even tens of\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars to build up their present business, and yet\r\n\r\nthe Government is paying compensation of a lesser amount to\r\n\r\npeople and merchants who are evicted from their land. The\r\n\r\npresent accommodation allotted by the Government is hired out at\r\n\r\nvery high rentals. All the measures taken are not reasonable.\r\n\r\nShop houses in Geylang Serai have been demolished and the\r\n\r\ncompensation has been very inadequate. When they built up their\r\n\r\nshophouses in Geylang Serai area, they had to pay thousands of\r\n\r\ndollars of tea money --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The  people\r\n\r\nliving  there  have  accumulated their  wealth  through  several\r\n\r\ngenerations  and have built up their livelihood there  and  they\r\n\r\nlive  out  of  the  land.  They have  planted  fruit  trees  and\r\n\r\nvegetable  crops to maintain their living. The land they  bought\r\n\r\nin  the past in this area fetches a different price from that of\r\n\r\nbefore.  A  piece  of land that can fetch tens of  thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars per acre can fetch only $2,000 to $3,000 of compensation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government.  Under these  circumstances,  the  living\r\n\r\nconditions of the rural people in that area have been  adversely\r\n\r\naffected. Small merchants and hawkers are faced with bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThat is why the residents, in the face of forced eviction by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, are not willing to remove even when faced with  fire\r\n\r\non their site --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Member:</b> Do not read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on the question of\r\n\r\nthe  sea  coast  along  the  Bedok area,  the  eviction  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  there  is  the first part of  the  reclamation  work.\r\n\r\nUnless   the  residents  can  be  chased  out,  the  reclamation\r\n\r\nprogramme cannot be carried out. So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis affects people, including those staying on hillocks and  in\r\n\r\nthat  area. If the people staying there are affected, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should look into their conditions. So I  suggest  as\r\n\r\nfollows to the Minister concerned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Government, in implementing its reclamation programme,\r\n\r\nshould compensate adequately the residents in the Bedok area and\r\n\r\npeople  who  stay  in  the Changi area and who  are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nagricultural work. The Government should not use any  excuse  or\r\n\r\npretext  to  refuse  adequate  compensation  to  the  residents,\r\n\r\nespecially the farmers there. It should not use the pretext that\r\n\r\nthe  houses  built by the farmers there have not been officially\r\n\r\napproved  by  the Government. In fact, many of the houses  there\r\n\r\nwere  built  long ago, and therefore the Government  should  not\r\n\r\ngroup  them into different classes. All the people there  should\r\n\r\nhe regarded as farmers engaged in agricultural work --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow this to go on very much\r\n\r\nlonger.  I  have  been very tolerant to the  Member,  because  I\r\n\r\nthought  that  during the earlier stages of the debate,  he  was\r\n\r\nmaking  the  point that Government could utilise its money  much\r\n\r\nbetter by helping the squatters. He has made his point and  must\r\n\r\nget  on with the topic of reclamation. And reclamation does  not\r\n\r\nmean eviction of squatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, allow me to say\r\n\r\nthat the eviction of residents is connected with reclamation\r\n\r\nwork - before the programme can be carried out. So we see\r\n\r\nlarge-scale eviction taking place when the Government implements its\r\n\r\nprogramme of land reclamation. I hope in carrying out the work\r\n\r\nof land reclamation, the Government will try to lessen any\r\n\r\nadverse effects on the residents concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your things are destroyed by the Government,\r\n\r\nsurely you expect the Government to pay you compensation. Many\r\n\r\npeople in Bedok are worried; particularly those living in the\r\n\r\nsmall hills are affected by the reclamation programme. They\r\n\r\nexpect the Government to provide them with alternative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npieces  of land in the neighbourhood, so that  they  can\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with  their farming activities. They  also  expect  a\r\n\r\nhigher compensation rate from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Law has also said just now that\r\n\r\nland  is  very  scarce  in Singapore. That  is  why,  after  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  chased the squatters out from  where  they  are\r\n\r\nwithout  adequate resettlement or rehousing or without  adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation terms, the squatters are at a loss where to go,  in\r\n\r\nview of the scarcity of land in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the responsibility of the Government to give\r\n\r\na  special  rent  subsidy to those shopkeepers affected  by  the\r\n\r\nreclamation  programme  when  they  are  asked  to  do  business\r\n\r\nelsewhere or in Housing Board shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Tampines area, a family was\r\n\r\nasked to vacate\r\n\r\nits  place,  and it was given only $500 by way of  compensation.\r\n\r\nThis  family  was actually running a shop in that area  and  for\r\n\r\nthis shop they only received $500 compensation. This family  was\r\n\r\nthen  asked to do business in a Housing Board shop at a rent  of\r\n\r\n$500  per  month. How can we say that the Government  is  really\r\n\r\nlooking  after the interests of the poor people? I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat, in cases where people have been affected by the Government\r\n\r\nreclamation  programme, they should be given higher compensation\r\n\r\nand  alternative  accommodation or shops  at  a  low  rental.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that in the case of shopkeepers affected, the Government\r\n\r\nshould build --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj):</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

What is  the  \r\n\r\ncompensation given to these people? At present, the rate of $3,000 for\r\n\r\neach  family is not adequate, when compared with the actual cost\r\n\r\nof  the  land. Some pieces of land cost $10,000 to  $20,000  per\r\n\r\nacre instead of $3,000 per acre. So the Government would do well\r\n\r\nto give adequate compensation to the small-holders in this area,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in view of the fact that you require some  $50,000\r\n\r\nto $60,000 to reclaim one acre of land in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, has the Government intended to alleviate the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the persons affected? The views expressed by  me\r\n\r\nshould  receive the Minister's attention and are a real test  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's sincerity in trying to improve the  livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  On the one hand, these people do  not  receive\r\n\r\nadequate compensation and, on the other hand, they are forced to\r\n\r\nstay in another place at a high rental which they cannot afford.\r\n\r\nThe Government is treating the people as fools if it does so.

Therefore,  we  came  up\r\n\r\nwith   the   present   plan  of  using  a  mechanical   conveyor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelt, so that there would be minimum disruption to the lives  of\r\n\r\nthe people living in and around Bedok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other point which the Opposition is always harping on\r\n\r\nis  that  compensation rates are inadequate. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the last five years we have made a review of the  compensation  rates,  and for their information, I am glad  to  inform\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  the people of Singapore  have  accepted  that\r\n\r\nSingapore should be redeveloped, that there should be newer  and\r\n\r\nbetter  buildings, and they have accepted our compensation  plan\r\n\r\nand  they  are willing to move out on the compensation rates  we\r\n\r\ngive. In fact, I have received many letters with regard to urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  as well as resettlement elsewhere. These writers  wrote\r\n\r\nto  me and said, \"We agree wholeheartedly with your attempts and\r\n\r\nwith  your  plans for the redevelopment of Singapore.  Will  you\r\n\r\njust  see  that in moving us you give us as little inconvenience\r\n\r\nas  possible?\" We have done that. During the last five years  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  moving about four to five thousand  people,  and  in\r\n\r\nplace  of that we have been able to rehouse about three to  four\r\n\r\nhundred  thousand people. So, as far as we are  concerned,  they\r\n\r\nwill keep on harping that compensation rates are not fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in this House before that legally these squatters\r\n\r\nare not entitled to compensation, but as a Government that looks\r\n\r\nafter  the welfare of the people of this country, we thought  it\r\n\r\nfair that these people, when being moved out to make way for new\r\n\r\nredevelopment, should not suffer unduly, and we  are  doing  our\r\n\r\nvery best to see that in moving them out we will cause as little\r\n\r\ndisruption  to  their  livelihood and their  way  of  living  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do\r\n\r\nnot  propose to take up too much time of the House to  reply  to\r\n\r\nthe  Members  opposite, but I would like to remind them  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that they must accept a major principle. This principle  is\r\n\r\nthat  the wealth of the nation should be used on the development\r\n\r\naspect  of  the country. I would like to ask them  to  face  the\r\n\r\nrealistic problem at present, which is that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore the population is fast increasing. This increased rate\r\n\r\nof  population is fantastic. Every year we have some 60,000  new\r\n\r\nbabies  coming  into  this part of the  world.  So  the  problem\r\n\r\narising  out of the increased population should be tackled  well\r\n\r\nahead by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible Government we should solve this problem in\r\n\r\nadvance  and  think of the future, quite apart from the  present\r\n\r\nday.  In  other  words, you must dig the  well  before  you  are\r\n\r\nthirsty,  otherwise it may be too late. This is a practical  and\r\n\r\nrealistic  proverb. Instead of thinking along those lines  as  I\r\n\r\nhave   suggested,  the  Barisan  Members  have  failed  to  give\r\n\r\nconstructive  suggestions to help the Government in implementing\r\n\r\nits  projects. Instead they go on harping on the old  tune  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is not properly looking after the interest of the\r\n\r\npeople.  One cannot deny that the problems of the future  should\r\n\r\nbe  tackled  well  in advance. Why should we be  stingy  in  our\r\n\r\nenergies  in trying to push through this programme?  This  is  a\r\n\r\nbasic principle. Of course, Mr Speaker, no one can deny that if\r\n\r\na  house is to be built beautifully and properly, the old  house\r\n\r\non  the  same  piece  of  land will be  affected.  Everyone  can\r\n\r\nunderstand, even a child of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, if you want the nation and the country to\r\n\r\ndevelop  strongly and healthily, then a small  minority  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation   may   suffer  some  losses.  This  is   inevitable,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  redevelopment\r\n\r\nprogramme  is a comprehensive one. But there is one  consolation\r\n\r\nin  the  fact that the Government is paying compensation to  the\r\n\r\npeople  affected, and the compensation adequate for the purposes\r\n\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members opposite have said that the\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme of the Government is intended to  build  a\r\n\r\nscenic  spot  in  the  island for the wealthier  capitalists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  would  like to tell them that  if  they  are  not\r\n\r\nengaged  in  day-dreams then they should know that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nvery  beautiful  and  wealthy,  and  well  advanced  in  housing\r\n\r\nprojects  in the whole of Malaysia. This fact is well  known  to\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the people thought that Tanjong Rhu belonged to the\r\n\r\nrich. Now we have already put up a lot of fiats in this area for\r\n\r\nthe  poor people. They can go there and see. Whether you  are  a\r\n\r\nwage-earner or a labourer or a small businessman, you can go and\r\n\r\nlive  in  Tanjong Rhu, which was formerly reserved for the  very\r\n\r\nrich  in  the  past. This is a fact which cannot be  denied  and\r\n\r\nnobody  can  bluff about this. If they do not know  the  way  to\r\n\r\nTanjong Rhu, the housing Board will provide free transport for them\r\n\r\nto go there. They can go and see for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Tampines has also said just now\r\n\r\nthat the houses built by the Government are let out at very high\r\n\r\nrentals,  and  this  is why very few are occupied  by  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople. This is ridiculous because we cannot build enough houses\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of the people. There are more people coming to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board to get fiats, but we cannot build  enough  to\r\n\r\nmeet the increasing demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis should be more realistic when they talk of\r\n\r\nthe needs of the people, instead of talking something intangible\r\n\r\nand unrealistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as the old saying goes, we can reclaim the sea\r\n\r\ninto  land.  The world is changing all the time.  Some of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite are graduates of universities.  If  they  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  eyes  open to the facts of life, they will  then  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the scarcity of land in Singapore will give rise to  great\r\n\r\nproblems in future. If steps are not taken to reclaim land  now,\r\n\r\nthen  in future they may be worried about where to stay. If  you\r\n\r\nwant  the  country  to progress and to advance,  then  you  must\r\n\r\nfollow  the principle of constant development for the future  as\r\n\r\nwell as for the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Member from Tampines referred\r\n\r\nto the eviction of squatters as a result of reclamation. I think\r\n\r\nhe  did  not make himself clear. There are no squatters directly\r\n\r\naffected by this reclamation. But what I think he meant was that\r\n\r\nsquatters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  indirectly affected by the reclamation, in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat  fill  for the reclamation will be obtained from about  345\r\n\r\nacres   of   land  which  have  been  gazetted  for   compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition.  This land is south of Upper Changi  Road,  between\r\n\r\nthe  7\u00bc m.s. to the 8 m.s. Upper Changi Road and the 7\u00bc m.s. \r\n\r\nEast Coast Road. He is worried about the question of resettlement \r\n\r\nof the  squatters  living in that area. I can assure  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nthat  we have always dealt very nicely wth our squatters. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  go  in and throw them out. We have surveys, enquiries,  and\r\n\r\nthe  usual  procedure will be followed in this  case.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nCollector's enquiries under the Land Acquisition Ordinance  have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed and possession of this land which has  not  been\r\n\r\ntaken  possession  of will be done so shortly.  The  acquisition\r\n\r\nitself is estimated to cost the Government about $3\u00bd million.\r\n\r\nNo cadastral  survey  of  the  area has been  undertaken,  but  the\r\n\r\ndetailed census of families, improvements and ex-gratia payments\r\n\r\napplicable   in   each  case,  which  is   a   prerequisite   to\r\n\r\nresettlement, will be undertaken once possession of the land has\r\n\r\nbeen  taken. However, preliminary investigations show that there\r\n\r\nare  200 buildings, not in the sea, but in the area of Changi  -\r\n\r\n200  buildings consisting of dwellings and shop-houses  on  this\r\n\r\nland, and the majority are Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the hon. Member that resettlement will be undertaken\r\n\r\nby the Housing and Development Board in accordance with the\r\n\r\nnormal policy and will be paid according to the progress of the\r\n\r\ncutting of fill as and when required. No specific lay-out plans\r\n\r\nhave been drawn up for the area providing the fill, but once the\r\n\r\nhills have been cut, the area will be levelled and will be made\r\n\r\navailable for various projects, including schools, housing, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just touch\r\n\r\nshortly on the resettlement policy which is worrying the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tampines. Briefly, genuine farmers who are affected by any\r\n\r\ndevelopment project will be compensated in accordance with\r\n\r\nvarious rates, not only for the structures, but the trees and\r\n\r\nthe plants on their land. In addition, they are given a\r\n\r\nrehabilitation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrant  of $1,000 per acre for land occupied by them. For \r\n\r\nowner-occupiers  of  huts,  full compensation will  be  paid,\r\n\r\nand  in addition  they will be eligible for Housing Board accommodation,\r\n\r\nplus  a  transport grant of $100 and a disturbance allowance  of\r\n\r\n$250. Even sub-tenants will be given Housing Board accommodation\r\n\r\nand a transport grant of $50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have with me, Mr Speaker, two schedules showing the rates\r\n\r\npayable.  There are two types of rates, one called \"compensation\r\n\r\nrates\"  and the other \"replacement\". Replacement rates are  paid\r\n\r\nto  persons  occupying  authorised structures  and  compensation\r\n\r\nrates are paid to those occupying unauthorised structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the shortage of time, Mr Speaker, I cannot read all\r\n\r\nthis,  but  as  a comparison, the first item, the house  with  a\r\n\r\nkitchen, concrete floor and drain, compensation rate $1 per  sq.\r\n\r\nft.,  replacement rate $2.50 per sq, ft. If the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines  is  interested, I will give him copies  of  these  two\r\n\r\nrates setting out even the rates for a durian tree which may  be\r\n\r\nremoved,  $30 a plant, a rambutan tree $20 a plant. We have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, the whole lot here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of the\r\n\r\nForeshores  Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves the reclamation  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  that  portion  of  the  foreshore  and   sea-bed\r\n\r\ncontaining  an  area  of  approximately  1,000  acres  from  the\r\n\r\njunction  of  Bedok Road and East Coast Road to Tanjong  Rhu  as\r\n\r\ndelineated on the plan, marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.\r\n\r\n3/65\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION AT KRANJI</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

They may not be fully aware of the repercussions of the\r\n\r\ntotal  ban  on strikes on the trade union movement in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is my contention, Sir, that the unprecedented action of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, apart from paralysing the infant trade union\r\n\r\nmovement in the Federation, might also cause grave damage to the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the working class in Singapore.  Hence  it  is  my\r\n\r\nintention,  Sir,  to  analyse in detail the seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation and also to bring to the limelight the extent to which\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency Power possessed by the Central Government can  be\r\n\r\nmisused to choke healthy trade unionism in Singapore. It  is  my\r\n\r\ndesire  to seek a solemn assurance from the State Government  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  and the Minister for Labour in particular,  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  take  all  necessary steps to see  that  our  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  which was built as a result of a series  of  struggle\r\n\r\ncommencing  from  the  year  1946  and  which  of  late  clearly\r\n\r\nindicated maturity, solidarity and all other essential qualities\r\n\r\nof  healthy  trade  unionism, should not  be  subjected  to  the\r\n\r\nrelentless and systematic persecution by a misguided Central Government  and  an  equally uninformed Malaysian Labour  Minister.\r\n\r\nFurther --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

What the Federation  Government  does  in the Federation is the business of the Federation,\r\n\r\nand  I  will not permit any discussion on that aspect of  it  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.

Here  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to say that the Malaysian Labour Minister did mention that\r\n\r\neven  though  for the present they do not extend the prohibition\r\n\r\non strikes to Singapore, nevertheless they could and might do it\r\n\r\nif  the situation warranted such an action. His statement was  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  negation of the autonomy in labour which Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  enjoy in the new Malaysian setup. But  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinister  claimed  that  the Emergency Powers  can  provide  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  with  a  legal  cloak  to  interfere   with\r\n\r\nSingapore's  trade  union  affairs.  We  cannot  for  a   moment\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  the  Centre  can deny  autonomy  in  labour  by\r\n\r\ninvoking  the Emergency powers. Once it is explicitly  expressed\r\n\r\nin  an  agreement that there will be no interference  in  labour\r\n\r\nmatters   of   the  State,  no  government  which  substantially\r\n\r\nsubscribed to the letter and spirit of this agreement and  whose\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  attested his signature to the solemn  agreement\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to ignore completely, make a roundabout  turn,  and\r\n\r\nattempt to choke the trade union movement in this country  under\r\n\r\nsome pretext or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do sympathise with our brothers across the Causeway for\r\n\r\ntheir shabby treatment from the Central Government. We are  also\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  resist any attempt by the Central Government  to\r\n\r\ninterfere     in     the     trade     union     affairs      of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  State.

The\r\n\r\nimperialists  did, of course, reap good dividends which  finally\r\n\r\nresulted in the elimination of colonialism in this country.  And\r\n\r\nif the Central Government wants to follow in the footstep of the\r\n\r\ncolonialists,  I  can assure it, on behalf  of  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, that they will not stand idly by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we were under the impression that Malaysia is a member of\r\n\r\nthe I.L.O. and subscribes to the sacred principles of that world\r\n\r\nbody.  But  the  contradictory policy followed  by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which definitely was not in line  with  the  I.L.O.\r\n\r\nConvention,  makes  one  wonder  whether  Malaysia,  like   some\r\n\r\ncountries   we   know,  is  out  to  breach  its   international\r\n\r\nobligation. It is indeed a sad state of affairs that the leaders\r\n\r\nof  this  nation, who have expressed the desire to see that  the\r\n\r\ncountry  does  not  fall  prey to Communism,  are  now  creating\r\n\r\nconditions which will provide opportunities for exploitation  by\r\n\r\nanti-democratic elements. We hope, Sir, that even at  this  late\r\n\r\nhour the Central Government will reassess their policy in labour\r\n\r\nmatters   and  permit  the  trade  union  movement  to  function\r\n\r\nefficiently and effectively, and also state in categorical terms\r\n\r\nthat  they have no intention whatsoever of interfering in  trade\r\n\r\nunion affairs in Singapore and that they will always uphold  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  which guarantees full labour  autonomy  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, turning to the State Government, we are quite eager to\r\n\r\nknow  what  they have done so far to clarify the situation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government, and also to seek an assurance from  the\r\n\r\nCentre  that labour autonomy will not be discarded by  extending\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency  Powers to Singapore. The State, I  am  sure,  is\r\n\r\nfully  aware that today in Singapore there exists a  mature  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  trade  union  movement  which  definitely  has  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Malaysians at heart. Further, strike for  strike's\r\n\r\nsake  has  never been our motto, and every industrial action  we\r\n\r\ntake  is essentially governed by the necessity to safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers. The establishment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Arbitration Court has smoothed relations between\r\n\r\nthe  employer and the unions, and today industrial relations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can be favourably compared to those of  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmore   mature  democracies  elsewhere.  Any  extension  of   the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Powers  of the Central Government to  Singapore  wiil\r\n\r\nonly turn the clock back, frustrate labour and finally strike at\r\n\r\nthe  very root of healthy unionism in Singapore. Thus it is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the State Government to see that  the  present\r\n\r\ntrend continues in this State and that the Central Government is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to extend its strong-arm tactics to create  inroads\r\n\r\ninto the many basic benefits enjoyed by the trade union movement\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  We request the State Government  not  to  remain\r\n\r\nindolent but to take this matter up immediately witl1 the Centre\r\n\r\nand  acquire  the necessary assurance, so that the workers  here\r\n\r\ncan   continue  to  build  constructive  and  responsible  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  in  peace.  Otherwise we may  have  to  dissipate  our\r\n\r\nenergies  and  resources to the defence of the basic  rights  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unionism  which, until now, have not been  challenged  or\r\n\r\nendangered.  We  hope and earnestly pray that such  a  situation\r\n\r\nwill  not  arise. Nevertheless, let me give a strong warning  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  out to destroy trade unionism in Malaysia,  for\r\n\r\nultimately  it is not trade unionism but they who will  get  the\r\n\r\nworse of the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

We have no  use  for\r\n\r\nemergency  powers to deal with our labour problems.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah, who is also the Chairman of the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress, has expressed the concern of workers  over  the\r\n\r\nban  on  strikes  most  forcefully and sincerely.  This  ban  is\r\n\r\ntotally unwarranted even though the country is facing aggression\r\n\r\nfrom  Indonesia.  That  we have to defend  our  country  no  one\r\n\r\ndenies.   But   is  the  situation  such  that  the  fundamental\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights of workers to strike should  be  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  be  axed? Even in the darkest days of the  Emergency,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Communists were wrecking havoc throughout the country.\r\n\r\nthe  colonial government of the time did not see any reason  for\r\n\r\ntaking such drastic action. Any action which denies the right of\r\n\r\nworkers to strike uproots the very foundation of a trade  union,\r\n\r\nfor  without this fundamental right, a trade union might as well\r\n\r\ncease  to  exist. The Singapore Government wants it to be  known\r\n\r\nthat it will seriously uphold what the Constitution says in  the\r\n\r\nfield of autonomy in Labour and Education. We will therefore not\r\n\r\npermit  the  Central Government or anyone else  to  violate  our\r\n\r\nconstitutional  rights,  emergency  or  no  emergency.  The  two\r\n\r\nregulations   promulgated  by  the  Central   Government   apply\r\n\r\nthroughout Malaysia, which means that the Singapore workers will\r\n\r\nbe equally affected as their counterparts elsewhere in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIf,  however,  these regulations are used by the Central  Government  to  nullify what the Constitution guarantees us,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  no alternative but to seek the unanimous support  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  to condemn the Central Government for violation  of\r\n\r\nthe very Constitution to which it is a party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to say that we were not consulted\r\n\r\nbefore the essential regulations were promulgated. On the\r\n\r\nafternoon of the 13th of May, 1965, a telephone call came\r\n\r\nthrough from the Secretary for Labour, Kuala Lumpur, to my\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary. He was informed that the Central Government\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour was about to announce in the next few\r\n\r\nminutes at a meeting of employers and trade unionists the\r\n\r\npromulgation of these regulations which were to be brought into\r\n\r\nforce the following day. I immediately contacted the Federal\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour by telephone and asked him whether the\r\n\r\nregulations applied to Singapore. He assured me that the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment had no intention to interfere with labour matters in\r\n\r\nSingapore. To clarify this, I issued a Press statement the next\r\n\r\nday to the effect that the Singapore Government did not intend\r\n\r\nto resort to Emergency Powers to resolve our labour disputes.\r\n\r\nbecause our present laws were adequate to deal with that\r\n\r\nsituation. These two regulations were received by us only on the\r\n\r\n17th of May, 1965. We then asked our legal officers to study the\r\n\r\nimplications of these regulations and their conclusions were\r\n\r\nthat the regulations were applicable to Singapore. On the 21st\r\n\r\nof May, 1965, however, my counterpart in the Central Government\r\n\r\nstated publicly that though the Central Government had no\r\n\r\nintention to interfere with our labour matters, we were legally\r\n\r\nbound by the essential regulations. Here we have an apparent\r\n\r\ncontradiction between the utterances of a Central Government\r\n\r\nMinister and the expressed regulations. We do not know how the\r\n\r\nintentions of a Minister and legality can be reconciled. If we\r\n\r\nare legally bound, then it is the law which must prevail and not\r\n\r\nthe intention. If the intention is to prevail, then I say it\r\n\r\nmust be legally spelt out. So to back up their public statement,\r\n\r\nthe most sensible thing for them to do would be to amend the\r\n\r\nregulations to exclude Singapore from the operation of these\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the query by the Member for Brash Basah as to what\r\n\r\nwe  have  done  to  clarify  the  situation,  we  can  say  that\r\n\r\nimmediately  after we obtained legal opinion on the regulations,\r\n\r\nwe  wrote to the Central Government requesting them to amend the\r\n\r\nregulations  to  exclude Singapore from the operation  of  these\r\n\r\nregulations.  We  are  still awaiting  a  reply  from  them.  We\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that they are wise enough to accept our  request.\r\n\r\nThey have already made a mess of their industrial relations  and\r\n\r\nwe  do not want them to pull us into the mess. It serves them no\r\n\r\nbenefit  at  all  to  try to interfere with  labour  matters  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. If they persist in doing it, then they will only gain\r\n\r\nthe  bitterness and hatred of the workers of Singapore, as  they\r\n\r\nhave already done so in the Federation. I must assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah that the Singapore Government will not shirk its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to the workers and will ensure that  democratic\r\n\r\ntrade  unions can always function freely within the  State.  The\r\n\r\nMalaysia Constitution clearly states that Labour and Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  autonomous.  It  was  on  that  condition  that  we  joined\r\n\r\nMalaysia. It was on that condition that we conceded to 15  seats\r\n\r\nin  the  Parliament. If they violate that condition,  then  they\r\n\r\ncannot  blame us for seeking new arrangements or for asking  for\r\n\r\nmore  seats in Parliament. There is no need for these  essential\r\n\r\nregulations to apply in Singapore and, for that matter,  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the  Federation,  because  our  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  a  child of labour, employers and  governments,  has\r\n\r\nworked successfully in reducing strikes and effecting settlement\r\n\r\nof  disputes without banning the right of unions to strike. This\r\n\r\nmachinery  exists in Singapore, and it is this type of machinery\r\n\r\nthat will answer the industrial programmes of our times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">\t\t\t\t\t\tAdjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">\t\t\t\t\t\tTen minutes past Eight o'clock p.m. sine die.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Wednesday, 16th June, 1965</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADDENDUM PIONEER INDUSTRIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh Keng Swee, pursuant to his written answer to the\r\n\r\nfollowing question on 18th November, 1964 (Official Report, 18th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1964, Vol. 23, No. 9, Column 765):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Ong Eng Guan asked the Minister for Finance to state the\r\n\r\nnumber \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof Pioneer Certificates which have been issued to date,\r\n\r\nwith details of name of firm: product specified: date of issue:\r\n\r\ntime limit to commence operation, if any; whether and when the\r\n\r\nfirm has commenced production; paid-up capital of the firm,\r\n\r\npercentage of local capital and foreign capital in the firm; and\r\n\r\nnumber of workmen of the firm.\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubsequently supplied the following information:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1965/19650616/19650616-HA-0230905.pdf\"\">APPENDIX TO WRITTEN ANSWER(Pages 1 - 12)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1965/19650616/19650616-HA-0230897.pdf\"\">ATTENDANCE OF MEMBERS AT SITTINGS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SELECT COMMITTEES(Cols 0897-0904)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
