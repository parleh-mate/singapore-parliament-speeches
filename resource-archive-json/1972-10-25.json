Of this figure, about\r\n\r\n2,400  are  over  26 years old, and  another  1,300\r\n\r\nbetween 22 and 26 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As goods vehicles generate a large amount of\r\n\r\neconomic  activity, it would not  be  advisable  to\r\n\r\ntake  them off the roads suddenly but to have  them\r\n\r\nphased out gradually. Accordingly, the mechanically\r\n\r\nunfit  or oldest vehicles will have to go  off  the\r\n\r\nroads  first. To ensure that there is no disruption\r\n\r\nto  the services provided by the goods vehicles, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to  give  the owners sufficient  time  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the scrapped vehicles, a grace  period  of\r\n\r\nsix   months  to  two  years,  depending   on   the\r\n\r\nmechanical  condition  of the  over-aged  vehicles,\r\n\r\nwould be given. Under the phase out programme,  the\r\n\r\nROV  will  send  notices  to  owners  of  over-aged\r\n\r\nvehicles,  notifying them of  the  dates  to  bring\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles  for mechanical  inspection.  These\r\n\r\nover-aged vehicles, if found mechanically unfit  on\r\n\r\ninspection,  would be given 14 days to rectify  the\r\n\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf,  after repairs are carried out, these  vehicles\r\n\r\npass  the  re-inspection, they would  be  given  12\r\n\r\nmonths extension. Such extension would be renewable\r\n\r\nsubject to satisfying the annual inspection  up  to\r\n\r\n31st  December,  1974, thus  giving  them  a  grace\r\n\r\nperiod up to two years. However, vehicles that fail\r\n\r\nthe  re-inspection after repairs would be given six\r\n\r\nmonths'  notice  to replace.

The answer to the question is  that\r\n\r\npriorities for the allocation of HDB flats will not\r\n\r\nonly be for the application for the first flat  but\r\n\r\nalso for application for transfers to a bigger  and better  flat.  In other words, if those  who  after\r\n\r\nhaving  been  allocated flats  continue  after  1st\r\n\r\nAugust,  1973,  to have more children,  then  their\r\n\r\napplication  for transfers to bigger flats  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  will drop very low in priority.

Singaporeans will  need  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that rewards should be equated to hard  work\r\n\r\nor  personal performance. But, in areas  where  the\r\n\r\npeople  are willing to work hard - in the vegetable\r\n\r\nfarms  of Potong Pasir, for instance - there should\r\n\r\nbe  no curbs. Urban renewal is threatening to erase\r\n\r\nthe  lust  for  hard  work these vegetable  farmers\r\n\r\npossess.  More  than 1,500 people depend  on  these\r\n\r\nfarms  for a living, directly or indirectly.  Here,\r\n\r\non  120 hectares of rich land is grown, among other\r\n\r\nvegetables,  nasturtium officinale  or  watercress.\r\n\r\nThe  alluvial soil of the Jalan Potong  Pasir  area\r\n\r\npermits   the  successful  growth  of   this   much\r\n\r\ncherished   vegetable,  which  possesses  medicinal\r\n\r\nvalue  and is good for the health. It is said  that\r\n\r\nthe  same vegetable from Cameron Highlands is flat\r\n\r\nto  the palate. While preserving the essence of the\r\n\r\nvegetable by letting it continue growing in  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir,  the  Government  would  also  preserve  its\r\n\r\npolicy -just returns for hard work. I say, Sir, let\r\n\r\nnot  the  farmers be swallowed up by urban renewal.\r\n\r\nLet  them continue sweating, toiling and doing what\r\n\r\nthey  love to do, until they are prepared  to  rest\r\n\r\ntheir  aching  bones in a Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flat or to repose in deserved peace  in  the\r\n\r\nbosom of the creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that \"nothing in life is for\r\n\r\nfree\"  should  be  the axiom of every  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nMany  still feel this is balderdash. But,  observe,\r\n\r\neven  the air we breathe will cost much because  we\r\n\r\nwill  need to spend large sums of money to keep  it\r\n\r\nfresh. The Government  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  task ahead to  eliminate  this\r\n\r\ncancer  of  air,  water  and noise  pollution.  The\r\n\r\nincreased  attention the Government  is  giving  to\r\n\r\nquestions about the environment is most welcome.

The  work  of\r\n\r\nthis  Ministry will be important to the  well-being\r\n\r\nof the community at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, my humble suggestions, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, are that the Environment Ministry:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) selects problem areas and either take action\r\n\r\nor make further inquiries;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) publishes information regarding the\r\n\r\nenvironment  that otherwise would not be  available\r\n\r\nto the public;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) establishes, where appropriate, international\r\n\r\nco-operation to preserve the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action to control pollution is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the Government, industry, trade unions and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public. All must be made aware of this, and\r\n\r\nnone    should   be   allowed   to   shirk    their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  Voluntary  organisations   could\r\n\r\nalso  play  a  valuable part in  mobilising  public\r\n\r\nopinion about pollution problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the pollution problem is the need to\r\n\r\nstrike  a  balance between the benefits of economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and the technological development on  which\r\n\r\nit  depends,  on the one hand, with  the  costs  in\r\n\r\nterms of harm to the environment, on the other. The\r\n\r\nGovernment should institute a study of the costs of\r\n\r\npollution  as part of a wider action to provide  an\r\n\r\neconomic  framework  to  aid decision-making  about\r\n\r\nthose economic and technological developments whose\r\n\r\nbenefits are accompanied by some adverse effects on\r\n\r\nthe environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of forms, or causes, of\r\n\r\npollution  giving concern, and immediate action  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to deal with the most serious issues. Sea\r\n\r\npollution, for instance, can be limited if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is  tight control on the dumping of  noxious\r\n\r\nmaterial; to limit noise pollution, there must be a\r\n\r\ngeneral reduction in levels; for refuse disposal on\r\n\r\nland,  action  is  needed  to  firmly  control  the\r\n\r\ndisposal   of   toxic  wastes;  with  fresh   water\r\n\r\npollution,  ways and means will have to be  devised\r\n\r\nto  meet the increasing demand for water, and I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that  in  the  Addendum  to  the  President's\r\n\r\naddress,  the Ministry of the Environment indicates\r\n\r\nthe using up of valuable land for new reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment will need to go\r\n\r\ninto  the qualifications and training of those  who\r\n\r\ncontrol  air,  water and noise pollution.  Constant\r\n\r\nvigilance of international development of  improved\r\n\r\ntechniques for monitoring pollution will have to be\r\n\r\nkept.   There  is  a  necessity  also  to  have   a\r\n\r\ncontinuing appraisal of pesticides. Close proximity\r\n\r\nwith other bodies dealing with motor vehicle fumes,\r\n\r\ndisposal of farm wastes, oil pollution of  the  sea\r\n\r\nand  clean air, must be preserved. Complex problems\r\n\r\n.of  pollution have to be tackled in a sensible and\r\n\r\npractical  manner.  Undoubtedly a  correct  balance\r\n\r\nbetween economic benefit and environmental cost  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to achieve, but this is an urgent problem\r\n\r\nthat needs to be solved. It is especially important\r\n\r\nto  take into account the costs and benefits to the\r\n\r\ngeneral  community,  and  in  some  instances   the\r\n\r\nspecific  effects  on workers, of  the  alternative\r\n\r\nways   of   promoting  economic  and  technological\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must pay for what we\r\n\r\nwant in life. But must some of the workers pay with\r\n\r\ntheir  lives or mangled limbs! Occupational  Health\r\n\r\nand  Safety  is  a  real problem in  Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nconcerns the well-being of more than half a million\r\n\r\npeople  in  their  daily work.  Finding  the  right\r\n\r\nanswers does not seem possible, but I hope to  make\r\n\r\nsome    contribution   that    will    provide    a\r\n\r\nreinvigorated,  constructive  and  realistic   step\r\n\r\nforward in an area where there is a crying need for\r\n\r\na  new  approach.

Quite  apart  from  human\r\n\r\ntragedy  and  suffering, the waste of resources  is\r\n\r\ncolossal.  In  Singapore  today,  there  is  little\r\n\r\nevidence  to suggest that the situation is  getting\r\n\r\nbetter.  But there are signs suggesting a worsening\r\n\r\nof  the  situation. Many new and difficult problems\r\n\r\nwill  arise  because  of  the  use  of  potentially\r\n\r\ndangerous substances and materials. Some  of  these\r\n\r\npresent direct risks to the public as well  as  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can I humbly contribute the\r\n\r\nfollowing  suggestions  which  may  alleviate   the\r\n\r\nproblems:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That a more comprehensive and stringent\r\n\r\nlegislation, progressive in character  and  unified\r\n\r\nunder  a  single Act, be introduced for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  all  the workers and also adequately protecting\r\n\r\nthe interests of the public;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the enforcement machinery for Health and\r\n\r\nSafety  at  work  be  revitalised  into  a  better,\r\n\r\nkeener, more streamlined and more dedicated body;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That Health and Safety organisations at work-places\r\n\r\nbe  set up, charged with the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  continuously monitoring and controlling  health\r\n\r\nand  safety  problems as they  arise  and  as  they\r\n\r\nchange. For this to be successful, employers should\r\n\r\nbe  obliged  to  consult with  their  employees  on\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety measures;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That an education system be set up for\r\n\r\neveryone  in  industry  to  stimulate  a  sustained\r\n\r\ninterest  and involvement in Health and  Safety  at\r\n\r\nwork;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That specialist training be given to safety\r\n\r\nofficers,  supervisors, technical staff  (including\r\n\r\nengineers, chemists, plant designers, etc.), safety\r\n\r\ninstructors,  work study staff, specialist  workers\r\n\r\nwhose  work involves special risks, workers' safety\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and all members  of  joint  safety\r\n\r\ncommittees;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That Health and Safety be organised as an\r\n\r\nintegral function of management.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  Singapore today, an injured  workman\r\n\r\ncannot  maintain  a  claim  on  his  employer   for\r\n\r\nworkmen's compensation and at the same time  pursue\r\n\r\na  claim  for  damages under Common Law.  The  same\r\n\r\napplies  to  the next-of-kin of workers  killed  at\r\n\r\nwork.  Workers  or their relatives  have  to  elect\r\n\r\nunder  which heading they would take their  remedy,\r\n\r\nand the acceptance of compensation is a barrier  to\r\n\r\na damages claim. In other words, it is compensation\r\n\r\nor damages. Generally under Common Law, the quantum\r\n\r\nof  compensation  is  higher  presuming  employers'\r\n\r\nnegligence.  Most workers and their  relatives  opt\r\n\r\nfor   workmen's  compensation,  because   of   this\r\n\r\nlegislation, and due to the worker being unemployed\r\n\r\nor  dead  when  the  claim  is  made,  because  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  need the money. Other factors  considered\r\n\r\nby the workers or their families are the protracted\r\n\r\nnature of a law suit, the costs and the uncertainty\r\n\r\nof the outcome, as proving employers' negligence is\r\n\r\nnot a cut-and-dry affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible amendment to enable workers to obtain\r\n\r\na  just compensation, especially when employers are\r\n\r\nnegligent, is to allow workers to first accept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npayment  under the Workmen's Compensation  Act  and\r\n\r\nthen  if tort is successful later, the worker could\r\n\r\nreimburse the compensation paid under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undue delays in the payment of compensation cause\r\n\r\nworkers and their families much hardship. The  time\r\n\r\ntaken  in finalising workmen's compensation  claims\r\n\r\nvaries  from case to case, depending on the  nature\r\n\r\nof  the  accident  and the extent  of  the  injury.\r\n\r\nBefore  an  assessment can be made, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto   ensure   that  the  claim  is  in  order   and\r\n\r\nsubstantiated by an authentic medical  report.  All\r\n\r\nthe red tape is appreciated, but how do the workers\r\n\r\nand  their families survive while all this is going\r\n\r\non?  Surely a satisfactory compromise can be worked\r\n\r\nout with either government or employers; this could\r\n\r\nbe stipulated in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a problem which presents a\r\n\r\nchallenge to both sides of industry, management and\r\n\r\nworkers  alike  is  \"occupational  dermatitis\",   a\r\n\r\ncondition  arising  out of one's  work.  It  needs,\r\n\r\nhowever,  to be emphasised that dermatitis  is  not\r\n\r\nconfined to industry alone. Household and gardening\r\n\r\nduties are all a possible source of contraction  of\r\n\r\ndermatitis. At one time it was being contended that\r\n\r\nthe  use of modern detergents and cleansers carried\r\n\r\na   distinct   risk  of  dermatitis,   though   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  of  such  products  could   strongly\r\n\r\ndispute   this.   However,  our  consideration   is\r\n\r\nindustrial dermatitis and we have to recognise that\r\n\r\nthis  scourge  is  a particular feature  of  modern\r\n\r\nindustry  bringing with it not only much  suffering\r\n\r\nand  inconvenience for workers afflicted  but  also\r\n\r\nretarding   the   country's   productive    output.\r\n\r\nDermatitis  is most common in industrial  processes\r\n\r\nwhere   raw   materials  are  handled.   Chemicals,\r\n\r\nalkalies,  de-greasing agents,  coal-tar  products,\r\n\r\nmineral   oils   and  artificial  adhesives   cause\r\n\r\ndermatitis.  Not  only is it necessary  to  impress\r\n\r\nupon  employers the need to adopt the  most  modern\r\n\r\nmethods in order to combat dermatitis, but there is\r\n\r\nalso an equal need for Government to include in the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule to the principal Act \"Occupational\r\n\r\nDermatitis\" as a compensable disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is unjust to pay the\r\n\r\nindustrious  the same quantum as the indolent.  But\r\n\r\nhow  do we get about correcting this injustice? The\r\n\r\nobvious  answer  is  the introduction  of  a  merit\r\n\r\npremium or a performance allowance. This additional\r\n\r\nallowance  is  determined  by, the  quantity   and\r\n\r\nquality of the workers' products. This system would\r\n\r\nmean  that over and above the basic wage, a  worker\r\n\r\ncan take home additional sums of money according to\r\n\r\nhis daily performance at work. The introduction  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system  would ensure that those  who  work\r\n\r\nharder would be amply rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maintaining and continuing the rapid pace of\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  economic growth in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\ncontinued  high growth rates is not an  easy  task.\r\n\r\nThe   willingness  to  work  cannot  be  inculcated\r\n\r\nwithout  the  co-operation  of  both  workers   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  The  working  relationship  between\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and labour many a time is  aggravated\r\n\r\nby   suspicion,  false  fears  and  self-destroying\r\n\r\nopposition.   Until  there  is  a  harmonious   and\r\n\r\npositive  co-operation  and  unity  of  purpose  in\r\n\r\nindustrial life, struggles for higher productivity,\r\n\r\nincreasing efforts and better standards  of  living\r\n\r\ncan make little progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement for the right sort of leadership\r\n\r\nespecially in management is visualised because this\r\n\r\nleadership   determines  the   quality   of   human\r\n\r\nrelations and morale in any enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously, entrepreneurs make attempts to\r\n\r\nmotivate workers by monetary incentives only.  This\r\n\r\ndoes  not  achieve the all-important  goal  of  the\r\n\r\nrealisation that workers are human beings  and  not\r\n\r\neconomic digits. Workers want, most of all, to be a\r\n\r\npart  of  society,  their opinions  respected,  and\r\n\r\ndoing  their  lot in ensuring the  success  of  the\r\n\r\nnation.  They  cannot and must not  be  treated  as\r\n\r\nsecond-rate  by management. They should  always  be\r\n\r\ntreated as a part of the company in which they work\r\n\r\nin because the success or failure of the enterprise\r\n\r\nis  largely  dependent  on them.  There  should  be\r\n\r\ncreated  a  greater  sense of  participation  among\r\n\r\nemployees and job-satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers are made a part of the company on a co-operative\r\n\r\nbasis, the incentive to work harder  for\r\n\r\nthe  success  of their enterprise will be  ensured.\r\n\r\nThis  is evident in Japan. The communion of thought\r\n\r\nbetween   management   and, workers   successfully\r\n\r\nimplemented ultimately leads to a stable industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  climate, which is important socially  as\r\n\r\nwell as economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tripartite association of Government,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs   and  labour,   Government   has   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to take a fundamental  step  forward\r\n\r\nto establish this co-operative relationship between\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and  labour. The  changes  envisaged\r\n\r\nwould  mean  new  obligations, on entrepreneurs  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  labour.  New rights  would  be  given  to\r\n\r\nlabour,  and  new  powers and  responsibilities  to\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  echo  the  sentiments of the Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  by  stressing that there is  a  dearth  of\r\n\r\nconcern  over the aged and underprivileged.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  their  fault that they are old,  deaf,  blind,\r\n\r\ndumb,   mentally   handicapped  or   spastic.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  must pledge a guaranteed share  in  our\r\n\r\nrising   national   prosperity   for   these   less\r\n\r\nfortunate. Most certainly we are conscious  of  the\r\n\r\nmany  difficulties at present experienced by  these\r\n\r\npeople.  I urge that immediate action be  taken  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  adequate and  imaginative  help  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI would like to add my support to the motion by the\r\n\r\nhon.

I feel that every citizen should assist\r\n\r\nthe  Government to achieve these objectives in  the\r\n\r\ncoming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important stress on quality is well accepted\r\n\r\nby  all concerned, and we welcome the formation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment for preserving and\r\n\r\nstriving   towards   a   better   environment   for\r\n\r\nSingapore. While it is accepted that this  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas an important function\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  perform, we also have to recognise some of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that  it will  face  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nstaffing and the lack of many experienced personnel\r\n\r\nin  implementing  some of these  policies.  In  our\r\n\r\neagerness  to  preserve the  environment,  we  must\r\n\r\nensure that unnecessary hardship is not placed upon\r\n\r\ninnocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the setting up of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment  is being received  with  some\r\n\r\nmixed feelings by some members of the public. There\r\n\r\nis  a  fear  by this hesitant group that the  over-enthusiasm\r\n\r\nin the implementation of some  of  these\r\n\r\npolicies  without proper knowledge  and  study  can\r\n\r\ncause   extreme   hardship  to   some   industries,\r\n\r\nespecially the local small industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that some local industries\r\n\r\nover the past year have been quite apprehensive  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government actually intends to  do  with\r\n\r\nregard  to pollution control problems, as there  is\r\n\r\nno clear-cut guideline on what should or should not\r\n\r\nbe done. I would therefore like to suggest that the\r\n\r\nnew  Ministry of the Environment should issue  some\r\n\r\ngeneral  guidelines so that the  officers  of  this\r\n\r\nMinistry  could implement the policy  in  the  true\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the  legislation  rather  than  to  the\r\n\r\nletter,  for  after all people who are earnest  and\r\n\r\nsincere in wanting to help Government implement its\r\n\r\npolicies should not be penalised. But, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we must also have a mechanism, or machinery,\r\n\r\nto   identify   those  who  pay  lip  service   and\r\n\r\nconstantly  flout  the  law for  self-interest  and\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the concerned members of the\r\n\r\npublic would like to know some clear-cut statements\r\n\r\nfrom   this   Ministry  concerning   the   relevant\r\n\r\nimplementations.  Otherwise it  can  drive  away  a\r\n\r\nnumber of new industries which ironically the other\r\n\r\nMinistries  may  be trying very  hard  to  promote.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  some existing industries feel  reluctant\r\n\r\nto  expand  as  there is uncertainty regarding  the\r\n\r\nenforcement of the environment laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of legislation to fight\r\n\r\npollution is obviously a step in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright direction. However, there must be flexibility\r\n\r\nin  its  enforcement as antipollution equipment  is\r\n\r\nvery  expensive and this may cause a strain on  the\r\n\r\nfinances of some small manufacturing firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to comment, Sir,\r\n\r\nconcerns the easing of manpower shortage. Singapore\r\n\r\nis  presently facing an acute shortage of manpower,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  higher  levels.  These   high-calibred\r\n\r\nand  experienced  personnel  cannot   be\r\n\r\ncreated  overnight, but need to  be  nurtured  over\r\n\r\nmany  years.  One  of the ways to help  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem  is the relaxation of immigration policies.\r\n\r\nBut  this  has  its  limitations,  among  the  most\r\n\r\nobvious  being  the need for adjustment  to  a  new\r\n\r\nenvironment, the lack of dedication and the  danger\r\n\r\nof  importing people of dubious talents. Perhaps  a\r\n\r\nmore  realistic  way to help solve  and  ease  this\r\n\r\nproblem immediately is the conservation and  better\r\n\r\nutilisation of existing selected manpower. This can\r\n\r\nbe done by allowing to reduce the annual leave with\r\n\r\nfinancial compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is usually the experienced senior civil\r\n\r\nservants  who  are most needed on  important  jobs.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously,  they are the same  staff  who  are\r\n\r\neligible  for  the most annual leave by  virtue  of\r\n\r\ntheir   seniority  and  their  length  of  service.\r\n\r\nConsequently,   some   senior   staff   have   been\r\n\r\naccumulating  their  leave to an  unhealthy  level.\r\n\r\nMuch  discontent  would result  if  some  of  their\r\n\r\nannual leave are forfeited. This conflicting  state\r\n\r\nof  affairs  can be alleviated for  the  better  by\r\n\r\ncompensating for shortening leave, if required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, senior staff are eligible\r\n\r\nfor  33,  or 39, or 42 days' annual leave  a  year,\r\n\r\ndepending  on seniority and length of  service,  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with leave entitlement in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  of  14 or 21 days. In trying to equate  the\r\n\r\nterms  of service in the public sector to those  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector,  this simple  fact  is  often\r\n\r\noverlooked.  Therefore, in  the  re-examination  of\r\n\r\nservice conditions as mentioned in the addendum  to\r\n\r\nthe President's Address\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Ministry of Finance) for senior civil servants,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that the reduction of annual\r\n\r\nleave  for selected staff in exchange for financial\r\n\r\ncompensation should be studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent unsatisfactory situation as regards\r\n\r\ngeneral  maintenance  of Far  East  Mansion  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency has brought home the point of  another\r\n\r\nsocial problem in Singapore. I therefore feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  House ought to re-examine the problem  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration  and  maintenance  of   the   common\r\n\r\nproperty and common area of flatted buildings.  The\r\n\r\nstatutory     provision    which    governs     the\r\n\r\nadministration and maintenance of common  areas  of\r\n\r\nflatted  buildings is the Land Titles (Strata)  Act\r\n\r\n(Cap.  277)  which came into force on the  15th  of\r\n\r\nMay,  1968.  Part IV of this Act provides  for  the\r\n\r\nsetting   up   of  a  corporate  body  called   the\r\n\r\n\"Management   Corporation\"   for   every    flatted\r\n\r\nbuilding.    The    Management    Corporation    is\r\n\r\nadministered by a Council selected from and by  the\r\n\r\nowners  of flats in the flatted building.  Section\r\n\r\n19  of  the Act sets Out the duties and obligations\r\n\r\nof the Management Corporation among which it is the\r\n\r\nduty  of  the Management Corporation to manage  and\r\n\r\nproperly  maintain  the  common  property  and  the\r\n\r\ncommon  areas of the flatted building, and to  keep\r\n\r\nthe same in good and serviceable repair. Section 29\r\n\r\nof   the   Act  provides  that  if  the  Management\r\n\r\nCorporation is in default of its obligations  under\r\n\r\nSection  19,  then the Management  Corporation  and\r\n\r\nevery  member of its Council shall be liable  to  a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, many flatted buildings in Singapore have\r\n\r\nyet  to  set  up effective Management Corporations.\r\n\r\nThe  main  reason appears to be that it  is  rather\r\n\r\nidealistic  and sometimes impracticable  to  expect\r\n\r\nflat  owners  to  undertake the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\ninitiating the formation of the Council. Perhaps  a\r\n\r\nseparate department for the implementation of  Part\r\n\r\nIV  of  the  Land  Titles (Strata)  Act  should  be\r\n\r\nestablished by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interim measures adopted so far are for the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  of  the flatted building  to  undertake,\r\n\r\nprior to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsetting   up   of   the   Management   Corporation,\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the upkeep and  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  common  areas. The undertaking is incorporated\r\n\r\nusually  in  the Agreements for Sale  and  Purchase\r\n\r\nbetween  each buyer of the flat and the  developer.\r\n\r\nThe  developer's  obligations here are,  therefore,\r\n\r\nstrictly  contractual and the only remedy available\r\n\r\nto  the  owners of the flats in case of default  of\r\n\r\nthe  developer  is to institute  a  civil  suit  in\r\n\r\ncourt.  This usually takes a long time, as  we  all\r\n\r\nknow.  This is clearly an unsatisfactory  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs,  as  in the case of Far East Mansions  for\r\n\r\ninstance.   I  feel  that  the  public  have   been\r\n\r\ninconvenienced to a great extent and measures ought\r\n\r\nto  be  taken  by  the Government  to  rectify  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the statutory provisions of\r\n\r\na  Management  Corporation  be  made  to  apply  to\r\n\r\ndevelopers  so that any default of these  statutory\r\n\r\nobligations to manage and keep in a state  of  good\r\n\r\nrepair the common property and the common areas  of\r\n\r\nthe  flatted building will result in the  developer\r\n\r\nliable  to a fine in the court. This calls  for  an\r\n\r\namendment  to the Land Titles (Strata) Act,  and  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this  may  act as a  deterrent  to  the\r\n\r\nhousing   developer  who,  very  often  after   the\r\n\r\nerection  and disposal of the flatted  building  to\r\n\r\nthe  members  of the public, neglect  to  keep  the\r\n\r\ncommon  areas  in  a  state  of  good  repair   and\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to touch on, Sir, is\r\n\r\nour  aims to create more satisfying and better paid\r\n\r\njobs  in Singapore. In this area, there is much  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  in  upgrading the skills of our  workers,\r\n\r\nalthough the Ministry of Education and the tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  have' been expanded.  This  alone  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient, as the institutions can  do  no  more\r\n\r\nthan  provide basic training. In order  to  achieve\r\n\r\nhigher   technology  and  better  skills  to   make\r\n\r\nSingapore into a service centre, there is a need to\r\n\r\nhave  better cooperation and understanding  between\r\n\r\nthose  who  work in the Government departments  and\r\n\r\nthose  in  the private sector. Therefore,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that a more effective consultative\r\n\r\nmachinery be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah\r\n\r\nHui):  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in supporting  the  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by the hon. Member for Bukit Batok, thanking\r\n\r\nthe President for his thought-provoking Address,  I\r\n\r\ntake  the opportunity to elaborate on some  of  the\r\n\r\npoints mentioned concerning the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Addendum to the Address, we\r\n\r\nwill  allow  industries  or enterprises  with  high\r\n\r\ntechnology  or  higher  skill  content,   and   the\r\n\r\nprospects  of  more sophisticated  manufacture,  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  labour on work permits liberally. This  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the growth of our industries  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  hampered  through lack  of  manpower.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now working on a new  scheme  which\r\n\r\nwill  enable work permits to be issued readily  and\r\n\r\nmore  expeditiously  to  what  we  consider  to  be\r\n\r\n\"priority  industries\". A list of  such  industries\r\n\r\nwill  be  drawn up and the scheme will be carefully\r\n\r\nimplemented  through greater co-operation  and  co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween the Economic Development  Board\r\n\r\nand  the  Labour  Ministry.  We  will  also  inform\r\n\r\nemployers of the scheme so as to facilitate them in\r\n\r\nthe recruitment of foreign workers. In other words,\r\n\r\neverything possible will be done to ensure that our\r\n\r\nindustries as well as those to be set up will  have\r\n\r\nthe requisite number of workers with the right type\r\n\r\nof  qualities  needed by them. Would-be  investors,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  need not have unnecessary  fears  about\r\n\r\ndifficulties in recruitment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, however, we should not depend\r\n\r\ntoo  much  upon the immigrant workers to  meet  our\r\n\r\nlabour requirements. More important, we must  train\r\n\r\nand  upgrade the skills of our own workers not only\r\n\r\nto   meet   the   needs  of  our  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  but  also  to raise  their  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving    through    increased    efficiency    and\r\n\r\nproductivity,  and hence higher  wages.  This  task\r\n\r\ncalls  for  the  joint effort  of  Government,  the\r\n\r\nemployers and the trade unions. The Government will\r\n\r\ndo its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart  mainly through the Industrial Training  Board\r\n\r\nto be set up soon. The Board will undertake and co-ordinate\r\n\r\nall  aspects  of  industrial   training,\r\n\r\nincluding apprenticeship schemes as well as-on-the-job\r\n\r\nand  off-the-job  training.  It, will   also\r\n\r\nregulate  and  control  such  training  schemes  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  training  given  is  of  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard   and  relevant  to  the  needs   of   our\r\n\r\nindustries.  In  this  way,  a  growing   pool   of\r\n\r\ntechnically   skilled  personnel   will   be   made\r\n\r\navailable  to  effectively meet the demands  of  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly industrialised economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep abreast with the changing times, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  our employers to adopt  modern  and\r\n\r\nscientific  management  techniques.  The   National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board will act as a catalyst  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  By  conducting  seminars,  workshops   and\r\n\r\ntraining   courses,   and   providing   consultancy\r\n\r\nservices, the National Productivity Board will also\r\n\r\nhelp   to   raise   the  quality   of   management,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in   its  relationship   with,   and\r\n\r\nefficient use of, workers. The Board will not cater\r\n\r\nexclusively   to   the   larger   industries    and\r\n\r\norganisations. Every effort will be made to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat small and medium-sized establishments can also\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  its services. As the  management  of\r\n\r\nthese  small  and  medium-sized establishments  are\r\n\r\nmostly  Chinese-educated, the Board  has  recruited\r\n\r\nsome  Nantah  graduates  so that  its  consultancy,\r\n\r\ntraining   and   other   services   can   also   be\r\n\r\nbeneficially utilised by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another urgent task of the Board is to help those\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive firms to modernise and  mechanise.\r\n\r\nIn the present tight labour market, these firms are\r\n\r\nfinding it increasingly difficult in recruiting and\r\n\r\nretaining  workers  as  they  are  unable  to   pay\r\n\r\ncompetitive   wage  rates  and  other   terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of service. Unless they are  modernised\r\n\r\nand  mechanised soon, they will be left far  behind\r\n\r\nby  the  wheel  of progress and may have  to  close\r\n\r\ndown.  This  is  a  serious matter  to  which  more\r\n\r\nattention    should   be   given.   The    National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Board  will  establish  a  Low   Cost\r\n\r\nAutomation  Unit to help these firms to  mechanise.\r\n\r\nThe Unit will advise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  application of inexpensive standard pieces\r\n\r\nof  equipment to achieve mechanisation,  previously\r\n\r\ndone  manually. The aim is to reduce human  effort,\r\n\r\n(either physical or mental, required for each  unit\r\n\r\nof production in order to increase productivity. It\r\n\r\nis    an    intermediate   stage   between   simple\r\n\r\nmechanisation and complete automation. I would urge\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive firms to make extensive use of the\r\n\r\nUnit for their town well-being and survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain and accelerate our present pace of\r\n\r\neconomic  development, we have  no  option  but  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to pursue our policy of industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice.  This  calls  for  an  orderly   and\r\n\r\nequitable  distribution of  the  additional  wealth\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  joint efforts of  the  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners.   The   National   Wages   Council    has\r\n\r\nrecommended,  and the Government  has  accepted,  a\r\n\r\nwage increase of 8 per cent for this year. Although\r\n\r\nthe necessary enabling legislations have yet to  be\r\n\r\npromulgated, I am glad to note that,  true  to  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  tripartism, the  employers,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and the Government have agreed on 23rd  May\r\n\r\nthis  year that negotiations on the recommendations\r\n\r\ncould  commence  without  waiting  for  legislative\r\n\r\namendments. To-date, 17 trade unions have concluded\r\n\r\nnegotiations with 199 establishments providing  for\r\n\r\nincreased  wages  for  some  38,000  workers.  More\r\n\r\nworkers will benefit from the recommendations  when\r\n\r\nnegotiations   between  their  unions   and   their\r\n\r\nemployers are concluded. This figure, however, does\r\n\r\nnot  include those non-unionised workers,  many  of\r\n\r\nwhom,  I  am  informed, have also been  given  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  by  their  employers.  As  long  as  the\r\n\r\nemployers  are fair and responsible and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  do  not  make  excessive  and  unreasonable\r\n\r\ndemands, the future promises better living for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, increasing the wages of the\r\n\r\nworkers alone will not help to bring about gracious\r\n\r\nliving  and  higher quality of life.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we must also provide the workers with what is\r\n\r\nsometimes  referred to as the \"psychic income\".  By\r\n\r\nthis,  I  mean we should provide them with a  clean\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafe  working environment which will  give  them  a\r\n\r\nsense  of personal pride and satisfaction in  their\r\n\r\njobs.  Only then can we urge them to give of  their\r\n\r\nbest.  The  Government  will,  therefore,  ever  be\r\n\r\nwatchful  and vigilant against those employers  who\r\n\r\nneglect the welfare of their workers for their  own\r\n\r\nselfish  ends. We will impose yet higher  standards\r\n\r\nof  welfare,  safety and health in  the  workplaces\r\n\r\nthrough more stringent and effective enforcement of\r\n\r\nthe Factories Act and other safety regulations.  We\r\n\r\nhave   also   re-introduced  in  this  Session   of\r\n\r\nParliament  a  new Factories Bill which  will  give\r\n\r\nmore powers to the Minister and the Chief Inspector\r\n\r\nof  Factories  to deal with recalcitrant  employers\r\n\r\nand employees alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to always remember that we in\r\n\r\nSingapore  value the welfare, health and safety  of\r\n\r\nour  workers. The socialist philosophy of  the  PAP\r\n\r\ndoes  not permit us to achieve economic advancement\r\n\r\nby  sacrificing  the workers. Sacrifices  must  and\r\n\r\nwill   be  made;  but  they  must  come  from  all,\r\n\r\nincluding the employers. Our workers must never  be\r\n\r\nsubjected   to   the   same  indignities,   inhuman\r\n\r\nconditions and exploitations which characterize the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Revolutions  of  the  West.  For  these\r\n\r\nreasons, we will continue to expand the Labour  and\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorates of the  Ministry  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  standards of welfare, safety and  health\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  our  Labour laws are  respected  and\r\n\r\nenforced.  In  fact,  these two Inspectorates  have\r\n\r\nalready  stepped  up  their  inspections  of  work-places.\r\n\r\nDuring  the period from 8th  September  to\r\n\r\n21st October this year they successfully prosecuted\r\n\r\n69 employers for infringements of the Labour laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, priority will be given to\r\n\r\nthe  inspections of those establishments that  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  visited in their life span. The majority\r\n\r\nof these establishments are small and non-unionised\r\n\r\norganisations  with  high  infringement  and   non-compliance\r\n\r\nrate, either because of exploitation  by\r\n\r\nemployers  or ignorance of the law. A Special  Unit\r\n\r\nof  experienced  officers will also be  established\r\n\r\nwithin the Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspectorate to crack down on difficult and\r\n\r\nelusive employers. Relieved from routine inspection\r\n\r\nduties, these officers will also have more time  to\r\n\r\nprobe  into  and  help  solve,  whenever  possible,\r\n\r\ngenuine  difficulties encountered by both employers\r\n\r\nand employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Labour has a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  task to perform.  We  must  always\r\n\r\nensure  that  a \"happy medium\" between the  workers\r\n\r\nand  employers is maintained or face  an  explosive\r\n\r\nbuild-up  which will ultimately rock  our  existing\r\n\r\nindustrial stability on which our economic progress\r\n\r\nis   founded.   Whatever  the  odds   and   however\r\n\r\nunpleasant the task may be, we will do whatever has\r\n\r\nto  be  done  firmly but fairly,  without  fear  or\r\n\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the speech delivered by the President\r\n\r\nat  the  opening  of  the  First  Session  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament  has, to my mind, clearly  outlined  the\r\n\r\nconcept of development for Singapore in the  1970s.\r\n\r\nIf,  with the confidence and support of the people,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can  implement  its  policies  and\r\n\r\nachieve its objectives of nation building, then  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the 1970s, our Republic will  be  more\r\n\r\nprosperous than ever before. That is why I am  very\r\n\r\noptimistic about our future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly feel that the evolution of our nation\r\n\r\nis  unique. To my mind, in the 1950s when the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nmovement  was  at  its  peak,  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst colonial forces was not the hardest part in\r\n\r\nour  efforts at nation building. This is especially\r\n\r\nso after the Bandung Conference in the mid-fifties.\r\n\r\nAt   that  time  colonialism  was  already  on  the\r\n\r\ndecline, and the last counter attack by colonialism\r\n\r\nwas   only   a   dying  struggle.  Following   this\r\n\r\nhistorical development, the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nin  this favourable setup in Singapore was able  to\r\n\r\nkeep up with the trend of the time and thus by  the\r\n\r\nend  of the fifties we were able to enter the phase\r\n\r\nof  a  self-governing state without any difficulty.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  threshold  of  self-government,  as  all  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament here know,  we  could  very\r\n\r\neasily  have  wiped  out  the  remnant  forces   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and  achieved  independence.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  geographical position  and  other\r\n\r\nfactors  our  course  of  development  was  not   a\r\n\r\nstraight-forward one. In other words, in  the  last\r\n\r\ntwenty  years,  apart from struggling  against  the\r\n\r\noppression of colonialism, we also had to face  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of Communism and communalism.  Hitherto,\r\n\r\nthose who touched on the history of the development\r\n\r\nof  newly emergent countries used to put the  blame\r\n\r\non   colonialism  for  every  evil,  as  though  by\r\n\r\ncastigating  the  ugly figure of colonialism,  they\r\n\r\ncould  help  fulfil  the task  of  nation  building\r\n\r\nsmoothly. Even now outside this House, the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis is still harping on the outdated old  tune\r\n\r\nof anti-colonialism. Fortunately enough, the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are not as naive and obstinate as the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, otherwise we would  not  have  a\r\n\r\nSingapore as prosperous as we have today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is that as we enter\r\n\r\ninto  the early 1970s, the threat we may face  from\r\n\r\ncolonialism  will diminish, while  the  two-pronged\r\n\r\nattack  we  may face from Communism and communalism\r\n\r\nwill  increasingly  be  greater.  However,  of  the\r\n\r\nforces of Communism and communalism, the forces  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism seem to become the centre of  attention\r\n\r\nof  the world. During the conflict between the U.S.\r\n\r\nand  Russia,  the  Russian chief  delegate  at  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations made a lengthy speech lasting  some\r\n\r\n14  hours, a feat which can hardly be repeated. The\r\n\r\nlate  U.S. Secretary of State, Foster Dulles' grand\r\n\r\nstrategy of anti-Communism has gone into the waste-paper\r\n\r\nbasket by President Nixon's visit to Peking.\r\n\r\nEven the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is also\r\n\r\non the decline and now thrown into disarray. On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  Czechoslovak  incident  and  the\r\n\r\nHungarian  uprising together with  the  Sino-Russia\r\n\r\nideological  polemics  are the  first  symptoms  of\r\n\r\ndivision in the world Communist movement which  has\r\n\r\nled   to   the  dismantling  of  monolithic   world\r\n\r\nCommunism..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore, in the new decade of\r\n\r\nthe l970s, the threat from world Communism that  we\r\n\r\nmay  face  will be less and secondary  as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  that posed ten years ago. But this  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that \"The Voice of the Revolution of  Malaya\"\r\n\r\nwill be without its latent influence. At least,  in\r\n\r\nrecent years, the increasing Communist forces along\r\n\r\nthe Malaysia-Thailand border is a reminder and food\r\n\r\nfor thought for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a world renowned\r\n\r\nhistorian who tried to revise certain teachings  of\r\n\r\ncommunalism by playing down the destructive  forces\r\n\r\nof  communalism. However, in between the  lines  of\r\n\r\nhis book traces of communalism lurk throughout. The\r\n\r\nBiafran war in Nigeria is the most tragic event  in\r\n\r\nthe  history of civilised man and the tragic  civil\r\n\r\nwar  in Cyprus between the Greeks and the Turks  is\r\n\r\nstill lingering on. The May 13th incident resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  the  general  elections in  Malaysia,  though\r\n\r\ndescribed by some people as a storm in a teacup  is\r\n\r\nby  no means an insignificant cause for concern for\r\n\r\nus when compared with the incident of banishment of\r\n\r\nBritish Asians in Uganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the world situation is concerned, the\r\n\r\nbipolarisation  of  the world  by  Russia  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States has almost become something  of  the\r\n\r\npast.  Instead a new complex world has  emerged,  a\r\n\r\nworld  in which the Chinese, the Russians  and  the\r\n\r\nAmericans are vying with one another for spheres of\r\n\r\ninfluence, a world which is more radical, amorphous\r\n\r\nand complex. Some countries for ideological reasons\r\n\r\ntry  to broaden their sphere of influence by taking\r\n\r\nsides  with other countries; others, due to  racial\r\n\r\nconflicts  in certain countries try to  take  sides\r\n\r\nwith  countries  with closer blood affinity.  Some,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  economic interests or  conflicts,  are\r\n\r\nforced  willy-nilly to take sides as their economic\r\n\r\ninterest dictates. It is by no means clear  who  is\r\n\r\nright  and who is wrong in such melee, as  much  as\r\n\r\nthere  is no distinction between the white and  the\r\n\r\nblack.  Small nations which try to survive in  such\r\n\r\ncontext   if   not   cautious  or   through   wrong\r\n\r\ncalculation would easily find themselves involved  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin such entanglement and become victims  of\r\n\r\nother powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, this is the real world that we are\r\n\r\nfacing,  in which we seek survival and development.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  world  that is far from ideal.  We  must\r\n\r\ncontrive to seek our survival and fortunes in  this\r\n\r\nworld.  For us and for our friends, we must try  to\r\n\r\ncarve  out a corner in the sun in this part of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  This  is  the  substance  of  the  national\r\n\r\nobjective   of   Singapore  as  stressed   in   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  address. In the course of  trying  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this  objective, the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  always  be  very cautious and  alert  and  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for any eventualities. Only then  are  we\r\n\r\nable  to maintain, preserve and ensure the survival\r\n\r\nand  progress of the international metropolis  that\r\n\r\nwe  have built up in Singapore. On the contrary, if\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  ensure achievement of  further  success\r\n\r\nupon  success,  or if we allow the  ingredients  of\r\n\r\nsuccess   to  become  a  spent  force,   then   the\r\n\r\nachievements that we have built up over  the  years\r\n\r\nwill be gone with the wind, and so will our efforts\r\n\r\nin   building   a  better  future  for   our   next\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree that in the initial stages of\r\n\r\nnation building, if the national objectives are not\r\n\r\nalways kept in the forefront of the mind, then  the\r\n\r\nnation  will not be on the way to further  success.\r\n\r\nFrom  the valuable experience of our struggles over\r\n\r\nthe  last  seven or eight years, the President  has\r\n\r\ndealt in his address the most fundamental aspect of\r\n\r\nour   nation   building,  i.e, the  Constitutional\r\n\r\namendments  to  provide \"that no surrender  of  our\r\n\r\nsovereignty,  or  any  part  thereof,  by  way   of\r\n\r\nincorporation into, or federation with,  any  other\r\n\r\ncountry is possible, unless two-thirds of the total\r\n\r\nelectorate vote positively for it in a referendum\",\r\n\r\nso that no traitors may sell out Singapore. This is\r\n\r\nthe  most  important key to the  assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic's identity, and it also marks a  milestone\r\n\r\nin  our  effort from one victory to another greater\r\n\r\nvictory.  It  is only on this foundation  that  the\r\n\r\nnational leaders will then be able to further unite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  people  to ensure that Singapore will  forever\r\n\r\nweather any storm or any turbulence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's address makes special reference\r\n\r\nto  the importance of Constitutional amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  survival of Singapore, and this is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  I  find  it most encouraging. It is  also  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  I have chosen in my maiden  speech  to\r\n\r\nanalyse the international situation in relation  to\r\n\r\nits  possible  effects on the future of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  in the years to come, the rise and fall,  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  or failure of Singapore will be determined\r\n\r\nmore   by  factors  outside  Singapore  than  those\r\n\r\ninside.  But,  the  basic factor that  will  enable\r\n\r\nSingapore to weather all storms will be the  stable\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of nationalism in Singapore.  We  must\r\n\r\nalways bear this in mind, whether it is to be a tri-polar\r\n\r\nworld  of the Soviet Union,  China  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, or whether it is going to be a multi-polar\r\n\r\nworld of China, the United States, the Soviet\r\n\r\nUnion,  Japan and Germany, the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  always  regard  national  interests  as  most\r\n\r\nimportant. We must always bear in mind the maxim of\r\n\r\nnot  to  be corrupted by wealth, changed by poverty\r\n\r\nor succumbed by force. It is only then that we will\r\n\r\nbe  able,  with  determination and  capability,  to\r\n\r\ncombat   against  the  centrifugal  force  of   the\r\n\r\nignoramus  who  are  being manipulated  by  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests.  It  is  only then that  we  can  ensure\r\n\r\nfurther and more rapid success for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while dealing with the proposed\r\n\r\nConstitutional  amendments  as  mentioned  in   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  speech, I would avail  myself  of  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  make an appeal that  a  patriotism\r\n\r\nmovement be launched systematically in Singapore to\r\n\r\nensure that the people of the various races will be\r\n\r\nable  to become more united under the flag  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic so that each one may give of his best as a\r\n\r\nmember  of  a  united community. The President  has\r\n\r\ngiven  an  example of how selfish  people  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries  have  tried  to stop  working,  to  stop\r\n\r\nmaking profits when they reach the surtax level,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  some  of them have gone overseas to  stay  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  six  months in order  to  avoid  paying\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on the dividends they earn on  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.  If this kind of deleterious  thinking\r\n\r\nis  allowed to take root in Singapore, I am  afraid\r\n\r\nit  will  be cancerous to our morale. We have  read\r\n\r\nfrom newspapers that in highly developed countries,\r\n\r\nadministrators  and executives have  taken  to  the\r\n\r\nperfunctory attitude of working a day and living  a\r\n\r\nday.  In  relation to their own duties,  they  have\r\n\r\nadopted  the  philosophy of seeking  no  merit  and\r\n\r\ngetting no blame. They become clock-watchers. In so\r\n\r\nfar  as they are concerned, working more or working\r\n\r\nless  means  the same in salary. If  there  is  any\r\n\r\ndifference,  the difference is: to  do  more  means\r\n\r\nmore  errors; to do less means less errors; and  to\r\n\r\ndo  nothing means no errors. So for a small country\r\n\r\nlike Singapore, which is without a very long rooted\r\n\r\nfoundation  in  nation building, if such  poisonous\r\n\r\nphilosophy is allowed to take root, then there will\r\n\r\nbe endless disasters for our Republic. To put it in\r\n\r\na  nutshell, nationalism has been surging very high\r\n\r\nafter  the War and it is this spirit of nationalism\r\n\r\nthat  has  enabled  Singapore  to  shake  off   the\r\n\r\nshackles of colonial rule and the various pressures\r\n\r\nof  the  big  powers  on our nationalists,  and  to\r\n\r\nbecome   an   independent  sovereign   multi-racial\r\n\r\ncountry.  Hereafter,  the  future  prosperity   and\r\n\r\nstability of our country will ensure us a permanent\r\n\r\nplace in this complex world from which we can  cast\r\n\r\nour light around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the 9th of August, 1965, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  been  relying on themselves. We  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  keep  our eyes and ears open  to  gain  the\r\n\r\nexperiences   from   all  quarters   as   to   what\r\n\r\nconstitutes   the  driving  force  behind   further\r\n\r\nsuccess  and further development. This will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we will become honourable Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the motion in the name of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Batok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  four years and five months ago we met in this\r\n\r\nChamber  on  a  similar occasion  and  focused  our\r\n\r\nattention  on  a  number  of  problems,  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant  of  which  was the anticipated  economic\r\n\r\nrecession  resulting  from the  withdrawal  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish forces by the end of 1971. We set ourselves\r\n\r\nthree  objectives. First, to build up an  effective\r\n\r\ndefence  capability.  Second,  to  achieve  greater\r\n\r\neconomic   growth,  more  export  markets,   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity, sound labour management relations and\r\n\r\nmore jobs. And third, to develop in our society  an\r\n\r\nenhanced   national   consciousness   of   problems\r\n\r\naffecting  the  nation  whereby  the  people  would\r\n\r\naccept  the  subordination  of  their  personal  or\r\n\r\nsectional  interests to those of the  nation  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. The return of 65 of us to this Parliament by\r\n\r\nthe people is an acknowledgement of our achievement\r\n\r\nof the objectives we set ourselves in 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected economic recession was averted by\r\n\r\nthe considerable foreign investment in our economy.\r\n\r\nOur  economy went on to register remarkable  growth\r\n\r\nrates. In March this year, the Finance Minister  in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget Statement was able to disclose  a  14.1\r\n\r\nper cent Gross National Product average growth rate\r\n\r\nfrom  1966 to 1970 and a growth of 14 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1971 over the preceding year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The per capita income in 1968 was $1,987. In 1971\r\n\r\nit  stood  at $3,029 registering an average  growth\r\n\r\nrate  of  13  per cent through the five years.  Our\r\n\r\nexternal trade, which in 1968 was $8,974.5 million,\r\n\r\nhas  grown to $14,395.5 million in June this  year.\r\n\r\nOur  country's  overseas assets  had  increased  13\r\n\r\ntimes  in the past 13 1/4 years, and stood at $4,200\r\n\r\nmillion  in August this year. Internal and external\r\n\r\nassets stood at $10,000 million after depreciation.\r\n\r\nMore jobs have been created by an increasing number\r\n\r\nof  industries and through expansion in the service\r\n\r\nand manufacturing industries. The economy is viable\r\n\r\nand  provides reason for considerable  optimism  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Finance, it is\r\n\r\nstated that our fast rate of economic growth can be\r\n\r\nsustained  through a policy which will  ensure  the\r\n\r\navailability of adequate capital, land and suitable\r\n\r\nlabour,  i.e, the essential factors of  production.\r\n\r\nCapital accumulation resulting from more savings by\r\n\r\nthe  populace will occur if saving from our  income\r\n\r\nbecomes  a social habit. Towards this end the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia  and, in particular, television, can make  an\r\n\r\nimportant  contribution. Land reclamation  has  to-date\r\n\r\nadded 1,538 more acres to the country's total\r\n\r\nland area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pace of industrialisation mounts, the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  the  necessary industrial  skills  and\r\n\r\nexpertise  will be increasingly acute.  Fortunately\r\n\r\nplans  to  make available such skills and expertise\r\n\r\nhave    been   implemented   and   our   vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes,     industrial    training     centres,\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and  Universities  are  producing  the\r\n\r\nrequired  skilled manpower. Perhaps there could  be\r\n\r\ngreater  emphasis  in the policy  to  persuade  our\r\n\r\nwomenfolk to take to industrial work. The provision\r\n\r\nof   suitable   creches  near  industrial   estates\r\n\r\ncombined with reasonable wages may secure a sizable\r\n\r\nportion  of  the  200,000  industrially  employable\r\n\r\nfemale  workers  for the manufacturing  industries.\r\n\r\nThe  plans for human resources development proposed\r\n\r\nby   the   Labour  Ministry  are  crucial  to   our\r\n\r\nindustrial progress in view of the estimation  that\r\n\r\nour industrial labour force should reach 375,000 if\r\n\r\nit  is  to  effectively support our  industries  in\r\n\r\n1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told of the Ministry's intention to be\r\n\r\ndiscriminating in its selection of industries so as\r\n\r\nto encourage those industries which in turn set off\r\n\r\nother  supporting industries, those  which  upgrade\r\n\r\nmanpower  skills and those which do  not  ruin  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.  This policy is imperative  as  it  is\r\n\r\nfairly  evident today that we must survive  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  as  citizens of a city  state  -  a  highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised  global city. To do  so,  our  chief\r\n\r\nresource, our human resource, must keep apace  with\r\n\r\nthe  more  developed  societies  of  the  world  in\r\n\r\ntechnological, flair, skill and expertise.

However, we need to be cautious with the\r\n\r\nmulti-national companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A characteristic feature of the multi-national\r\n\r\ncompany   is  that  its  subsidiaries,  which   are\r\n\r\nestablished  in  the  manufacturing  and  marketing\r\n\r\ncentres  of the globe, take on different  roles  in\r\n\r\nthe  production  of  the final  product.  Not  much\r\n\r\ntechnological   or  managerial   skill   would   be\r\n\r\ntransmitted  to our manpower if the  subsidiary  of\r\n\r\nthe  multi-national company in Singapore  takes  on\r\n\r\nthe  role of producing simple component parts while\r\n\r\nthe  integration and assembly of the final  product\r\n\r\nwhich  calls  for much technological  expertise  is\r\n\r\ndone in another country. The multi-national company\r\n\r\nis  the corporate organisation of the times. It  is\r\n\r\ngigantic  and  wields much power, it can  determine\r\n\r\nthe price of raw materials, components and finished\r\n\r\nproducts  at  which its subsidiaries buy  and  sell\r\n\r\nbetween     themselves.    Transactions     between\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries at different buying and selling prices\r\n\r\ncan result in money leaving the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our city will soon be a manufacturing and\r\n\r\nmarketing centre and a strategic location  for  the\r\n\r\nmulti-national. There is much to know of the multi-national,\r\n\r\nthe   scope  of  its  operations,   its\r\n\r\ntechnique  and  its power if we are to  enter  into\r\n\r\ndealings with it beneficially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant point to note is that the interests\r\n\r\nof  Government  which are organised on  a  national\r\n\r\nbasis  might run counter to the interests of multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies which are organised on a  global\r\n\r\nscale  for  the  interests of a limited  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  outside the country. In this  connection  I\r\n\r\ncame  across in my reading what purports  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndefinition of the proper duty of an executive in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-national company, formulated by its chairman.\r\n\r\nI  must admit that I was disturbed. This definition\r\n\r\nof  the  proper  duty  of a multi-national  company\r\n\r\nrequired the executive to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`set aside any nationalistic attitudes and\r\n\r\nappreciate that in the last resort his loyalty must\r\n\r\nbe  to the shareholders of the parent company,  and\r\n\r\nhe  must protect the interests of the company  even\r\n\r\nif  it might appear that it was not perhaps in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest of the country in which  he  was\r\n\r\noperating  despite  apparent  conflicts,   as   the\r\n\r\ntransfer of funds at a period of national crisis, a\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  production  from  one  subsidiary  to\r\n\r\nanother, or a transfer of export business'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  view  of  what I have said, I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the proper expertise in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  which  can adequately  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nactivities of these corporate organisations, so  as\r\n\r\nto  ensure in the future that the Government is all\r\n\r\nthe time in control of the multi-national companies\r\n\r\nwhich choose to operate in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that in his Address the President has\r\n\r\nstressed the need for work ethic. Our acceptance of\r\n\r\nthe  work  ethic  has carried us through  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.  Its  rejection now will push  us  down  the\r\n\r\nslide.  The caution is timely. A new generation  of\r\n\r\nadults  is in employment and its capacity for  hard\r\n\r\nwork  is being tested. There are distractions.  The\r\n\r\ngeneral  affluence of members of  this  generation,\r\n\r\nthe  availability  of varieties  of  entertainment,\r\n\r\ntheir independence and the self-hypnotising ballads\r\n\r\nwhich  preach  opting out of society in  preference\r\n\r\nfor   \"constructive  prostration\",  whatever   that\r\n\r\nmeans.  But  if we carefully watch the excesses  of\r\n\r\nthis  generation and provide direction and example,\r\n\r\nwe  should continue to succeed in bringing to  bear\r\n\r\nupon  our  people  the meaning of the  advice  that\r\n\r\n\"nobody in Singapore owes anybody a living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addendum to the President's Speech on the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  National  Development  projects   an\r\n\r\nenvironment  which  is  most  welcome.  It  is   an\r\n\r\nenvironment of high-rise dwelling which  takes  the\r\n\r\nman,  the individual, the person in our society  as\r\n\r\nthe  measure of development and progress,  and  not\r\n\r\nstatistics   of  housing  achievement.   The   more\r\n\r\nspacious  and  better designed flats,  recreational\r\n\r\nand  social facilities, the gardens and parks,  all\r\n\r\nthese   will   go  a  long  way  in   meeting   the\r\n\r\nexpectations of the young flat dwellers who do  not\r\n\r\nhave the experience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the sordid slums of  the  mid-50s  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the progress in the transition from slum\r\n\r\nto flat dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible for me to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  all  the  policies  described  in  the\r\n\r\naddenda  of the various Ministries. I am sure  that\r\n\r\non   reading   them  our  people  will   have   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  that the Government has  meticulously\r\n\r\nplanned for our security and welfare well into  the\r\n\r\nyears ahead including, Sir, the improvement of  the\r\n\r\naddress  system in this Chamber. However, assurance\r\n\r\nof  our continued success must be qualified by  (a)\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of a world monetary crisis;  (b)  our\r\n\r\ncollective will and effort to succeed; and (c)  the\r\n\r\nabsence of disruptive international events  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968 a series of dramatic events have taken\r\n\r\nplace  in East and Southeast Asia, the full results\r\n\r\nof  which have yet to unfold. Within a period of 11\r\n\r\nmonths,  the  United Nations admitted the  People's\r\n\r\nRepublic of China to the world community; President\r\n\r\nNixon   visited  Peking  and  later  Moscow;  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Tanaka  visited Peking, followed  by  the\r\n\r\ncessation  of  diplomatic relations between  Taiwan\r\n\r\nand  Japan  and  the  impending  normalisation   of\r\n\r\nrelations  between Japan and the People's  Republic\r\n\r\nof  China.  At  the moment an end  to  the  war  in\r\n\r\nVietnam   might   not   be  an  improbability.   In\r\n\r\ninternational  politics we are not so  remote  from\r\n\r\nthese  events  that  they have no  bearing  on  our\r\n\r\nposition. What has to evolve in the region is a new\r\n\r\nstructure   of  tensions  which  will   give   some\r\n\r\ndefinition  to  the alignments of super  and  major\r\n\r\npowers  interested in the region. But whatever  the\r\n\r\noutcome of these events, the Government will act to\r\n\r\nensure  our  survival as a people of an independent\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last elections, self-acclaimed leaders of\r\n\r\npolitical   parties  opposing  us  campaigned   for\r\n\r\ngovernment of the country on the promise of release\r\n\r\nfrom  so-called  social and political  restrictions\r\n\r\nand  the  start of a new style of life. The  people\r\n\r\nput  paid  to these leaders. It is likely  that  an\r\n\r\nattempt will be made again in the next elections to\r\n\r\nfool the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung   electorate.   These   advocates   of    the\r\n\r\ninalienability  of  human rights  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nbeguile  our  people while in countries  around  us\r\n\r\ngovernments have, through the imposition of martial\r\n\r\nlaw,  shelved constitutional and inalienable rights\r\n\r\nin  bulk  to  attempt  a  reconstruction  of  their\r\n\r\nsocieties and countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all of us understand that the priority of the\r\n\r\nissues  for  our nation is first how to keep  alive\r\n\r\nand  then how to live and not any other combination\r\n\r\nwhich reverses the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be confronted with more challenges in the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years. However, we may draw  confidence\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact that through the present  political\r\n\r\nleadership  there is gradually being  generated  in\r\n\r\nour social dynamic a national instinct for survival\r\n\r\n- an instinct which can recognise a national threat\r\n\r\nand  can respond to the need for a realistic course\r\n\r\nof  action  to  adequately deal with  it.  For  us,\r\n\r\nvigilance,  hard work, the will to  succeed  and  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  realism  is the price of  our  survival.\r\n\r\nThere is no other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting\r\n\r\nthe  motion  calling for a vote of  thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident for his Address to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  on  behalf of the  people  of  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar,  I would like to support the motion  in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Bukit Batok. The standard of\r\n\r\nliving  of  our  people in Singapore has  increased\r\n\r\nwith  the  rapid economic development and progress.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it has only been a short space  of  eight\r\n\r\nyears  since our independence, the people  are  now\r\n\r\nenjoying  political stability and economic success,\r\n\r\nthereby  posturing us as one of the most  fortunate\r\n\r\npeople in the whole of Southeast Asia. While we are\r\n\r\nmaking  rapid  progress in the economic  front,  we\r\n\r\nmust  also  realise  that  there  are  always   two\r\n\r\nversions  of  a story. Therefore, while  we  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect our leaders to catch up immediately with the\r\n\r\nstandard of the advanced countries in the world, we\r\n\r\ncan, however, be assured that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  continuing drive and dynamism, together  with\r\n\r\nconcerted  efforts on the part of  the  people,  we\r\n\r\nwill  gradually  be  able to  keep  pace  with  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries. If we take two steps when  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries take only one, and if  we  take\r\n\r\none  year to do what they need to do in two  years,\r\n\r\nthen  if  we can move at this pace we will soon  be\r\n\r\nable to narrow the gap between our own country  and\r\n\r\nthe  advanced countries. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address, we have been told  that  the\r\n\r\npace of our economic growth is to be maintained and\r\n\r\naccelerated in the years to come. Only then will we\r\n\r\nbe able to maintain high standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same Address, reference is also made to\r\n\r\nthe  salary structure of the civil servants,  which\r\n\r\nwill  come  under  review. This, of  course,  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter for rejoice. But I feel that while the terms\r\n\r\nand conditions of service and remuneration of civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  being reviewed, supervision  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service and the correction of their attitude\r\n\r\nto  work should go on at the same time. Sir, proper\r\n\r\nwork  ethos should be created in our civil service.\r\n\r\nThis was obtained some years ago when we first took\r\n\r\noffice. For some time past, the civil servants  had\r\n\r\nbeen  working  very well with the correct  attitude\r\n\r\nand the right spirit. This won them the acclaim  of\r\n\r\nthe people. But after a lapse of several years, the\r\n\r\nold trouble took a relapse. Perhaps this is because\r\n\r\nin  the  early  stages of our nation building,  our\r\n\r\nMinisters were too occupied with the many  problems\r\n\r\nso   that  they  were  not  able  to  devote  their\r\n\r\nattention to this aspect of the civil service, i.e.\r\n\r\nto maintain a correct attitude towards work and the\r\n\r\nright spirit to be adopted in the civil service. In\r\n\r\nview  of this, Sir, when reference is made  to  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the civil service salary scales, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the inculcation of the correct  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards work should be made at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that remuneration must be compatible\r\n\r\nwith  the  responsibilities of the job in order  to\r\n\r\nattract  and  retain  the right  calibre  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat the same time there is a small minority of\r\n\r\ncivil servants who are guilty of very poor service,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the plain-clothes Health  inspectors,\r\n\r\nor    building   inspectors.   These   people   are\r\n\r\ndiscourteous and bureaucratic in the performance of\r\n\r\ntheir duties, particularly when they deal with  the\r\n\r\npublic.  They  are pompous and throw  their  weight\r\n\r\naround  especially among those people in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  who are ignorant. I therefore feel that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  wield  the  big  axe  and  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  action  to chop down  these  people.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  the  good reputation  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  the  Government to  be  spoilt  by  a\r\n\r\nminority  of  these  pompous and discourteous  \"bad\r\n\r\nhats\"  or black sheep. If these black sheep in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  are allowed to throw  their  weight\r\n\r\nabout  among  the  people, particularly  the  rural\r\n\r\nfolk,  then after some time the people will have  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad impression of the civil service  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. As a result of this, whatever efficient\r\n\r\nservice  that  has  been given  to  the  people  in\r\n\r\ngeneral will be written off. I therefore appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  concerned to deal with  those  civil\r\n\r\nservants who are bringing the entire civil  service\r\n\r\ninto disrepute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of education, we\r\n\r\nall  know that Singapore is multi-racial and multi-lingual,\r\n\r\nan international metropolis. The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore should not only know their mother tongue,\r\n\r\nbut  also a second language, particularly when  the\r\n\r\nsecond language is English. This, Sir, has been the\r\n\r\nconsistent policy of the Government, and  is  being\r\n\r\nimplemented by the Ministry of Education. Steps are\r\n\r\nalso being taken to improve the methods of teaching\r\n\r\nin  the  hope  that  our next  generation  will  be\r\n\r\nsufficiently  proficient  in  two  languages  after\r\n\r\ncompletion of their secondary education. Sir,  this\r\n\r\npolicy  has  always received the strong support  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Chinese School Teachers' Association,\r\n\r\nof  which I happen to be the President. When I read\r\n\r\nthe  motion, standing in the name of the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Batok, who is also the Minister of State  for\r\n\r\nEducation, I felt rather sad when he made reference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  some  teachers in his speech.  Perhaps  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  still  in the  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ncampus  and  has  not  quite  realised  the  actual\r\n\r\nconditions.  But,  let me come back  to  the  topic\r\n\r\nunder  discussion.  The  Singapore  Chinese  School\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Association has always  been  supporting\r\n\r\nthis  policy of the Government. There is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout  this.  In  our memoranda  submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, we have stated our views  on\r\n\r\nhow  and  what  to  do to improve  second  language\r\n\r\nteaching,  i.e, the teaching of English in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.  In  this regard, Sir,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress  my  humble opinion, and that is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should try to ensure that every child is\r\n\r\neducated  first in his own mother tongue, while  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time learning a second language. Children\r\n\r\neducated in this way will be much better than those\r\n\r\nwho  are  educated  first  in  a  second  language,\r\n\r\nbecause they may not know or may know only a little\r\n\r\nof  their own mother tongue. This is, of course, my\r\n\r\nhumble  opinion and is subject to the  scrutiny  of\r\n\r\nthe hon. Members in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while still on the subject of\r\n\r\neducation,  as  a representative of the  people  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  President of the  Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nSchool Teachers' Association, I would like to bring\r\n\r\nto your attention the grievances of the teachers in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In this particular regard, I  have  one\r\n\r\naspect  to  concentrate on. For many years  in  the\r\n\r\npast, the Chinese School Teachers' Association  has\r\n\r\ntaken up the matter with the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth Minister has assumed office, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  the new Minister,  or  the  new\r\n\r\nMinister of State, or the new Parliamentary  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  taken  note  of   their\r\n\r\ngrievances and is prepared to look further into the\r\n\r\nmatter. This has been going on for a long time  and\r\n\r\nis  quite beyond the comprehension of many  people.\r\n\r\nEven  those  teachers who have  retired  are  still\r\n\r\ngrumbling.  They go to the extent  of  saying  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not \"close their eyes even  after  they\r\n\r\nhave kicked the bucket\". So I would like to take  a\r\n\r\nlittle  time  of  the House to  elaborate  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter for the benefit of the Minister of State, in\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of the Minister. It is also  my  hope\r\n\r\nthat by airing such grievances here, I will be able\r\n\r\nto get an explanation for the delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, obligations and privileges must\r\n\r\nbe  equal,  and rules must have equal  application.\r\n\r\nThat   is  common-sense.  But  in  Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools, there is this anomaly in this common-sense\r\n\r\nphilosophy, and that is, under the same  Government\r\n\r\nand  in  the same school, teachers are governed  by\r\n\r\ntwo different sets of rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
