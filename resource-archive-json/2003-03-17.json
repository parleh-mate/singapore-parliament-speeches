Dr Amy Khor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  applaud  the  MOM  for  aggressively  and  tirelessly\r\n\r\nlaunching a slew of programmes to help retrenched workers\r\n\r\nand  groom Singaporeans into an adaptable workforce  with\r\n\r\nportable skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one of my grassroots leaders with business\r\n\r\nin  China and Australia, recently remarked, half in jest,\r\n\r\nthat compared to other governments in the region,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  may  have taken skills upgrading and retraining  much\r\n\r\ntoo  seriously.   He  mused cynically  that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done  too much, so  much  so  that  when\r\n\r\nworkers cannot get a job after retraining with Government\r\n\r\nfunds, they blame the Government who kept nudging them to\r\n\r\ngo for retraining in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on a more serious note, despite the plethora of\r\n\r\nskills upgrading and retraining programmes launched, some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at the ground have the impression that  what\r\n\r\nhad  been  done  so far are ad hoc and disjointed.   Some\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the large number of schemes, as well  as  the\r\n\r\nmultiple  agencies organising these schemes, is confusing\r\n\r\nand  that  there  is  also  some degree  of  duplication.\r\n\r\nRightly  or wrongly, the suspicion is that all the  money\r\n\r\non  retraining  may  not have been  well  spent  and  the\r\n\r\nresults less than sterling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, are there enough job opportunities for\r\n\r\nthe   course   participants  after  they   complete   the\r\n\r\nprogramme?   Otherwise,  some  could  become  even   more\r\n\r\ndejected.    This  calls  for  a  programme   of   career\r\n\r\ncounselling  to  help  workers  match  their  skills  and\r\n\r\ninterests with the job opportunities available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the most relevant and useful training\r\n\r\nprogrammes been organised?  Has the training helped  them\r\n\r\nfind  employment?  What is the job retention rate of  the\r\n\r\ntrainees  after they complete the programme?  I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can enlighten us on these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to these issues, I am pleased that a body\r\n\r\nto  further  develop,  promote and coordinate  Continuing\r\n\r\nEducation  and  Training for adults and  their  placement\r\n\r\nwill  be  formed.  The new CET body should  work  closely\r\n\r\nwith all relevant private and public sector organisations\r\n\r\nin  identifying, planning and organising the  appropriate\r\n\r\nCET  programmes  and inculcating the  habit  of  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning  in  a  Singaporean  workforce  at  all  levels,\r\n\r\nincluding the professionals and executives who  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen spared from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nredundancy  and  retrenchments.   The  CET  body   should\r\n\r\nconfine  itself to policy and promotion and champion  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement  of the private sector to supply services  to\r\n\r\nrealise its mission.  It should try to outsource as  many\r\n\r\ncourses  as  possible to the private sector who  has  the\r\n\r\ncapability  to  conduct these courses  and  not  directly\r\n\r\ncompete  with them in course delivery. This would prevent\r\n\r\nthe  CET  body from becoming another behemoth  that  some\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public are wary of.  It would  indeed  be\r\n\r\nironic  if  there  comes a day when the CET  body,  which\r\n\r\noversees training and placement of the unemployed, has to\r\n\r\nretrench employees themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CET body should ensure that minimum standards\r\n\r\nare  complied  with. Finally, it should  also  track  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  and effectiveness of all programmes implemented,\r\n\r\nbenchmark itself against an internationally accepted  set\r\n\r\nof  educational  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPI)  and\r\n\r\nreport these periodically.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Gan See Khem is not here. Ms\r\n\r\nIrene Ng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, let me\r\n\r\nstart  by  relating the experience of a man who has  been\r\n\r\nretrenched three times and he is only 39 years  old.  His\r\n\r\nfirst  retrenchment was in 1982.  He  worked  as  a  pipe\r\n\r\nfitter  and  he  got retrenched after about  11/2  years.\r\n\r\nThen,  he  worked as a marine assistant in Jurong  Island\r\n\r\nand   after  13  years,  he  was  retrenched.  His  third\r\n\r\nretrenchment was last week, from a paint factory where he\r\n\r\nworked as a warehouse assistant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would think that, after being retrenched twice,\r\n\r\nhe  would have been better steeled for his last one.  But\r\n\r\nno.   For  him,  his  last  retrenchment  was  the   most\r\n\r\ntraumatic.  This was because of the way the exercise  was\r\n\r\nconducted.   He went to work, like any normal day.  Then,\r\n\r\nafter  lunch,  a dozen of them were asked to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nboardroom,  and they were told that they were retrenched.\r\n\r\nJust  like  that.

He  was so upset that he threw his company uniform\r\n\r\ninto the dustbin in front of his supervisor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his experience holds some lessons. No, not\r\n\r\nonly  that  you  have  to be prepared  to  be  retrenched\r\n\r\nseveral  times in your working life, but also  that  some\r\n\r\ncompanies just lack the experience and knowledge  on  how\r\n\r\nto conduct retrenchments in a humane and proper way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With retrenchments on the rise in Singapore, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  it is necessary to lay down some guidelines on what\r\n\r\nconstitute   good   industrial  relations   practice   on\r\n\r\nconducting retrenchments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want to make it so hard for companies\r\n\r\nto  retrench  in  so  hard a way that  would  affect  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  our labour market and our attractiveness\r\n\r\nfor  investment.  But  we  cannot  allow  it  to  be   so\r\n\r\nfreewheeling that companies can discard workers  like  so\r\n\r\nmany expired canned food on a shelf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a good retrenchment practice is that\r\n\r\nconducted  by Beecham Pharmaceuticals in 1996,  where  it\r\n\r\ngave  about  one year's notice to staff of its  impending\r\n\r\nretrenchment  exercise.  The time allowed  them  to  make\r\n\r\nalternative  plans regarding their financial  commitments\r\n\r\nand to look for a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Beecham and the union, the Chemical\r\n\r\nIndustries Employees' Union, arranged for staff to attend\r\n\r\ncourses   during   their  working  hours.    Nearer   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment  date, the company provided counselling  and\r\n\r\neven   allowed  its  workers  time-off  to  go  for   job\r\n\r\ninterviews.   By  doing  this, it treated  the  departing\r\n\r\nemployees with dignity and respect, and kept morale  high\r\n\r\namong the remaining employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that arises from the recent PSA\r\n\r\nretrenchment  is  that  it  is  an  example  of  a   good\r\n\r\nretrenchment  exercise  or a  bungled  one.   People  are\r\n\r\ndivided  on  this issue. Some say yes,  this  is  a  good\r\n\r\nexample,   because   PSA  management   made   a   general\r\n\r\nannouncement on the estimated numbers to be retrenched on\r\n\r\n17th February and gave a notice period\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  about  one  month so that unions could  start  formal\r\n\r\nnegotiations with management to work out a fair  package.\r\n\r\nThis  was better than to spring it suddenly on the unions\r\n\r\nand  workers,  which would then have no time  to  consult\r\n\r\neach other and to find ways to help the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, including some in the media, say no. The\r\n\r\nmedia reported that many workers had been anxious to know\r\n\r\nwho  would be retrenched and that morale was down because\r\n\r\nof the uncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng, you are nearing the end\r\n\r\nof your speaking time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> This led PSA to expedite\r\n\r\nthe  process  and conclude the negotiations  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.   But it raises the question of  what  makes  a\r\n\r\ngood   practice   in  terms  of  giving   a   notice   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  How long should it be?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify the matter, I would urge the Manpower\r\n\r\nMinistry, together with its tripartite partners, to  work\r\n\r\nout   guidelines  on  how  to  deal  with  retrenchments,\r\n\r\nincluding  the matter of giving appropriate notice.  This\r\n\r\ncould   form  a  Code  of  Practice  on  good  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations for retrenchment exercises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to add on to what hon. Member,  Irene\r\n\r\nNg, has said.  As retrenchment is generally a painful and\r\n\r\ntraumatic  experience for affected employees, it  is  the\r\n\r\nmanner in which employees are retrenched and the attitude\r\n\r\nof some employers that I wish to raise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ms Irene Ng has informed us, some organisations\r\n\r\nare   very   caring.  They  go  beyond  their   statutory\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   in  providing  whatever   retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits  are  required of them to the  employees.   They\r\n\r\ntake  pains  to  inform and prepare  the  workers.   They\r\n\r\narrange for MOM and the trade union to be present at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  during  the  period when retrenchment  notices\r\n\r\nwere   served,   to  help  with  alternative   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  to offer comfort and  support.   They\r\n\r\nmake  referrals  to  social  service  organisations,  for\r\n\r\nexample, Family Service Centres, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  who  need counselling and advice on  personal  and\r\n\r\nfamily matters.  A few conscientious employers would even\r\n\r\ninvite  Family  Service Centres or other  social  service\r\n\r\norganisations  to  the workplace during  that  period  to\r\n\r\noffer  on-site  information,  referrals  and  counselling\r\n\r\nservice to their retrenched staff. Unfortunately,  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  just  heard, the majority of retrenchment exercises\r\n\r\ndo not go that smoothly.  Only a handful of the employers\r\n\r\nbother to provide such an arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the anxiety and despondency of being\r\n\r\nretrenched,  especially for those who have  heavy  family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to worry about, can affect their social,\r\n\r\npsychological health.  .Hence, bringing in the assistance\r\n\r\nof    professionally   qualified   social   workers   and\r\n\r\ncounsellors, for instance, as part of the overall process\r\n\r\nduring  their  retrenchment exercise is  to  be  strongly\r\n\r\nencouraged. The helping professionals can listen  to  the\r\n\r\nemployees and offer them comfort.  They can work out with\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched  employees  on  how  to  mobilise  social\r\n\r\nsupport and community resources and how to make necessary\r\n\r\nchanges and adjustments in their lives. In this way,  the\r\n\r\nunwelcome  blow  of retrenchment can be mitigated  and  a\r\n\r\nheavy  burden lightened.  This would also help boost  the\r\n\r\npsychological  state  of mind of retrenched  persons  and\r\n\r\nhelp   provide  the  necessary  motivation,  among  other\r\n\r\nmatters, for them to press on with finding jobs or to  go\r\n\r\nfor training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my query to the Minister then is: how can MOM\r\n\r\nencourage  more  employers  to  provide  counselling  and\r\n\r\nsocial  service  assistance to  their  retrenched  staff,\r\n\r\neither through their own human resource department or  by\r\n\r\ninviting  Family  Service  Centres  and  the  CDCs,   for\r\n\r\nexample, to be on site at the workplace, during the  time\r\n\r\nwhen the retrenchment exercise is on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I am concerned\r\n\r\nthat  our  structural unemployment is on a rising  trend.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  World Development  Report  2001,  our\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment stands at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n17.7%, as compared to Korea's 2.5% and the United States'\r\n\r\n8.7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of structural unemployment is rising\r\n\r\namong  the  highest educated segment of the workforce  as\r\n\r\nwell.   According  to  the  IPS  report,  the  share   of\r\n\r\nsecondary  educated structural unemployment increased  to\r\n\r\nnearly 30% as at 2001.  What is more worrying is that the\r\n\r\nshare of the higher educated, which means post-secondary,\r\n\r\ndiploma   and   degree  holders  who  were   structurally\r\n\r\nunemployed, increased by more than three-fold, from 7% to\r\n\r\nnearly 24% between 1986 and 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is partly due to our education system\r\n\r\nbeing  too rigidly or artificially designed to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  MNCs in the past.  Many graduates cannot  find\r\n\r\njobs  that  match their training as those MNCs  who  need\r\n\r\ntheir  knowledge have left Singapore. It is  ironic  that\r\n\r\nwhile our Government is constantly stressing on producing\r\n\r\nhigh-value added products and services, high-value  added\r\n\r\nhuman resource could not find any jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who think that the foreign\r\n\r\ntalent policy is another factor contributing to the  high\r\n\r\nrate  of  unemployment.  These so called foreign  talents\r\n\r\nare  merely  cheap  replacements  for  our  high-educated\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Many people also started to  wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthey  have been short-changed by these so-called  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been talking about training and\r\n\r\nretraining.   My  question is:  how successful  has  this\r\n\r\nstrategy  been  in  solving the  structural  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem?   Maybe the Government should be  reminded  that\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  are  also  facing  a  rising  trend  in\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment, from 10% in 1986 to  more  than\r\n\r\n30% in 2001, as shown in the Institute of Policy Studies'\r\n\r\nreport.   Just blaming workers for not accepting jobs  of\r\n\r\nlower  pay or status will not help in the long  run.  The\r\n\r\nsocial   and  economic  cost  of  workers  having   their\r\n\r\npotential under-utilised will be huge in the long run for\r\n\r\na small resource-scarce economy like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the social and\r\n\r\npsychological    impact    of    prolonged     structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.    I  would  like  to  know   whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has commissioned any studies on the social and\r\n\r\npsychological    impact   of   structural   unemployment.\r\n\r\nAccording  to statistics, again provided by  IPS  report,\r\n\r\nthe  percentage  of older workers, from age  40-49,  rose\r\n\r\nfrom  17%  in  1984  to  40% in  2001.   The  social  and\r\n\r\npsychological  impact  on  this  group  of  workers,  who\r\n\r\nprobably  has the most heavy burden of their  life  cycle\r\n\r\nwith  children  to  support,  would  be  great  and  far-reaching.    It  would  lead  to  problems  like   mental\r\n\r\ninstability  due  to  stress, stress on  marital  status,\r\n\r\nmarital relations, social polarisation between the  haves\r\n\r\nand have-nots, reduce social cohesion, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the Government's\r\n\r\nassessment of the seriousness of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nBesides urging people to lower their expectation, to sail\r\n\r\nthrough  the rough waters, training and retraining,  etc,\r\n\r\nare  there any other plans to help mitigate the  pain  of\r\n\r\nthose   suffering  under  the  situation  of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment?\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  thank  the  many hon. Members who have spoken  on  the\r\n\r\nmanpower challenges, employment market and job assistance\r\n\r\nmeasures and also on continuing education and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before addressing the specific queries raised by\r\n\r\nhon.  Members, I would like to make some general comments\r\n\r\nto  put  in  perspective  the  situation  and  challenges\r\n\r\nconfronting  us  today.   First and  foremost,  the  poor\r\n\r\nemployment  market  reflects  the  weak  global  economy.\r\n\r\nMajor  economies  such as the US, the European  countries\r\n\r\nand  Japan are down.  We cannot expect to be immune  from\r\n\r\nthe  global downturn.  There is also a radical  shift  in\r\n\r\nthe global environment.  Globalisation and the relentless\r\n\r\npursuit   of   corporate  competitiveness   are   pushing\r\n\r\ncompanies  to be more mobile.  They scour the  world  for\r\n\r\nlocations that can offer them a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive   edge   in  terms  of  cost,   productivity,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and talent.  Previously, labour-intensive\r\n\r\noperations such as manufacturing of toys, radios and  TVs\r\n\r\nwere transferred to the less- developed countries.  Later\r\n\r\non,  more sophisticated products, such as disk drives and\r\n\r\ncomputers,   followed.    But  the   current   round   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  is seeing even skilled and knowledge  type\r\n\r\nof  jobs  moving  offshore as well.   This  is  not  just\r\n\r\nhappening in the United States or the European countries,\r\n\r\nbut also affecting Singapore, with the emergence of China\r\n\r\nand  India  as  major  economic  competitors.   With  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  knowledge  tasks can  be  undertaken  or  done\r\n\r\nalmost  anywhere  in the world.  Many MNCs  are  shifting\r\n\r\ntheir  back-room  operations and  even  call  centres  to\r\n\r\nIndia.  Others are shifting to China and eastern European\r\n\r\ncountries  which have ample highly skilled, well-educated\r\n\r\nworkers willing to work at competitive salaries in  areas\r\n\r\nlike  chip  design, software engineering,  even  auditing\r\n\r\nfinancial statements and drafting architectural plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to compete for investments and jobs in\r\n\r\nthis  global environment.  To remain competitive, we have\r\n\r\nto  move up the value-added and technology ladder.   This\r\n\r\nis  not  the first time that Singapore has had to  change\r\n\r\ngear.   From  making  shoes and garments,  we  went  into\r\n\r\nmaking hair-dryers, typewriters and radios.  Later on, we\r\n\r\nwent  into  printed  circuit boards, disk  drives,  semi-conductors  and precision-engineering.  Today,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  attract investments in  growth  industries\r\n\r\nsuch  as  specialty  chemicals,  high  value  electronics\r\n\r\nproducts   such  as  network  storage  devices,  advanced\r\n\r\ndisplay devices, photonics, digital media, and biomedical\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, we have stayed ahead and remained\r\n\r\ncompetitive  because  we  have successfully  adapted  our\r\n\r\neconomy  to suit global trends.  What is different  today\r\n\r\nis  that the pace of restructuring is accelerating and so\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  adjust faster than before.  And this  time,\r\n\r\nSir,   there   are  more  competitors  in   the   market.\r\n\r\nDisplacement, or job losses, is also affecting the entire\r\n\r\nspectrum   of  workers,  from  lower-skilled  blue-collar\r\n\r\nworkers to professionals, managers and executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we address the concerns of those who are\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  economic restructuring and to  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  as Mr Low had just mentioned?   First,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  more  investments, so that new  jobs  can  be\r\n\r\ncreated.  To do this, we must transform Singapore into an\r\n\r\neven  more  attractive location for businesses that  come\r\n\r\nhere  because they can leverage on our excellent economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   That  is the strategic  thrust  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review Committee's Report.  And, Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nis   attractive.   Despite  the  gloomy  global  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment last year, EDB attracted $9 billion worth  of\r\n\r\nfixed  assets investments in manufacturing and $2 billion\r\n\r\nworth  of  business spending in services.   And,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Trade and Industry told  us  on  Saturday,\r\n\r\nthese   investments  will  add  20,000  new   jobs   when\r\n\r\noperational.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EDB's investment promotion efforts will receive\r\n\r\na   boost   with  our  network  of  FTAs  with  different\r\n\r\ncountries,  especially the upcoming FTAs with the  United\r\n\r\nStates.  For example, recently ST-Microelectronics  -  by\r\n\r\nthe  way, \"ST\" is not \"Singapore Technologies\", it  is  a\r\n\r\nEuropean  company - just announced that it  would  invest\r\n\r\nS$436  million  over the next three years to  expand  its\r\n\r\nsemiconductor production capacity in Singapore.  ST Micro\r\n\r\nexpects  this  to  create some  800  new  jobs.   Another\r\n\r\ncompany, AFPD's Liquid Crystal Display plant, launched at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  last  year, is an example of  the  advanced\r\n\r\ndisplay  industry which we believe has growth  potential.\r\n\r\nAFPD's investment of some S$3.14 billion over the initial\r\n\r\ntwo  years  is expected to generate 700 jobs.  These  and\r\n\r\nother investments will create many skilled jobs and  also\r\n\r\nsome unskilled ones along the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, IE Singapore is helping our\r\n\r\ncompanies   to   seek   out  new   markets   and   export\r\n\r\nopportunities.   As our companies grow  their  businesses\r\n\r\nabroad,   they   will   have  to  build   up   management\r\n\r\ncapabilities at home to help to run the business  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  This will create\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore jobs for our professionals and managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring more investments here, we need workers with\r\n\r\nthe  right  skill  sets for the jobs.   If  workers  lack\r\n\r\nskills  or  if  they cannot pick up the relevant  skills,\r\n\r\nthey will not be employable.  Then we will suffer growing\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment.  So, the answer  is  in  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.  Many hon. Members - Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Heng Chee How,  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah Heng and Dr Amy Khor - have spoken in support  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's effort to upgrade the skills of our  workers\r\n\r\nor  retrain them for the new jobs.  I thank all the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers for their endorsement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, skills upgrading is not new to our workforce.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  new to Singapore.  As all Members know,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  promoting  skills  upgrading   for\r\n\r\ndecades.  Over the years, we have, in fact, established a\r\n\r\nvery   strong   system  of  employer-based  training   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Members will recall that we set up the Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  in  1979.   Since  then,  the   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  has supported some 8 million  training\r\n\r\nplaces  for  our  workers.  That  has  kept  our  workers\r\n\r\nproductive and competitive in the past two decades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang pointed out that we should use the\r\n\r\npresent slack period to prepare our workers for recovery.\r\n\r\nI  agree  wholeheartedly.   In FY  2001,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncontributed  $500  million as a one-off  payment  to  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development Fund (SDF) to sustain its  effort  to\r\n\r\ntrain the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Plan launched in 1999 highlighted\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of promoting lifelong  learning.   Since\r\n\r\nthen,  we  have achieved some success with new programmes\r\n\r\nintroduced to build up skills in various segments of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, and I believe Dr Amy Khor, also\r\n\r\nasked   how   many  workers  were  helped  through   this\r\n\r\nprogramme.  We have exceeded the 5-year target of 100,000\r\n\r\ntraining  places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\nadministered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby the NTUC.  Over 150,000 people have been trained in IT\r\n\r\nskills under the National IT Literacy Programme and  also\r\n\r\nthe  Infocomm  Competency Programme.  Over 20,000  people\r\n\r\nhave   been   trained   under  the  WorkSkills   Training\r\n\r\nProgramme.   And,  over  4,800  professionals  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained under the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme\r\n\r\nand  Self-Employment Training Programme.  This  does  not\r\n\r\ninclude    professionals,   managers,   executives    and\r\n\r\ntechnicians  who were trained under different  programmes\r\n\r\nrun  by  EDB, MAS, Infocomm Development Authority and  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the annual Lifelong Learning Festival has also\r\n\r\nreached  out  to  some 75,000-100,000  Singaporeans  each\r\n\r\nyear.   But  more  can  be  done.   The  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommended  that a Continuing  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  statutory  board  be  formed  to  provide  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and effective national Continuing Education\r\n\r\nand    Training.     Government   has    accepted    this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  The Ministry of Manpower will  establish\r\n\r\na   statutory  board  to  focus  on  CET  and  employment\r\n\r\nfacilitation  by the end of this year.   The  mission  of\r\n\r\nthis new statutory board is to enhance employability  and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of Singaporean workers.  It is to prepare\r\n\r\nour  workers,  young  and  old,  skilled  and  unskilled,\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  blue-collar,  for  the   restructured\r\n\r\neconomy.   I  thank  the many hon. Members  including  Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad  Magad,  Mr Seng Han Thong, Mdm Halimah  Yacob  and\r\n\r\nothers  for  their comments and suggestions for  the  CET\r\n\r\nstatutory  board.  We will be considering  all  of  these\r\n\r\nideas  and suggestions in the months ahead as we go about\r\n\r\nsetting up the statutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Miss Irene Ng seem particularly\r\n\r\nworried   that  when  the  ERC  Report,  or  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials,  or  even myself mentioned \"workers\",  we  are\r\n\r\nonly thinking of blue-collar workers.  Let me assure  all\r\n\r\nof  them,  once and for all, that when we  use  the  term\r\n\r\n\"worker\" or \"workforce\", we use it in the broadest sense.\r\n\r\nWe use it in an all-embracing manner.  We are all workers\r\n\r\n- working for our families, for Singapore - regardless\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  actual job that we are engaged in.  However,  we\r\n\r\nwill  still  need to prioritise and target  our  training\r\n\r\nassistance.  As Mdm Halimah pointed out on Saturday,  the\r\n\r\nlower-skilled  workers are more vulnerable to  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.     Yes,   we   are    seeing    structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  and growing unemployment  even  among  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  managers and executives, but  the  lower-skilled   and   lower-educated  are  by  far   the   most\r\n\r\nvulnerable.  So they needed a little extra help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, briefly, I see the statutory board doing the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) promote workforce skills upgrading;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) build a comprehensive Continuing Education and\r\n\r\nTraining infrastructure;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) enable sustained Continuing Education and\r\n\r\nTraining with employers' involvement and support;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) develop the Continuing Education and Training and\r\n\r\nHuman Resource industries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) last, but not least, regulate the standards of\r\n\r\nContinuing Education and Training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statutory board's objective is very\r\n\r\nspecific  -  the employability of our workers.   But  its\r\n\r\nmandate is broad because it will serve the mainstream  of\r\n\r\nadult  workers,  not  just  the  lower  skilled  or   the\r\n\r\nunemployed.  It will reach out to our workers,  including\r\n\r\nthe  professionals, managers and executives.   I  see  it\r\n\r\nhelping  these groups to meet their skills and job  needs\r\n\r\nthrough:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) continuing skills upgrading for all levels of\r\n\r\nthe workforce, including professionals and executives;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) helping our workers to develop new skills so\r\n\r\nthat they can get jobs in growth industries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) providing employment assistance programmes\r\n\r\nwhich will be packaged together with skills training  for\r\n\r\nnew jobs and, in some cases, with some career counselling\r\n\r\nand guidance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo, Mr Ahmad Magad and several other hon.\r\n\r\nMembers have highlighted the need to strengthen the nexus\r\n\r\nbetween  training and industry needs. In particular,  Mrs\r\n\r\nYu-Foo would like to see better planning to train workers\r\n\r\nfor  incoming industries so that jobs would not be  taken\r\n\r\nby   foreign   workers  because  Singaporeans   are   not\r\n\r\navailable.   This  will  be the statutory  board's  modus\r\n\r\noperandi.   This will be how we will approach  the  task.\r\n\r\nThe statutory board will collaborate closely with the EDB\r\n\r\nand  all  industries  to ensure that training  programmes\r\n\r\nwill  meet the industries' needs, including the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  investments  coming  into  Singapore.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we identify the current skill  gaps  and\r\n\r\nfuture  skill  needs of the industries, so that  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes   are  industry-relevant.  Besides   providing\r\n\r\nappropriate   pre-employment  training   in   our   ITEs,\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and  universities,  we  should  also   have\r\n\r\ncontinuing  education and training for workers  to  equip\r\n\r\nthem  with job specific skills for the new jobs that  are\r\n\r\nbeing created.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address Mr Ong Ah Heng's concern about training\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  recognised by employers, we  have  already\r\n\r\nestablished the National Skills Recognition System, which\r\n\r\nprovides   for   portable   skill   certification.    The\r\n\r\nContinuing  Education and Training statutory  board  will\r\n\r\ncertainly promote skills certification and recognition to\r\n\r\nenhance  workers'  portability and also employability  of\r\n\r\nour workers who have undergone such training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng suggested that we should make sure that\r\n\r\ntrained  workers  are given jobs.  She suggested  getting\r\n\r\nemployers  to guarantee to employ the workers after  they\r\n\r\nhave  gone for training.  I understand the disappointment\r\n\r\nsuffered by a diligent worker who had invested much  time\r\n\r\nand  effort to upgrade himself but, at the end, could not\r\n\r\nget  a  job.   It is very disappointing.  No doubt,  this\r\n\r\nhas   happened,  especially  when  our  job   market   is\r\n\r\nshrinking.  I agree with her, and that is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhy  we have already started to introduce Place-and-Train\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   In  other words, the unemployed  is  placed\r\n\r\nwith  a company and after the company signs him on as  an\r\n\r\nemployee,  that is when we send him for training.   After\r\n\r\nthe  training, he goes back to the job.  Examples are the\r\n\r\nAerospace  Reskilling  for  Operations  Programme,   Call\r\n\r\nCentre  Programme, Hospitality Programme  -   hospitality\r\n\r\nin  our  hotel industry  -  and, the recently  announced,\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Professional Programme.  All  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes are place-and-train programmes.  This requires\r\n\r\nparticipating  employers to sign up  the  worker   before\r\n\r\nthey are sent for training.  My Ministry pays for most of\r\n\r\nthe cost of training and also provides full-time trainees\r\n\r\nwith allowances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with the best of intentions, we still\r\n\r\nencounter   disappointments.   For   instance,   in   the\r\n\r\nHospitality Programme in the hotel sector, in  one  case,\r\n\r\n62  out of the 81 who were offered jobs accepted.  Out of\r\n\r\nthose  who  accepted, a full 40% left their  jobs  within\r\n\r\nthree months after training.  They cited unwillingness to\r\n\r\nwork  shifts, dislike for working on public holidays  and\r\n\r\neven  dislike  for the place of work.  We have  spent  so\r\n\r\nmuch  money  to train them, paid for the training  course\r\n\r\nand, in some cases, even gave them allowances.  So, maybe\r\n\r\nI   should  take  Ms  Irene  Ng's  suggestion  seriously.\r\n\r\nMembers may remember that on Saturday, she suggested  the\r\n\r\n\"money   back  guarantee\".   Maybe  I  should  take   her\r\n\r\nseriously.  In other words, those who have been  trained,\r\n\r\nplaced in a job, and did not stay on the job will have to\r\n\r\npay back.  I do not know if she will support that idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Ong Ah Heng spoke of\r\n\r\nthe   need  for  enhancing  adult  training  methods  and\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  This is indeed a very important  area.   The\r\n\r\nstatutory  board will certainly strengthen our continuing\r\n\r\neducation  and  training  system  based  on  professional\r\n\r\ndesign  of  adult  curriculum  and  also  adult  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods.   It  is not quite the same as getting  a  14-16\r\n\r\nyear olds into our ITE and train them in trade skills  or\r\n\r\ninto our polytechnic and train them in a discipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter  they have worked for 10-15 years and they have  to\r\n\r\ncome back to the classroom, the whole approach is totally\r\n\r\ndifferent.   The CET statutory board will be  looking  at\r\n\r\nhow   to  improve  the  methodology  of  providing  adult\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked, in this connection, what\r\n\r\nhappened to the idea of a Centre for Adult Learning which\r\n\r\nwas  suggested in the ERC Report. We have considered this\r\n\r\nidea  and concluded that, for the time being, we  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  to set up a specific institution for research  into\r\n\r\nmethods of training adults.  The CET statutory board will\r\n\r\ndevelop  in-house expertise in this area by working  with\r\n\r\nresearchers  in our universities, polytechnics  and  also\r\n\r\ninternational experts in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng stressed the importance of regulating\r\n\r\nthe  quality of the CET industry.  I believe Dr Amy  Khor\r\n\r\nalso  touched  on  this.   I  agree  totally.  Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is investing large sums of public   money  in\r\n\r\ntraining, we will establish training standards and assess\r\n\r\nmore critically and more rigorously the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  national CET programme.  Private training  providers\r\n\r\nthat participate in our CET effort and receive Government\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for their programmes will also be  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe same rigorous standard of assessment.\r\n\r\n.     Mdm  Ho  Geok Choo asked how will the CET statutory\r\n\r\nboard   relate   to  SPRING  Singapore.   Human   capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes under SPRING  and  several  other\r\n\r\neconomic  agencies  -  I mentioned some earlier on,  EDB,\r\n\r\nIDA   -   will complement the effort of the CET statutory\r\n\r\nboard.  Of course, we will not want to duplicate or waste\r\n\r\nresources.  We will improve coordination and cooperation.\r\n\r\nShe  also asked whether the statutory board will encroach\r\n\r\non  the  private  sector's training providers'  role  and\r\n\r\ncompete  for  business opportunities or, as Dr  Amy  Khor\r\n\r\nmentioned, it becomes a behemoth swallowing up the  small\r\n\r\nprivate sector training providers.  The answer is no.  We\r\n\r\nexpect  private sector continuing education and  training\r\n\r\nproviders  to  continue  complementing  training  to   be\r\n\r\nprovided by industry-led entities, like industry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngroups,   and   also   the  public   sector   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  We will, in fact, work harder to encourage\r\n\r\nmore  private  sector participation and facilitate  their\r\n\r\nentry into the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the statutory board does\r\n\r\nnot  intend  to  take  on the role  of  a  sole  training\r\n\r\nprovider  in  Singapore.  We will work with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  providers.  We want to encourage  a  vibrant  and\r\n\r\ndynamic  training industry to grow. Where  the  statutory\r\n\r\nboard will undertake training, this will be very specific\r\n\r\ninstances under very special circumstances where it needs\r\n\r\nto  be involved.  One that comes to mind could perhaps be\r\n\r\nthe  training of the trainer type of programme, where the\r\n\r\nboard may, in order to ensure quality control, want to be\r\n\r\ninvolved in the training of the trainers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tackling unemployment, several Members have\r\n\r\nspoken on this.  I like to add that a statutory board  is\r\n\r\nnot  on  its own going to be the magic bullet  that  will\r\n\r\nsolve  all our employment problems.  If we have a  highly\r\n\r\nskilled,  highly productive, disciplined and  hardworking\r\n\r\nworkforce,  more investors will come to Singapore.   Yes,\r\n\r\nour  wages may be a little higher or may be a lot higher,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, compared to places like China  and  India.\r\n\r\nBut we offer value for money.  And the investors who come\r\n\r\nhere  make  more  money  by locating  their  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Hence,  Mr Jean-Claude Marquet,  ST  Micro's\r\n\r\nCorporate   Vice-President  and   Chief   Executive   for\r\n\r\nAsiaPacific  said  \"We are satisfied  with  the  way  the\r\n\r\nSingapore team is making use of the investment and see no\r\n\r\nreason to relocate\".  Mr Hiroshi Kawai, Managing Director\r\n\r\nof Matsushita Refrigeration Industry, said \"It is cheaper\r\n\r\nfor  us  to produce here than in China, at least for  the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years\". So, it is not a simple chicken-or-egg\r\n\r\nconundrum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, a skilled workforce comes first. With a\r\n\r\nskilled  workforce and a good supporting  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nthe EDB will have greater success bringing investors here\r\n\r\nand  more jobs will be created for Singaporeans.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust also heed what Mr Hiroshi, Managing Director of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMatsushita Refrigeration Industry, said.  He had a caveat\r\n\r\nwhen  he said, \"at least for the next five years\".    So,\r\n\r\nwe must make good use of the time for us to resharpen our\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge  and restructure the economy,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  time comes, we will be in a new  and  stronger\r\n\r\nposition.  We will not be left stranded high and low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Singaporeans must make the effort. The\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  will help, but it takes  two  hands  to\r\n\r\nclap.   Through the statutory board, the Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide opportunities for skill upgrading, but our people\r\n\r\nmust  be  willing to learn and take jobs  at  competitive\r\n\r\nwages.   It remains the personal responsibility  of  each\r\n\r\njob  seeker  to  seek  out a job and  to  keep  the  job.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we  will  not be able to overcome  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah suggested on Saturday that it is time to\r\n\r\ntighten the foreign worker quota.  She thinks that if  we\r\n\r\nsend   the  foreign  workers  back,  all  our  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will immediately have a job.  She  may  have\r\n\r\nseen   the   numbers,  and  sometimes  numbers   can   be\r\n\r\nmisleading.  So, they say there are statistics and  there\r\n\r\nare  statistics.   We  have  more  than  200,000  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in the key manufacturing and services  industry.\r\n\r\nI  will  discount the domestic workers and those  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  workforce   Let  us  assume  we  send  back\r\n\r\n100,000  of them.  Then, obviously, the 89,900 unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at the end of December 2002 should  have  no\r\n\r\nproblem  getting  jobs.  Right?  If  only  it  were  that\r\n\r\nsimple,  I would have fewer white hairs on my head!   Not\r\n\r\nonly  are we lacking jobs for Singaporeans today, we also\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  serious  mismatch  in  skills,  wages  and\r\n\r\nexpectations.   If we tighten access to foreign  workers,\r\n\r\ncan  we  be  sure that the 89,900 unemployed Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  go  out there and take on the jobs that  are  being\r\n\r\ndone by all these foreign workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members a personal example. I used to\r\n\r\ngo to a hairdresser long before I became an MP.  When she\r\n\r\nfirst started out her business, I was one of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearly  customers and saw the business grow.  She used  to\r\n\r\ncut  my  hair  very  efficiently, 20-25  minutes  at  the\r\n\r\nutmost, minimal waiting, very well done.  It went on  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  10 years.  Even when I became an MP,  I  went\r\n\r\nback to her.  It was still 20-25 minutes.  Then, in 1991,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister appointed me Minister for Labour.   I\r\n\r\nwent  back  to her for a haircut.  It went on  for  35-40\r\n\r\nminutes.  It was not just for a hair cut.  I kept getting\r\n\r\near bashing besides having my hair trimmed.  Her business\r\n\r\nhad  grown.   She  needed  more workers.   She  recruited\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  They worked for a week and they went  away\r\n\r\n-   high  turnover.  They asked for higher  pay  all  the\r\n\r\ntime.  She said, \"Can I have more foreign workers?  Can I\r\n\r\nhave  work  permits?  You are the Minister  for  Labour\",\r\n\r\nseated  there  in  the chair.  And she snipped,  snipped,\r\n\r\nsnipped.  Then one day, it was more than a year  after  I\r\n\r\nbecame  Labour Minister, the same thing happened.   Snip,\r\n\r\nsnip,  snip.  I do not think it was her fault.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  was  intentional.  She was perhaps  getting  a\r\n\r\nlittle  excited,  arguing for more work permits.   \"Chk\",\r\n\r\nshe  snipped  my  ear.  I told myself, \"This  is  getting\r\n\r\ndangerous.\"  I stopped going to the hairdresser.  My wife\r\n\r\ndoes the job for me and I have to thank her for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying is that not only are we lacking\r\n\r\njobs  for locals, we have this mismatch.  We cannot  just\r\n\r\nassume   that  if  we  fire  all  the  foreign   workers,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will take on all the jobs.  If we  send  all\r\n\r\nthe  foreign workers who are in the hairdressing industry\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, many hairdressing salons may have to close\r\n\r\ndown.   All  our  people will have bigger  problems  with\r\n\r\ntheir  hair grooming, especially our ladies.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter not to work on that assumption.\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members a more serious example. If we\r\n\r\ntighten  the  foreign worker quota, can  we  assume  that\r\n\r\nlocals   will  take  on  the  job?   Last  week,  Members\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the debate on the Budget Statement  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  famous Singapore brands, Tee Yih Jia, famous for its\r\n\r\npopiah-skin and roti-prata.  Do you know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat, today, they cannot run their factory 24/7; in other\r\n\r\nwords, 24 hours, 7 days a week.  Why?  Is it because they\r\n\r\ndo  not  have enough orders or business to run  it  24/7?\r\n\r\nNo.   They  have  good orders; they have  good  business.\r\n\r\nBusiness is booming.  But they cannot run it 24/7 because\r\n\r\nthey  lack  workers.  Instead of running  the  production\r\n\r\nplant  into  the night, they have to shut  down  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lines  and  machineries because Singapore  workers\r\n\r\nwant  to  go  home  and will not work  the  late  shifts.\r\n\r\nWithout   foreign  workers,  there  will  be  even   more\r\n\r\ndifficult  problems.  They may even  have  to  shift  out\r\n\r\ncompletely  from  Singapore, if they  do  not  have  some\r\n\r\nforeign  workers to help them to run the late shifts  and\r\n\r\nto moderate their wage costs downwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they shift out, who lose? More Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nlose,  not just the foreign workers.  And not only  those\r\n\r\nwho  work  for  Tee  Yih  Jia  but  also  all  the  other\r\n\r\nsupporting   industries,  service   providers,   material\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  the ones who send the spices,  the  oil,  the\r\n\r\nflour that they need to make their popiah-skins and roti-pratas,  the  transport companies that  carry  all  these\r\n\r\nthings  around, the equipment maintenance companies  that\r\n\r\ncome  and fix up all the machineries in the factory,  and\r\n\r\neven  PSA  Corp,  because of the  dozens  and  dozens  of\r\n\r\ncontainer  loads  of their products that  they  ship  out\r\n\r\nevery  month.  All these will lose business.   And  there\r\n\r\nare,   in  fact,  many  other  companies  facing  similar\r\n\r\nproblems.  So, let us not believe that the problem can be\r\n\r\nsolved  by just telling the foreign workers to  go  home,\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans will take on the jobs.  We will not just\r\n\r\nlose  the  foreign workers; we may well lose the  company\r\n\r\nand   the   remaining  jobs  that  are  being   held   by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    In  administering  the  foreign   worker\r\n\r\npolicy,  we  have  to  maintain a  very,  very  judicious\r\n\r\nbalance  between  Singaporeans, foreign workers  and  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the employers.  My Minister of State will  have\r\n\r\nmore to say on this subject later on in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must develop an enterprising attitude and a\r\n\r\ndetermination to learn new skills.  We must adapt quickly\r\n\r\nto the changes that are taking place around\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus.    Mdm  Halimah  and  Mrs  Yu-Foo  asked  about   the\r\n\r\nemployment prospects and where are the growth areas.   At\r\n\r\nthe   end  of  December  2002,  72%  of  those  who  were\r\n\r\nretrenched  in the first three quarters were already  re-employed.   That  is  an  improvement;  some  good  news.\r\n\r\nBecause, last year, it was, I think, around 65%.  It  has\r\n\r\ngone up to 72% this year.  We also have about 12,900  job\r\n\r\nvacancies with the service sector accounting for  59%  of\r\n\r\nthe  vacancies.   These came mostly  from  transport  and\r\n\r\ncommunications, wholesale and retail trade, business  and\r\n\r\nreal estate services and community and personal services.\r\n\r\nManufacturing  contributed a smaller proportion,  34%  of\r\n\r\nthe   vacancies  mainly  from  transport  equipment   and\r\n\r\nelectronic    products.    Vacancies   for   professional\r\n\r\nmanagers,  executives and technicians  were  30%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  vacancies; for production operators and labourers,\r\n\r\n45%;  and  another  26% for clerical, sales  and  service\r\n\r\nworkers.  But, in view of the uncertainties gripping  the\r\n\r\nglobal economy, we should prepare for some worsening  and\r\n\r\ndeterioration of the labour market.  This  year  may  not\r\n\r\nsee  sharp  recovery  in  jobs  and  improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these difficult times, workers must be\r\n\r\neven  more  determined to compete  and  fight  for  jobs,\r\n\r\nespecially older workers.  Mr Heng Chee How urges MOM  to\r\n\r\nstart  the  Continuing Education and  Training  statutory\r\n\r\nboard as soon as possible.  We will try our best to speed\r\n\r\nup  the process, but we think six to nine months is  what\r\n\r\nit  will take to get an organisation of this scale up and\r\n\r\nrunning.  But I should clarify that while we are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  setting up a statutory  board,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nsitting around doing nothing.  All our programmes are on-going,  and  we  will  continue to add  to  the  existing\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  build  up  new capabilities  within  MOM\r\n\r\ninstead,  so that as and when the statutory board  is  up\r\n\r\nand  running, these programmes can be passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\nstatutory board.  It will be a seamless transition.  As I\r\n\r\nhave  said, the programmes that are already on-going will\r\n\r\ncontinue.  We do not need to wait for the official launch\r\n\r\nof the statutory board to initiate new programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo suggested working with the community\r\n\r\norganisations.   I  fully agree.  My  Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nworking  very  fruitfully with the Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  and  self-help  groups and  other  professional\r\n\r\ngroups, like SHRI through SPEC, to bring skills upgrading\r\n\r\nand  job  assistance  closer to the  people.   This  will\r\n\r\nremain  our  strategy.  The statutory board will  explore\r\n\r\nnew   avenues  for  cooperation  with  all  our  existing\r\n\r\npartners and interested parties.  She also suggested that\r\n\r\nwe  should  pay more attention to career counselling.   I\r\n\r\nagree  too, and we will explore ways of providing  career\r\n\r\ncounselling especially to the lower educated who may  not\r\n\r\nbe able to get the job and training information that they\r\n\r\nneed.   And I think this is very relevant to the  remarks\r\n\r\nmade  by  Prof.  Ngiam earlier about the  plight  of  the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers.  Some career counselling,  some  more\r\n\r\nconcerted hand-holding to get them through, help them  to\r\n\r\nnavigate  the  intricacies of job  change  and  also  the\r\n\r\nintricacies of the changing job market, would  be  useful\r\n\r\nand helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong pointed out that despite the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  effort to promote lifelong learning,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  queue  or  mad rush for our training  programmes,\r\n\r\nunlike  when  McDonald's was selling  Hello-Kitty  dolls.\r\n\r\nYes,  he  is  right,  and this is a disappointment.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the People for Jobs Traineeship  Programme\r\n\r\nfor older workers, we have, till today, already more than\r\n\r\na  year from its launch, about 9,000 older workers signed\r\n\r\nup  for  this  programme.  We had originally targeted  to\r\n\r\nhelp 20,000 workers when the programme was launched.  But\r\n\r\nup  to now, only about 9,000 workers have signed up.  And\r\n\r\nthis programme is a very generous programme.  It provides\r\n\r\njobs  with on-the-job training and up to 50% wage support\r\n\r\nfor  the  employers.  Yes, the CET statutory  board  will\r\n\r\nhave  to work harder to motivate workers to go for skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked how we could help the\r\n\r\n\"untrainable\"  workers.  I do not think  we  should  call\r\n\r\npeople \"untrainable\".  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisagree with that approach.  That would not help  us  to\r\n\r\naddress Mr Seng's concern of getting more people to  join\r\n\r\nthe  queue.   We want to create a buzz for  CET,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot  go around saying, \"You are untrainable.  You  are\r\n\r\nout  of  the action.\"  No.  I would take a more  positive\r\n\r\napproach  and  try to look for appropriate training  even\r\n\r\nfor  the lowest educated and lowest skilled workers.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as they are willing to make the effort, as long  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  willing  to go and try, as long  as  they  are\r\n\r\nrealistic in their job expectations, we should be able to\r\n\r\nhelp   them.   For  instance,  the  Centre  for  Cleaning\r\n\r\nTechnology - I think it was in the newspapers last week - started    with    MOM's   financial    assistance    and\r\n\r\nencouragement.   It  has proved  to  be  very  useful  in\r\n\r\ntraining many older and lower skilled workers for gainful\r\n\r\nemployment  in the growing commercial cleaning  industry.\r\n\r\nMany  of their trainees went in without much expectation.\r\n\r\nBut  when  they  left,  they were  snapped  up  by  these\r\n\r\ncleaning companies.  And because of their training,  many\r\n\r\nhave  also  progressed  beyond just  trainees  to  become\r\n\r\nsupervisors,  earning much higher than they had  expected\r\n\r\nin the first instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, admittedly, all of us involved in job placement\r\n\r\n- whether it is MOM, NTUC, Community Development Councils\r\n\r\nwith  their  Distributed Career Link network -  have  had\r\n\r\nnumerous  disheartening encounters with workers who  turn\r\n\r\ndown  job  offers  or refuse to go for skills  upgrading.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, we hear stories of workers in Vietnam\r\n\r\nand China enthusiastically learning new skills to get  on\r\n\r\nin  life.   They  sign up for night or  weekend  classes.\r\n\r\nThey  rush  from work to their night classes,  be  it  to\r\n\r\nlearn  English  or  some new computer  skills.   That  is\r\n\r\nlifelong learning in action.  That is what we should have\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  -  a  buzz on lifelong learning.   In  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  I was told that doctors move into  nursing.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because they recognise that the worldwide shortage\r\n\r\nof  nurses  opens  up  many new  opportunities  for  them\r\n\r\noverseas   where,   perhaps,  maybe  their   professional\r\n\r\nqualifications may not be recognised.  But, at least,  if\r\n\r\nthey  take  up nursing skills, they can go overseas,  and\r\n\r\nthey get better jobs.  We need to be equally flexible and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadaptable.  As the labour market changes, we have  to  be\r\n\r\nflexible and adaptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that it is not an answer to\r\n\r\ntell  people  to be prepared to take on a job,  any  job,\r\n\r\neven  if  it  is at a lower pay, to solve our  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment problem.  But if there is scarcity of  jobs,\r\n\r\na  realistic solution must be to take what is  available,\r\n\r\nmake  the best out of it, until better times come around.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  not all Singaporeans are totally  apathetic\r\n\r\nto  retraining or skills upgrading.  We do have some fine\r\n\r\nexamples.  Streats, on 17th January 2003, reported a  Mrs\r\n\r\nKaren  Wong who lost her job as a HR executive at  an  IT\r\n\r\nconsulting  company.  She recognised  that  she  was  not\r\n\r\nlikely to find a job in the same field and enrolled in  a\r\n\r\nchildcare  training course under the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme.  Today, she is happily teaching children at  a\r\n\r\nPAP Community Foundation kindergarten.  Likewise, Mr Chen\r\n\r\nGuo  Hua,  who  was  retrenched from  his  salesman  job,\r\n\r\ndecided   to   sign   on   for  MOM's  Place-Train-Adjust\r\n\r\nprogramme,  one of those programmes where we assign  them\r\n\r\nto  an employer first.  The 52-year old Mr Chen completed\r\n\r\nhis training and is now a commis cook in Ritz-Carlton and\r\n\r\nenjoying  his  job.  So, I thank the media for  featuring\r\n\r\nsuch stories of enterprising, adaptable Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  learning  new skills and trying their  hand  at  new\r\n\r\nventures  or  new jobs.  I am sure there are  many,  many\r\n\r\nmore such examples out there waiting to be highlighted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must reiterate that it takes two hands to\r\n\r\nclap.  I agree with Mdm Halimah that employers also  have\r\n\r\nto  play  their part.  I therefore call on  employers  to\r\n\r\nchange  their  mindset.   Nominated Member,  Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee, gave the example in last week's Budget debate of how\r\n\r\nKK  Women's  and  Children's Hospital was  successful  in\r\n\r\nhiring   older  workers.   I  commend  Dr  Lee  for   her\r\n\r\nwillingness to give older workers a chance and urge other\r\n\r\nemployers  to follow her lead.  In my Ministry's  efforts\r\n\r\nto  place  older  workers, we have  found  that  many  HR\r\n\r\nmanagers  in  various companies are not receptive.   Some\r\n\r\nhave  become used to hiring foreign workers in  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen we had a tight\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlabour  market.  They refuse to consider new options  and\r\n\r\njust  want  to  carry on doing things the  way  they  are\r\n\r\ncomfortable with - just hire foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah was concerned that employers will lay\r\n\r\noff  workers  hired under the People for Jobs Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme after the wage support period, which can go  up\r\n\r\nto  nine  months,  has ended.  Under this  programme,  we\r\n\r\nprovide very generous wage support for employers to  take\r\n\r\nin older workers.  The wage support can amount to $12,000\r\n\r\nor more.  Participating employers should not just lay off\r\n\r\nworkers  at  the  end of the wage support  period.   They\r\n\r\nshould  continue to employ these trained workers and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  help them to continue to upgrade their skills,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can make bigger contribution to the  company.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, these companies or employers will continue  to\r\n\r\nlay  off workers after training and they will not be able\r\n\r\nto participate in the programme and derive the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  wage subsidy that Government is giving.  So all  our\r\n\r\ncompanies must also adjust their mindsets, starting  with\r\n\r\nthe Chief Executive Officers.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, to round up all the remarks made\r\n\r\nby  the  Members and my response, we are facing difficult\r\n\r\ntimes but there is no need to be despondent.  There  will\r\n\r\nbe  an economic rebound.  We are not sure when this  will\r\n\r\nbe.  If the US economy picks up, if a war between the  US\r\n\r\nand Iraq erupts,  when and how will it end.  If there  is\r\n\r\na  war,  what  will be the impact on the  price  of  oil.\r\n\r\nThere  are so many \"ifs\" and all of these \"ifs\" are  well\r\n\r\nbeyond  our influence.  But what we can do, and must  do,\r\n\r\nis  to make preparations for the rebound.  As Mr Yeo Guat\r\n\r\nKwang  pointed  out  right  at  the  beginning  of   this\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  take  advantage  of  this  slack  period  to\r\n\r\nprepare  our  workers for the future.   So  we  can  make\r\n\r\npreparations for the rebound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the resources to revamp the economy. The\r\n\r\nERC  Report has pointed out what we can do to advance our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  But we have more than just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources to revamp the economy - we have the people with\r\n\r\nthe  gumption  to face challenges directly and  make  the\r\n\r\nchanges  that  are necessary for survival  and  continued\r\n\r\nprosperity.   In  this  way,  when  the  global   economy\r\n\r\nrebounds, we will be in a good position to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  new  opportunities.   Let  us,  therefore,  work\r\n\r\ntogether  and  turn  today's  adversity  into  tomorrow's\r\n\r\nadvantage.   Our parents had laboured to build  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  scratch  since 1965 with much less  resources  than\r\n\r\nwhat we have today.  We owe it to them to make the effort\r\n\r\nto   transform   our  skills  and  capabilities   through\r\n\r\nContinuing Education and Training to provide the  impetus\r\n\r\nfor future economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask whether or not the Minister will agree\r\n\r\nthat the foreign workers quota was set at a time when the\r\n\r\neconomic growth was good, structural unemployment was not\r\n\r\nan  issue  and the long-term unemployment rate  was  much\r\n\r\nlower.   Now, with the changed environment, higher  long-term  unemployment, slower economic growth and structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  whether  or not  the  quota  ought  to  be\r\n\r\nrevisited.   I have never asked for the large  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers to be sent back because it is completely\r\n\r\nunrealistic.   But  I  did  ask  for  the  quota  to   be\r\n\r\nrevisited, the issue to be relooked, and not to send back\r\n\r\nthe  hundreds  of thousands of foreign workers,  just  to\r\n\r\nprovide jobs for 90,000, because that is not possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It was a rather lengthy\r\n\r\nclarification, Mdm Halimah.  Would you like to reply,  Dr\r\n\r\nLee?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I am grateful to Mdm Halimah\r\n\r\nfor  her clarification that she does not see the need  to\r\n\r\nsend  large numbers of foreign workers back deliberately.\r\n\r\nThe   foreign   workers  quota  operates   in   different\r\n\r\nindustries.  There are different quota levels.   We  have\r\n\r\nfound  it  useful to balance the needs of  employers  and\r\n\r\ncreating  employment for local workers using  this  quota\r\n\r\nmechanism.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the  construction industry,  we  are  very\r\n\r\nliberal  -  1 local to 5 foreign workers.  We are  slowly\r\n\r\nadjusting that.  We are bringing that down now because of\r\n\r\nthe   over-dependency   and  low  productivity   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  In the marine sector, we  have  a\r\n\r\nquota   of   1:3.   And  despite  this  adverse  economic\r\n\r\nsituation,  the  marine industry is  one  of  our  bright\r\n\r\nspots.   They have lots of vacancies.  And if we were  to\r\n\r\nlower the quota for the marine industry today, we will be\r\n\r\ncausing the companies enormous difficulties, not just  in\r\n\r\ncompeting  for  jobs, they actually  have  obtained  jobs\r\n\r\nalready,  but they need the workers to do the  work.   So\r\n\r\nsince  Singaporeans are still reluctant to take on  these\r\n\r\nvacancies  in  the  marine sector, I think  it  would  be\r\n\r\nfoolhardly  for  us  to revise the quota  in  the  marine\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing service industry, as I have\r\n\r\nexplained   just   now,   many   companies   still   face\r\n\r\ndifficulties operating within the present quota.  But  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  review all  of  these  mechanisms  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the entry of foreign workers.  And the  Minster\r\n\r\nof  State will reply on this subject.  Could you  refresh\r\n\r\nmy memory on the last point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> I asked whether there is a need\r\n\r\nto   revisit   the   quota   because   of   the   changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  That is all.  I am not suggesting that we\r\n\r\nsend back the foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Whether we have to revisit the\r\n\r\nquestion on quota, I have to say that we do that all  the\r\n\r\ntime.  We review the quota.  We look at the needs of  the\r\n\r\nindustry  all the time, and we will do what is necessary.\r\n\r\nBut  I  just  want to point out that we must  maintain  a\r\n\r\njudicious balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members not to\r\n\r\nask  questions or make lengthy speeches in the  guise  of\r\n\r\nclarifications.   Mr Inderjit Singh is not  present.   Dr\r\n\r\nWang Kai Yuen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I have been\r\n\r\nwondering why Singaporeans are so despondent, to use  the\r\n\r\nword of the Minister, about the economy when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  unemployment rate was 4.2% in December 2002,  having\r\n\r\ndropped from a high of 4.6% in September 2002.  This  has\r\n\r\ntranslated  to  about over 80,000 unemployed  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  bearing in mind that even in boom  time,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate was about 2%.  So based on unemployment\r\n\r\nfigures  alone, our economy should have been much  better\r\n\r\noff than Hong Kong with its unemployment rate of 7%.  But\r\n\r\nin  terms of the people's psyche, I believe our people do\r\n\r\nnot seem perkier than those of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is whether the statistics tell the\r\n\r\nfull  story.  I browsed through the published figures  of\r\n\r\nMOM,  paying particular attention to the table of  change\r\n\r\nin  employment  in the Government press release  on  31st\r\n\r\nDecember 2002.  Change in employment, Sir, refers to  the\r\n\r\nchange  in the number of jobs in our economy compared  to\r\n\r\nthe   previous  period.   This  figure  shows  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy has had five consecutive  quarters  of\r\n\r\nnet  job  losses from third quarter 2001 to third quarter\r\n\r\n2002,  totalling 63,000.  However, I was unable to  match\r\n\r\nthis change in employment figure with the employment rate\r\n\r\nof the corresponding period.  If we were to add 63,000 to\r\n\r\nthe  number of workers already unemployed at the  end  of\r\n\r\nsecond  quarter 2001, which was 60,000,  or  3%,  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  workforce of close to 2 million, the total  number\r\n\r\nof  unemployed workers should be around 123,000 by  third\r\n\r\nquarter  2002.  But we have a lower number.  So it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  some  40,000 workers who have lost their jobs  have\r\n\r\nsimply disappeared from our radar screen.  I really could\r\n\r\nnot  reconcile these numbers and would like the  Minister\r\n\r\nto elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the reason could be that those are foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   If,  indeed,  this  is  the  case,  then   the\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate figure is not giving a  true  picture.\r\n\r\nSo  we  might be lured into a false sense of  comfort  if\r\n\r\npolicy makers were to just look at the unemployment  rate\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the unemployed workers, I am\r\n\r\nparticularly  concerned about those with little  hope  of\r\n\r\nfinding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na job after being unemployed for nine months or more.  To\r\n\r\nhelp  these  people  back to the job  market,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider changing the CPF contribution rate  for\r\n\r\nthese  structurally unemployed people?  For those  facing\r\n\r\nlong-term unemployment, it is indeed futile for  them  to\r\n\r\nplan  for retirement when they cannot even take  care  of\r\n\r\ntheir current needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you finish with your question,\r\n\r\nDr Wang?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to find out whether\r\n\r\nfor  those who are unemployed for one year or more, would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  consider phasing in the  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate  starting  from zero to the full  contribution  rate\r\n\r\nover, let us say, nine months or so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, during the good\r\n\r\nyears in 1995 and 1996, what we heard was the problem  of\r\n\r\nworkers  job hopping and employers unable to  get  enough\r\n\r\nworkers.   Since the financial crisis in 1997, the  table\r\n\r\nhas  turned  against the workers.  Now is the  employers'\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general elections, the PAP had promised\r\n\r\nto  give top priority to providing jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe  trade unions even showed its support to the  PAP  by\r\n\r\ntaking  UOB  to task when it announced its  intention  to\r\n\r\nretrench its workers due to merger and restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have passed, but unemployment remains a\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  is  a clear fact that the  PAP  Government\r\n\r\ncould   not   create   enough  jobs   for   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIronically, Government controlled entities, like GLCs and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, are the ones now starting a new  round\r\n\r\nof  retrenchments.  This time - I suppose it  is  because\r\n\r\nthis  is  not an election year - Chartered Semiconductor,\r\n\r\nPSA and HDB had already done their bit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to add salt to injury, the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nis  still putting out Contact Singapore advertisements on\r\n\r\nCNBC   to  attract  foreign  talents  to  find  jobs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If the PAP Government could not create enough\r\n\r\njobs for its own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncitizens,  how could it offer Singapore jobs  to  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents?   I  would like to ask the PAP  Government  what\r\n\r\ntypes of jobs it could offer to foreigners that our local\r\n\r\ntalents could not do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, you are asking the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment, or you are asking Dr Lee?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am asking Dr Lee. The last\r\n\r\ncheck  on  Contact Singapore website showed that  SIA  is\r\n\r\nputting   up   advertisements  for   the   positions   of\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officer and Business Development  Manager.\r\n\r\nThe  question  to the Minister is:  do our  citizens  not\r\n\r\nhave  the talents to take up jobs, such as Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficer and Business Development Manager?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it does not make sense at all to keep\r\n\r\nrecruiting  the so-called foreign talents for  jobs  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can do, especially in this period  of  high\r\n\r\nunemployment.   We have some Singapore graduates  selling\r\n\r\nnoodles,  taking up part time jobs and giving tuition  to\r\n\r\nmake  ends meet.  But our Government is offering jobs  to\r\n\r\nforeign talents.  I want to remind the Government that it\r\n\r\nis  Singaporeans  who  have voted them  into  power,  not\r\n\r\nforeigners, talented or not.  I think it is only fair and\r\n\r\nright  that  the Government puts Singaporeans'  interest,\r\n\r\njobs and welfare as its top priority, and not foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just said that, not so long ago,\r\n\r\nEDB  has attracted new investments.  But I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  specifically what is the number and nature of  jobs\r\n\r\nthat the Government, or the investments, have created for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as well as foreigners.  And what  jobs  have\r\n\r\nbeen offered to foreigners that our locals could not do?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi is not speaking.

Such  acts\r\n\r\nwill  only  lead  to the loss of morale  and  confidence.\r\n\r\nThen   half  the  battle  is  lost  in  the  process   of\r\n\r\nrepositioning  Singapore.   Employers  should  not   take\r\n\r\nretrenchment lightly.  Retrenchment should be carried out\r\n\r\nonly  when  it  is absolutely necessary, that  too  after\r\n\r\nexhausting  all  other avenues.  I say this  because  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  unemployment situation is bad and it should  not\r\n\r\nbe further aggravated as far as possible.  The social and\r\n\r\npsychological impact caused by unemployment could lead to\r\n\r\nother negative and sometimes tragic circumstances.  So we\r\n\r\nshould  exercise  care  and,  at  the  same  time,   help\r\n\r\nretrenched workers to find new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during this bleak unemployment situation, the\r\n\r\nhardest hit are the old and the less educated.  These are\r\n\r\nthe  workers  who have contributed immensely  during  our\r\n\r\nformative  years of nation building.  I am glad  to  hear\r\n\r\nthe Minister saying earlier that they are trying to do  a\r\n\r\nlot  to help these workers.  I hope the Ministry will  do\r\n\r\nmore  in helping them get jobs, especially by helping  or\r\n\r\ngiving  a  certain amount of subsidies to  employers  who\r\n\r\nhire   them.    We  could  also  create  some  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities or reserve certain categories of  jobs  for\r\n\r\nsuch workers besides training them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should also encourage more employers to\r\n\r\nuse  the  People  for  Jobs  Traineeship  scheme.   Would\r\n\r\ngreater   incentives  be  introduced  to   enthuse   more\r\n\r\nemployers?   Sir, I do agree that workers should  not  be\r\n\r\nchoosy.   But, at the same time, more should be  done  in\r\n\r\nthe  area of redesigning jobs and multi-tasking, so  that\r\n\r\nlocals  could do jobs, such as cleaning and others mainly\r\n\r\ndone  by foreigners, and earn decent wages.  I am pleased\r\n\r\nwith  MOM's joint efforts with NTUC in helping retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers,  but more needs to be done during this difficult\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to dwell further on placement and\r\n\r\ntraining schemes, as the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower has adequately covered it.  But one\r\n\r\nother  area in training which I need to highlight is  the\r\n\r\ntraining   of   shift   employees.    They   have   great\r\n\r\ndifficulties  attending  training  programmes,  and  this\r\n\r\nneeds to be addressed by CET.  Today, the challenges  are\r\n\r\ndifferent and daunting, and it needs more efforts.  I  do\r\n\r\nagree  with Mdm Halimah Yacob that we should monitor  the\r\n\r\nsituation very carefully.  We are not suggesting that all\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  workers  should be sent  back.   A  lot  of\r\n\r\nconcerns  have  been raised.

Unfortunately, this does not square  with  the\r\n\r\nperception on the ground.  A number of unemployed workers\r\n\r\nhave  indicated  that after many tries,  they  are  still\r\n\r\nunable  to get jobs.  MOM needs to identify the  reasons,\r\n\r\nwhether it is skills mismatch, employers' preference  for\r\n\r\ncertain  age  groups of workers, or other  reasons.   MOM\r\n\r\nshould put in place appropriate measures to resolve  this\r\n\r\nissue of perception.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Magad, you have three cuts.\r\n\r\nYou can take them all together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard during the previous three days and also  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Manpower a moment ago about unemployment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  currently affecting Singaporeans,  there  were\r\n\r\nalso  calls  by  some to slow down the  flow  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  so  that Singaporeans can be given priority  to\r\n\r\nbid for the scarcer jobs available in our job market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, too, am sympathetic to the plight of\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singaporeans, we need  to  be  pragmatic  and\r\n\r\nthink about the needs of employers too.  Notwithstanding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  weak employment market, there are in fact many  good\r\n\r\nhigh  quality jobs available in the job market. But  many\r\n\r\nof these jobs require intense training and application of\r\n\r\nthinking skills on the job.  Regrettably, I dare say that\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans shun such jobs.  They are still hoping\r\n\r\nfor  the high-paying routine-type easy-to-do jobs  coming\r\n\r\non  to their laps.  Unfortunately, such jobs are few  and\r\n\r\nfar between, and many of these are gone forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I led a group of unemployed\r\n\r\nresidents to consider employment in the Wafer Fab Park in\r\n\r\nPasir Ris.  After being explained the nature of the  job,\r\n\r\nonly about 30% said they would consider applying for  the\r\n\r\njobs.  The primary reasons are the requirements to put on\r\n\r\nclean-room  attire and 12-hour shifts.  I  later  learned\r\n\r\nthat,  of  the 40 people or so who attended the briefing,\r\n\r\nless  than  10  actually applied.  I have a  similar  sad\r\n\r\nexperience   in  my  own  organisation  where  clean-room\r\n\r\ntechnicians'  jobs requiring operation  of  sophisticated\r\n\r\nthin-film high vacuum systems and application of thinking\r\n\r\nskills are refused by Singaporeans.  As a result, 70%  of\r\n\r\nmy employees working in this department are Malaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question is: where do we go from here? I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir,  employers do want  to  give  priority  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to fill vacancies.  But, often, they  cannot\r\n\r\nwait for the right candidates to come by.  I ask that MOM\r\n\r\nand our labour movement continue to drum into the ears of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  these jobs have to  and  must  go  to\r\n\r\nforeigners, if they continue to refuse them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What choices do employers have? The multi-billion\r\n\r\ndollar  factories and expensive equipment  needed  to  be\r\n\r\nmanned   to   recover  investments.   Singaporeans   must\r\n\r\ntherefore  understand  that we  have  no  choice  but  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a barrier-free employment system, and that  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  face  competition from foreigners  and  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  who  are  more than willing to grab  such  high-paying  and  stable jobs.  Unless they  wake  up  to  the\r\n\r\nreality  of  the situation, we are going to  continue  to\r\n\r\ngive away such high-quality jobs to foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my next cut, it is an established fact that\r\n\r\nas  an  economy matures, such as what is observed in  the\r\n\r\nUnited   States   and   many   European   countries,    a\r\n\r\ncorresponding   contractual  manpower   supply   industry\r\n\r\ntypically  evolves with it.  Organisations  operating  in\r\n\r\nsuch  economies need to be lean and trim in order  to  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive  on  costs.   A  readily  available  manpower\r\n\r\nsupply   industry  fills  the  gap  whenever  there   are\r\n\r\ntemporary surges in work.  We are inching towards such  a\r\n\r\nstage  as  we restructure and position ourselves  into  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy.  Although there  is  already  a\r\n\r\nskeletal  presence of a contract manpower supply industry\r\n\r\nto supply contract manpower to serve industry needs, most\r\n\r\ncompanies  doing so operate as job matching agencies  and\r\n\r\nearn  commissions  from successful  matches  rather  than\r\n\r\nmaintaining   staff  on  their  payroll   for   immediate\r\n\r\ndeployment  whenever  there is  a  need.   I  see  it  as\r\n\r\nbeneficial  if  we  could formalise  the  presence  of  a\r\n\r\ncontract manpower supply industry to supply manpower  for\r\n\r\nprofessional   assignments  as  well   as   satisfy   the\r\n\r\nrequirements of an evolving service industry,  and  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister to take a hard  look  at  my\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two advantages I see in such an approach.\r\n\r\nFirst  is  the  creation  of  additional  employment,  as\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  such industries will maintain  a  pool  of\r\n\r\nprofessionally trained employees and have them  ready  to\r\n\r\nbe  deployed  for  contractual assignments.   The  second\r\n\r\nadvantage  is  the  enhancement  of  professionalism   of\r\n\r\nindividuals which companies are expected to invest in, in\r\n\r\norder to project a professional image of their respective\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on now to my third cut. I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe  ERC, among others, has also placed emphasis  on  our\r\n\r\ngrowing  services  sector, recognising our  potential  to\r\n\r\nbecome  Asia's leading services hub.  A key consideration\r\n\r\nto  realising  this  vision is to first  ensure  that  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  fully  understand what  service  excellence\r\n\r\nmeans.   While  I  believe Singapore is  quite  ahead  of\r\n\r\nregional countries, such as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThailand,  Malaysia and, to some degree,  Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nTaiwan,  in terms of service excellence ranking, we  pale\r\n\r\nconsiderably when compared to more sophisticated markets,\r\n\r\nsuch as the US, UK and Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To differentiate ourselves from our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries, we need to carve out a strategy to develop the\r\n\r\nability   to   provide  differentiated  or   high-contact\r\n\r\nservice.   Our  domestic enterprises must learn  to  work\r\n\r\naround the disadvantage of limited labour supply and high\r\n\r\nlabour  cost, and turn this into a competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nAs  a  cosmopolitan city, we have many people  with  high\r\n\r\npurchasing  power  who are constantly  looking  for  such\r\n\r\ndifferentiated  services.  I am  confident  that  we  can\r\n\r\nsucceed to position ourselves as a leading services  hub,\r\n\r\nif  we  can master the art of showering service upon  our\r\n\r\ncustomers and make them a satisfied and happy lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond customer satisfaction and customer delight,\r\n\r\nSir,  we should learn to romance the customer.  We should\r\n\r\nride on Romancing Singapore and propagate this message to\r\n\r\nall   local  service  providers.   The  imagery  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Girl immediately comes to mind when one  thinks\r\n\r\nabout  service excellence.  The great service one  enjoys\r\n\r\non  board  a Singapore Airlines flight has not only  made\r\n\r\nthe airline one of the world's leading airlines, but also\r\n\r\nimpressed  upon the world that Singapore has the  ability\r\n\r\nfor service excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIA experience shows that setting and processes\r\n\r\nare  as  important  as the employees of an  organisation.\r\n\r\nThe   secret   is  to  take  the  customers'   experience\r\n\r\nseriously,  create  an  emotional  connection  with   the\r\n\r\ncustomers,  and  ensure  that  the  right  experience  is\r\n\r\ndelivered to the customers.  It is this interaction  that\r\n\r\ncounts,  and this is what companies renowned  in  service\r\n\r\nexcellence have put in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that apart from creating a service\r\n\r\nexcellence movement to instill among Singaporean  service\r\n\r\nproviders the importance of service, we should also  seek\r\n\r\nout effective training models of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies with outstanding service and develop affordable\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  the  service  industry.   In  regard  to\r\n\r\ntraining,  there are a few local organisations,  such  as\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines, the Raffles and Ritz-Carlton  hotels,\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  outstanding service, from which  training\r\n\r\nmodels  could be crafted and initially used as kick-start\r\n\r\ntraining   programmes.   Upon  laying   the   appropriate\r\n\r\nfoundation,  each industry should develop an  academy  to\r\n\r\nraise the professionalism of its workforce, such as  what\r\n\r\nthe  hotel industry has done in Shatec.  With an enhanced\r\n\r\nservice  profile,  workers can  acquire  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nservice skills standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ultimate goal should be the creation of a\r\n\r\nSingapore  brand service that is unique and where  people\r\n\r\nwill  rave  about.  We already have some form of  service\r\n\r\nexcellence, such as the Excellent Service Awards.  We now\r\n\r\nneed to make it more widespread and universal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, much has been said\r\n\r\nabout   the   concern  of  unemployment   and   long-term\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore.  The increasing trend of long-term  unemployment actually stood at 1.4% as of  December\r\n\r\n2002, compared to about 0.3-0.5% in the early half of the\r\n\r\n1990s.  This is very worrying, because mainly those  with\r\n\r\nbelow  secondary education and those 40 years  and  above\r\n\r\nare the most affected group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, employment prospects are not very\r\n\r\ngood.  With 28 jobs for every 100 job seekers, even  when\r\n\r\nwe  fill up all the vacancies, many of them will still be\r\n\r\nout  of  job.  I agree with the Minister that  attracting\r\n\r\nmore  investments is the way to create jobs. But with  28\r\n\r\njobs  for  every 100 job seekers, what are the Ministry's\r\n\r\nspecific   plans  to  boost  the  number  of   jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  Has the Ministry actually considered maybe\r\n\r\npromoting  and  facilitating employment creation  in  the\r\n\r\ninformal and semi-informal sectors of the economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that it is the individual's\r\n\r\nresponsibility to look for a job, retrain himself and try\r\n\r\nto  keep  the job, we must also know that many  of  them,\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretraining, still could not find a job.  So, what are the\r\n\r\nMinistry's specific measures to help this group of people\r\n\r\nwho  are  willing to change but are unable to find  jobs?\r\n\r\nFor  those who still refuse to change their mindset, what\r\n\r\nare the specific measures that the Ministry is taking  to\r\n\r\nhelp to change their mindset so that they will be willing\r\n\r\nto  take  up  different  jobs  and  have  more  realistic\r\n\r\nexpectations, and so on?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking into the longer horizon, I think that\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment would be a problem that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  face.   What steps is the Ministry  taking  to\r\n\r\nprepare ourselves for that challenge?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, as the Minister has explained earlier, many older\r\n\r\nworkers  are finding it hard to retain their jobs.   Many\r\n\r\nare  getting  retrenched  as their  companies  resize  or\r\n\r\nrelocate.   Once  jobless,  they  are  likely  to  remain\r\n\r\njobless  for  a very long time.  Retaining jobs  is  thus\r\n\r\nmore  important than creating new ones.  To retain  jobs,\r\n\r\nwe need to look at the two biggest components of business\r\n\r\ncost:  wage and land costs.  Since this pertains  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower, I will just touch on wage cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have high CPF contributions from employers,\r\n\r\nthe  fight  to  retain  jobs will  be  hard.   While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes the ERC proposal to cut the  employers'\r\n\r\ncontribution  by  4%, it is not going  to  help  much  in\r\n\r\nretaining jobs.  It is also unfair to those aged  workers\r\n\r\nwho are still highly valued by their companies.  Instead,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can  be more flexible  and  stop  micro-managing,  and  free  up the CPF contribution  rates  for\r\n\r\nemployers   and   employees   to   negotiation    between\r\n\r\nthemselves.   If he is a valuable employee,  the  company\r\n\r\nwould  be  more  than  willing  to  offer  him  a  higher\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate.  But if the wage cost  is  still  too\r\n\r\nhigh,  the  employer would have the option  to  negotiate\r\n\r\nwith  the  employee  for  a lower  or  even  no  employer\r\n\r\ncontributions at all.  It is still better to have  a  job\r\n\r\nthan  going jobless for a very long time.  Some employees\r\n\r\nwould  be  more  than willing to forgo  their  employers'\r\n\r\ncontributions,  if  they can retain their  current  jobs.\r\n\r\nSo, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not make it mandatory for them  to  be\r\n\r\nretrenched by forcing a standard contribution rate.   Let\r\n\r\nthe employer and the employee negotiate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, as Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  restructures,  workers with  higher  skills  and\r\n\r\nenterprising  attitudes  would  be  more  able  to   stay\r\n\r\nemployed or to move on to new employment should  they  be\r\n\r\ndisplaced. But the key challenge socially is to help  the\r\n\r\nlower skilled workers, many of whom are older workers  as\r\n\r\nwell,  to earn a living, because there is a segment among\r\n\r\nsuch workers who would not be able to upgrade fast enough\r\n\r\nor  adapt fast enough in tandem with the requirements  of\r\n\r\neconomic  development. So, even  if  we  have  the  lower\r\n\r\nskilled or semi-skilled type jobs coming in with the  new\r\n\r\ninvestments, there is a segment that might find it  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  access  those  kinds  of  jobs.   In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I hope that concerted efforts can be put into\r\n\r\nidentifying  and  highlighting  suitable  job  areas  and\r\n\r\nopportunities and on creating areas of work suitable  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, one good area to look at is in the non-export sector, on the services side, where the areas of\r\n\r\nwork tend to be more labour-intensive. When I say labour-intensive  here,  I  do  not  mean  that  you  have  many\r\n\r\nheadcount  within  the company, but rather  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncontent of work, it is labour-intensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest some areas for\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I consider the life cycle area,  such  as\r\n\r\nthose  relating  to birth, and that would include  infant\r\n\r\ncare  as well as childcare, eldercare, healthcare or even\r\n\r\nservices relating to death.  Those are necessary services\r\n\r\nthat  any  society and every society would need  all  the\r\n\r\ntime and certain areas within that would offer prospects.\r\n\r\nRecurrent everyday needs in the areas, say, retail, food,\r\n\r\nhousing,  transport, again, there might be certain  areas\r\n\r\nwithin  that  that can be designed for  workers  in  this\r\n\r\ncategory  to  take  on;  public  needs,  such  as  public\r\n\r\ncleanliness, hygiene, public health, security.  Then,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  could be areas of status needs, such as home care,\r\n\r\nhousekeeping, errand running. And there would be informal\r\n\r\nsector activities, including home-based work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open up opportunities in these areas to such\r\n\r\nworkers require new and different ways of organising them\r\n\r\nbecause  these workers are individually unlikely to  know\r\n\r\nhow  to organise themselves. Sir, in this regard, I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  more  encouragement can  be  given  to  efforts  to\r\n\r\norganise them for full-time, part-time and contract work,\r\n\r\nand  in  this way, to render them competitive as a  group\r\n\r\nwith, say, foreign labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I fully support the\r\n\r\nManpower   Minister's   emphasis  earlier   on   personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility on the part of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key responsibility must be on the worker to find\r\n\r\njobs,  to  identify the right training and  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary adjustments.  I know the Manpower Minister  has\r\n\r\ntried very hard to help older workers to stay employable,\r\n\r\nbut  no matter how much personal responsibility the older\r\n\r\nworker  takes  in  applying  for  jobs,  those  above  50\r\n\r\ncontinue to find it hard to get a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the latest labour market survey shows, more than\r\n\r\nhalf of the retrenched, aged 50 and above, could not find\r\n\r\nre-employment  within  six months  last  year.   This  is\r\n\r\nreally quite alarming. Even the employed, those who  have\r\n\r\njobs, above 45, are now beginning to feel insecure.  They\r\n\r\nare worried about losing their jobs because they know  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be easy to find another job again.  They  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they are at the mercy of employers and of the harsh\r\n\r\nmarket  which  discriminates against older workers.  They\r\n\r\nhave  to fight the battle of proving that they are  still\r\n\r\nproductive  workers,  capable of giving  many  more  good\r\n\r\nyears of service, and that they are worth their salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to help employers understand that older\r\n\r\nworkers can be a plus in their operations. If I may  cite\r\n\r\nan   example.  One  of  my  grassroots  leaders  runs   a\r\n\r\nrestaurant business , the Village Wok.  One restaurant is\r\n\r\nin Thomson, the other in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGeylang.   In his recruitment advertisements for workers,\r\n\r\nhe  would always state that he prefers workers above  40.\r\n\r\nSo I asked him why.  He cited three reasons and these are\r\n\r\nbased on his own experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they have a good attitude to work. They are\r\n\r\nmore committed to the employer and they will not leave at\r\n\r\nthe whiff of a better opportunity. Second, they have more\r\n\r\nexperience in skills that the employer does not  need  to\r\n\r\nspend  too  much time or money to train them. And  third,\r\n\r\nthey  have more realistic expectations when it  comes  to\r\n\r\nwages.  This is his own experience because he finds  that\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers have gone through a lot in  life,  so\r\n\r\nthey know the value of a secure job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to highlight more of such enlightened\r\n\r\nemployers  who hire older workers, not because  of  good-heartedness or charity, or because there are so many  out\r\n\r\nthere that need to be absorbed for the nation, but it  is\r\n\r\nbecause it makes good business sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government said that the move to lower the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution rate for those in  the  50-55\r\n\r\nage  group  is to enhance their employability.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Manpower Minister to conduct a study  to\r\n\r\nfind  out if this would indeed help older workers  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  employable.   If  not, we might  want  to  consider\r\n\r\nreviewing  it.  If they only just reduce the pay  of  all\r\n\r\nthose  above  50  without any effect on their  employment\r\n\r\nsituation,  as  the  experience of my  grassroots  leader\r\n\r\nhighlights,  the affected older workers will  learn,  can\r\n\r\nlearn   and  must  learn  how  to  adjust  their   salary\r\n\r\nexpectations, without the Government giving a blanket pay\r\n\r\ncut  via  the  CPF for all workers above  50.  This  will\r\n\r\nindeed    hammer   home   the   message    of    personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo, you have got two\r\n\r\ncuts.  Take them together, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, there are two\r\n\r\nissues  that  I  would  like  to  raise  with  regard  to\r\n\r\npreparing for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nself-employment and nurturing entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on preparing for self-employment. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  submit  some suggestions to facilitate  a  more\r\n\r\nready  mindset and to help these unemployed  to  be  more\r\n\r\nself-reliant.   Experience of the  last  two  years  have\r\n\r\nwoken  up several jobless among the PMEs that their  once\r\n\r\ncorporate career life is never to return again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help the unemployed continue to feel a\r\n\r\nsense  of usefulness and purpose?  To be suddenly  thrown\r\n\r\nout  of  work, one can be very disorientated and  feel  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  loss. One way is to enable them an association\r\n\r\nwith  a  surrogate  employer who can then  nurture  their\r\n\r\nconfidence  and equip them with skills and knowledge  and\r\n\r\nconnect them to potential project work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare at this point that I am\r\n\r\nthe  founder  member of SPEC and serves as  the  Honorary\r\n\r\nDeputy Chairman. SPEC was set up two years ago as a self-funding   cooperative  to  provide  a  mutual   self-help\r\n\r\nenvironment  for these people. SPEC has a mindset  change\r\n\r\nand  career counselling module under WSTP and  more  than\r\n\r\n3,000  Singaporeans have benefited from  this  programme.\r\n\r\nBoth  employers and employees, who have gone through this\r\n\r\nmodule,  are better prepared for the parting of ways.   I\r\n\r\nwould encourage employers to tap on the services of  SPEC\r\n\r\nand   these  include:   employment  and  small   business\r\n\r\nadvisory, job and business counselling, writing  business\r\n\r\nplans  and  proposals.   On  a  regular  basis,  it  runs\r\n\r\nseminars,  showcasing  the success stories  of  self-made\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This is to encourage economically inactive\r\n\r\nPMEs to learn from others and take on self-employment and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship in the portfolio economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: will the Government be disposed\r\n\r\ntowards  the  idea of encouraging employers  to  consider\r\n\r\nSPEC membership as a step-down caretaker benefit for  the\r\n\r\nemployees?   MOM can encourage via endorsement statements\r\n\r\nin their publicity materials.  My second\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion  is:   at  the  same time, will  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider  a  tax rebate for such step-down care  benefits\r\n\r\nthat employers take up for their PMEs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is the idea to set up a community of\r\n\r\nlearning and sharing so as to better transfer, manage and\r\n\r\nretain  knowledge.  This is particularly so for  projects\r\n\r\nthat  are  given to foreigners. There have been calls  by\r\n\r\nseveral  MPs  for civil servants to be less  bureaucratic\r\n\r\nand to be more customer-centric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can say that it is all perception issues but\r\n\r\nperception,  we  know, is reality.  I wish  to  highlight\r\n\r\nanother perception which reinforces that anything foreign\r\n\r\nseems  better. Such perception undermines the  experience\r\n\r\nand  expertise of our local Singaporeans.   It  has  been\r\n\r\nobserved  that  often  times, our  Ministries,  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  GLCs award contract for services to  foreign\r\n\r\nservice providers and bring in overseas speakers at hefty\r\n\r\nfees.  This is desirable where locals lack the experience\r\n\r\nand  expertise.  In many instances, foreign entities pull\r\n\r\nout  when  the going gets tough.  Neither  do  we  see  a\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  knowledge or expertise  and  experience  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We   all  know  for  Singapore's   longer\r\n\r\ndevelopment, capabilities, knowledge and experience  must\r\n\r\nbe managed, captured and retained for the KBE.  This is a\r\n\r\nsure   way   to   go   to  nurture  self-employment   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship. We should therefore facilitate the set-up of a community of learning and sharing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, I would like to propose that in the\r\n\r\naward  of  contract  for services, a  Singaporean  entity\r\n\r\nshould  be  included to work with the foreign  entity  as\r\n\r\npartners.   In this way, Singapore will begin to  develop\r\n\r\nspecific icons in the area of knowledge management.  This\r\n\r\nwill  then further spur the entrepreneurial spirit  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On PMEs, Sir, I would like to raise two issues. The\r\n\r\nfirst issue relates to job match for PMEs. The retrenched\r\n\r\nare having a tough time getting back to work.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy picked up a little bit last year but jobs  coming\r\n\r\nback and new jobs created were mainly for blue-collar and\r\n\r\nlower skilled workers.  FTAs concluded will create 20,000\r\n\r\njobs, so EDB said.  But EDB also said that it would  take\r\n\r\nabout three years to materialise for each investment. And\r\n\r\nwhere high job skills are created, they appear to be  too\r\n\r\nhighly skilled for many Singaporeans. For example,  there\r\n\r\nare jobs created in the biomedical sector which require a\r\n\r\nPhD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible industry in which this group may be\r\n\r\nable to find gainful employment is with MOE.  But we know\r\n\r\nthat  even  in polytechnics, contracts for lecturers  are\r\n\r\nnot  renewed.  The truth of the matter, Sir, is that even\r\n\r\nwith new jobs created, it is likely the graduating cohort\r\n\r\nand  the  younger ones who are going to fill up  the  gap\r\n\r\nfirst.   This  is  because, all things being  equal,  the\r\n\r\npotential employer will prefer to employ a younger one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I would like to raise are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can the Minister enlighten the House on the\r\n\r\nextent  of job mismatch among the PMEs, ie, they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  right skills for the jobs available?   Second,\r\n\r\nhow  many  have gone through the job conversion programme\r\n\r\nat  MOE  and  gained a foothold as their teaching  staff?\r\n\r\nAnd  third,  how  can  we ensure  that  given  the  right\r\n\r\nattitudes,  skills and qualification, PMEs above  40  can\r\n\r\ngain equal opportunities for employment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to an endowment fund for\r\n\r\nPMEs.  Last year, I have asked for such a fund.  I called\r\n\r\nit  the  HEED  fund  as  I  was trying  to  persuade  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to heed the need for such a fund.  Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  paid  no heed, again  this  year,  I  am\r\n\r\nbringing it up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need to reskill and retrain this group of\r\n\r\nPMEs  is  also important.  In time to come, we know  that\r\n\r\nthis  cohort  of  employees will  constitute  the  bigger\r\n\r\nworkforce.    Sir,  this fund will  help  the  retrenched\r\n\r\nPMEs, or those who are to be retrenched, to pursue higher\r\n\r\nskills and education. This will help to increase their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployability and also enable them to fend for themselves\r\n\r\nthrough self-employment, part-time work and flexible work\r\n\r\narrangements. This group is growing by the day.  Yet,  we\r\n\r\nseem  to  put  our  own mindset that they  can  fend  for\r\n\r\nthemselves - they do not need help at all. The  likes  of\r\n\r\nOlivia Lum are testimony that they should be able to make\r\n\r\nit  if  they try hard enough.  But, Sir, how many  Olivia\r\n\r\nLums can there be? For every one Olivia Lum who makes it,\r\n\r\nthere  are hundreds out there who just need that booster.\r\n\r\nCall it luck or providence intervention.  It only touches\r\n\r\na  few  out of the hundreds. And when they are in  droves\r\n\r\nout  there,  a  civic  cautious  society  would  want  to\r\n\r\nmobilise and organise some form of assistance. This is to\r\n\r\nensure  that we contain the possible energies  that  they\r\n\r\nare  capable  of  generating back to the  economy  if  we\r\n\r\norganise and harness them well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the set up of the endowment fund can develop\r\n\r\nand equip PMEs for the future economy.  Otherwise, we may\r\n\r\nface  the  same sort of structural unemployment  for  the\r\n\r\nsandwich PMEs as we are facing today for the workers.  My\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  will Government be disposed to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  set-up  of  such  a  fund by encouraging  employers,\r\n\r\nemployer groups and professional bodies to start  such  a\r\n\r\nfund and the Government will match such donations, as  it\r\n\r\nhas done for the endowment fund for workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, many jobs are\r\n\r\nlost  during the current difficult economic crisis.   One\r\n\r\nreason  is  the  global economic slowdown.   But  a  more\r\n\r\nprofound  reason  is  a change in the  structure  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.   The  new  economy  jobs  require  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  set of skills and competencies. Do our  people\r\n\r\nunderstand  this?  Do our people understand the  dynamics\r\n\r\nof  the new economy and implications that it will have on\r\n\r\nus?\r\n\r\nDespite  the  economic  slowdown,  many  jobs  are  still\r\n\r\navailable in the market.  At first, Singaporeans were not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take them.  They made many  excuses.   They\r\n\r\nwere  reluctant  to  take on new, difficult,  unfamiliar,\r\n\r\nlower  paying  jobs.  They were reluctant  to  learn  new\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever,  today,  many of the same  people  have  changed\r\n\r\ntheir  minds.  They have taken on these jobs.  They  have\r\n\r\ngone  for  training  and to learn new  skills.   But  not\r\n\r\neveryone has done so. Some are still waiting for the  old\r\n\r\njobs  to come back.  What is really important is not that\r\n\r\nmerely  everyone takes the new jobs offered to them,  but\r\n\r\nthey  need to understand why they have to do so.   Hence,\r\n\r\nmore  needs to be done.  People change more readily  when\r\n\r\nthey  are faced with a problem.  We must turn the present\r\n\r\ndifficulties  into an opportunity to get  our  people  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the new economy and accept the needed changes.\r\n\r\nWe  must inform and educate them.  We must convince  them\r\n\r\nto accept and adapt to the new economic environment.  Our\r\n\r\nfuture  prosperity  depends on successfully  making  this\r\n\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to ask the Government what has\r\n\r\nbeen done to change the mindsets of our workforce for the\r\n\r\nnew economy.  What progress has been achieved?  What more\r\n\r\ncan be done?  What are some of the future plans?  We must\r\n\r\nnot stint on time, money and effort, in this vital task.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, let me thank Members for their suggestions to assist\r\n\r\nretrenched and unemployed Singaporeans as well as  cogent\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  improve our unemployment  situation.\r\n\r\nSir,   the  points  they  have  brought  up  are   indeed\r\n\r\nimportant,  as  many  analysts  predict  that  this  more\r\n\r\ndisruptive  economic climate may persist for  some  time.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  how globalisation will  pan  out,  the\r\n\r\nbacklashes,  how our economic conditions would  be,  even\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  impending war if  there  is  one,  remain\r\n\r\nuncertain.  These are fundamentally turbulent  times  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  not quite sure when visibility will improve  and\r\n\r\nwhat   the  climate  or  the  scenarios  will  be,  after\r\n\r\nvisibility   has  improved.   Therefore,  it   would   be\r\n\r\nimportant  for us to examine our fundamentals for  policy\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responses to existing challenges are underpinned\r\n\r\nby prevailing principles\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand,  if  you  like, philosophies.  Through our  meetings\r\n\r\nwith other Government officials and comparison with other\r\n\r\nsystems, we consistently subject our beliefs to scrutiny.\r\n\r\nSingapore, if you believe in equal commiseration, is  not\r\n\r\nthe only country facing unemployment.  Others have had it\r\n\r\nmuch  tougher and for a longer time.  Recently, I  led  a\r\n\r\ndelegation  to  some European cities to  study  how  they\r\n\r\naddress  their  problems of unemployment and  assistance.\r\n\r\nThe trip shed much light and I will share some main take-away lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lesson is that temporary assistance\r\n\r\nschemes,  indiscriminately applied and started  with  the\r\n\r\nbest   of   intentions,  degenerate  very  quickly   into\r\n\r\npermanent  schemes and hurt the overall economy.   Please\r\n\r\nnote that these are systems in developed countries run by\r\n\r\nseasoned bureaucrats with their armies of think-tanks and\r\n\r\npolicy   makers.   Even  with  their  vast   intellectual\r\n\r\nresources and the realisation that change has to be  made\r\n\r\nurgently,  they find it a stupendous task to  ameliorate,\r\n\r\nlet alone reverse, the increase in spending on assistance\r\n\r\nrelated to unemployment.  So, in some countries, they end\r\n\r\nup  spending  as  much  as  3% of  their  GDP  on  social\r\n\r\nassistance schemes.  This is more than three-quarters  of\r\n\r\nour  Education  budget, which caters for 550,000  people,\r\n\r\nbut  they  spent it on social assistance schemes.   Their\r\n\r\ncorresponding  cost of government is about  40%  of  GDP,\r\n\r\ncompared with 19% in Singapore currently.  GST, in  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  is  in  the double digits  and  corresponding\r\n\r\nmarginal personal and corporate tax rates twice  that  of\r\n\r\nours,  as  they  have to raise by taxes and  revenues  40\r\n\r\ncents   just   to  generate  one  dollar   of   turnover.\r\n\r\nPredictably,  these countries lose their  competitiveness\r\n\r\nand  the negative spiral begins, and continues.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nwe  ever choose to follow suit, this will be a load  that\r\n\r\nwill  sink us all.  Perhaps, some MPs might say  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  benefit from the wisdom of hindsight and  avoid  the\r\n\r\nexcesses that these economies have been encumbered  with.\r\n\r\nAre we so certain?  Should we venture into the water when\r\n\r\nthere are many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsigns telling us to beware of the strong undercurrents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of suggestions, both from\r\n\r\nthe  speakers  during the Committee  of  Supply  and  the\r\n\r\nBudget    debate,   in   terms   of   Government   loans,\r\n\r\nretrenchment, endowment, and `heed' funds.  Sir, they are\r\n\r\nwell-meaning,  but I would caution, eg,  loan  funds  and\r\n\r\nretrenchment   funds,   how  would   Government   enforce\r\n\r\nrepayments  if  we use their houses as collaterals?   For\r\n\r\nborrowers  who are at default, Government  would  not  be\r\n\r\nkeen  to  repossess their houses.  Alternatively,  if  we\r\n\r\nallow members to use their own or future CPF funds,  they\r\n\r\nwould  deplete their retirement savings.  I would caution\r\n\r\nus moving that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like MPs who have weekly meet-the-people sessions, I\r\n\r\nshare  Members'  concern over the  plight  of  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers, and our more targeted approach to assist them is\r\n\r\nthe  right  one.  We have many benefits as enumerated  by\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Lee as well as financial assistance\r\n\r\nschemes in our CDCs and CCCs.  Deputy Prime Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nspoke  on the sensitivity of our grassroots schemes.   We\r\n\r\nshould not underestimate the effectiveness and value that\r\n\r\nour various grassroots schemes have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My CCC welfare committee, like yours, I am sure, is\r\n\r\na  veritable  fount  of  local  knowledge.   I  have  one\r\n\r\nparticular lady who has lived in the estate for  over  20\r\n\r\nyears.  Sometimes, I almost believe that she knows  every\r\n\r\nelderly  or  down-and-out constituent.   She  knows,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in detail what cars their children drive,  what\r\n\r\nthey  eat and how much they eat.  Occasionally, she  will\r\n\r\nbring  hardship cases to my MPS with specific details  of\r\n\r\nfamily  feuds and how the appellant has suffered.   Other\r\n\r\ntimes, she will disagree on certain persons that we  have\r\n\r\nchosen  to  help.   \"They use the money  to  treat  their\r\n\r\nfriends  at  coffee shops\", she tells me.  Or,  \"her  son\r\n\r\ndrives   a  big  car  and  they  are  still  getting   PA\r\n\r\nallowance.\"  Their local knowledge in our community-based\r\n\r\nassistance scheme is invaluable.  They serve as brakes or\r\n\r\nlubricants, to be appropriately applied.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd, these schemes are better than any other bureaucratic\r\n\r\nschemes I have seen today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should be prudent that in our efforts\r\n\r\nto help those retrenched, we do not unwittingly undermine\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  of the willing. What do I mean?   Yes,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate was 4.2% in the last quarter.  Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  forget  that  96%  of  those  that  have  jobs  will\r\n\r\nthemselves  to work.  Sir, work is not fun and  glamorous\r\n\r\nevery  day.  There are days for every person,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  for all Members in this House, where you choose  to\r\n\r\nwork  whether you feel you like it or not.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nfanfare or stardust outside your door.  It is a conscious\r\n\r\nchoice we make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned my study trip and the lessons learned,\r\n\r\nand one particular poignant vignette was obtained from  a\r\n\r\nsenior  official who has been helping the unemployed  for\r\n\r\ndecades.  He has lots of experience as their unemployment\r\n\r\nrates  were in the teens for many years.  Those requiring\r\n\r\nemployment  assistance, he has concluded  from  years  of\r\n\r\nexperience, fall into three groups.  The first group  has\r\n\r\nskills and attitude, and are self-starters.  Many of them\r\n\r\nget  information  on their own and need  little,  if  any\r\n\r\nhelp,   to  get  re-employed.   The  second  group  needs\r\n\r\ntraining  indeed for new skills to get jobs.   The  third\r\n\r\ngroup, he graphically portrays, needs to be reminded that\r\n\r\nthey have an interview the next day.  Indeed, officers in\r\n\r\nhis  agency actually call on the day of interview to wake\r\n\r\nthis  third group of members to remind them!  He did  not\r\n\r\nrecount   his   conclusions  with  bitter   cynicism   or\r\n\r\ndisillusionment.   He said so with a matter-of-fact  tone\r\n\r\nand  with  a  sense  of acceptance and  equanimity.   His\r\n\r\nrealistic  appraisal would help his  organisation  to  be\r\n\r\nmore effective in their role, he added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked what has Government\r\n\r\ndone  to  create enough jobs.  He has said  whether  they\r\n\r\nwere  the  right types of jobs.  Sir, other Members  have\r\n\r\nexpressed,  despite jobs being present, as  Dr  Wang  Kai\r\n\r\nYuen has said, whether Government has underestimated  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  the  problem.  In these times,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nprudent for us to look\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninwards  as  well  as  outwards.  Our  figures  are  very\r\n\r\nrobust.   They are from figures that we take  from  about\r\n\r\n25,000 households and they are trend lines as well  which\r\n\r\nconvince  us that they are indeed robust.  In fact,  last\r\n\r\nyear,  our  local employment grew by 1.3%.   It  did  not\r\n\r\nshrink.   Yes, there was a net loss in unemployment,  the\r\n\r\namount of which was due to foreigners leaving, both  with\r\n\r\nWork Permit and Employment Pass, but our local employment\r\n\r\ngrew by 1.3%.  Should we start saying that there are  not\r\n\r\nenough  jobs,  that  the situation is  imperfect?   Where\r\n\r\nshould we place our efforts and resources?  Do we deprive\r\n\r\nthose who have a good attitude or do help those who place\r\n\r\nthemselves  `furthest from the job  market'  -  this  was\r\n\r\nanother  term we learned on this trip?  Do we  pile  even\r\n\r\nhigher  the  table for those who feel that  the  existing\r\n\r\nfood  on their table is not appetising?  Do we take  away\r\n\r\nfood  from  the table for those who by their own  efforts\r\n\r\nfeed  themselves?   There are no  easy  answers,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot be naive.  It will undo us.  In all our asking and\r\n\r\nangst, we should first get wisdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third lesson was that those who fail to plan and\r\n\r\nprovide  for the future have planned to fail.  I know  it\r\n\r\nsounds   axiomatic   but,  nonetheless,   remains   true.\r\n\r\nGovernments all around the globe are grappling  with  the\r\n\r\nadequacy  of  pension funds as life-expectancy  increases\r\n\r\nand  populations age. First generation Singaporeans build\r\n\r\nup   substantial  reserves  which  have  created   stable\r\n\r\nconditions  and  a  strong currency.   In  October  2001,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister Lee indicated that the  Government\r\n\r\nwould consider the withdrawal of CPF in extremis, but now\r\n\r\nis  not the time.  The recent ERC has concluded that  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system should be refocused on the three basic  needs\r\n\r\nof  retirement,  housing and healthcare.   And,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem stay focused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are jobs available. Yes, workers have to\r\n\r\nadjust  their  mindsets and expectations but  it  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.   My Minister mentioned that for year 2002, 72%  of\r\n\r\nthose retrenched in the first three quarters of the  year\r\n\r\nfound   employment  by  December.   Seven  out   of   ten\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproved  that  it can be done by finding work  six  months\r\n\r\nafter  retrenchment.  Therefore, our  approach  has  been\r\n\r\nthat we should enable those who want to remain employable\r\n\r\nthrough   reskilling   or  to   counsel   them   in   job\r\n\r\nopportunities.  But let us not mistake and  say  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to give guarantees.  There are no guarantees.   The\r\n\r\nonly  person  who  can guarantee success  is  the  worker\r\n\r\nhimself.    All  schemes  come  to  nought  without   the\r\n\r\ndetermination and effort of the individual.  So I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  endorsement and the support of Members for  the  CET\r\n\r\nboard which is the right direction we are taking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fully agree with other Members that we should\r\n\r\nfacilitate more the take-up of jobs.  Mr Steve Chia asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should  allow  employers  and  employees  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate their CPF contributions.  Sir, the ERC recently\r\n\r\nrecommended  that we should raise the employee  CPF  wage\r\n\r\nbands  for lower income workers from $200-$363  to  $500-$750,  so  that lower income employees, especially  part-time  workers,  will be able to take home  higher  salary\r\n\r\nwhile   their   employer's   CPF   contribution   remains\r\n\r\nunchanged.   This would increase the incentive  for  more\r\n\r\npeople to re-enter the workforce, particularly to do part-time  work.   However, we would not  want  to  completely\r\n\r\nwaive  the  contribution requirement for this group,  nor\r\n\r\nwaive the employer's CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to strike a balance between building\r\n\r\nup  sufficient  CPF funds for old age, on one  hand,  and\r\n\r\nencouraging more people to enter the workforce.  However,\r\n\r\nI  agree that there is room for review, if need be, as to\r\n\r\nwhere the base salary level should be.  And I am also not\r\n\r\nkeen  on  this idea because I think there is more  to  it\r\n\r\nthan  just fundamentally CPF contributions.  For example,\r\n\r\nour  PJTP  scheme that my Minister spoke  about  provides\r\n\r\nvery  generous wage adjustments, if you like.  We sponsor\r\n\r\n50%  of those salaries in the first six months and,  even\r\n\r\nwith  those generous schemes, people are not  hiring.   I\r\n\r\nsuspect that many employers are reluctant to hire because\r\n\r\nof the uncertainty.  First came September\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n11,  then  the  current  Iraq crisis.   Until  visibility\r\n\r\nimproves, we will have to stick to this situation and not\r\n\r\nadjust precipitously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has suggested that we increase\r\n\r\nefficiencies  by  formulating  or  formalising   contract\r\n\r\nmanpower industry.  He will be happy to note that  indeed\r\n\r\nit  has already happened without any of our measures  and\r\n\r\nthat there is flexibility in our labour market.  In 2002,\r\n\r\n70%  of  contract workers found employment  through  this\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members, among which Mr Heng Chee How, Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah,  Dr Ong Seh Hong, who have given suggestions  on\r\n\r\nhow  we should help those with lower skills and at higher\r\n\r\nrisk  of structural unemployment.  I know that they speak\r\n\r\nfrom experience, having personally helped the retrenched,\r\n\r\nand  they  are realistic proposals.  They have  suggested\r\n\r\nthe  potential of non-tradable jobs. MOM agrees.  Several\r\n\r\nsectors - healthcare, hospitality, infantcare, eldercare,\r\n\r\npublic  cleaning,  domestic  cleaning,  restaurants   and\r\n\r\nretail  -  have already been identified by MOM,  EDB  and\r\n\r\nSPRING because they have either good growth prospects  or\r\n\r\ngreat  propensity to absorb local workers.  These sectors\r\n\r\nhave  existing  vacancies, but locals are  generally  not\r\n\r\nkeen to consider them for a variety of reasons, like  low\r\n\r\nwages,  perceived poor image, long training  periods  and\r\n\r\nstructural   impediments  like  shift   work   and   work\r\n\r\nconditions.  We will slowly tackle the problems,  one  by\r\n\r\none, deliberately.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these sectors, MOM is currently looking at the\r\n\r\nwhole value chain of the workforce development.  We agree\r\n\r\nthat  there is potential here and, therefore, we want  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  this.  This is one of the efforts of  the  CET\r\n\r\nboard.   The  aim  is  to ensure better  coordination  of\r\n\r\nindustry development with manpower development strategies\r\n\r\nand,  hence,  better  match between  the  skills  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers and industries' needs, as some Members have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as of December 2002, there were some 5,000\r\n\r\njob vacancies in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngoods-producing  industries,  while  there  were  another\r\n\r\n8,000 job vacancies in services industries.  All in  all,\r\n\r\nMOM,   EDB   and   SPRING   have  identified   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities in 12 sectors that we will focus on, and we\r\n\r\nwill engage key stakeholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad suggested that we should focus on the\r\n\r\nservice industry  -  he indeed has a point  -  and we are\r\n\r\ndoing  that.   We have sponsored NTUC Fairprice training,\r\n\r\nand  we  are working with the Retail Academy as  well  as\r\n\r\nsome healthcare providers like HMI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo has asked what aid is given to\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  managers  and executives.   We  have  not\r\n\r\nneglected them.  For workers who are keen to set up small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  be  self-employed,  the  existing  Self-Employment  Training  Programme, which  was  launched  in\r\n\r\nApril  last year, will equip them with the knowledge  and\r\n\r\npre-requisites.  In fact, 4,000 places were taken up last\r\n\r\nyear.     And  56%  of  the  participants  who  completed\r\n\r\ntraining  indicated that they would like to  start  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to provide job matching services to\r\n\r\nretrenched   executives  complemented  by  industry   and\r\n\r\ncommunity  job  fairs.   There  are  nearly  1,000   jobs\r\n\r\navailable  in  MOM's  job  bank  for  professionals   and\r\n\r\nexecutives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what are the programmes in terms of the\r\n\r\nstrategic manpower conversion programmes.  Indeed,  there\r\n\r\nare  many.   We  have  started  training  in  sectors  of\r\n\r\ninfocomm,   logistics,  community  and  social  services,\r\n\r\nhealthcare    nursing,    intellectual    property    and\r\n\r\ninternationalisation sectors.  It is not that we did  not\r\n\r\nheed.   We  did heed.  It is just that the  fund  is  not\r\n\r\ncalled  by  the  name she suggested.  It  is  called  the\r\n\r\nStrategic Manpower Conversion Programme.  We may  try  to\r\n\r\nthink of how we can change it to suit her acronym, but it\r\n\r\nmight take us some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other economic agencies such as EDB, MAS,\r\n\r\nIDA  and IE Singapore have also provided training support\r\n\r\nto professionals.  In 2002, these agencies helped\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrain over 13,000 executives and professionals to support\r\n\r\nthe industry capability and developmental thrusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Ong Seh Hong\r\n\r\non  the  need  to  change  mindsets.   We  need  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  transit their mindshifts, and  we  will  do\r\n\r\nthat.  We have had 15 good years.  It takes some time and\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to emphasise this.  Many Members  would\r\n\r\nhave  come  across our Jobs Task Force's public education\r\n\r\nprogramme.   It  is  a  9-month programme,  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to spend time on it.  Has it worked?  Yes.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that  72% of retrenched workers found re-employment\r\n\r\nin  2002  indicates that we have some limited  but  early\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng spoke about the mature workers. To\r\n\r\nencourage and incentivise employers, we talked about  the\r\n\r\nPeople-for-Jobs  Traineeship  Programme   (PJTP).     The\r\n\r\nMinister said that as at February 2003, the programme has\r\n\r\nsome  4,000  participating companies.   In  other  words,\r\n\r\nemployers  are  responding and this  has  benefited  some\r\n\r\n9,000  mature employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry understands and appreciates the\r\n\r\ndifficulties faced by older workers.  Together  with  the\r\n\r\nemployer  organisations and trade unions, we are stepping\r\n\r\nup our efforts to assist Singaporeans who have difficulty\r\n\r\nseeking employment, including the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\ntripartite    guidelines   on   Non-discriminatory    Job\r\n\r\nAdvertisements  and  the  Code of Responsible  Employment\r\n\r\nPractices  jointly issued by NTUC and SBF/SNEF to  change\r\n\r\nthe mindset of employers on older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Members. I think the elderly and\r\n\r\nthe  mature workers, which Members here also fall in  the\r\n\r\ngroup,  are getting a bad rap.  Many employers,  I  feel,\r\n\r\nwill  rue  the day they did not capitalise on  this  soft\r\n\r\nlabour  market to employ such workers.  And I agree  with\r\n\r\nMs  Irene  Ng  that  this is a business  aspect,  not  an\r\n\r\naltruistic  bent.   There are some enlightened  employers\r\n\r\nlike  Jennifer Lee and Ms Irene Ng's example of an  owner\r\n\r\nwho understood that mature workers have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncachet  of experience and networking and they are  likely\r\n\r\nto  stay with the company longer.  The image and fear  of\r\n\r\nmature  workers  falling  ill more  compared  to  younger\r\n\r\nworkers is over-rated.  Statistics show that the majority\r\n\r\nof  medical  consumption occurs in the last 10  years  of\r\n\r\nlife,  ie,  it occurs in the majority after our mandatory\r\n\r\nretirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang tells us not to forget that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  voted the Government in and, therefore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  responsibility  to  find  them  jobs.   I  would\r\n\r\nreiterate to Mr Low that we have never forgotten.  It  is\r\n\r\nparticularly because of that that we have created schemes\r\n\r\nthat will help us to be competitive in the long run.   He\r\n\r\nimplies  that  if we only restrict work opportunities  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans our economy would do better and the  problem\r\n\r\nsolved.   My Minister dwelt on that a long time,  but  it\r\n\r\nseems that the point needs reiterating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which nationality would he exclude? In every\r\n\r\nindustry, there are ample examples, without me having  to\r\n\r\nname them, of luminaries  -  there are many in this House\r\n\r\n-  that the vitality, the verve, the competitiveness, the\r\n\r\nability  to attract investments is because of our  multi-national  representation.  Would we be better  served  by\r\n\r\nhaving  a  company full of Singaporeans  with  a  limited\r\n\r\ntalent  pool diminishing the pie, equal misery?  The  pie\r\n\r\nshrinks, salaries drop and more are unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a quote from The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\r\n\r\nwill  be  suitable at this point.  This is a book written\r\n\r\nby  David  Landes,  Emeritus  Professor  of  History  and\r\n\r\nEconomics at Harvard.  For those who want to refer to it,\r\n\r\nit is in pages 225, 229-230. He was trying to compare and\r\n\r\nask  himself why some countries progress and  others  did\r\n\r\nnot.  In this particular chapter, he asked:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why no industrial revolution in India? After all,\r\n\r\nIndia had the world's premier cotton industry in the 17th\r\n\r\nand  18th centuries, unbeatable for quality, variety  and\r\n\r\ncost.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many reasons, one which was a closed mind,\r\n\r\nhe cites one particular poignant example and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The British engineers who built the Indian railways\r\n\r\nunderstood that Indian labor, cheap as it was, would move\r\n\r\nearth  and  rock by hand; but they also took for  granted\r\n\r\nthat the Indians would use the wheelbarrows.  Not at all:\r\n\r\nthe Indians were used to moving heavy burdens in a basket\r\n\r\non  their  head and refused to change.  We even have  one\r\n\r\nreport  of Indian laborers placing barrows on their  head\r\n\r\nrather  than  wheel  them.   Presumably  such  resistance\r\n\r\nreflected  a  desire  to  spread the  work  and  increase\r\n\r\nemployment  [to their locals], especially  to  women  and\r\n\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is self-serving; this is self-diminishing.\r\n\r\nAmong  all our efforts, there is one thing that we should\r\n\r\nnot  do and, indeed, would prove futile, ie, to hold back\r\n\r\nbarriers  and erect barriers.  We are in an open  export-driven  economy.  We depend on free trade to thrive  and,\r\n\r\nwith that, we expose ourselves to international standards\r\n\r\nof  productivity,  processes  and  practices.   Mr  Low's\r\n\r\nsuggestion that we keep our markets closed would diminish\r\n\r\nus all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must ride this wave of progress and\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  and  we will come  on  top,  as  we  have\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am not saying that we\r\n\r\nshould  close and we should not welcome foreign  talents.\r\n\r\nMy question really is:  are there jobs which Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  talented  enough to do that are offered  to  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents, instead of Singaporeans, especially with  a high\r\n\r\nunemployment rate?

But we will let the markeplace decide  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  not erect barriers to distort the market.

Specifically,  they  are:   deferment  of  CPF\r\n\r\nrestoration for two years;  progressive lowering  of  CPF\r\n\r\nceiling    for   employer   contribution;    lower    CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  workers  aged  50-55;  and   increased\r\n\r\ncontribution rates to Medisave and Special Accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are major changes that impact workers. I know\r\n\r\nthat  much has already been debated on these CPF  changes\r\n\r\nin  public,  the media and in Parliament.  But  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhat  will the Government do to help Singaporeans  adjust\r\n\r\nto the impact of these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans understand that the CPF is\r\n\r\nfundamentally  for  old age, medical expenses  and  basic\r\n\r\nhousing,  and that the Government will continue  the  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem  around  these core objectives.   But  with  these\r\n\r\nchanges,  Singaporeans'  savings  for  old  age  will  be\r\n\r\neroded.   We  must ensure that our workers'  CPF  savings\r\n\r\nwill  have stable and reasonably good returns.   Allowing\r\n\r\nindividual CPF members to invest their savings seems  not\r\n\r\na  preferred  choice these days where the  stock  markets\r\n\r\nworld-wide are underperforming.  There have been on-going\r\n\r\ndiscussions that the Government is considering privately-managed  pension funds as an alternative to CPF  savings.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister whether he could provide\r\n\r\nthe House greater details and insights.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nlong  economic recession all over the world has  resulted\r\n\r\nin our unemployment rate remaining very high.  I think we\r\n\r\nhave   about  100,000  people  who  are   unemployed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Now,  with our economic restructuring,  even\r\n\r\nthe higher educated are affected.  The Minister has given\r\n\r\nsome  examples  of  how  jobs were  created  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   But  for those older workers who  are  50  and\r\n\r\nabove,  if  they  are  unemployed,  they  are  unemployed\r\n\r\nforever. It is very difficult for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem   to  get  another  job.   Our  economy  has   grown\r\n\r\nsignificantly   since   our   independence.    We    have\r\n\r\ntransformed from an old village into a cosmopolitan city.\r\n\r\nIt  shows  that  we  have moved in the  right  direction.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we would not have progressed.  But  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  who  are unable to cope with the changes, they  are\r\n\r\nentangled in a trap and they cannot help themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old kampong days, when people were\r\n\r\nunemployed,  they   could  just  plant  some  tapioca  or\r\n\r\npotatoes,  and still survived.  But now if you  do  that,\r\n\r\nyou  will  get a summons from the authorities.  Nowadays,\r\n\r\nif  you  are  unemployed, it would not  be  easy  to  get\r\n\r\nanother  job.   Some  residents  came  to  see   me.    I\r\n\r\nintroduced them to a job.  One week later, they came back\r\n\r\nand said that they wanted to work but the employers would\r\n\r\nnot employ them.  This is an employers' market now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the pay is $1,000 and after CPF\r\n\r\ndeduction,  the take-home pay is only $800.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  to  maintain the family.  The Teochew people  say\r\n\r\ntan  chiak,  which means to earn and eat.  After  eating,\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing left.  The only saving you can have  is\r\n\r\nin  your CPF, but you cannot get the money until you  are\r\n\r\n55.   It  is  like in a desert, you see the water  in  an\r\n\r\noasis;  you want to drink the water but you cannot  reach\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether, in\r\n\r\nthis  difficult time, special consideration can be  given\r\n\r\nto  those who are 50 and above, unemployed for more  than\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  with  no  savings and no financial  support.\r\n\r\nThey  look seriously  for jobs but could not get  a  job.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  circumstances, can they  make  some  advance\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  from  their  CPF  accounts?   If  they   have\r\n\r\n$50,000, let them withdraw, say, 5% a year or about  $200\r\n\r\na month, just to tide over this difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, first, please allow me to\r\n\r\nquote the CPF Board's mission statement:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We aim to provide our members in a cost effective\r\n\r\nmanner the widest range of quality services possible.'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the size of our CPF members' reserves as of\r\n\r\nDecember 2001 was over $90 billion.  Our CPF members  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to invest their savings in a range of  financial\r\n\r\ninstruments   including   shares,   bonds,    gold    and\r\n\r\nprofessionally managed products.  Here, I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  may not have discharged its duties adequately\r\n\r\nin   providing  its  members  cost  effective  investment\r\n\r\noptions to enhance their long-term savings.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since most of the average Singaporeans are not\r\n\r\ninvestment  savvy,  many  got their  fingers  burnt  when\r\n\r\ninvesting  their  CPF savings in the markets  themselves.\r\n\r\nWhy  are  they  not  investing through professional  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  who will provide them portfolios, reduce  their\r\n\r\ninvestment risks and enhance their returns?  One  of  the\r\n\r\nbiggest obstacles is the high management fees imposed  by\r\n\r\nthe fund managers.  On average, you have to pay about  3-5% front-end fees plus an annual fee of between 1-1.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 2001, a total of $44 billion of CPF\r\n\r\nmembers'  monies  were invested.  If  they  all  invested\r\n\r\nthese  monies through fund managers, a mere 3% fee  would\r\n\r\nbe $1.3 billion.  This is enough to build, I think, a new\r\n\r\nMRT line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whichever way you look at it, this is a huge\r\n\r\namount of money.  But as individual account holders,  our\r\n\r\naverage  CPF members are like ikan bilis.  They  have  no\r\n\r\nbargaining powers.  It is just like when you  go  to  the\r\n\r\nbank,  you have to queue up if you are an average  retail\r\n\r\nmarket  customer, and you have to pay all the  fees  that\r\n\r\nthey ask you to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we want to attract foreign fund managers to be\r\n\r\nbased  here,  we  must also make it  attractive  for  our\r\n\r\ncitizens to park their money with them.  In this  regard,\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  the  CPF Board must do its  part  for  its\r\n\r\nmembers.   It  is in the best position to  negotiate  the\r\n\r\nbest deal for its members.  Size in business does matter.\r\n\r\nAs a big fish, you are more likely to be wined\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  dined than an average guy on the street.

This would be a win-win-win situation  for  all\r\n\r\nthree  partners.  If the management fee could be lowered,\r\n\r\nmore   CPF  members  would  be  persuaded  to   let   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals manage their money and enjoy better returns\r\n\r\nin  the  long  term.  The fund management industry  would\r\n\r\nhave  the boost of extra monies for them to manage.   The\r\n\r\nCPF  Board, in the end, would have fulfilled its  mission\r\n\r\nto  provide  a  cost-effective  quality  service  to  its\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, even as we\r\n\r\nare dealing with the implications of not providing enough\r\n\r\nfinances  for  old  age,  we  have  every  motivation  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  rate of return on CPF  savings.   Also,  I\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  Mr Steve Chia's proposal  to  render  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  negotiable for certain  workers.   I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is some evidence, say, in the  US  for  the\r\n\r\n401K,  that  there  will  always  be  a  reason  not   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  at  all.  We should, therefore,  not  be  too\r\n\r\nquick to dispense with the forced savings feature of  the\r\n\r\nCPF scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has recently stated that the Board is\r\n\r\nstudying  ways  of assisting in the establishment  of  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  pension plan within the CPF framework.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to achieve a higher, longer term  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn through a well-diversified portfolio to be managed\r\n\r\nby  one  or more reputable pension plan providers.   Sir,\r\n\r\ndiversification is the right strategy.  But I would  like\r\n\r\nto raise a few questions regarding this initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of the CPF Board. Unlike the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  mandatory pension schemes  elsewhere,\r\n\r\nthe  role  of the CPF Board has hitherto been limited  to\r\n\r\nthe collection and disbursement of members' monies within\r\n\r\na  well-prescribed framework, ie, ensuring that employers\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  the  required contributions on the  one  hand,  and\r\n\r\nmaking sure that members meet mortgage instalments on the\r\n\r\nother.   The  Board does not explicitly  manage  members'\r\n\r\nfunds.  Yet it guarantees a minimum interest rate of 2.5%\r\n\r\non  Ordinary  Account  and  4%  on  the  Special  Account\r\n\r\nbalances.   This is, in essence, an offer of a  risk-free\r\n\r\nrate  by  an institution, ie, the CPF Board, familiar  to\r\n\r\nall CPF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this deposit-like facility, it is therefore\r\n\r\nconceivable  that  we would need a huge  dose  of  public\r\n\r\neducation  to  convince members to  buy  private  pension\r\n\r\nplans.   The  ability of these providers to  quote  lower\r\n\r\nmanagement  charges is linked directly to  the  scale  or\r\n\r\nsize  of the aggregate amounts under management.  So,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  bit  of a chicken-and-egg situation that  we  have\r\n\r\nhere.   Short  of  mandating  that  all  funds  must   be\r\n\r\nallocated to providers which incidentally is the scenario\r\n\r\nelsewhere  where  there is no CPF  rate  alternative,  it\r\n\r\ncould  be a real challenge to get enough takers.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister how the Board will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere is sufficient scale for a meaningful outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the accountability for performance. I\r\n\r\nwould also like to ask the Minister what are some of  the\r\n\r\nreservations  for  the Board itself to  be  the  manager,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  the facilitator.  As it is,  it  is  already\r\n\r\nproviding  a risk-free return for balances.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nin  the  event that the take-up rate by members  is  such\r\n\r\nthat  the scale allows for the selection of only  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo managers, the accountability of the Board will extend\r\n\r\nbeyond that of a facilitator anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh is not present.\r\n\r\nMdm Ho.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, there are two main issues\r\n\r\nthat  I would like to raise with regard to the CPF funds.\r\n\r\nThe first issue refers to the use of a portion of the CPF\r\n\r\nfunds  as an advance loan for a limited period.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  in  households where the sole breadwinner has  lost\r\n\r\nhis  job and where the spouse is sick and unable to work,\r\n\r\nand where they have children to support and bills to pay,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden can be a very heavy one.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  know  whether  the  Minister  would  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider the release of a portion of the CPF funds as  an\r\n\r\nadvance   loan   to  help  tide  over   the   period   of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  especially if it is  a  prolonged  period.\r\n\r\nSir,  such amounts are to be treated as temporary  loans,\r\n\r\nwhich  the unemployed will have to return when they  have\r\n\r\nfound jobs subsequently.  The CPF loan should be used for\r\n\r\nliving expenses and meeting financial obligations such as\r\n\r\nstudy  loans  for themselves or their children,  and  for\r\n\r\npayment  of  the insurance premiums covering medical  and\r\n\r\nhospitalisation eventualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue relates to reviewing the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of the CPF for those above 50 years  to  the\r\n\r\nsame  rate as those below 50 when the recession  is  well\r\n\r\nbehind us.  The main concern behind the policy of a lower\r\n\r\nCPF  rate  for those who hit 50s will ensure that  mature\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are able to find jobs in the future.   Most\r\n\r\nof  these  concerns  centre around the  observation  that\r\n\r\nemployers perceive mature workers to be more costly  than\r\n\r\ntheir  younger counterparts and less productive as  well.\r\n\r\nSir,  we have yet to obtain data to show that the  mature\r\n\r\nworkers do not represent value for money when compared to\r\n\r\ntheir  younger  counterparts.  A lower  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate  for  this  group would insignificantly  reduce  the\r\n\r\noverall  cost of doing business in Singapore.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  will  not help to increase the employability  of  the\r\n\r\nmature workers.  The point is how many mature workers who\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their jobs have gotten back into  employment,\r\n\r\nbecause  their  CPF rate has gone down.  The  problem  of\r\n\r\nemployability  may  have  its cause  elsewhere.   It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a double whammy blow for this group of people.\r\n\r\nAdopting  a measure of reduced CPF contribution  rate  to\r\n\r\nincrease the employability of mature workers has not been\r\n\r\neffective.   It may be more prudent to educate  employers\r\n\r\nto change their perception concerning mature workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can appreciate the difficulties that many\r\n\r\namong  this group of workers face in ensuring  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  sufficient funds in their CPF for their  retirement\r\n\r\nand do not have to depend on the state for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir upkeep.  While it is laudable to try to enhance the\r\n\r\nemployability  of  this  group of  workers,  it  is  also\r\n\r\nimportant  that we keep other objectives in  mind  before\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  policy.  This is to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nmature workforce does not suffer undue hardship in  years\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, starting from 2004, the\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  for  the  Special  Account  and  the\r\n\r\nMedisave Account will be increased, in line with the  ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  refocus our CPF  to  meet  the  basic\r\n\r\nfinancial  needs of Singaporeans.  I support  this  move.\r\n\r\nBut in implementing the new rates, I urge the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  to be mindful of the needs of Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  between  the ages of 50 and 55 years.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ngroup  that will have their CPF capped at 36%.  When  the\r\n\r\nCPF  is restored for Singaporeans below 50 years of  age,\r\n\r\nthey   will   be  affected  the  most,  as   the   higher\r\n\r\ncontribution   rate  to  these  two  accounts   will   be\r\n\r\ntransferred from their Ordinary Accounts.  By  2006,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, their Special Accounts will increase  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  rate  of  6% to 9%, and their Medisave  accounts\r\n\r\nwill  increase from the current rate of 8% to  9%.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that by 2006, Singaporeans between the ages of  50\r\n\r\nand  55  years will have a total amount of 4% transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  their  Ordinary  Accounts and  deposited  into  the\r\n\r\nSpecial and Medisave accounts.  Many Singaporeans in this\r\n\r\nage  bracket are still paying for their homes and so will\r\n\r\nfeel  the pinch.  The situation will be particularly hard\r\n\r\nfor those earning more than $5,000, as the salary ceiling\r\n\r\nwould also be reduced in 2004.  They will suffer a double\r\n\r\nwhammy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has recommended that we allow CPF members\r\n\r\naged 50 to 55 to continue using their Special Accounts to\r\n\r\nmeet  shortfalls  in  mortgage repayments  for  a  longer\r\n\r\ntransition period.  I urge the Ministry to heed this call\r\n\r\nand  exercise flexibility in implementing the new  rates,\r\n\r\nso that older Singaporeans will not suffer undue hardship\r\n\r\nas a result of the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry to\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation of the low wage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearners.   With  the recent change, those  earning  below\r\n\r\n$500 do not have to contribute to the CPF.  While this is\r\n\r\na  good  idea  as  it  gives  them  more  take-home  pay,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  the flip side is that they  may  not  have\r\n\r\nenough savings to purchase a house or retire.  So,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about this group and I ask MOM to monitor  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a final point, I also hope that the Ministry\r\n\r\ncan throw some light on this issue of the retirement age.\r\n\r\nMany  calls  have been made in this House to abolish  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age.  This has given the impression  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a mandatory retirement age forcing people to retire\r\n\r\nat  62  years.  The Retirement Age Act, to my  knowledge,\r\n\r\ndoes no such thing.  On the contrary, what it does is  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  right for people to work until 62 years,  that\r\n\r\nis,  they  cannot be retired before 62,  but,  by  mutual\r\n\r\nagreement with the employer, there is nothing to prohibit\r\n\r\nthem  from  working beyond this age.  Sir, a confirmation\r\n\r\non the part of the Ministry on this point will be useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, as I said during the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  debate, Government  must  correct  the\r\n\r\nperception - it may not be a statutory requirement but  a\r\n\r\nperception  - that one must retire by age 62  or  65,  as\r\n\r\nwhat  Mdm  Halimah  has said earlier.  Otherwise,  people\r\n\r\nlike  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Chief Justice Yong\r\n\r\nPung  How  are way overdue for retirement.  But this  has\r\n\r\nnot  been the case, and will not likely be the case  with\r\n\r\nan increasingly knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, one can only retire if one has money\r\n\r\nand can afford it.  We read of successful individuals who\r\n\r\ndecided  to  retire at the age of 40  or  so.   They  can\r\n\r\nafford it.  But for many others, life will need to go  on\r\n\r\nafter  65,  and to continue working helps  to  keep  them\r\n\r\nmentally  alert and to keep illness away.  As  such,  the\r\n\r\nconcept of retirement at age 65 needs to be dropped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Government not to force compulsory\r\n\r\nretirement  on  those who can, who want or  who  need  to\r\n\r\nwork, especially\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose in the civil service.  This can be done by adopting\r\n\r\na   flexible  wage  structure  and  moving  away  from  a\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage  scheme  to  one   that   is   more\r\n\r\neconomically  viable.  And if this proposal  is  adopted,\r\n\r\nthe  concept of CPF savings for retirement can be revised\r\n\r\nto  CPF savings for rainy days, where members can draw on\r\n\r\ntheir  savings  on  difficult days, no  longer  just  for\r\n\r\nretirement  purposes.  This will allow the Government  to\r\n\r\nfree up the compulsory CPF contribution for older workers\r\n\r\nto  something that is negotiable between the employer and\r\n\r\nemployee, as I have explained earlier in my speech.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to  help save jobs for older  workers  and\r\n\r\nreduce  the  unemployment rate.   If  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  free up car loans totally for  consumption,\r\n\r\nthen it should not worry unnecessarily about the problems\r\n\r\nof  retirement savings or 401K, as highlighted by  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  Remaining employed  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant than having enough retirement savings  for  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, many of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have already spoken on various aspects of  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system.   I would like to touch on just one  current\r\n\r\ndeficiency  of  CPF  as the primary means  of  addressing\r\n\r\nfinancial needs of Singaporeans in their old age, namely,\r\n\r\nit  does not cover homemakers whose contributions in  the\r\n\r\nhome  and  in  attending to their family  needs  are  not\r\n\r\nattributed economic value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC on the Aging Population recommended in 1999\r\n\r\nthat  this be addressed.  But sadly, the ERC, in all  its\r\n\r\nstudied modifications proposed to the CPF system, did not\r\n\r\nfollow up on this particular aspect.  Although the female\r\n\r\nlabour  force participation rate is currently 54%,  there\r\n\r\nare over 700,000 women who are homemakers - not holding a\r\n\r\nCPF  account, not holding a job that draws a salary  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  either having an inactive  CPF  account  with\r\n\r\nminimal  amount  in their balance, or not  having  a  CPF\r\n\r\naccount at all.  As these women will, in all probability,\r\n\r\noutlive their spouses,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  financial situation will be precarious  as  it  is\r\n\r\nuncertain  what  their husbands will have  left  them  as\r\n\r\nremaining balances in their CPF account, or other savings\r\n\r\nor, indeed, if they will have left their CPF balances  to\r\n\r\nthem at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work women do in attending to the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in  the  home  are  what  enable  their\r\n\r\nspouses to be productively and gainfully employed in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  and  the upbringing of children  prepares  the\r\n\r\nnext  generation of citizens.  It is surely then not  too\r\n\r\nmuch  to  ask  that this contribution be acknowledged  by\r\n\r\nfactoring  into  the system measures that  will  help  to\r\n\r\nprotect the women's financial situation in their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask that, as we proceed to refine\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system, as recommended by the ERC, we consider,\r\n\r\nin  addition,  dividing the Special Account  contribution\r\n\r\ninto  two,  one half being in the name of the non-working\r\n\r\nspouse  in a single income household.  Women in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  very  fortunate in that the strong  protection  that\r\n\r\nfamily  law  here  provides  them  in  acknowledging  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of a non-working spouse in the  division  of\r\n\r\nmatrimonial assets in the event of a divorce.   There  is\r\n\r\nno  such  provision in inheritance law and  we  have  sad\r\n\r\nstories  of widows left high and dry when their  deceased\r\n\r\nhusband's  assets, including any CPF savings, are  willed\r\n\r\nto other parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our promotion of strong family units\r\n\r\nand  both partners in a couple, working together, raising\r\n\r\nchildren  together  and preparing for old  age  together,\r\n\r\ncould  we therefore consider, in addition, that,  on  the\r\n\r\ndeath  of an account holder, the balances in the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount   and   the  Medisave  Account   be   transferred\r\n\r\nautomatically  to the surviving spouse  since  these  two\r\n\r\naccounts are particularly meant to cater for one's  basic\r\n\r\nneeds in old age?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I thank all the Members who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  on the CPF system.  Before I  go  into  the\r\n\r\nspecific  response,  I would just  like  to  remind  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that the CPF system was exhaustively studied  by\r\n\r\nthe Economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nReview Committee.  They picked up the stone, they gave it\r\n\r\na  good dusting.  They looked at the top, they looked  at\r\n\r\nthe side, they looked underneath.  At the end of the day,\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  concluded that the CPF system serves  us  well.\r\n\r\nOne  of those stones they decided not to throw away,  but\r\n\r\nput  it  back.  Yes, they did not put it back in  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same position.  They repositioned the stone a little\r\n\r\nbit.   The repositioning was to enable us to better  meet\r\n\r\nthe  future challenges.  The details of the repositioning\r\n\r\nwere  covered by DPM Lee, both last year and also, again,\r\n\r\nin the Budget Speech.  So I would not go over them again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the basic point I want to make is that the CPF\r\n\r\nsystem  has  served  us  well, and  it  continues  to  be\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the needs of Singapore and to Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nif  we  refocus it on the key or core objectives  of  the\r\n\r\nCPF,  namely, retirement, savings, housing and healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenses.   I do not think there is any question  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of hon. Members that we should do away with it  or\r\n\r\nto  make even more radical surgery.  I think there is, of\r\n\r\ncourse, room for improvement as we go along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that we will continue to\r\n\r\nsee  how  we can provide better service, make improvement\r\n\r\nto  the  system,  make  it even more  responsive  to  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's question. He\r\n\r\nmentioned that the idea of allowing CPF members to invest\r\n\r\nmoney in the share market has not turned out to be a good\r\n\r\nidea  because,  as a result of the fall  in  the  various\r\n\r\nshare  markets, CPF members have lost money.  Yes, it  is\r\n\r\ntrue.  CPF members who have gone into the share market on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  have  lost money as a result  of  the  market\r\n\r\nconditions.   Let us remember also that  if  we  had  not\r\n\r\nliberalised,  if  we  had  not  enabled  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nutilise   some  of  their  CPF  savings  for  their   own\r\n\r\ninvestment,   we  will  also  stand  accused   of   being\r\n\r\nunreasonably rigid and of unfairly locking up hard earned\r\n\r\nsavings of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we did liberalise and created a CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment Scheme, we cautioned all CPF members that they\r\n\r\ninvest   at   their  own  risk.   They   have   to   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  They have to learn how to  invest  their\r\n\r\nretirement savings so that they do not get caught.   Over\r\n\r\nthe years, we have also refined the investment system  to\r\n\r\nbetter adjust for this risk exposure.  We started out,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  by  allowing them to use 80% of the  investible\r\n\r\nsavings  to  make  personal investment.   This  was  then\r\n\r\nreduced to 50% and, currently, only 35% of the investible\r\n\r\nsavings  can be invested personally.  Whereas  the  rest,\r\n\r\nthey  can  invest  in unit trusts or managed  by  a  fund\r\n\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in fact, we are responding, we are adjusting, we\r\n\r\nare learning from the experience.  But, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday,  when  you  make  investment, everybody  must  know,\r\n\r\nincluding  CPF  members, that there  will  always  be  an\r\n\r\nelement of risk and you have to do your calculations,  do\r\n\r\nyour sums and make sure that the risks are acceptable  to\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong was concerned with the high\r\n\r\nmanagement  fees levied by fund managers on  CPF  members\r\n\r\nwho  place  their  CPF savings in these  fund  management\r\n\r\naccounts.   It is correct to say that the fees  are  high\r\n\r\nand,  in  a  sense, it does discourage CPF  members  from\r\n\r\ngoing into such fund management accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that these high management fees\r\n\r\napply  both  to cash investors and CPF Investment  Scheme\r\n\r\nmembers  who are investing in unit trusts or  other  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement accounts.  I think it is not right for Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nto  say that CPF Board has not discharged its duty or  to\r\n\r\nprovide effective services to CPF members.  The fact that\r\n\r\nfund  managers charge a high fee applies to both the  CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment   Scheme  investors  and  also  cash   account\r\n\r\nholders, and it is also related to the small fund size of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  market.   We  are  a  very  small  market\r\n\r\ncompared   to   the   global  fund   management   market.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with a small market, the overheads tend to  be\r\n\r\nhigher.    So   the  fees  will  be  higher.    That   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Board will continue to look for ways\r\n\r\nto  bring  down the cost of investment for members.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, in September 2002, last year, the Board allowed\r\n\r\nforeign  unit trusts, registered under the CPF Investment\r\n\r\nScheme,  in other words, approved for investment  by  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers, to be offered directly to CPF investors  without\r\n\r\nthe  need  to go through an additional feeder  structure.\r\n\r\nSo  we shorten the retailing chain.  We do not have to go\r\n\r\nthrough a further intermediary.  Foreign unit trusts  can\r\n\r\nbe offered directly, once they meet certain criteria.  So\r\n\r\nthat  will  help  to  lower the cost for  CPF  Investment\r\n\r\nScheme members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked some questions with regard to\r\n\r\nthe proposal for a private pension plan which is intended\r\n\r\nto  help CPF members get a higher rate of return  over  a\r\n\r\nlonger term.  This was one of the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee  -  to  study  an  option  by\r\n\r\nintroducing low-cost privately-managed pension  plan  for\r\n\r\nCPF  members.   The belief is that with  this  privately-managed pension plan, investment cost could be lower  and\r\n\r\nit  could  also, over the longer term, achieve  a  higher\r\n\r\nrate  of  return  for  CPF members.   The  Board  is  now\r\n\r\nstudying  how  best  to  operationalise  this   idea   of\r\n\r\nprivately managed pension plan within the CPF framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our preliminary studies, scale is a\r\n\r\ncritical factor - I think Mrs Lim mentioned this too - to\r\n\r\nensure  low  cost.   The pension plan  design  should  be\r\n\r\nsimple  and  low risk.  This will attract  more  members,\r\n\r\nincluding those who are not investment savvy and  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to take unnecessary risks with their retirement\r\n\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other desirable features would be globally well-diversified portfolios and reliability of the pension\r\n\r\nplan  operators themselves so that CPF members  can  have\r\n\r\ngreater  confidence  that they will  be  able  to  return\r\n\r\nhigher  interest over the longer term.  Members would  be\r\n\r\nable  to invest their savings in both their Ordinary  and\r\n\r\nSpecial  Accounts  in approved privately-managed  pension\r\n\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board recognises that, under the current CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment Scheme, agent bank's charges add to  the  cost\r\n\r\nof  investing  and this will be taken into  account  when\r\n\r\ndesigning the pension plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also asked what will be the Board's role in\r\n\r\nthis  privately-managed pension plan.  This  is  an  area\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board is also studying, ie, whether the  Board\r\n\r\nshould  act  as  an  intermediary, or  be  more  actively\r\n\r\ninvolved.  In this connection, I overlook Dr Ong's  other\r\n\r\npoint  about the Board negotiating on behalf of  all  its\r\n\r\nmembers  to invest, or to place funds with fund  managers\r\n\r\nor  unit trusts.  I had addressed this question before in\r\n\r\nthis House.  This will put the Board in a moral hazard of\r\n\r\nhaving  to make the investment decision for and on behalf\r\n\r\nof  individual CPF members.  If the Board makes the right\r\n\r\ndecision,  of course, all will be well.  But, as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  all investments come with some risks.   And  if\r\n\r\nthe Board were to make a wrong decision, then I think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  held  accountable.   I  do  not  think  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable,  in  the way the CPF Board is  structured,  to\r\n\r\nimpose this responsibility on the Board.  We would prefer\r\n\r\nvery  much  that,  when it comes to  the  CPF  Investment\r\n\r\nScheme,   the  Board  would  act  as  a  facilitator   or\r\n\r\nexpeditor, rather than making the decision on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Steve Chia and also Mdm Ho Geok\r\n\r\nChoo  would like the CPF Board to consider releasing some\r\n\r\nof  the  CPF savings for workers, particularly those  who\r\n\r\nare  out  of job for quite some time and are in financial\r\n\r\nhardship.  We sympathise with all workers who are out  of\r\n\r\njob  and who are facing financial difficulties.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Minister  for Finance, in  his  Budget  Speech,\r\n\r\nannounced  measures  to  help particularly  lower  income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with additional rental rebates, service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  rebates and extension of the Utilities  Save\r\n\r\nrebates.   We have also granted the New Singapore  Shares\r\n\r\nand  Economic  Restructuring Shares.  All these  measures\r\n\r\nwill  provide some financial assistance to those who  are\r\n\r\nhard   hit   by   the   economic  downturn   and   rising\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we turn to the CPF savings for early relief,\r\n\r\nwe may be barking up the wrong tree, I would say.  We may\r\n\r\nbe  taking a wrong turn because, with the CPF,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nzero-sum game.  The more we take out today to spend,  the\r\n\r\nless we have for our retirement, the less we have to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  healthcare needs in our old age.  Even  if  it  were\r\n\r\nconsidered  as a loan that would have to be put  back  in\r\n\r\nfuture, we would have imposed greater difficulty  on  the\r\n\r\nworker  to  repay CPF savings that had been  consumed  in\r\n\r\nadvance.   It  would not help him to accumulate  what  is\r\n\r\nneeded.   Already  today there is concern  that,  at  our\r\n\r\nexisting contribution rates, a significant proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe workers would have difficulty accumulating sufficient\r\n\r\ncash savings when they finally retire.  So, if we open up\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  to  allow  people to use  it  to  meet  current\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties, we are  guaranteeing  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  have much less savings in their old age.  Yes,  we\r\n\r\nmay  be  alleviating their hardship now, but we  will  be\r\n\r\nimposing  massive difficulties for these people  and  for\r\n\r\nthe Government in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think it is unwise to do so. But, of course,\r\n\r\nas  we  have  always  said, if we  go  into  a  prolonged\r\n\r\nrecession,  eg,  a depression where we have  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands of Singaporeans who are completely out of  work\r\n\r\nand  there is no light at the end of the tunnel, then  we\r\n\r\nwill  have to consider.  It is the last option.   But  we\r\n\r\nare  not in such a parlous state yet.  So, we should  not\r\n\r\nrush into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also referred to a point which I\r\n\r\nthink Ms Irene Ng touched on earlier, ie, cutting of  the\r\n\r\nCPF  for  those who are aged 50-55 by freezing employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution  at  16%.  She asked,  if  the  economy\r\n\r\nshould  turn around, whether we would restore  it.   This\r\n\r\nwas  the  recommendation from the ERC  study,  to  reduce\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution rate for older workers, as  a\r\n\r\nway  to  moderate  and overcome rigidities  in  our  wage\r\n\r\nstructure, which presently is based on seniority, ie, the\r\n\r\nolder the worker is, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore he gets paid, regardless of whether his productivity\r\n\r\nhas  improved  year  by year.  And it  is  a  measure  to\r\n\r\nenhance the employability of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho asked whether it has created the result or\r\n\r\nnot, and how many older workers have been re-employed  as\r\n\r\na  result of this measure.  I would say that we have just\r\n\r\nintroduced it and it is too soon to give numbers  on  the\r\n\r\nimpact.  But what we know for a fact is that, through our\r\n\r\nlabour  market  survey - in fact, the  report  of  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  survey for 2002 was released last Friday  -  last\r\n\r\nyear,  72%  of those aged below 30 managed to secure  re-employment within six months after retrenchment, compared\r\n\r\nto  47%  for those aged 50 and over.  So, obviously,  re-employment  rate for the younger workers  is  far  better\r\n\r\nthan  that for those who are older.  We believe that part\r\n\r\nof  the  reason is the seniority-based wage scale,  which\r\n\r\nworks   against  the  interests  of  the  older  workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have made this adjustment to the employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution  for  the older  workers.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nrelated  just to the state of the economy and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that we should look at it as a temporary  measure.\r\n\r\nThe  idea  here  is  to  reduce the  mandatory  statutory\r\n\r\ncontribution of CPF for this older group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that does not mean that older workers are, in\r\n\r\nthe words of Mdm Ho, not value for money.  I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  she  is  suggesting that.  She is just  questioning\r\n\r\nwhether  this refinement implies that older  workers  are\r\n\r\nnot  value  for money.  Certainly not.  We want  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  get  jobs and stay in jobs.  It does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat,  because  we  have reduced their CPF,  they  cannot\r\n\r\ndeliver or perform.  In fact, I would encourage employers\r\n\r\nto  reward  the older workers who do well or  make  great\r\n\r\ncontributions to the companies through the variable  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.  There are many ways we can reward a good worker,\r\n\r\nboth young and old.  We can give them additional bonuses,\r\n\r\nwe  can  give them a higher performance bonus,  and  that\r\n\r\nwould  more  than make up for the loss in  the  statutory\r\n\r\ncontribution.    As   far  as  the  mandatory   statutory\r\n\r\ncontribution  is  concerned, what we  need  today  is  to\r\n\r\nreduce this cost item.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob was concerned with the impact of\r\n\r\nthe  changes on the increasing contribution rates to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  and  to Medisave  introduced  recently,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  those in the 50-55 age  group.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  that we are also concerned and we are  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  that this transfer  from  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount  to  the  Special Account and to  Medisave  would\r\n\r\nimpact adversely on those workers, particularly the older\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  still  servicing  mortgages  and  with\r\n\r\noutstanding  loans to repay.  That is why we  are  making\r\n\r\nthis  adjustment  gradually  over  several  years.    CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  who purchase their properties before 1st January\r\n\r\n2004, when these measures take effect, will be allowed to\r\n\r\ncontinue to have access to their Special Account to  help\r\n\r\ntop  up  the shortfall in their mortgage payments to  the\r\n\r\nextent  these payments are affected by the transfer.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, if they have a shortfall, we will  open  up\r\n\r\naccess  to the Special Account.  But, remember,  for  the\r\n\r\nvast majority of others, this refinement will immediately\r\n\r\nmean  that they are putting aside more money for Medisave\r\n\r\nand  their  Special  Account, which  is  their  long-term\r\n\r\nretirement  savings.  So, it has its advantage,  although\r\n\r\nwe are also able to accommodate the concerns of those who\r\n\r\nhave to service their mortgage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob also made this point about\r\n\r\nretirement  which  Mr Steve Chia touched  on  also.   Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah  Yacob is absolutely correct.  There is  a  gross\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  over  the  Retirement  Age  Act.    The\r\n\r\nRetirement  Age  Act does not compel workers  to  retire.\r\n\r\nThe  Retirement Age Act provides workers with  additional\r\n\r\nprotection  by  imposing on the employer a responsibility\r\n\r\nand  a  duty  to  employ  the person  until  the  minimal\r\n\r\nretirement  age.   We  must  remember  that  without  the\r\n\r\nRetirement  Age Act - I think it was before 1994  or  so,\r\n\r\nwhen  we did not have such a legislation - employers were\r\n\r\nretiring  their workers at the age of 55.  But  with  the\r\n\r\nRetirement Age Act in operation, the retirement age first\r\n\r\nwent  up  from  55  to 60, and then to 62.   So,  workers\r\n\r\ngained  another seven years of work as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\noperation of the Retirement Age Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Act does not say anywhere that a worker cannot  work\r\n\r\nbeyond the age of 62.  So, I think Mr Steve Chia is quite\r\n\r\nmistaken.  We have never said that you cannot work beyond\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 62.  We welcome everybody to work.   In  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, even those who are 62, if they are  doing\r\n\r\nwell,  can  contribute, are in good health  and  able  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their duties, I would expect that  they  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be re-employed even though they  can  retire\r\n\r\nand may already be retired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the connection between freeing\r\n\r\nup  car  loans and freeing up CPF for negotiation between\r\n\r\nolder workers and their employers.  As far as the CPF  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   while   we  should  reduce   the   statutory\r\n\r\ncontribution to provide a minimal level of protection,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think freeing up the CPF for open negotiation  is\r\n\r\nthe  way  to go.  What we have done, though, is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   gradually,  over  the  years,  reduced   the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution for the older workers, to reduce the  burden\r\n\r\non  employers and to make older workers more  employable.\r\n\r\nThat is why when we introduced the Retirement Age Act  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  retirement age from 55 to 60, we lowered  the\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution for those aged 55 and above,  and  they\r\n\r\nstill  continue to contribute much lower CPF than others.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  more  recently, we are now saying  that  for\r\n\r\nthose aged 50 to 55, the employers' CPF contribution rate\r\n\r\nwill  remain  at  16%.  I think that is the  way  to  go,\r\n\r\nrather than to open up a free-for-all in this sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee is worried about the homemakers who\r\n\r\nhave  been  left  out.  I am afraid that  while  we  want\r\n\r\neverybody   to  participate  in  the  CPF   system,   the\r\n\r\nhomemakers do have a difficulty, although we do  open  up\r\n\r\nthe CPF system for voluntary contributions.  So, there is\r\n\r\nreally  nothing to stop homemakers to have an account  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to CPF to build up a nest-egg for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt  is with this in mind that we have allowed the topping\r\n\r\nup  of  the Minimum Sum scheme under the CPF Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\nTop-up  Scheme to encourage CPF members to top  up  their\r\n\r\nspouse's  or  parents' CPF account through  transfers  of\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF savings into the latter's retirement  account,\r\n\r\nif they have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  than  twice the current Minimum Sum  in  their  own\r\n\r\naccount.   Members can also opt to use cash  top-ups  for\r\n\r\ntheir family members' CPF accounts, and the amount of the\r\n\r\ntop-up  in  the  CPF account will then  be  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nrecipient  by  monthly instalments from age  62  onwards.\r\n\r\nThe  recipient can also choose to buy a life annuity with\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum  Sum  which has been  topped  up  by  family\r\n\r\nmembers.  Spouses and children who contribute to the  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts of homemakers would be allowed tax relief on the\r\n\r\ncash amount that they contribute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, whenever the Government is able to\r\n\r\nprovide  for CPF top-ups or New Singapore Shares and  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring Shares,  for  instance,  we  have\r\n\r\nalways  required  co-payment and the  opening  of  a  CPF\r\n\r\naccount.   So, homemakers who do not have a CPF  account,\r\n\r\nwe would expect that their spouses would immediately open\r\n\r\nup  an  account and put in the co-payment,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can credit the contribution to this  account.\r\n\r\nOver  the  years,  we  hope that they  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  make  such contributions and,  in  the  good\r\n\r\nyears when the Government has surpluses, we will top  up,\r\n\r\nand this will help them to build up a small nest-egg.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we should legislate to ensure that, upon the\r\n\r\ndemise of the CPF member, a certain amount should  go  to\r\n\r\nthe spouse, this was an issue that was studied some years\r\n\r\nago,  and debated in this House.  The conclusion was that\r\n\r\nwe  should not interfere with the nomination system  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  by  and  large, most CPF  members  already  do\r\n\r\nnominate  their spouses and children as beneficiaries  of\r\n\r\ntheir CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the case about\r\n\r\n$41,000  and  the  car  loan  is  about  empowering   the\r\n\r\nindividual to be responsible for their decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on now to the role of NTUC. I speak\r\n\r\nwith  concern regarding the role of NTUC.  It is a highly\r\n\r\nrespected national institution, and receives funding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  taxpayers  for its work, through  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower.   Yet,  it  engages in politics,  and  publicly\r\n\r\ndeclares  its symbiotic relationship, not as a  principle\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government of the day, but with the  governing\r\n\r\npolitical  party,  the PAP.  This symbiotic  relationship\r\n\r\nimplies that, if the ruling PAP party were to lose  in  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election,  the NTUC will set  itself  up  to  go\r\n\r\nagainst  the  government of the day, and go  against  the\r\n\r\nexpress  wishes of the citizens in a democratic election.\r\n\r\nThis is terrible.  This is political subversion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of NTUC is to care for union workers, elect\r\n\r\ngood people who can represent them to negotiate with  the\r\n\r\nemployers   and  not  to  play  politics.   By   removing\r\n\r\ndemocratically elected leaders who are not with the  PAP,\r\n\r\nit  is  playing politics.  It is shameless  of  NTUC  for\r\n\r\nbeing  unprofessional in carrying out its charter.  Until\r\n\r\nit    repents   and   retracts   its   stated   symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship,  it  should  not continue  to  receive  any\r\n\r\nfinancial  aid from the Ministry of Manpower.  Also,  our\r\n\r\nmotion  on the role of GLCs last year, when it was agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the Government and GLCs should not set up companies\r\n\r\nthat can be found in the Yellow Pages, should be extended\r\n\r\nto  all  NTUC  cooperatives.  We have  NTUC  cooperatives\r\n\r\nrunning  coffeeshops, casket agents,  contractors,  print\r\n\r\nmedia,  sound  systems, entertainment business,  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment, etc, other than the more commonly known  and\r\n\r\naccepted NTUC Fairprice, Comfort taxi and bus services.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the last three mentioned, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  rein  in these business cooperatives before  they\r\n\r\nstart  killing our smaller local businesses and  increase\r\n\r\nthe unemployment figure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, first, I would like to\r\n\r\ncomment on what Mr Steve Chia had said.  I must say  that\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  disappointed in the  use  of  his  language\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  they are extremely  unparliamentary  - words like \"political subversion\", \"shameless\" and so on.\r\n\r\nI think those are highly ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, that is for me to\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir. I want to address the\r\n\r\npoint  that  Mr  Steve Chia said that  we  are  receiving\r\n\r\nfunding.   The  funding that we receive is very  nominal,\r\n\r\nbut  the  purpose of that funding is actually to  address\r\n\r\nthe  imbalance  between  the  employers  and  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement,  in terms of ensuring that the labour  movement\r\n\r\ncan  continue to employ professionals and credible people\r\n\r\nto serve the members and to serve the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the issue of the symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship, I think that is an open relationship.  That\r\n\r\nis  an  open secret, everybody knows about it.   And  the\r\n\r\nreason why we have a symbiotic relationship is also known\r\n\r\nto  everyone  and,  that is, we share  common  objectives\r\n\r\nbetween  the PAP and the NTUC. That objective is to  take\r\n\r\ncare  of the welfare of the people and workers.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the workers are not stupid.  Every worker  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement, right down to the shop floor level, gets\r\n\r\nto  elect his leaders once every three years.  And if  he\r\n\r\ndoes   not   agree,  he  does  not  think  the  symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship between NTUC and the PAP works, he will vote\r\n\r\nout  the  people  who  support this policy  on  symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship.   I  would like to  say  clearly  that  the\r\n\r\nsymbiotic   relationship  is  a  purely   objective   and\r\n\r\npractical  one which benefits the workers, and  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing sinister in that relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, I thought you are\r\n\r\ntalking on flexible wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir, I am coming to that\r\n\r\npoint.   Just  one more point and that is on  the  NTUC's\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in  cooperatives.   I want  to  stress  once\r\n\r\nagain that the NTUC Cooperatives gave out $52 million  in\r\n\r\nthe  year 2001/2002 to help workers who were affected  by\r\n\r\nthe   downturn  and,  therefore,  we  are  in  all  these\r\n\r\ncooperatives   and  business  ventures   for   a   social\r\n\r\nobjective,  and that is very clear.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  support  this call as flexibility  is  the  way\r\n\r\nahead in ensuring greater job stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help jumpstart the setting up of the monthly\r\n\r\nvariable  component, ERC has recommended that  companies,\r\n\r\nin  consultation with their unions, transfer a portion of\r\n\r\nthe  basic  wage  into  the MVC. This  recommendation  is\r\n\r\ntimely.   Up  to  2001,  only  4.8%  of  companies   have\r\n\r\nimplemented  MVC, although in the unionised  sector,  the\r\n\r\nfigure  is close to 34%.  Since the announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nERC's recommendations, I am glad to note that the banking\r\n\r\nsector and the Singapore Press Holdings have set aside  a\r\n\r\nportion of their basic wage to build up the MVC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call upon companies to do their part in\r\n\r\nimplementing the MVC.  Instead of cutting jobs,  this  is\r\n\r\ncertainly a better way to weather the uncertain  economic\r\n\r\ntimes.  With the MVC, we have another means to  make  our\r\n\r\nwage  system  more flexible to deal with future  business\r\n\r\ndownturns.  We have seen some promising moves  after  the\r\n\r\nERC's recommendation, but more can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies should not give examples, such as adopting\r\n\r\na  wait-and-see attitude or that it is too complicated to\r\n\r\nimplement.

It\r\n\r\nhas  been argued on many occasions, including Mdm Halimah\r\n\r\njust  now, that the need to revamp the present seniority-based  salary  system  is  fundamental  to  our  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring   efforts.   I  shall  not   repeat   these\r\n\r\narguments.   I  would just like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on the Ministry's plan to push ahead with  this\r\n\r\nrevamp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly variable component, for example, was\r\n\r\nfirst mooted some two years ago and progress to date,  as\r\n\r\nI understand it, has been painfully slow.  My own company\r\n\r\nhas  introduced the MVC, with some modifications, and the\r\n\r\nscheme  has  worked well. Today, about 5%  of  our  basic\r\n\r\nsalary is in the form of MVC.  We hope to achieve 10%  in\r\n\r\nanother year or two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we do not forge ahead with wage reform\r\n\r\nquickly,  I  am  afraid  that  it  will  become  a  major\r\n\r\nbottleneck   in   our  economic  restructuring   efforts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to urge the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nlaunching   a  major  campaign  this  year  to   persuade\r\n\r\nemployers and employees to do away with the fixed  annual\r\n\r\nincrements  and replace them with the reward system  that\r\n\r\nis  linked  to  productivity  and  performance.  We  must\r\n\r\nconvince the employers that this is good for them, as  it\r\n\r\nprovides   greater   flexibility   and   enhances   their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness. We must convince the employees that this\r\n\r\nis also good for them as it improves their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployability and helps them to save jobs in bad times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the residents who came to me for help to\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  are willing to take as much as a 50%  cut  in\r\n\r\ntheir  salary.  It would be unrealistic to hope for fixed\r\n\r\nincrements year after year.  The Ministry should draw  up\r\n\r\na  clear schedule with specific milestones and targets so\r\n\r\nthat we can monitor our progress and achievements in this\r\n\r\nrespect.  Other  than  providing  assistance,  will   the\r\n\r\nMinistry consider offering some carrots or incentives  to\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees to help them to overcome  their\r\n\r\ninertia?   For  example, if we want to promote  the  MVC,\r\n\r\ncould  we consider exempting certain portions of the  MVC\r\n\r\nfrom  tax  or CPF contribution for a limited  period  of,\r\n\r\nsay, 2-3 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is imperative that we do not waste valuable\r\n\r\ntime  in  reforming  our wage system.   A  flexible  wage\r\n\r\nsystem  tied  to  productivity rather than  seniority  is\r\n\r\nintegral  to our economic restructuring programme.  Given\r\n\r\nthe  weak job market, Sir, this is perhaps the best  time\r\n\r\nfor us to persuade people to accept it.  We must not miss\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, while all workers face\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  unemployment in an economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nthe   older   workers  bear  the  heaviest  brunt.    The\r\n\r\nstatistics clearly show that the older workers are likely\r\n\r\nto be retrenched during an economic downturn. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  employers  are  also less willing  to  hire  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Why is it so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key reason besides the seniority-based wage\r\n\r\nsystem is higher medical cost.  Employers are not willing\r\n\r\nto  incur higher medical costs associated with the  older\r\n\r\nworkers,   particularly  those  who  may  have  developed\r\n\r\nmedical  conditions  as  they change  jobs.  The  way  to\r\n\r\naddress  this  problem  is the portable  medical  benefit\r\n\r\nsystem (PMBS).  Under the PMBS, a worker can get portable\r\n\r\nand  continuous seamless medical coverage during his work\r\n\r\nlife  and  even  extend into his retirement.   Under  the\r\n\r\nscheme,  the  worker does not lose out  when  he  changes\r\n\r\njobs, even if he develops a medical condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, it will also not unnecessarily add  on\r\n\r\nto the cost to the employers as he gets older.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for PMBS to firmly take root, I see a\r\n\r\ncompulsory basic national insurance scheme as  the  clear\r\n\r\nway to go. The national scheme can be a multi-tiered one.\r\n\r\nIt  provides a compulsory basic level of coverage for all\r\n\r\nworkers  at the national level with affordable  premiums.\r\n\r\nThen,  it can allow optional enhancement coverage  to  be\r\n\r\nadded on later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many companies\r\n\r\nin  the  private sector have implemented PMBS.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso  ask  the  Ministry to step up its  drive  for  more\r\n\r\nwidespread implementation of PMBS in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> The Economic Review Committee has\r\n\r\ngiven  its support to the portable medical benefit scheme\r\n\r\nand I thoroughly welcome that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It advocated that for a start, at least, that it be\r\n\r\nleft to negotiations between companies and the unions and\r\n\r\nthere are also further studies to be done with respect to\r\n\r\nthe  portable  medical benefit scheme which  was  earlier\r\n\r\nproposed,  as  well  as a transferable medical  insurance\r\n\r\noption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst all these further studies are going on, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to share my views as to how I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee  a  portable medical benefit system taking shape  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Singaporeans.  I would like  it  to  be  a\r\n\r\nnational system covering all workers because that is  the\r\n\r\nbest  way to ensure that, as a worker moves between jobs,\r\n\r\nthere is true portability from employer to employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like it to be compulsory because that would\r\n\r\nensure  that we have the biggest possible base, and  that\r\n\r\nwould  keep  the  premiums payable  to  the  minimum  for\r\n\r\neverybody.   I would like it to be basic, so  as  not  to\r\n\r\npush   the   premiums  up  because  of  these  additional\r\n\r\nfeatures.   I would also like to see that the premium  of\r\n\r\nthe insurance under such a scheme be pre-funded so as  to\r\n\r\nequalise the premium across the system, and in this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway, remove one more hurdle from the employers having  to\r\n\r\nlook at older workers as being more expensive to them  in\r\n\r\nterms of medical cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say all these because I am really keen to see\r\n\r\nthe  portable medical benefit system implemented as  soon\r\n\r\nas possible in Singapore, because of the increasing churn\r\n\r\nin  our  labour  market. Every day of delay  exposes  our\r\n\r\nolder workers to greater risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I strongly support the\r\n\r\nERC's  recommendation on portable medical  benefits.   It\r\n\r\nhas  also  agreed  to raise the tax exemption  limit  for\r\n\r\nadditional  Medisave  contributions  for  private  sector\r\n\r\nemployees  from  1%  of an employee's monthly  salary  at\r\n\r\npresent  to  a lump sum of $1,500 per employee.   What  I\r\n\r\nmeant   is   that   Government   has   agreed   to   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  consider two refinements in order to  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  workers  to  opt into the scheme. Firstly,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that the Ministry of Manpower  or\r\n\r\nthe  Government consider providing incentives  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  to entice them into the PMBS.  This is important\r\n\r\nas  older workers would otherwise not find the scheme too\r\n\r\nattractive, as the PMBS is essentially a savings  scheme.\r\n\r\nFor older workers, because they have less number of years\r\n\r\nto  work before retirement, they may find the scheme less\r\n\r\nattractive as they would not be able to chalk  up  enough\r\n\r\nsavings  and  might  as well continue with  the  existing\r\n\r\nscheme.   Having any support from the Government in  this\r\n\r\nregard would therefore be very helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, I would also like to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   consider  pegging  the  additional   1%\r\n\r\ncontribution to be put into the Medisave account  to  the\r\n\r\nmedian wage.  This would ensure that lower income workers\r\n\r\nhave  a minimum floor.  Otherwise, the contribution  that\r\n\r\nthey  receive will not be meaningful enough to  encourage\r\n\r\nthem to adopt the portable medical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a worker earning $1,000, for instance, will get\r\n\r\n$10  a  month, whereas a worker earning $5,000  will  get\r\n\r\n$50.  These are basic salary floors.  Low income  workers\r\n\r\nwill have greater incentive to opt into the scheme as the\r\n\r\namount  will  be  sufficient  for  them  to  purchase  an\r\n\r\ninsurance  policy to cover their medical  needs.  In  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of such a floor, Sir, many may prefer to  remain\r\n\r\non  the  existing medical benefits scheme and this  would\r\n\r\naffect our effectiveness in adopting the PMBS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not present. Ms\r\n\r\nIrene Ng is also not present.  Mr Arthur Fong?\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, it has already\r\n\r\nbeen pointed out that our current unemployment rate is at\r\n\r\n4.8%  and  is  likely  to get worse in  view  of  several\r\n\r\nuncertainties, such as a war that may begin in  hours  or\r\n\r\nin  days, and its impact on the global economies.  In the\r\n\r\nevent  that war breaks out, the price of crude  oil  will\r\n\r\nskyrocket,  causing whatever economic  recovery  that  we\r\n\r\nhope to see towards the end of this year, retard.  It  is\r\n\r\nbad  enough  that we are experiencing high  unemployment,\r\n\r\nbut we also have to contend with structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nWhen we view structural unemployment against the backdrop\r\n\r\nof the profile of some 660,000 of our workforce having  a\r\n\r\nSecondary  Two  and lower education, and  getting  older,\r\n\r\nSir, we have a serious problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted we have taken steps to help our unemployed\r\n\r\nand  needy  through  these hard  times  with  a  slew  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  like  the  New  Singapore  Shares,  ERS  and\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes  availed  through  the  CDCs,  the\r\n\r\nproblems we are facing over the last two years or so have\r\n\r\nnever been experienced before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need an alternative that addresses both\r\n\r\nthese  problems, ie, create work opportunities such  that\r\n\r\nmore  people can be gainfully employed and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, provide family-friendly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noptions  for the existing workers.  Sir, as the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower has said, the Ministry cannot be the  magic\r\n\r\nbullet  to  solve unemployment.  It takes  two  hands  to\r\n\r\nclap.   Sir,  I  propose that we encourage  employers  to\r\n\r\nexplore  job  sharing  in  the workplace.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething new.  It has been successfully deployed in many\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries with problems similar to what we  are\r\n\r\nfacing now, with excellent results.  For example, the  US\r\n\r\nFederal Government actively promotes job sharing  in  the\r\n\r\ndifferent agencies.  It had recognised the need  to  come\r\n\r\nup  with a solution that took full advantage of personnel\r\n\r\nflexibility and resources available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that we implement a one-year trial.\r\n\r\nDuring  this  trial,  we  can  test  how  effective  this\r\n\r\nalternative  is  in  providing continued  employment  for\r\n\r\nthose  who will otherwise be retrenched.  This will allow\r\n\r\nsome  of  these workers to spend some time at  home  with\r\n\r\ntheir  children,  whilst still fulfilling  the  goals  of\r\n\r\ntheir  station.  Indeed, teams comprising  two  or  three\r\n\r\nworkers  can  undertake a single job.  Firstly,  it  will\r\n\r\nprovide  employment to a team of workers  who  would  now\r\n\r\nfulfil  the  functions of the job.   Secondly,  companies\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to retrain workers they would  otherwise\r\n\r\nlose,  as  job  sharing will allow flexibility  for  both\r\n\r\nemployees  and employers, or union-sponsored training  to\r\n\r\nupskilling or retrain outside of the work time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the results of job sharing in countries like\r\n\r\nthe  United States and UK show that this flexibility  has\r\n\r\naddressed  the growing problems of unemployment  and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, created family-friendly workplaces.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers  should be given this option so that we can  keep\r\n\r\nthem  gainfully  employed,  albeit  at  wages  which  are\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the number of hours they work.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, a family-friendly schedule would provide more\r\n\r\nflexible working arrangements for those workers who  want\r\n\r\nto  start  a family or have young children to  care  for.\r\n\r\nThis  may  even reduce dependency on domestic  maids  for\r\n\r\nsome  families,  as well as possible savings  from  child\r\n\r\nminding  services.   Job sharing can  present  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation for everyone concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Thank you, Sir, for exercising a\r\n\r\nsharp knife, otherwise we will all be delayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take up the point raised by Mr Steve\r\n\r\nChia.  I notice that he has just stepped in.  It is  very\r\n\r\ngood  for him to be here to hear the response.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nhe  has  already got the response to his  question.   Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah  has  adequately  rebutted  his  unjustified  and\r\n\r\ntotally  unfair  allegations against NTUC.   That  is  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  NTUC  and the PAP Government  working  in  a\r\n\r\nsymbiotic  relationship.  The reason  why  we  should  be\r\n\r\nsupporting the NTUC is quite obvious, and Mdm Halimah has\r\n\r\nmade  it  clear that the funding that NTUC receives  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government is a small part of its total budget.   It\r\n\r\nsignifies Government's desire and concern in supporting a\r\n\r\nstrong  and  vibrant labour movement so  that  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nthrough  its  affiliate unions, will be  able  to  better\r\n\r\nserve our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also questioned the benefits of having NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives.  Mdm Halimah has also addressed that point.\r\n\r\nI  just want to add that, in fact, NTUC cooperatives  are\r\n\r\ndoing  very  good work, serving members of the  NTUC  and\r\n\r\nworkers  in  general.   The  fact  that  they  have  NTUC\r\n\r\nFoodFair is a measure to help moderate the price of  food\r\n\r\nfor many of our workers.  They set benchmarks.  If you do\r\n\r\nnot  have such a cooperative in the market place  setting\r\n\r\nbenchmark  prices,  you could have  runaway  prices,  and\r\n\r\nworkers  will suffer.  So what does he prefer?   I  think\r\n\r\nhaving  the  NTUC  cooperative in the business  helps  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  price increases in many sectors,  and  they  do\r\n\r\nserve a useful purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Mr Gan Kim Yong both spoke about the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the monthly variable component.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  them  completely.  This is a very  important  step.\r\n\r\nThe ERC has recommended that we push harder on this.   We\r\n\r\nwill  promote the monthly variable component to companies\r\n\r\nand  we  will  move  away from the  seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nstructure,  which is too rigid.  We should be adopting  a\r\n\r\nmore  flexible  wage system, where the  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  could  form 10% or even  more  of  a  person's\r\n\r\nmonthly pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  will  allow companies to make adjustments,  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  business environment changes and, in  the  process,\r\n\r\nhelp  the companies survive and hopefully reduce the need\r\n\r\nfor retrenchments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly variable component was first suggested\r\n\r\nin 1999.  Yes, we have not made very dramatic progress in\r\n\r\nthe interim.  Overall, progress has been slow, except for\r\n\r\nthe  unionised companies, where in 2002, about 39% of the\r\n\r\nunionised companies have already implemented the  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component.  This is an increase from 29% in 2000\r\n\r\nand  34%  in 2001.  However, in the non-unionised sector,\r\n\r\nthe  implementation has been rather slow, only about 3.9%\r\n\r\nof  the  non-unionised companies are  using  the  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speed up the implementation of the monthly\r\n\r\nvariable   component,  ERC  has  recommended   that   for\r\n\r\ncompanies that have yet to implement the monthly variable\r\n\r\ncomponent,  or  where the monthly variable  component  is\r\n\r\npresently less than 2% of the worker's basic wage, up  to\r\n\r\n2%  of the basic wage can be set aside gradually to build\r\n\r\nup  the monthly variable component of about 10%.  This is\r\n\r\na   very  significant  recommendation,  because,  if  you\r\n\r\nremember,  in  1999  when the idea  of  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  was first mooted, the assumption was  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  use  future wage increases to build up  a  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component.  But since then we have gone  into  a\r\n\r\nroller-coaster  ride in the economy,  up  and  down,  and\r\n\r\nthere  has  been very little wage increase.   So  it  was\r\n\r\ndifficult to build up a monthly variable component.   But\r\n\r\nnow  that  we  have decided, in the course of  the  ERC's\r\n\r\ndiscussion, and we have also got the support of the union\r\n\r\nmovement to use the existing basic wage to help to  build\r\n\r\nup  a monthly variable component, I am confident that  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to move faster on this implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong asked whether there are clear\r\n\r\nschedules  to  achieve a widespread  application  of  the\r\n\r\nmonthly variable component.  As I said, with this change,\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to  move a lot faster than what we did  before.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult to now state a deadline when we would  want  to\r\n\r\nconvert   all   the   companies  onto  monthly   variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.  He also asked whether we could exempt certain\r\n\r\nportions  of the monthly variable component from  tax  or\r\n\r\nCPF  contributions.  It would be unwise to introduce more\r\n\r\ndistortions   in   this  sense.   The  monthly   variable\r\n\r\ncomponent should still remain as part of the wages of the\r\n\r\nworker, and that we should not treat it differently.  All\r\n\r\nit  means  is that it is a portion that could be adjusted\r\n\r\nin  times of need - easier to adjust - than to resort  to\r\n\r\nCPF reduction or other tax cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng Chee How\r\n\r\nspoke about the portable medical benefit system.  Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\nasked  how  many  companies have so far  implemented  the\r\n\r\nportable  medical benefit system.  From what I  have  got\r\n\r\nhere,  as  of  now, about 100 companies  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  had  already  implemented  the  portable  medical\r\n\r\nbenefit system.  Of course, Members will remember that in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the public sector, the civil  service  has\r\n\r\nalready implemented this portable medical benefit  system\r\n\r\nsince  1994 because many civil servants, especially those\r\n\r\nwho were recruited post-1994 were placed on what is known\r\n\r\nas the Medisave-cum-Outpatient Scheme, and that is a form\r\n\r\nof portable medical benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of this portable medical benefit system is\r\n\r\nthat,  in  lieu of an employer-provided medical  benefit,\r\n\r\nthe  employer  will make additional contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nemployee's Medisave every month, which will allow him  to\r\n\r\npurchase medical insurance to cover his in-patient needs.\r\n\r\nThe  ERC also recommended an alternative which is  called\r\n\r\ntransferable medical insurance scheme, whereby  employers\r\n\r\nwill sponsor group insurance for the employees.  But this\r\n\r\ngroup   insurance  will  have  a  special   feature,   an\r\n\r\nenhancement whereby even if the employee is retrenched or\r\n\r\nlaid off, the coverage will continue for at least another\r\n\r\nyear,  as  long  as the employee is able to  continue  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  premium  on  his  own.   As  far   as   the\r\n\r\ntransferable medical insurance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  is  concerned, the insurance industry is  working\r\n\r\nwith  my  Ministry  and other agencies  to  develop  this\r\n\r\nproduct to meet the needs of the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the portable medical benefit\r\n\r\nsystem and the transferable medical insurance scheme,  as\r\n\r\nMdm  Halimah  has  pointed out, will be  voluntary.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided to encourage employers  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  route, instead of remaining with the present system\r\n\r\nof  employer-provided medical benefit.  The way  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  it  is  to adjust or to refine the tax system  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  employers' medical expenses.  From 1st  April\r\n\r\n2004,  employers who implement either of the two portable\r\n\r\nmedical benefit systems will continue to enjoy a  2%  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  on  their  expenses, in other  words,  on  the\r\n\r\ncontribution to Medisave or on their contribution to  the\r\n\r\ntransferable  medical  insurance scheme,  and  any  other\r\n\r\nallowable  outpatient expenses.  However,  employers  who\r\n\r\nchoose to remain status quo, in other words, do not  join\r\n\r\nany  of these schemes, do not adopt any of these schemes,\r\n\r\nand  just  continue  to offer to their employees  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits,  they would only be allowed to make a deduction\r\n\r\nof  1%  for their expenses.  We hope that, with this  tax\r\n\r\nchange, more employers will shift to the portable medical\r\n\r\nbenefit scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked whether we should have a\r\n\r\nfloor   with   regard  to  the  additional  1%   Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution.  I agree with her.  It is a concern because\r\n\r\nif  you say 1% and you earn $600, then it is only $6.  It\r\n\r\nis  very  low.  So what should we do?  We should  provide\r\n\r\nfor a minimum amount that allows them to buy a reasonable\r\n\r\ninsurance  coverage.   These are  details  that  will  be\r\n\r\nworked  out.   But you will note that in making  the  tax\r\n\r\nrefinements,  the  Minister for  Finance  has  generously\r\n\r\nagreed  not  to fix it at 1%, but at a cap  of  $1,500  a\r\n\r\nyear.   With the $1,500 tax deductible cap, the employers\r\n\r\nwill  find  it  much easier to adopt  a  floor  wage  for\r\n\r\ncontribution to Medisave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Heng Chee How mentioned the\r\n\r\nneed for a basic medical insurance scheme that will cover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  workers.   We already do have such a  basic  medical\r\n\r\ninsurance  scheme operated under MediShield  by  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  on  behalf of the Ministry of Health.  Already,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  about  90% of our workers are  covered  under\r\n\r\nMediShield.   So,  once  we  move  towards  the  portable\r\n\r\nmedical benefit system, there is an opportunity for us to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  MediShield coverage.  Of  course,  premiums\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be adjusted accordingly.   But  with  the\r\n\r\nadditional Medisave contribution made by the employers, I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  most  employees would be able  to  afford  this\r\n\r\nenhanced MediShield scheme.  If we have 90% or so of  our\r\n\r\nemployees  covered by it, that would meet the requirement\r\n\r\nof   having  a  broad-based  nation-wide  basic   medical\r\n\r\ninsurance to cover all our employees.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong suggested job sharing as an option to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  this present economic downturn  and  hardship\r\n\r\nimposed by the lack of employment opportunities.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.  Job sharing is one way.  Some companies  have\r\n\r\nimplemented such ideas of job sharing and part-time work.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  new.   We have actually actively  encouraged\r\n\r\ncompanies  to do so.  We have a group in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower which advises companies that have indicated that\r\n\r\nthey  may  have to downsize by retrenchment, to  look  at\r\n\r\nalternatives.  One alternative is to put workers on part-time  employment  instead  of outright  retrenchment.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  some hospitals have already  introduced\r\n\r\njob-sharing.   In fact, NTUC Fairprice is  another  major\r\n\r\nemployer who offers part-time or job sharing options  for\r\n\r\npeople who want to work in the supermarket retail sector.\r\n\r\nSo,  this practice is already in existence.  If need  be,\r\n\r\nwe  will, of course, publicise  it more widely,  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  employers are aware of the opportunities  available\r\n\r\nto  have  workers  who can come in on a part-time  basis,\r\n\r\nmaybe help them to meet their demand for workers and yet,\r\n\r\nat the same time, keep costs manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed the points raised by\r\n\r\nthe Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  Can the Minister clarify\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  nominal funding is no funding at all or still  a\r\n\r\nsmall bit of funding?  By his words, are GLCs not doing a\r\n\r\ngood  job too?  So, that is why the Yellow Pages rule  is\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the  GLCs and not on the NTUC  cooperatives,\r\n\r\nbecause the NTUC cooperatives are doing a good job.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the numbers\r\n\r\nwith  me  as to how much exactly we provide to NTUC  each\r\n\r\nyear  by  way  of funding, but the number  is  not  large\r\n\r\ncompared  to  NTUC's  annual  budget.   But  it   is   an\r\n\r\nimportant,   and  not  insignificant,  gesture   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  support  to  our  workers'  movement.   Our\r\n\r\nlabour movement plays a very important part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, let me give Mr Chia an\r\n\r\nexample.  In  our negotiations for Free Trade  Agreements\r\n\r\nwith  many countries, the issue of labour standards comes\r\n\r\nup  all the time.  In order to secure agreement, we  have\r\n\r\nto  show  to  our  counter party that we  have  excellent\r\n\r\nlabour standards.  And what better way to show them  than\r\n\r\nto  have  our  NTUC, the leaders of our labour  movement,\r\n\r\nstand  up and speak to explain to our counter party that,\r\n\r\nyes,  in  fact,  in Singapore, high labour standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained,   and  this  Government  is   serious   about\r\n\r\nupholding the rights and interests of workers.  For  that\r\n\r\nlittle  investment of financial assistance  to  NTUC,  we\r\n\r\nhave  developed  a  group  that  is  very  capable,  very\r\n\r\narticulate and able to explain the situation to important\r\n\r\nparties  whom  we  are negotiating Free Trade  Agreements\r\n\r\nwith.   What is wrong with it?  I think it is the essence\r\n\r\nof  the  symbiotic relationship.  We help each other  and\r\n\r\nthey   support  our  efforts  to  bring  in   even   more\r\n\r\ninvestments,   so  that  our  workers  will   have   more\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I\r\n\r\nwas  driving along a narrow two-lane two-way traffic road\r\n\r\nwhere  one  of the lanes was closed for road  works.   To\r\n\r\ncontrol  the two-way traffic, I saw a worker  putting  up\r\n\r\ntwo   mobile  traffic  lights.   He  could  control   the\r\n\r\ndirection  single-handedly.  But here  in  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  two workers on each side holding a stop-and-go sign\r\n\r\nat each end.  There is  a third worker coordinating.  So,\r\n\r\naltogether, there are three workers doing the job.   This\r\n\r\nis  a  very  simple example of how simple technology  can\r\n\r\nactually improve productivity and how it shows that  more\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  to  reduce the dependence  on  low-skilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the well-being of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  This House has debated previously the plight of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers in Singapore.  I have asked the Minister\r\n\r\nquestions  on  housing for foreign  workers  and  actions\r\n\r\ntaken  against  errant employers who do not  pay  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  Minister has assured the House  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will monitor the situation closely and  it  will\r\n\r\ntake errant employers to task.  I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto give us an update.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to ask the Minister about the problem of\r\n\r\nmaid  abuse today.  Although maid abuses get very  widely\r\n\r\nreported in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe media, often getting front-page news, I know that the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of Singaporeans, however, are  responsible\r\n\r\nones and who do not ill treat their domestic maids.   Can\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  provide  statistics  on  the  number   of\r\n\r\nemployers involved in maid abuse cases against the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of domestic maids in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, again, I must stress that each\r\n\r\ncase of maid abuse is one case too many.  I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister on the outcome of such initiative,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  Ministry's plan to do more to address  the\r\n\r\nproblem of maid abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister two additional\r\n\r\nrelated questions on employment pass holders.  First, how\r\n\r\nmany  employment  pass  holders  were  affected  by   the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn?  Second, what is the  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nchange  of  the minimum salary from $2,000 to $2,500  for\r\n\r\nemployment  pass  holders?  Does it  help  to  level  the\r\n\r\nplaying  field for our young graduates vis-a-vis  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, over the last few days, we\r\n\r\nhave heard a number of comments that are very critical of\r\n\r\nSingapore workers.  In fact, I think the tendency is  for\r\n\r\nus to be too critical of Singapore workers.  I fear, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  if  we continue to criticise Singaporeans  all  the\r\n\r\ntime,  this  will be counter productive.  In  this  House\r\n\r\nalone,  over  the last few days of debate, I  have  heard\r\n\r\nabout  the need for mindset change among Singaporeans  so\r\n\r\nmany  times that I think if we were to patent  the  words\r\n\r\n\"mindset change\", we will probably make  a lot of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate about Singaporean workers is similar to\r\n\r\nwhat  we  had some years ago about Singaporeans  who  job\r\n\r\nhop.   That debate went on for some time until it  became\r\n\r\nclear  that it was not doing Singapore any good, and  may\r\n\r\neven  affect  investors' perceptions about  our  workers.\r\n\r\nSir,  if,  indeed,  our  workers  have  such  a  terrible\r\n\r\nmindset,  they  will  not be ranked  as  the  number  one\r\n\r\nworkforce  by  BERI.  Surely, that counts for  something.\r\n\r\nSo  I  do ask that when we talk about mindset change,  we\r\n\r\nspare a thought for the effect this will have on investor\r\n\r\nconfidence.  I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaying  this  because I came across  a  newspaper  report\r\n\r\nwhere  even a foreign MD was making a comparison  between\r\n\r\nlocal  and foreign workers, and repeating the same mantra\r\n\r\nabout  negative traits of local workers.  If  indeed  our\r\n\r\nworkers have such serious mindset problems, then we  will\r\n\r\nnever  have made the leap from a third world to  a  first\r\n\r\nworld  country  within  a  record  period  of  just  four\r\n\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes, I wonder whether mindset problems\r\n\r\nhave  become  a  convenient excuse to  cover  other  more\r\n\r\nsignificant underlying issues that need to be  addressed.\r\n\r\nOne  that  comes to mind is job redesign.  Our  workforce\r\n\r\nhas  grown  older, but if the jobs that our  workers  are\r\n\r\nasked  to do have not changed, if it still requires  them\r\n\r\nto  stand up to eight to 10 hours a day, or there are  no\r\n\r\nequipment  to help move heavy objects so that  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  use  their physical strength, over time,  these\r\n\r\njobs  will be too onerous for them.  Even in the  service\r\n\r\nsector,  there  are  jobs which over time  can  be  quite\r\n\r\nonerous  for older workers.  For example, the  job  of  a\r\n\r\nchambermaid  which requires heavy beds to be lifted  when\r\n\r\nbedsheets  are  changed.  A 30-year old can  do  the  job\r\n\r\neasily.   But a 55-year old may find it harder.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nneed to have a closer look at this issue of job redesign.\r\n\r\nAnd I call upon MOM to give greater priority to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another problem is, of course, pay. Many of\r\n\r\nthese  jobs  pay  low salaries, even  with  training  and\r\n\r\nattempts  to upgrade cleaning jobs through training,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the starting pay of $700 to $800 is not  likely\r\n\r\nto  excite  Singaporeans.  I am not sure how far  we  can\r\n\r\nfurther  upgrade  cleaning jobs so that  we  can  improve\r\n\r\nproductivity  and therefore our workers can  earn  better\r\n\r\nwages.  But I am sure there are other jobs where this can\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, in the hotel industry, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  different persons do the cashiering,  ordering\r\n\r\nand table cleaning.  But, today, all this can be done  by\r\n\r\none  person  - multi-skilling, multi-tasking and  working\r\n\r\nacross functions are the norms\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnow.    And  more  can  be  done  so  that  with   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity,  pay can go up.  Sir, the third  underlying\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you wind up your\r\n\r\nspeech now, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> The third underlying problem is\r\n\r\nthe  image of some jobs.  Certainly, there is a  need  to\r\n\r\nchange  image,  for  example, jobs in the  shipyards  are\r\n\r\nrelatively  safe  and you do not hear of  people  getting\r\n\r\ninjured or killed every day.  But nothing much is done to\r\n\r\ncounter the negative impression that jobs there are  very\r\n\r\nunsafe.   So Singaporeans sometimes may not want to  work\r\n\r\nthere.   Sir, I would like to urge MOM to seriously  look\r\n\r\ninto these underlying issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to urge you to stop your\r\n\r\nspeech too.  Next speaker, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I support Mdm Halimah's\r\n\r\npoint  about  not just the workers need to  change  their\r\n\r\nmindset  but,  at  the  same time,  would  like  to  urge\r\n\r\nemployers to also change their mindset.  The first  issue\r\n\r\nI  would  like to raise is with regard to the retail  and\r\n\r\nhospitality sectors where most Singaporeans are  shunning\r\n\r\nthese sectors.  I support that we take in foreign workers\r\n\r\nand  talents  where  we are lacking  in  the  skills  and\r\n\r\nexpertise,  or we cannot find Singaporeans to fill  these\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the foreign workers or talents compare\r\n\r\nbetter  than  our locals and make up for  what  we  lack,\r\n\r\nthere is no good reason for us to reject them.  But where\r\n\r\njobs  can be filled by Singaporeans, we must continue  to\r\n\r\neducate  Singaporeans to be less picky and  employers  to\r\n\r\nadopt  flexibility  in managing the needs  of  the  local\r\n\r\nworking population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would like to support what Mr Arthur Fong has\r\n\r\nsaid earlier regarding job sharing.  I came across a case\r\n\r\nrecently.  An Indian beauty salon owner came to apply for\r\n\r\na  work  permit for an Indian national trained in  beauty\r\n\r\ntherapy.  The reason is that the foreign talent  will  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  work on weekends, long hours, and  accept  a\r\n\r\nlower salary.  I had to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconvince the owner to explore job sharing which may  make\r\n\r\nit  easier for him than to look for a local who needs  to\r\n\r\nlook for a job with normal work hours because of domestic\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers, as Mdm Halimah has said, have\r\n\r\ncarried  articles on the attitude of Singaporeans leading\r\n\r\nto  eating  houses and the like, preferring  to  opt  for\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  The issues I would like to raise  are:\r\n\r\none, it would appear that the terms and conditions of the\r\n\r\njob  offered  have  made  this  job  less  attractive  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  I would like to ask MOM whether  there  is\r\n\r\nany  educational programme for employers with  regard  to\r\n\r\nmindset   change  on  work  flexibility  and  terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions of work for local Singaporeans in this sector.\r\n\r\nTwo,   in   order  to  encourage  businesses  to   engage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in jobs traditionally shunned in restaurants\r\n\r\nand  hotels,  what  schemes does  the  Ministry  have  to\r\n\r\nencourage more Singaporeans to join these sectors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second issue concerns the recent change on foreign\r\n\r\nworkers policy in the construction industry.  The primary\r\n\r\nconsideration  in this change is to allow  multi-skilling\r\n\r\nto  qualify for lower levy and to encourage businesses to\r\n\r\nemploy  Singaporeans.  Now, it is important that we  also\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans  to  be  multi-skilled   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector.  This is survival for  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  the  construction industry, otherwise they  may  find\r\n\r\nthemselves levelling down, while the foreign construction\r\n\r\nworkers  will  level  up with multi-skills  training  and\r\n\r\ntasking.  My questions are: how does the Ministry propose\r\n\r\nto  encourage  more Singaporeans to take up  multi-skills\r\n\r\ntraining in the construction industry?  I would also like\r\n\r\nto  know  why  the  recent policy on  the  rationale  and\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  the foreign construction  workers  is  not\r\n\r\nextended  to  the  other sectors where there  is  a  high\r\n\r\ndemand for foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue, it concerns the lowering of\r\n\r\nincome tax for foreign talents.  Sir, one reason why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  lowered  the personal  tax  rate  is  to\r\n\r\nattract\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  talents into the country.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether there is sufficient reason to lower\r\n\r\nthe  income tax rate for this group of people, given that\r\n\r\nthe  personal  income tax in this country is considerably\r\n\r\nlower  than  in other parts of the developed world.   How\r\n\r\nmuch lower should we cut our personal income tax rate  in\r\n\r\norder to attract foreign talents?  Are there other better\r\n\r\nways to appeal to them besides undertaking a measure that\r\n\r\nmay not be effective?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\ndeclare  my interest as the CEO of Hyflux Limited.   Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  do  need  to focus on creating jobs for  the  locals.\r\n\r\nHowever, this should not be at the expense of enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also protect the interests of some promising\r\n\r\nSMEs.  One of the sunrise sectors, for example, is in the\r\n\r\nenvironmental technology sector.  Some of these companies\r\n\r\nrequire   workers   with   specific   skills,   such   as\r\n\r\nmanufacturing of membranes, and assisting in research and\r\n\r\npilot  plant  trials  for  reclamation  of  waste  water.\r\n\r\nLocals with such skills are very hard to find because the\r\n\r\ndemand   for   membrane-based  treatment  facilities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore has taken a quantum jump only in recent  years.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed in grooming a group of people in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  in  that  case  this might  become  a  very  viable\r\n\r\nalternative for Singapore being an environmental hub  for\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers with the necessary skills for such\r\n\r\njobs often do not have professional paper qualifications.\r\n\r\nInstead, they acquire their skills through years  of  on-the-job  training  and experiences in overseas  projects.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the Ministry of Manpower does not have the\r\n\r\nappropriate  classification for this  group  of  workers.\r\n\r\nHence, this group of workers is normally brought in under\r\n\r\nthe  classification of construction industry and they are\r\n\r\nsubject  to rules relating to this classification,  which\r\n\r\ncan be quite irrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from next year, MOM requires new foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to obtain two trade certificates before they  can\r\n\r\nqualify for lower levy.  Since there is no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappropriate  classification for  this  group  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers, and for the fact that they are brought in  under\r\n\r\nthe  classification of construction industry,  the  trade\r\n\r\ncertificate  must be from construction related  subjects,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  tiling, water proofing, painting, piling,  etc.\r\n\r\nWhile such skills are necessary for construction workers,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not relevant to this group of skilled workers.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, the workers would choose courses, such  as\r\n\r\npainting   or   brick  laying,  just  to   satisfy   this\r\n\r\nrequirement, though they have no need for such a skill in\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.   And  companies would also  have  to  incur\r\n\r\nunnecessary business cost, just to qualify for lower levy\r\n\r\nfor the renewal of permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that it is difficult for institutions to\r\n\r\nstructure specific courses to suit the needs of  a  small\r\n\r\nniche market.  In this regard, I want to ask if MOM would\r\n\r\naccept  on-the-job training in place of  the  set  skills\r\n\r\ntest  for  such qualification.  Of course, one may  argue\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  train  our  local  workers,  instead   of\r\n\r\ndepending on foreign workers.  Yes, we can.  But changing\r\n\r\nthe  mindset  of the locals will take time  and  business\r\n\r\ncannot wait.  Such skills also need time to develop.   If\r\n\r\nthese  businesses cannot survive because  of  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nworkers  here,  these companies will  relocate  and  more\r\n\r\nSingaporean jobs will be lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would like to further ask if\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Manpower would review the foreign workers\r\n\r\nclassification and terms of engagement so as to keep pace\r\n\r\nwith changing times and industrial needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, there are genuine\r\n\r\ninternational talents and there are skilled and unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  Except for the high bonuses  paid  for\r\n\r\ntheir early departures, our population generally has less\r\n\r\nobjection  to bringing in good international talents,  if\r\n\r\nit  is  to  help build our economy, nor do they have  any\r\n\r\nobjection  to bring in the unskilled workers  to  do  the\r\n\r\njobs that most Singaporeans do not want to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most working citizens are having objections\r\n\r\nto the entry of lower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaid skilled foreign workers.  The Government should make\r\n\r\nan  effort to differentiate skilled foreign workers  more\r\n\r\nclearly instead of lumping them together as international\r\n\r\ntalents, for they are not.  These skilled foreign workers\r\n\r\nare  just  workers on a lower pay and come in to  compete\r\n\r\nwith  the  majority  of our Singapore workers  for  their\r\n\r\njobs.  In view of the high level of unemployment that  we\r\n\r\nhave,  the  Government must clearly  justify  why  it  is\r\n\r\nadvertising  aggressively  overseas  for  these   skilled\r\n\r\nforeign  workers to come in and compete with our citizens\r\n\r\nand allowing them to displace our workers in the process.\r\n\r\nWill   the   Government  allow  and   encourage   foreign\r\n\r\npoliticians, like Bill Clinton, to come and compete  with\r\n\r\nthem for their political jobs?  I do not think so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any way, I hope that the Minister can address the\r\n\r\nconcerns   of  working  Singaporeans  on  the  aggressive\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  skilled  foreign  workers  to  come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   To reply to Minister Ng, it is  not  closing\r\n\r\nour  markets  to  foreign workers, but about  proactively\r\n\r\nrecruiting skilled foreign workers, or talents  overseas,\r\n\r\nto come here and compete with our locals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, there are about 140,000 foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers employed in Singapore.  Most come  from\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries and have contributed significantly\r\n\r\nto   Singapore's  growth  and  prosperity.   Without  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers, it will be difficult for  many\r\n\r\nSingapore women to work, and the economy will suffer as a\r\n\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign domestic workers, work in Singapore is\r\n\r\nattractive  as the remittances that they send  home  help\r\n\r\ntheir  families  and  contribute significantly  to  their\r\n\r\ncountry's  GDP.   According to ILO's  estimates,  migrant\r\n\r\nworkers'   remittances  represent  the   second   largest\r\n\r\ninternational  monetary  trade  flow,  exceeded  only  by\r\n\r\npetroleum.   But  US$600  million flow  through  official\r\n\r\nchannels  and another US$15 million in various unreported\r\n\r\nways.   So  foreign  domestic workers  serve  a  mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial need both for the sending country as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe receiving country, such as Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have asked before whether there is a need for\r\n\r\nsome  regulatory  framework for foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nas,  unlike  other foreign workers, they are not  covered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Employment Act.  I must stress  that  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic   workers  are  not  singled  out  for  specific\r\n\r\ntreatment.   In  fact,  all domestic  workers,  including\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  are excluded from the  scope  of  the  Act\r\n\r\nprimarily because of the nature of their work.  Hence,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask whether there are any  proposals  to\r\n\r\nreview  our current position on foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nbecause   foreign  domestic  workers  tend  to  be   more\r\n\r\nvulnerable  than  other  foreign workers,  as  they  work\r\n\r\nwithin  the  confines of the home and are  more  isolated\r\n\r\ncompared  to  other foreign workers.  Is it  possible  to\r\n\r\nconsider providing some legal minimum standards for  them\r\n\r\nand  a  mechanism  for  them  to  legally  enforce  these\r\n\r\nstandards?   For example, the standards can cover  things\r\n\r\nlike  rest  days, payment of salary, sick day and  annual\r\n\r\nleave,  some  of  the very basic and core  benefits.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  enforce these standards, the foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  can be allowed access to MOM's labour courts  to\r\n\r\nmake claims and to enforce these standards.  In this way,\r\n\r\nthey  have  access to a speedy and inexpensive method  of\r\n\r\ndealing with their claims.  I am aware that MOM has  done\r\n\r\nquite  a  lot  to help foreign domestic workers.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  scope  for us  to  further  refine  our\r\n\r\nexisting rules to better protect them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you, for allowing me to speak on this  topic.   As\r\n\r\nemployers  of  domestic workers, they pay  about  $345  a\r\n\r\nmonth  to  the Ministry of Manpower as levy.   There  are\r\n\r\nabout 140,000 domestic workers today and this amounts  to\r\n\r\nabout  $47 million a month in levy.  I am here  today  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Ministry  of  Manpower to  consider  whether  a\r\n\r\nportion  of  this levy could be used for three  purposes.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  domestic workers do fall ill.   This  is  apart\r\n\r\nfrom the accident insurance policy that employers do take\r\n\r\nout.  A check with doctors in private practice as well as\r\n\r\nhospitals does show that at least one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndomestic  worker needs hospitalisation and  sometimes  is\r\n\r\nwhisked away by employers who do not want to pay for  the\r\n\r\nhospitalisation.   Is it possible then  perhaps  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a premium with some insurance company to take  care\r\n\r\nof hospitalisation for certain illnesses?\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another use of the levy that I am asking\r\n\r\nis  whether it is possible to consider a certain  portion\r\n\r\nto  be  set  aside,  such that domestic  workers  can  be\r\n\r\ntrained in basic skills.  This can be part of the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Programme.  A check shows that some  of  the\r\n\r\ncourses that domestic workers take on their days off cost\r\n\r\nabout  $60-120 for 12 sessions of dress-making,  etc,  or\r\n\r\neven using home appliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, can a portion of this levy be set aside in\r\n\r\na modified scheme, such that when the domestic workers go\r\n\r\nhome  they  get some little substantial amount  of  money\r\n\r\nover  the months accumulated that they can take home  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  own course of living back in  their  home\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I think with $345 - I do not\r\n\r\nknow  what  the  calculations can be, if we  are  serious\r\n\r\nabout  these three schemes - if let us, say, we  were  to\r\n\r\nkeep aside $45, that amounts to $6 million a month to  be\r\n\r\nkept  aside  for things that can benefit and improve  the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between  the  domestic  worker   and   the\r\n\r\nemployer.  As such, I would also like to ask the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower  if it is possible to know what  exactly  is\r\n\r\nthis  amount of almost $50 million per month put  to.   I\r\n\r\nhave looked through the Budget Book, and I grant that  it\r\n\r\nis  used  to  cover operational costs, the  investigation\r\n\r\nprocesses  for  certain cases, and  to  maintain  a  very\r\n\r\nefficient Work Permit Department.  But it would  be  good\r\n\r\nto know where else the money goes to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang Mong Seng is not present.

This is  primarily due to the efforts put\r\n\r\nin by the Ministry of Manpower, unions and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the number is falling, each case is still one\r\n\r\ncase  too many.  We must do whatever we can to bring down\r\n\r\nthe  figure even further.  It saddens me to see that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of fatal accidents and that of accidents which led\r\n\r\nto permanent disability and injuries to hands and fingers\r\n\r\nof  the  workers  over  the  past  three  years  has  not\r\n\r\nimproved.  On the average, there are about 60 fatal cases\r\n\r\nper year, of which 60% occurs in the construction sector.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  fatal  cases in the construction  sector  have\r\n\r\nincreased despite the industrial slowdown.  In  the  past\r\n\r\nfive  years, there were, on average, about 100  accidents\r\n\r\nper  year, which led to permanent disability. Out of this\r\n\r\nnumber,  35  were from the construction industry  and  30\r\n\r\nfrom  the metal industry.  Has the Ministry any plans  to\r\n\r\nstep up efforts in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the statistics in the past few years, two\r\n\r\ntrends are visible.  The most common type of occupational\r\n\r\ndisease  is  noise-induced deafness, and the most  common\r\n\r\ntype  of  industrial accident involves  hand  and  finger\r\n\r\ninjuries.   In  fact, if we add them  up  together,  they\r\n\r\naccount for 45% of the total. If something can be done on\r\n\r\nthese two areas, our industrial safety record could  have\r\n\r\nbeen much better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to statistics, about 70% of accidents\r\n\r\nwere caused by the following three factors:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Fall from high places;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Struck by falling objects; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stepping on or hit by stationary objects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to focus on these key causes and\r\n\r\nrecommend effective measures to prevent such incidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that\r\n\r\nwe  are rather behind time on this cut since Members  are\r\n\r\nmaking such long speeches.  Mdm Halimah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, on worker protection, I\r\n\r\nhave a specific concern.  It seems to be obvious that the\r\n\r\nemployment structure is changing very rapidly.  There are\r\n\r\nmore  part-time,  temporary and casual jobs.   In  short,\r\n\r\njobs have become more short-term.  But if we look at  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, most of the benefits are tied  to  length\r\n\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is our sick leave, where we have to\r\n\r\nwork  for six months before we are entitled to paid  sick\r\n\r\nleave.    Unionised   workers  are  covered   under   the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements, where benefits are extended  from\r\n\r\nthe first day of work, but non-unionised workers have  to\r\n\r\ndepend on the discretion of the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case in point is the retrenchment benefits,\r\n\r\nwhere  we have to work for three years before we can  ask\r\n\r\nfor the benefits.  Even then, we will be paid only if the\r\n\r\nbenefit   is  stipulated  in  the  contract  of  service,\r\n\r\notherwise  payment  will  be at  the  discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  For unionised workers, this is not a  problem,\r\n\r\nas  the  union  will negotiate on behalf of the  workers,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether this is stipulated in the  contract\r\n\r\nof  employment or the collective agreement.  But  workers\r\n\r\nwho are not unionised are not so protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the changes that are taking place, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Ministry whether it considers  it\r\n\r\nfeasible at this point of time to consider legislating  a\r\n\r\nminimum   quantum  of  retrenchment  benefits   for   all\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.  I would like to  request  that  MOM\r\n\r\nlook  into  this  issue  to ensure  that  our  employment\r\n\r\nlegislation  keeps  in tandem with  the  changes  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic and employment structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, our labour standards are good and up\r\n\r\nto  par with international standards.  As a member of the\r\n\r\nILO  governing  body, I am proud of  our  standards  and,\r\n\r\nhence,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  whether  our\r\n\r\nGovernment would consider ratifying more ILO conventions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Steve Chia asked whether we would\r\n\r\nallow foreigners to come to Singapore to compete with  us\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical office.  We indeed do.  There are Mr Khaw  Boon\r\n\r\nWan, Ms Irene Ng and Ms Olivia Lum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of speakers have alluded to our\r\n\r\nforeign  worker policies, and I think it is important  to\r\n\r\naddress  it,  because it is a fundamental pillar  of  our\r\n\r\nlabour market policies.  Many of the Members' comments  - and these are comments from Mr Steve Chia and Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  - assume that the mathematical model for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers and Singaporeans is one of displacement,  ie,  if\r\n\r\nwe  disallow one foreign worker into Singapore, we create\r\n\r\none  job  for  Singaporeans.  This  is  flawed  thinking.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  on a net basis, the entry of foreign workers  is\r\n\r\nadditive, ie, it creates more jobs for Singaporeans  and,\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly,  their exclusion would  result  in  even\r\n\r\nmore unemployment.  My Minister has touched on this but I\r\n\r\nwill elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers help to fill manpower gaps within\r\n\r\nour  economy,  which locals are not willing  or  able  to\r\n\r\nfill.   They  also help to moderate the cost of  business\r\n\r\nand  improve  the  international competitiveness  of  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  and allow them to function, win more contracts\r\n\r\nand employ more Singaporeans.  For example, the transport\r\n\r\nequipment  industry, which includes the marine  industry,\r\n\r\ngrew  rapidly in 2001, and saw an increase in  employment\r\n\r\nof  over  20,000 jobs.  Given the sudden  upturn  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry,  the sector had to turn to foreign  workers  to\r\n\r\nquickly ramp up its workforce.  Without this ready source\r\n\r\nof  foreign workers, the companies would not be  able  to\r\n\r\ntake on new orders, thus losing the opportunity to create\r\n\r\njobs for Singaporeans as well as foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might ask why did the marine industry not\r\n\r\nturn to Singaporeans.  Last year, many Members, including\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  Mayors  in the CDCs, profiled  the  marine\r\n\r\nindustry, together with me.  We went on a roadshow to say\r\n\r\nthat  it  had one of the best safety records, wages  were\r\n\r\ndecent despite what Mdm Halimah says about low wages.  We\r\n\r\nsaid that in the marine industry they can earn up to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout $2,000 with overtime and a stable career path.   We\r\n\r\ndonned hard hats, walked up ramps, got hoisted onto  ship\r\n\r\ndecks,   and   toured   their  shipyards.    Particularly\r\n\r\nmemorable  was Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon in a yellow  pantsuit\r\n\r\nand  hoisted  up  onto the ship deck.  We  had  excellent\r\n\r\npress  coverage.  We continued those efforts for about  a\r\n\r\nyear.   The result?  Less than 300 workers signed on  for\r\n\r\nan  industry that has 2,000 vacancies even now.  We  will\r\n\r\nand  we  must continue these efforts, but we need  to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic.   It  will  take  some  time  before  mindsets\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, hotels have had to hire foreign workers to\r\n\r\nensure  that they are able to operate smoothly over  peak\r\n\r\nChristmas,  Hari  Raya  and  Chinese  New  Year   holiday\r\n\r\nperiods.   And there is no shortage of schemes  profiling\r\n\r\nthe  opportunities and the better image of workers in the\r\n\r\nhospitality  industry.  If they do not have ready  access\r\n\r\nto willing workers, customers like you and I complain and\r\n\r\nmay  not  patronise  their  restaurants  again.   Similar\r\n\r\nexamples  exist for technical jobs in the  aerospace  and\r\n\r\npetrochemical industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in our present high unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation,  many  locals  are  not  willing  to  take  up\r\n\r\navailable jobs in industries.  It is not, as Mdm  Halimah\r\n\r\nsays,  that  we  are  castigating or selective.   I  have\r\n\r\nalready mentioned that the unemployment rate is 4%.   96%\r\n\r\nof the willing take up jobs.  It is these select few that\r\n\r\nwe  must not allow to tarnish the whole industry.  If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  makes  it  difficult for  companies  to  find\r\n\r\nsufficient manpower, they will lose contracts  or,  worse\r\n\r\nstill,  may relocate their operations to other countries,\r\n\r\nand  locals employed by them would end up losing jobs  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Supporting industries would see their  businesses\r\n\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Mr Steve Chia's definition of talent\r\n\r\nis  an artificial one.  Would not an employer consider  a\r\n\r\nhardworking worker, whether local or foreign, willing  to\r\n\r\nlearn,  helping  to meet deadlines, talent?   Restricting\r\n\r\naccess  to  foreign workers through stricter quotas  with\r\n\r\nmore  rigidities  to our labour market, as  suggested  by\r\n\r\nsome, would only hurt us in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Ministry takes a judiciously  calibrated\r\n\r\napproach   in   balancing  between   helping   unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to find jobs and meeting business needs  for\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, while we continue to manage this\r\n\r\ninflow of foreign workers through an appropriate levy and\r\n\r\nquota,  we  must  simultaneously  help  Singaporeans   to\r\n\r\ncompete.   And  this  is  the  gist  and  thrust  of  our\r\n\r\nContinuing  Education and Training statutory  board.   We\r\n\r\nmust  help  Singaporeans to be more  competitive  by  re-adapting mindsets, retrain, re-deploy as well as redesign\r\n\r\nindustries, as Mdm Halimah has also suggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that ultimately\r\n\r\nit  is  the competitiveness of our industries, with their\r\n\r\nmix of local and foreign workers, that will determine our\r\n\r\noverall  productivity and value-add.  Indeed, the  recent\r\n\r\nchanges  in the construction manpower policies were  made\r\n\r\nwith  this  very  end in mind, and we  will  extend  this\r\n\r\npolicy and the measures to other industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the possible changes to the foreign worker\r\n\r\nlevy,  there  is  no need to increase the  levy  at  this\r\n\r\npoint,  as the numbers have not escalated.  Dr  Wang  Kai\r\n\r\nYuen  earlier  asked  whether we were  certain  that  our\r\n\r\nfigures were correct.  If we look at our figures  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  year, local employment actually rose.  There was  a\r\n\r\nnet   decrease  in  overall  employment  but,  for  local\r\n\r\nresidents,  the number employed went up by  20,000.   For\r\n\r\nforeigners, there was a loss of 60,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with Members that the current $30\r\n\r\nskill levy is too low to regulate inflow.  It was set  in\r\n\r\n1999  when  the  Government  substantially  reduced   the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy to help business tide over the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis and, as Deputy Prime Minister  Lee  has\r\n\r\nannounced, the Ministry will review this later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken about welfare of our\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  He has asked for the  number  of  maid\r\n\r\nabuses.  I will give just two figures.  In 1997, it was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n157  offenders.  It has dropped to 43 last year,  on  the\r\n\r\nback of an ever increasing population of foreign domestic\r\n\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of housing, we have said that by mid-2004,\r\n\r\nall foreign workers who are housed off-site would have to\r\n\r\nbe  accommodated in proper and authorised  accommodation.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue  these efforts to  treat  our  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers with decency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Employment Pass holders, Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  and  Mr  Steve  Chia implied  that  our  policies\r\n\r\ndisproportionately discriminate against locals.  The most\r\n\r\nrecent  change was in the raising of the salary criterion\r\n\r\nfor  Employment Pass holders from $2,000 to $2,500,  from\r\n\r\n1st December 2001.  Since then, we have witnessed a sharp\r\n\r\ndecline in the number of Employment Pass holders over the\r\n\r\npast year, from 90,000 in 2001 to about 70,000 by the end\r\n\r\nof  2002, a 25% reduction.  I assure Members that we  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  similar  reduction in terms  of  our  local\r\n\r\ngraduates.   The  unemployment  of  our  graduate  degree\r\n\r\nholders is still around 4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this shows is that, under difficult conditions,\r\n\r\nour   policies   were  not  weighted  against   our   own\r\n\r\nprofessionals.    Indeed,   foreigners   have    suffered\r\n\r\nretrenchments even more so, and were not spared from  the\r\n\r\nadverse labour market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives us no joy for commiseration. When\r\n\r\nexpatriates leave, the service sector suffers  too,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the  expatriates  may  be  in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector: rents, the restaurants they patronise, the  shops\r\n\r\nthey  buy from, there is a knock-on effect.  So, this  is\r\n\r\nno  cause  for joy for any of us.  We need  to  view  our\r\n\r\nglobal  workforce in its entirety: both local and foreign\r\n\r\nworkers   adding   value  and  competitiveness   to   our\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Olivia Lum that technological\r\n\r\nchanges  will blur industry boundaries, and she is  quite\r\n\r\nright.   It  is  difficult to have  cut-and-dry  industry\r\n\r\nclassifications  or  qualifications  because   of   these\r\n\r\nchanges.   However,  there  must  be  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  fill these jobs  too  because,  if  the\r\n\r\nsector does well, it is an employment creation sector\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we  want  to  focus  on.  Therefore,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nManpower  Development Assistance Plan, which is a  scheme\r\n\r\nthat  helps companies and organisations develop  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  project  forward  for  critical  skills   in\r\n\r\nindustries, and especially growth industries, where there\r\n\r\nis a lack of training, to try to help Singaporeans become\r\n\r\ncompetitive. 3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I have taken note of her concerns and\r\n\r\nMOM  would  be happy to work with these industry  players\r\n\r\nlike  her  in  the  environmental  technology  and  water\r\n\r\ntreatment industry, to address the specific needs of  the\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked for better regulation of\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic maids.  As I have said  in  this  House\r\n\r\nbefore, it is not practical to regulate domestic work  in\r\n\r\nregard to hours of work, rest day and overtime work in  a\r\n\r\nhome    environment.    It   is    difficult    to    do.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  this, the Ministry encourages  employers\r\n\r\nand  their foreign domestic workers to work out the terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of employment based on mutual  agreement.\r\n\r\nWith  the  help of their embassies or employment  agents,\r\n\r\nmost  foreign  domestic  workers do  enter  into  written\r\n\r\nemployment contracts with their employers, covering  core\r\n\r\nemployment  terms  such  as  salary,  rest  day,  medical\r\n\r\nbenefit  and a description of their duties.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof Manpower is happy to conciliate if there are disputes.\r\n\r\nIt  is not uncommon for employers to provide at least one\r\n\r\nrest day in a month and to purchase the medical insurance\r\n\r\npolicies for their foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathiaparanam has spoken on foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic worker levy to be used for other purposes.   The\r\n\r\npurpose of the levy is to regulate the demand for foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers and should be used as  such.   However,\r\n\r\nemployers  who feel that their maids deserve  higher  pay\r\n\r\nand benefits are encouraged to do so.  We would encourage\r\n\r\nemployers to reward them, including paying them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbonuses,  air  fare, paying for their  courses,  if  they\r\n\r\nchoose to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what happened to the $50 million that the\r\n\r\nMinistry collects and what it is used for.  My answer  to\r\n\r\nher is that it goes into the consolidated fund and it  is\r\n\r\nreturned  to the public in terms of ERS, utility rebates,\r\n\r\nrental rebates. There is not one-to-one correlation.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  go  straight into the pockets of our  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  or Ministry members.  It goes back to  society\r\n\r\nat large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has spoken on safety at\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites.  We share his  concern.   There  are\r\n\r\nabout 38 fatal accidents in construction work sites  last\r\n\r\nyear.  MOM will continue its concerted efforts to improve\r\n\r\nsafety  and  we  will  continue to  launch  a  number  of\r\n\r\ninitiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on enforcement and regulation, we\r\n\r\nwill  take  contractors who flout the rules to  task  and\r\n\r\nthose  with  poor  safety records  will  be  barred  from\r\n\r\nemploying  foreign  workers from non-traditional  sources\r\n\r\nfor one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety training for personnel will be made\r\n\r\ncompulsory in a number of sectors and new regulations  to\r\n\r\naddress   safety   concerns,  such  as   poorly   erected\r\n\r\nscaffoldings, will be implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about hand and finger injuries. He is\r\n\r\nquite  right.  They are the most significant reasons  for\r\n\r\ninjuries - about 2,200 cases in 1993. But it has  dropped\r\n\r\nto  about  1,600  cases  last  year.   The  metal-working\r\n\r\nindustry intuitively does indeed suffer more injuries and\r\n\r\nwe   have   introduced  new  provision  to  require   all\r\n\r\nsupervisors  and  workers  in this  industry  to  undergo\r\n\r\nproper safety training. This will take effect on 1st June\r\n\r\n2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On noise-induced deafness, it has declined in 2002\r\n\r\nto  the  level  of  that  in 1998  as  a  result  of  our\r\n\r\nenforcement and promotional efforts, including the  Noise\r\n\r\nControl  Awards.  We  will set a new Singapore  Standard:\r\n\r\nCode of Practice this month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked for retrenchment benefits. In\r\n\r\n2002, a total of 18,900\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers  were  retrenched.  In  that  same  period,   193\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers sought the Ministry's  assistance  to\r\n\r\nsecure  payment of retrenchment benefits.  Of these,  40%\r\n\r\nwas  successful  in  their claims and the  remaining  60%\r\n\r\nsettled  on  their  own.  In general,  companies  do  pay\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits to their laid-off workers. This  is\r\n\r\nreflected  in  a  study  involving  58  companies   which\r\n\r\nnotified the Ministry of their retrenchments.  97% of the\r\n\r\n2,405  affected  workers  from these  companies  received\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits, the majority  receiving  benefits\r\n\r\nabout a month per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister of State?  He said in his reply  that\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of foreign talent is an artificial  one.\r\n\r\nHe  also  said  that a hardworking person  valued  by  an\r\n\r\nemployer can be considered as talented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a bit confused about this. What exactly\r\n\r\nis  the difference between attracting foreign talents and\r\n\r\nthe  foreign worker policy?  Does it mean that the policy\r\n\r\nfor  foreign talent is to attract foreign workers who are\r\n\r\nhighly  educated  and  skilled  and  thereby  introducing\r\n\r\ncompetition to Singapore workers to depress their  wages,\r\n\r\nas we are overpaid?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Low starts with an\r\n\r\nassumption  of his own making and ends up to  a  position\r\n\r\nthat he himself makes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent is best decided by the employer and this has\r\n\r\nto  be  so.  But he has said:  do we protect our  workers\r\n\r\nenough?   Let  us take the point that we  are  making  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  professionals. Indeed, the greatest protection\r\n\r\nis the restriction we have already imposed on the market.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of salaries, we have raised it from $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,500.   That, in itself, is the industry's  nation-wide\r\n\r\nmeasure  which  regulates  the  entry.   And  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned,  when the economy went down,  the  EP  holders\r\n\r\nwere  reduced by 25%, a dramatic reduction,  which  shows\r\n\r\nthat  it is enough of a protection for our local workers.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is not, as he has implied, that we do not protect\r\n\r\nour professionals and that we use them to depress wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  salary  criterion  of $2,500  is  a  very  effective\r\n\r\nregulator.  And if you look at our job surveys, in  terms\r\n\r\nof NUS and NTU graduates who have recently come out, they\r\n\r\nsuffer salary decrements of about 5%, and measured  on  a\r\n\r\nglobal scale, in terms of this economic climate, that  is\r\n\r\nnot  something  that is way out in terms of international\r\n\r\nbenchmarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at our polytechnic graduates, some of\r\n\r\nthem  have  pay  rises.  I will dispute  the  point  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  with the facts, that we are not protecting  our\r\n\r\nprofessionals.   But  I would also  say  that  protection\r\n\r\nneeds  to be calibrated because foreign workers,  whether\r\n\r\nat the unskilled or skilled level or EP level, add to our\r\n\r\nvigour, our vibrancy and our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A further clarification.

The most spectacular event was the  fish-tossing  demonstration by the foreign  experts  who  were\r\n\r\nspecially invited to perform at the festival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our people are saying, \"Why toss the\r\n\r\nfish?  You  keep  tossing the fish  at  the  fishmonger's\r\n\r\nstall, and you would end up tossing away your rice bowl!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in Singapore, we do not toss the fish, but\r\n\r\nwe toss durians. I often see some workers tossing durians\r\n\r\nfrom the lorry to the people standing on the ground,  who\r\n\r\ncatch  the  durians  and,  in  turn,  toss  them  to  the\r\n\r\nstallholder.  You need to be skilful to  toss  and  catch\r\n\r\nthese thorny fruits, because if you miss any one of them,\r\n\r\nit  will hit you on the face. It is not only painful  but\r\n\r\nshameful too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think this year, in our Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\nFestival, we should have more local flavour in it.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  awarded some scholarships to Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nexhibited  good  learning attitude.  Perhaps,  we  should\r\n\r\naward  some  scholarships this year to  people  who  have\r\n\r\nshown good results in acquiring new skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Lianhe Wanbao launched a new series called\r\n\r\nthe  \"Roll  of Heroes\" where they introduced a series  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who had been  unemployed but then,  because\r\n\r\nof their determination and courage, they started to learn\r\n\r\na  new skill in a new territory and then created economic\r\n\r\nmiracles. According to the journalists in Lianhe  Wanbao,\r\n\r\nthere  are  in fact many, many people who deserve  to  be\r\n\r\nfeatured  but  many  of them declined because  they  felt\r\n\r\nembarrassed  to  be  featured as the so-called  \"rags-to-richness\" heroes.  Those who are courageous enough to  be\r\n\r\ninterviewed  and  featured are real heroes.  They  really\r\n\r\nhave the guts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present situation, with jobs being so hard to\r\n\r\nget, people would say, \"Well,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere is no choice.  Give me a job,  I will take it  even\r\n\r\nif  I  have to work seven days a week. Even if the salary\r\n\r\nis  halved, I will still do it.  If what I earn  is  just\r\n\r\nenough  for  me to eat, that is good enough for  me.  The\r\n\r\nTeochew  term for beggar is kit jia (beg to  eat).   Now,\r\n\r\nyou  beg  for  a job, earn your salary so that  you  have\r\n\r\nenough to eat.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and MPs have asked the people to change\r\n\r\ntheir mindsets. I think that is not good enough. We  need\r\n\r\nto have the workers themselves to come forward and be the\r\n\r\nspokesmen for this change of mindset. This will appeal to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  as  they can identify themselves  with  the\r\n\r\nspokesmen. They are \"fellow sufferers commiserating  with\r\n\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think MOM should learn from the commercial\r\n\r\nadvertisements.   If you are advertising  a  hair-growing\r\n\r\ntonic,  you would get some botak or bald guys to  promote\r\n\r\nthe  products, by saying how they have applied the  tonic\r\n\r\nand how their hair began to grow again.  You do not get a\r\n\r\nlong-hair beauty to sell the hair-growing tonic.  She  is\r\n\r\nbetter used in selling hair shampoo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can have more local characteristics\r\n\r\nand  a  change of style in this year's Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nFestival.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the new CET statutory board\r\n\r\nwill   also   work   more  closely  with  community-based\r\n\r\norganisations,  such  as  the  CDCs,  to  bring  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning  to the heartlands.  Nevertheless, I  think  the\r\n\r\nonly point that I, and probably this House, will want  to\r\n\r\ntake  home  from  Mr Seng's question is  that  we  should\r\n\r\nincorporate   him   in  next  year's  Lifelong   Learning\r\n\r\nFestival.

This  shows  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  recognition that companies  will  generally\r\n\r\nnot train workers for other jobs.  Companies may actually\r\n\r\nprefer  to employ directly-trained people from the market\r\n\r\nrather  than train their own, that SMEs will, over  time,\r\n\r\nemploy  a  larger percentage of the workforce,  and  that\r\n\r\nSMEs,  generally  speaking, have a  lower  propensity  to\r\n\r\ntrain  their  workers. In this connection, I  would  just\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister what are the specific plans that\r\n\r\nwe have in mind to initiate more specific support schemes\r\n\r\nfor individual-initiated training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on purposeful training, in a downturn, the\r\n\r\nnumber of unemployed increases and you find that as  more\r\n\r\npeople go for training, some may not get jobs immediately\r\n\r\nand  therefore, the question arises whether  training  is\r\n\r\npurposeful. I completely support MOM's approach which  is\r\n\r\nto target training that can help people find jobs as soon\r\n\r\nas  possible. That is purposeful and, therefore,  schemes\r\n\r\nlike place-and-train is the way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to highlight that we also have got\r\n\r\nto  prepare  for  the rebound.  Every  time  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrebound,  we  will find that there are pockets  of  skill\r\n\r\nshortages that will drive up costs.  Therefore, in  order\r\n\r\nnot   to  have  this  cost  rise  to  the  detriment   of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and workers' employment prospects, I urge\r\n\r\nthat  MOM  continue  to work closely with  industries  to\r\n\r\nanticipate areas of skill needs and be prepared to  train\r\n\r\nin advance of recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> While some Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nfacing  difficulties  in finding  jobs,  many  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  shun away from certain jobs available.

It\r\n\r\nhas  a  huge  multiplicity  of  roles  -  public  housing\r\n\r\nauthority,   developer,   financier,   lessor,   builder,\r\n\r\nsupplier,  estate  manager, and so on.   The  ERC  Report\r\n\r\ncalled  for a review of the HDB's role in public housing,\r\n\r\nbut it stopped short of making recommendations.  Madam, I\r\n\r\ndeduce  that  unlike  streaming in  education,  the  home\r\n\r\nownership  policy  is not a sacred  cow  that  cannot  be\r\n\r\nslaughtered.   As more than 85% of Singaporeans  own  and\r\n\r\nlive  in HDB flats, any change in public housing policies\r\n\r\nstands to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwide ramifications on the private housing market and  the\r\n\r\neconomy  as a whole.  This has been witnessed many  times\r\n\r\nover  in  the  past.  Reviewing the  role  of  HDB  is  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  challenge and requires much  careful  thought\r\n\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that HDB has already begun to remake\r\n\r\nitself  with the announcement to corporatise the Building\r\n\r\nand Development Division.  Madam, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether the HDB plans to become even trimmer  by\r\n\r\nshedding   some   of  its  non-related   public   housing\r\n\r\nfunctions, such as developing and managing industrial and\r\n\r\ncommercial  projects.   I would also  like  to  make  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  two  suggestions for HDB  to  consider  as  it\r\n\r\nreviews its role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, increasing the ratio of private to public\r\n\r\nhousing.   Over the years, HDB has scope-crept  from  low\r\n\r\ncost  to  middle income housing, and perhaps even  higher\r\n\r\nmiddle income housing.  The recent economic downturn  has\r\n\r\nshown that the demand for 5-room flats has dwindled to  a\r\n\r\ntrickle.   On the other hand, 4-room flats have  remained\r\n\r\nthe  most  popular.   There  are,  in  fact,  already   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number  of 5-room HDB  flats  available  for\r\n\r\nsale, both in the new and resale markets, which can cater\r\n\r\nto  those  who  wish  to upgrade to  such  flats.   HDB's\r\n\r\nattention  is thus better focused at the lower  end  mass\r\n\r\nhousing  market, where the housing needs are  more  acute\r\n\r\nbecause  of  lower affordability.  HDB should shrink  its\r\n\r\ntarget  market  at the higher end completely.   It  could\r\n\r\nstop   building  5-room  flats  and  instead  sell   more\r\n\r\nexecutive  condominium sites as a step towards increasing\r\n\r\nthe proportion of housing types.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, low income housing and rental flats. HDB\r\n\r\nshould   make  more  rental  flats  available  to   allow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   the  option  to  separate  their   housing\r\n\r\ninvestments and consumption decisions.  Increasingly,  in\r\n\r\nline  with the call for more entrepreneurial spirit, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  may not wish to be tied down by  a  housing\r\n\r\nmortgage.   They  may wish to invest  their  money  in  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  instead of a house.  To allow this,  HDB  could\r\n\r\nrelax the qualifying criteria for renting flats,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby, amongst others, increasing the gross household income\r\n\r\nceiling,  which now stands at only $800 per  month.   The\r\n\r\npresent rules are too stringent and will not release  any\r\n\r\nsignificant  amount of rental housing  into  the  market.\r\n\r\nThe  optimal  mix  of home ownership  and  rental  would,\r\n\r\nhowever,  need  to  be  studied to  strike  some  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the effect of an entrepreneurial risk  appetite,\r\n\r\nrate of family formation, and having a tangible stake  in\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Madam, with the\r\n\r\npresent  scenario of a built-up city, I just  have  three\r\n\r\nquestions.   What is the new role of HDB in view  of  the\r\n\r\nalready  high  build-up of HDB public housing?   And,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the proposed big set-up of 1,000 staff and  800\r\n\r\ncontract clerks-of-works, does the new HDB Corp expect to\r\n\r\nplay  any  role  in  the Singapore market,  although  the\r\n\r\nstated  objective of HDB Corp is to foray  into  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets, like India and China?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support Dr Teo's call for a review of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' need of the interim, main, lift  upgrading,\r\n\r\nand selective en-bloc redevelopment programmes, and their\r\n\r\ncost  effectiveness and benefits to residents versus  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience faced by residents.  Although  the  various\r\n\r\nupgrading  works have served the objective  of  enhancing\r\n\r\nthe  living  environment  of the  older  estates  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious phases, the residential development may still not\r\n\r\nbe  intensively built to take advantage of the plot ratio\r\n\r\nof 3.5 for residential development in the new Master Plan\r\n\r\n2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Madam, like\r\n\r\nthe  other speakers before me, I would also like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  about the new role of HDB.  With  the  HDB\r\n\r\nCorp  now  taking over as the developer  and  builder  of\r\n\r\npublic housing, how will it be monitored in terms of  the\r\n\r\nquality and cost of housing development?  The next  point\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Minister is whether  he  would\r\n\r\nreview  what  I  have asked before, ie,  to  allow  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a chance to monetise their flats.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  older  Singaporeans  have purchased  4-  and  5-room\r\n\r\nflats.

Perhaps, the Minister\r\n\r\ncould review this again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Madam, the\r\n\r\nrole  of  HDB now carries a different meaning.  HDB  has,\r\n\r\nmetaphorically  and  literally, been  a  household  word.\r\n\r\nHDB's  role  has  been, for a long time, synonymous  with\r\n\r\npublic  housing.   With it come the social  sensitivities\r\n\r\nconnected with different public housing needs,  not  just\r\n\r\ncommercial  interest.   With  corporatisation,  and   HDB\r\n\r\nfarming  out more and more public housing to the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  how  would  MND  and  HDB  ensure  that   public\r\n\r\ninterests  are  not  compromised?   Would  MND  and   HDB\r\n\r\nconsider   setting  up  an  advisory  board   to   handle\r\n\r\ngrievances  from  the  public,  especially  when  HDB  is\r\n\r\ncorporatised?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, today's Berita Harian highlighted some of the\r\n\r\npredicaments  faced by HDB applicants following  the  new\r\n\r\nrules  introduced  by HDB, eg, when  applying  for  loans\r\n\r\nthrough  commercial  banks, they were  subjected  to  the\r\n\r\ntightest  scrutiny,  so  much  so  that  those  who  have\r\n\r\nproblems  with credit balances, or loan repayments,  were\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  loans by the banks, although  they  claimed\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  cleared those loans or credit  balances.\r\n\r\nWould  HDB  explain why the need for corporatisation  and\r\n\r\nwhat  more  changes can the public expect following  this\r\n\r\nmajor shift in HDB's position?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Madam, just a few quick\r\n\r\npoints.  Firstly, I would say that I welcome the move  to\r\n\r\ncorporatise  some  aspects of HDB's  functions,  which  I\r\n\r\nbelieve will contribute to a leaner and more focused HDB,\r\n\r\nallowing  other aspects of its work to be run on  a  more\r\n\r\ncommercial  and private sector basis.  Having said  that,\r\n\r\nthe questions that I would like to pose are these:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the residual HDB, which is the core\r\n\r\norganisation,  continues to have certain aspects  of  its\r\n\r\nfunctions,  which, it seems to me, logically belong  more\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  private sector as well.  This includes,  as  Dr  Amy\r\n\r\nKhor   has   also  mentioned,  the  areas  of  industrial\r\n\r\nproperties  and commercial properties, for example.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  then  is:  are there plans to also  corporatise\r\n\r\nthese and subject them to private sector discipline?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  what will shape HDB's focus  in  the  years\r\n\r\nahead.   There  are many imperatives and  driving  forces\r\n\r\nthat  are  going  to reformulate the challenge  that  HDB\r\n\r\nfaces.   These  include not just the  reduced  volume  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  public  housing,  but   also   changing\r\n\r\ndemographics,   and  also  the  proportion   of   private\r\n\r\ndevelopments is increasing.  So is there a case for HDB's\r\n\r\nfocus to be sharpened, perhaps, to focus its planning and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  efforts primarily on those Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nneed  their first home, or those Singaporeans who are  in\r\n\r\nfinancial need of a loan, and allowing the private sector\r\n\r\nto  take  up the slack in other aspects of public housing\r\n\r\ndemands  in Singapore?  Madam, I would appreciate  it  if\r\n\r\nthe Minister could clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, with a more mature public\r\n\r\nhousing market, building of new flats will gradually slow\r\n\r\ndown.   Thus,  there  is  a  need  to  restructure   HDB,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Building and Development Division  (BDD).\r\n\r\nThe  announcement of the corporatisation of HDB's BDD has\r\n\r\nraised concerns both within HDB and the industry.   Those\r\n\r\naffected  will  have  to consider whether  they  will  be\r\n\r\ncompensated  or  re-employed by the new HDB  Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis  has  generally affected morale,  especially  during\r\n\r\nthis   uncertain  market  situation.   Madam,  with   HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation,  many  practitioners  are  concerned   about\r\n\r\nlosing market share in the future.  Many private building\r\n\r\nconsultants who are presently working on public  projects\r\n\r\nhave  put  in investments to satisfy the requirements  of\r\n\r\nvarious Government agencies.  If the workload for  public\r\n\r\nprojects declines, they will suffer much loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the cost of corporatising HDB?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the principal business activities of HDB Corp?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the estimated value of HDB contracts to be\r\n\r\nallocated to HDB Corp for the next five years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, HDB's revamp is\r\n\r\ninevitable because the large bureaucratic organisation it\r\n\r\nhas  grown  into over the years is clearly not suited  to\r\n\r\nthe  rapidly  changing  economic  and  social  landscape.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this has given rise to some concerns  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate and people sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, scope of HDB Corporation. I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister what would be the scope of HDB  Corp's\r\n\r\nbusiness?   Would  it  extend  beyond  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nprofessional  services and consultancy work  to  property\r\n\r\ndevelopers  when it is eventually allowed to  compete  in\r\n\r\nthe local non-HDB market?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a level playing field. An increasing\r\n\r\nproportion  of HDB's projects will be outsourced  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector from 2006.  This is, of course,  welcomed\r\n\r\nby  the private sector.  However, there are apprehensions\r\n\r\nfrom  them that the HDB Corp, being wholly-owned by  HDB,\r\n\r\nwill  not  be competing on a level playing field.   I  am\r\n\r\nquite   certain   that  the  Temasek  Charter   will   be\r\n\r\nreligiously and fully applied to this entity and it  will\r\n\r\nnot  enjoy  special  privileges beyond  what  is  already\r\n\r\nannounced  by the Minister.  But the fact that overnight,\r\n\r\na  Government-linked behemoth, capable of  competing  for\r\n\r\nthe  shrinking housing pie, has surfaced is sure to  give\r\n\r\nrise  to grave concerns over unfair competition.  I  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider, at least, a tentative timetable\r\n\r\nfor  HDB  Corp's divestment into private hands to  reduce\r\n\r\nsome misgivings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, focusing its energy on overseas\r\n\r\nmarket instead of competing in the local market will help\r\n\r\nto   allay   the   fears  of  the  private   sector   and\r\n\r\nsimultaneously help to achieve the objective of expanding\r\n\r\nour second wing.  Madam, I notice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat both these issues have already been mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMinister.   But I urge the Minister to ensure that  these\r\n\r\nthrusts  to minimise direct competition with the domestic\r\n\r\nenterprises and to increasingly focus beyond  the  shores\r\n\r\nof Singapore will not be diluted in any way.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some eyebrows raised by the press as\r\n\r\nwell  as  some members of the public who have written  to\r\n\r\nthe  press  regarding  the generous compensation  package\r\n\r\ndished out by HDB to its staff, especially those who will\r\n\r\nbe transferred to HDB Corp.  In a reply to the press, HDB\r\n\r\nhas  noted that these HDB staff will not be automatically\r\n\r\ngiven  a job in HDB Corp and that they will be on  a  new\r\n\r\npay  structure.   This is hardly convincing.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  let us know if some or all of the staff  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred   to  HDB  Corporation  have   already   been\r\n\r\nidentified?   What  percentage  of  the  staff   in   HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation  will not be former HDB employees?   I  know,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  that HDB Corporation already  has  a  CEO\r\n\r\ndesignate  who is presently a staff of HDB.  Also,  while\r\n\r\nHDB  Corporation is technically a different  entity  from\r\n\r\nHDB,  it is wholly owned by HDB and, hence, a job in  HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation,  which if offered to an HDB employee,  could\r\n\r\nvery  reasonably be viewed as a transfer,  instead  of  a\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  There is public outcry over what is deemed\r\n\r\nto  be  an  unnecessary double bite of the  same  cherry.\r\n\r\nThis   matter  should  not  be  allowed  to  fester   as,\r\n\r\notherwise,   it   will  undermine   confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's wisdom to make such decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, since its\r\n\r\nestablishment  in  1960, HDB has a  glorious  history  of\r\n\r\nabout  40  years.  Under the home ownership scheme,  they\r\n\r\nhave  already  built some 800,000 flats.   About  85%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are living in HDB flats, and about  96%  own\r\n\r\ntheir  own flats.  I think this is the highest record  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has already accomplished its mission, and many\r\n\r\nof  its  staff  had  an  early  retirement  and  received\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor  them, I think it is a good reward for what they have\r\n\r\ncontributed to our nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB is now going to set up a company. Many of\r\n\r\nthe   local  developers  are  worried.   Will  this   HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation be competing with them for construction  work\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  With HDB's history of 40 years, it has  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  track record and famous brandname.   I  think\r\n\r\nthey should go into foreign markets, maybe in China or in\r\n\r\nIndia.   They  should  venture  over  there  instead   of\r\n\r\ncompeting with the local companies in our market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to ask the Minister what is the main aim of\r\n\r\nthe corporatisation.  Will HDB Corporation be leading our\r\n\r\nlocal  developers and builders to venture and develop  in\r\n\r\nthe foreign markets?  If they can give this assurance, it\r\n\r\nwill  certainly boost the confidence and  morale  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal developers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, as one of the advisors to the HDB\r\n\r\nStaff Union, I know the HDB's corporatisation process has\r\n\r\ncreated a lot of uncertainty and angst amongst the staff.\r\n\r\nHaving  said that, I think the management of HDB and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  have been very fair in their treatment  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff   affected,  and  I  would  like   to   record   my\r\n\r\nappreciation on that score.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think the core issue today is:\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the nature of the relationship between HDB  and\r\n\r\nthe  newly  established HDB Corporation?  As I understand\r\n\r\nit,  based  on the releases made to the media,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nwholly owned subsidiary of HDB.  What that means is  that\r\n\r\nHDB  Corporation's  financial  performance  will  have  a\r\n\r\ndirect bearing on HDB's financial performance.  Then, can\r\n\r\nwe   expect   the  relationship  between  HDB   and   HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation to be one at arm's length?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the outsourcing programme also creates\r\n\r\nadditional questions on this score.  For the first  three\r\n\r\nyears, all HDB projects will be given to HDB Corporation;\r\n\r\nthereafter, 10% and then I understand it is  30%  in  the\r\n\r\nfifth  year and 50% in the sixth year.  And the  pace  of\r\n\r\noutsourcing, thereafter, will be reviewed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat the end of year six.  There are naturally questions in\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  those in the private  sector  as  to  how\r\n\r\ntransparent and level the playing field will be  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the staff in HDB Building Development\r\n\r\nDivision today will be divided.  Some  will be in the HDB\r\n\r\nat  the  parent level, and some will be at the subsidiary\r\n\r\nlevel.  Can these relationships truly be at arm's length?\r\n\r\nShould  we not accelerate the process of outsourcing  and\r\n\r\ndecoupling  the relationship between HDB Corporation  and\r\n\r\nHDB?   The  question  is particularly  pertinent  because\r\n\r\nhaving  come out with a fair package, which is equivalent\r\n\r\nto  a  retrenchment  package, the position  of  an  early\r\n\r\nretirement  scheme,  we  are  now  endowing   the   newly\r\n\r\nestablished HDB Corporation with the flexibility  to  set\r\n\r\nterms and establish itself in a manner that it deems  fit\r\n\r\nin  order  to  compete in the new environment.   I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if the Minister could clarify this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, you can take the next two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, on HDB branch office. With\r\n\r\nthe  delegation of the maintenance of HDB estates to  the\r\n\r\nTown  Councils,  the functions of the HDB branch  offices\r\n\r\nhave been reduced drastically.  In the past, the HDB  had\r\n\r\nadopted  a  decentralised approach to build area  offices\r\n\r\nall  over  Singapore  to better serve  Singaporeans.   To\r\n\r\ndate,  these  branch  offices are providing  a  range  of\r\n\r\nservices,  such as purchase of season car  park  coupons,\r\n\r\nand  lease  and  tenancy management  matters.   With  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  the  five Community Development  Councils,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to review whether the HDB branch offices\r\n\r\ncan  be better synchronised to provide a one-stop service\r\n\r\nto residents.  Many of the CDCs are located at convenient\r\n\r\nand  accessible  locations  to  residents.   As  such,  a\r\n\r\nrationalisation of these branch offices may be  necessary\r\n\r\nto  ensure better outreach of the branch office  services\r\n\r\nto residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Ministry the following\r\n\r\nquestions: first, are there plans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  rationalise the branch offices to better support  and\r\n\r\nadvise  CDC?   Second, will the HDB carpark  services  be\r\n\r\ncorporatised?   Third,  can  the  URA  and  HDB   carpark\r\n\r\nsections be merged into a single entity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on Build to Order (BTO). The BTO\r\n\r\nscheme  was  introduced to replace  the  Registration  of\r\n\r\nFlats  system for HDB flats last year.  The main  purpose\r\n\r\nis  to ensure a better match of demand and supply of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   What  is more important is that it  allows  flat\r\n\r\napplicants to choose specific locations when applying for\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  However, to achieve this, HDB must  allocate\r\n\r\nmore  sites  for BTO and provide a wider  mix  of  flats,\r\n\r\nmaybe from studio to 5-room flats, for each BTO site.  If\r\n\r\ndemand  for a particular mix of flats is below  75%,  HDB\r\n\r\nmust readjust the mix of flat types so as to attract  new\r\n\r\ndemand.   In  this  way, there will be  no  abortive  BTO\r\n\r\nsites,  resulting in disappointment among flat applicants\r\n\r\nand  wastage of resources.  Like private developers,  HDB\r\n\r\nmust be prepared to reduce the sale price of unsold flats\r\n\r\nfor  those with less desirable attributes, such as facing\r\n\r\nbin centres or poor view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions: (1) does BTO provide better matching of demand\r\n\r\nand  supply of HDB flats?  (2) can HDB consider providing\r\n\r\na better mix of flats for each BTO project?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, my concerns are with the\r\n\r\nchanging demography of the Singapore population.  The new\r\n\r\nHDB  could  work  towards being more  responsive  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Many  of  the  post-war baby  boomers  will  be\r\n\r\nreaching the senior citizens age group.  Many may need to\r\n\r\ndowngrade  their living standards in view of the  smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies  that  they  have, and  many,  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  may  just want  to  be  economically\r\n\r\nindependent and  free of their assets.  HDB should   take\r\n\r\nan  active  review  in the provision of suitable  housing\r\n\r\ntypes  for  the  future change in the demography  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the advancement of information and\r\n\r\ncommunication  technology,  the  HDB  should  review  its\r\n\r\nprovision of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbasic  facilities within the flat, eg, the  provision  of\r\n\r\nbroadband and wireless network, to meet the future  needs\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans who are growing up with the computer and\r\n\r\nInternet  world.   These facilities and  amenities  would\r\n\r\nbecome  the basic necessities than luxuries.  This  would\r\n\r\nalso provide the backbone for the home office concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the small number of flats to be built and\r\n\r\nsold  by  the  HDB,  HDB could relook  into  the  various\r\n\r\npolicies for the sale of HDB flats.  HDB, presently,  has\r\n\r\nthe  most complicated policies and guidelines in the sale\r\n\r\nof HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a surplus of about 9,000 flats as at 31st\r\n\r\nDecember  2002, HDB should look into the selling  of  the\r\n\r\nflats  on  a daily basis, rather than on a monthly  basis\r\n\r\ncurrently.   This is the standard in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nI  am told that, recently, Wing Tai also sold their flats\r\n\r\nand  houses during the Chinese New Year holidays and gave\r\n\r\naway   ang  pows  to  prospective  buyers.   Would   HDB,\r\n\r\npossibly, consider selling the 9,000 excess flats in  the\r\n\r\nopen  market at market price without subsidy and  without\r\n\r\nthe  usual HDB restrictive conditions for occupation  and\r\n\r\nresale?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an incentive, HDB could do some accounting on the\r\n\r\nholding  cost  of its built-up HDB flats.   For  example,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  surplus flats under the SERS redevelopment\r\n\r\nprogramme  are not let out to the public promptly.   Some\r\n\r\nblocks  were ready at least for two years before take  up\r\n\r\nby  residents,  and  many of these flats  are  in  superb\r\n\r\nlocations where demand is very high.  The timing for  the\r\n\r\noccupation of the flats could be better scheduled if  the\r\n\r\nholding cost of the built-up flats is taken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee is not here.

Many 3-room flat dwellers are working\r\n\r\nclass  families  and need more space  as  their  families\r\n\r\ngrow.  Today, some are living in congested flats and are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunable  or  cannot afford to upgrade to  a  4-room  flat.\r\n\r\nWith  grown up children, some of their children  have  to\r\n\r\nsleep  in  the  kitchen or living room, as there  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  bedroom for them.  The crowded living  conditions\r\n\r\nare  also  not conducive for their children to  study  at\r\n\r\nhome.  The 10 years time bar imposed by HDB for upgraders\r\n\r\nhas  further aggravated this problem, resulting  in  more\r\n\r\nfamilies staying in congested 3-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1)  can HDB consider reducing the resale levy for 3-room\r\n\r\nflat  owners who wish to upgrade to a 4-room  flat?   (2)\r\n\r\ncan  HDB  waive the resale levy for those who sold  their\r\n\r\nflats below their purchase price?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, on affordability of HDB\r\n\r\nflats.    Presently,  HDB  policies  are  geared   toward\r\n\r\nSingaporeans upgrading their flats. This is  natural,  as\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans,  when they  can  afford,  would  want\r\n\r\ncomfortable and bigger sized flats.  And most of us  have\r\n\r\nalso grown up with the aspiration of owning our flats, as\r\n\r\nbig  as  possible.  We are the only country that has  the\r\n\r\nhighest  home  ownership, and when the  economy  changes,\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans would be tied down  to  their  assets,\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  make  a vertical move for  their  housing,\r\n\r\nunlike some who rent a house or a flat.  In view of  such\r\n\r\nscenarios  present and in the future, HDB  should  review\r\n\r\nits  present housing policy to allow for downgrading  and\r\n\r\nthe need to build smaller flats.  Presently, the purchase\r\n\r\nof  3-room  HDB flats is only for first-time  applicants,\r\n\r\nearning  an income of less than $2,000.  Will HDB  review\r\n\r\nits  policy  to allow existing flat owners  who  need  to\r\n\r\ndowngrade to 3-room flats and meet the income criteria of\r\n\r\nbelow $2,000 another chance to purchase directly from HDB\r\n\r\nthe  3-room  flats?  The reasons are that some  of  these\r\n\r\nhouseholds  staying  in bigger flats just  simply  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  buy  a 3-room flat in the open market,  since\r\n\r\nthey  still have large outstanding loans of their present\r\n\r\nbigger  flats  and could not maintain the  present  flat.\r\n\r\nDoes the HDB have a sufficient supply of 3-room flats  to\r\n\r\ncater to families who require them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nindeed  very lucky to have the CPF scheme to  allow  home\r\n\r\nownership to be made affordable.  That is definitely true\r\n\r\nfor  the  first generation of homeowners in the first  20\r\n\r\nyears   of  our  independence.   Indeed,  following   the\r\n\r\nsignificant  jump  of property prices, many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsold  their flats ending up cash rich, yet upgrading into\r\n\r\na  second  flat, continuing to use the CPF  scheme  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  bite  of  the HDB cherry.  I was  told  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Muslims who went on Haj, for example,  during\r\n\r\nproperty prices boom time, showed a direct correlation to\r\n\r\nsales in HDB flats.  But, unfortunately, no more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many of those who upgraded, while hoping to\r\n\r\nsell  again  later, are now caught.  If  they  are  among\r\n\r\nthose retrenched or unemployed, their problems get worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of affordability of public housing\r\n\r\narises  in  the context of new flat prices, retrenchment,\r\n\r\nthe  passing  of  the  high wage  policy  and,  possibly,\r\n\r\nreduced CPF contributions.  The question now is:  is  HDB\r\n\r\nhousing  still affordable?  How would MND  and  HDB  keep\r\n\r\npublic  housing  affordable, especially when  they  would\r\n\r\nwant to keep housing of first-world quality?\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Madam, the\r\n\r\nnew  HDB loan financing policy took effect on 1st January\r\n\r\nthis year.  The banks have reassured us that it will  not\r\n\r\nbe too quick to repossess the flats of borrowers who have\r\n\r\ndefaulted payment.  I am glad to note this and I hope  we\r\n\r\nwill  not face the problem later on.  While the issue  of\r\n\r\nrepossession  may  be  far  fetched,  other  issues   are\r\n\r\nbeginning to emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to discuss the plight of two\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people who may face difficulty with  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancing policy.  One, is the failure to obtain loan  by\r\n\r\nthose  with  poor  credit standing.  The  banks  are  not\r\n\r\nlikely  to extend the loan to those who were assessed  to\r\n\r\nhave poor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncredit  standing.   There are about  15,000  undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupts  as at September 2002, and thousands  more  are\r\n\r\nwaiting at the doorsteps of the High Court to be declared\r\n\r\nbankrupt.   Some are trapped with credit card  and  other\r\n\r\nbills.  These people will not stand a chance in obtaining\r\n\r\nhousing  loans from the banks.  Worse, what happens  when\r\n\r\nthey  cannot afford their current flat any more and  want\r\n\r\nto  downgrade to a smaller flat but they are not eligible\r\n\r\nfor any more concessionary loans from HDB, thus forced to\r\n\r\nborrow from the bank?  They are likely to be rejected due\r\n\r\nto  their  poor credit worthiness.  What will  happen  to\r\n\r\nthese  individuals?  They probably cannot  rent  the  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  either, as they would have to serve a 30-month ban.\r\n\r\nIf  they remain in the current flat, they are just  going\r\n\r\nto  accumulate  more  arrears with  interest.   They  are\r\n\r\nstuck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, they are the products of our own system.\r\n\r\nWhen times were good, we encouraged them to upgrade.   We\r\n\r\nare  proud  to  tell  others that  we  have  85%  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation that own their own flats.  But when  they  are\r\n\r\nstuck,  what do we do?  I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  share  the  Ministry's position with regard  to  such\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group involves those whose composition of\r\n\r\nfamily   nucleus   changes.   Madam,  many   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nappreciate the Government's offer of concessionary  rates\r\n\r\nto  their  mortgage  loans.  However,  sometimes,  family\r\n\r\ncircumstances change and render it necessary for families\r\n\r\nto  have  to  change  the  names  of  co-lessees  due  to\r\n\r\ndifferent circumstances.  Quite unfortunately, when  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances   arise,  HDB  considers  the   next   loan\r\n\r\nnegotiated  as  separate  and  renders  the  family   not\r\n\r\nqualified  to enjoy concessionary rates any longer.   The\r\n\r\nnew  policy  forces  them to get \"refinancing\"  from  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks as it would have been considered  as  a\r\n\r\n\"market rate\" borrower with HDB previously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, lay persons often find it difficult to\r\n\r\nunderstand such processes.  How can changing a name of  a\r\n\r\nco-lessee mean that their monthly instalments will have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  increase?   They  do  not understand  that  they  are\r\n\r\nactually  signing a new lease agreement.  HDB will  argue\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  the  same as selling the current  flat  and\r\n\r\nbuying  another flat with different people as co-lessees.\r\n\r\nWill  HDB consider on a case-by-case basis, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe    circumstances   of   each   case,   allowing   for\r\n\r\nconcessionary rates to continue even after the  names  of\r\n\r\nco-lessees  were  to change as long as  the  main  lessee\r\n\r\nremains?   Madam,  I think the problem is  that  the  two\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rates are granted to each family  nucleus.\r\n\r\nBut  the  problem is that the composition of  the  family\r\n\r\nnucleus  may  change,  that is,  sometimes  circumstances\r\n\r\nforce  one  to change course and direction without  one's\r\n\r\nown deliberate intention.  Such cases may be rare, but it\r\n\r\ndoes test the flexibility of the system in its place.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like HDB to relook at this policy in the light  of\r\n\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Madam, Dr Maliki has\r\n\r\ncovered my points.

Mr\r\n\r\nOthman Haron Eusofe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Madam, recently, the HDB\r\n\r\nintroduced  an  option  period to  enable  purchasers  of\r\n\r\nresale  HDB flats time to reconsider their purchases.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask how effective this will be, especially\r\n\r\nwhen  some housing agents can impose conditions or manage\r\n\r\nthe transactions on behalf of the purchasers, giving them\r\n\r\nlittle  room  to  reconsider  their  purchase.   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly so for those who are not so well educated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just highlight an example which came to my\r\n\r\nMPS which I have written to the HDB to investigate.  This\r\n\r\nis  the  case  of a person who is a cleaner earning  some\r\n\r\n$800  per month.  She sold her 3-room HDB flat and wanted\r\n\r\nto rent a HDB rental flat but was not able to do so.  She\r\n\r\nwas  in  a  desperate state.  Therefore, when  a  housing\r\n\r\nagent approached her, telling her that he could help  her\r\n\r\npurchase  her  5-room  flat, she  took  the  bait.   What\r\n\r\nhappens  is  this.  The agent made her sign a declaration\r\n\r\nthat  her  income  was something like $2,500  per  month.\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe agent made her sign documents to allow another person\r\n\r\nto  be  her  power  of attorney, which means  effectively\r\n\r\ntaking  the  decision of the purchase  from  her.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, she bought a 5-room flat and now she has seen  me\r\n\r\nsaying that she has difficulty servicing the loan.  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering how this case was processed at the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should take steps to inform housing\r\n\r\nagents  that they should be careful in the way they  help\r\n\r\nin  the  purchase  of  flats  and  we  should  not  allow\r\n\r\nunscrupulous housing agents and their associates to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  poorly  educated  residents  who  can   be\r\n\r\nunsuspecting of things.  I hope that HDB will  look  into\r\n\r\nthis  case  and  see how they can tighten up  the  resale\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Madam, although the\r\n\r\nlocal  residential market has declined over the last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  rental of premises from private owners  is  still\r\n\r\nout  of  reach for many low income families.   The  going\r\n\r\nrate  for  a single room in a HDB flat is about $300  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  Families who have low income can hardly afford to\r\n\r\npay  this  kind  of rent and have enough to  sustain  the\r\n\r\nhousehold  expenses  of a normal family.   Such  families\r\n\r\nnaturally  look to HDB and its current stock  of  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised  rental  flats.   To  qualify,  at  least  two\r\n\r\neligible  tenants must come together, their  income  must\r\n\r\nnot exceed $800 per month and they must not have owned  a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat  in the last 2 1/2 years.  However,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany families out there who fall between the cracks, that\r\n\r\nis,  they cannot afford to buy and own a flat for various\r\n\r\nreasons and yet do not qualify for a HDB rental flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families that fall within this category requiring\r\n\r\nrental  premises are those who have to sell their  flats,\r\n\r\nespecially in divorce cases and financial hardship cases,\r\n\r\nthose  who  cannot afford to pay the 20%  cash  lump  sum\r\n\r\ndownpayment to purchase a flat, those who do not  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  housing loan from HDB or commercial banks, and those\r\n\r\nwho  have lost their income and need some temporary  help\r\n\r\nto  adjust and sort out their financial commitments.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  understand  that HDB plans to scale  down  or  totally\r\n\r\nwithdraw from providing subsidised rental flats.  HDB has\r\n\r\njust  renovated the interior of most of its present stock\r\n\r\nof  rental  flats, upgraded them and will be offering  to\r\n\r\nsell them to sitting tenants.  This is a one-off exercise\r\n\r\nthat  will benefit the existing tenants and help them  to\r\n\r\nown their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these existing tenants are not, and will not, be\r\n\r\nthe  only  ones  needing affordable rental  flats.   Many\r\n\r\nother families needing such help will emerge from time to\r\n\r\ntime  as the product of the circumstances at the material\r\n\r\ntime.  I would like to ask the Minister whether HDB  will\r\n\r\nbe helping to provide a roof over their heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, going by the appeals\r\n\r\nI  get from my meet-the-people session, there seems to be\r\n\r\na  rise in the demand for HDB 1- and 2-room rental  flats\r\n\r\nfrom  three groups.  First, the elderly who want to  live\r\n\r\napart  from their children for various reasons, chief  of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  that  they could not get along,  causing  much\r\n\r\nunhappiness  within  their family.   Second,  the  single\r\n\r\nparents,  especially those who are recently divorced  and\r\n\r\nneed  a home of their own as their matrimonial flat  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be sold.   And third, those hit by the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn and who have to sell their flats to downgrade to\r\n\r\nrental flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, these are urgent cases requiring an\r\n\r\naffordable  roof over their heads.  I would also  foresee\r\n\r\nthat, as more lower-educated men stay single and as  they\r\n\r\nage,  they  too will look for rental flats.  As  we  know\r\n\r\nfrom  statistics,  for the men, it is the  lower-educated\r\n\r\nabove  40  who make up the majority of men who are  still\r\n\r\nsingle  and  who  are likely to remain single.   But  HDB\r\n\r\npolicy  for  rental flats is presently quite strict.   To\r\n\r\nqualify  for  a  rental flat, the total household  income\r\n\r\nmust not exceed $800, and those who have sold their flats\r\n\r\nin  the open market will be debarred from renting  a  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  for  30  months from the date of the  sale.   Also,\r\n\r\nthere needs to be a family nucleus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that HDB exercises flexibility on a case-by-case basis, and I am grateful\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the  occasional positive responses from  HDB  to  my\r\n\r\nappeals, on behalf of my residents.  But I do think  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  case for reviewing the criteria, especially\r\n\r\nthe income ceiling which is presently I think too low.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest raising it to at least $1,000  to  capture\r\n\r\nthose,  as  my colleague Mr Ong Kian Min said,  who  fall\r\n\r\nbetween the cracks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trends I cited stem from social problems, for\r\n\r\nexample, marriage break-ups or family problems, but  they\r\n\r\nare  often  not  in the control of those  affected.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  it  is no good telling the divorcee  that  she\r\n\r\nshould  have stayed married, or telling those hit by  the\r\n\r\nrecession  that they should not have bought  such  a  big\r\n\r\nflat  in  the first place.  They need solutions to  their\r\n\r\nhousing problems.  The more readily the rental flats  are\r\n\r\navailable, the more it would help them.  We do not want a\r\n\r\nsociety  where Singaporeans, especially those who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford it, need to have their cash tied up with property,\r\n\r\nleaving nothing for their old age.  If they want to  live\r\n\r\nprudently  and if that means living in rental  flats,  we\r\n\r\nshould give them that option more easily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge MND to review the criteria, especially\r\n\r\nthe  income  ceiling.  Also, can the Minister review  the\r\n\r\nsituation  of  rental flats to see if  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nflats to meet the demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the Singapore Government has been very successful\r\n\r\nin  implementing its \"Home for Everyone\"  policy.   There\r\n\r\nare  now about 85% Singaporeans who own their own  flats.\r\n\r\nHowever, I observe that there are still many flats in the\r\n\r\nwestern  part  of  Singapore which are unoccupied.   They\r\n\r\nhave been completed but for more than two years, they are\r\n\r\nstill not being occupied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the HDB should make some good use of these\r\n\r\nflats  by  renting  them  out to  those  who  need  these\r\n\r\napartments,  particularly those who  have  to  move  from\r\n\r\nother parts of Singapore to the west in order to be  near\r\n\r\nto  their work place.  This would make it more convenient\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fresh university graduates and young couples\r\n\r\nhave just joined the labour market. They cannot afford to\r\n\r\nbuy  their own flats because they have not enough CPF  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the downpayment.  Why should we force them  to  buy\r\n\r\nthe  flats?   Why  can  we  not have  more  rental  flats\r\n\r\navailable  to them near their places of work?   They  can\r\n\r\nrent  the  flats from HDB and it would be convenient  for\r\n\r\nthem  to go to work.  If they were to buy a flat  in  one\r\n\r\npart of Singapore and later on find a job in another part\r\n\r\nof  the island, they would have to either sell their flat\r\n\r\nand  buy another one nearby, or to pay through their nose\r\n\r\nto rent an apartment from a private landlord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, HDB has succeeded in providing some 85%\r\n\r\nof  our citizens with their own flats, a record which  is\r\n\r\nnot achieved by any other country in the world.  In other\r\n\r\ncountries,  the  majority of their citizens  are  renting\r\n\r\ntheir  accommodation.   Having already  achieved  such  a\r\n\r\nremarkable  record, we should not insist that our  people\r\n\r\nbuy  their own flats.  If a worker lives in Tampines  and\r\n\r\nworks in Jurong, why can we not allow him to rent a  flat\r\n\r\nin  Jurong?   Next  time, if his  work  is  relocated  to\r\n\r\nWoodlands, he can give up the tenancy in Jurong and  rent\r\n\r\na flat in Woodlands. He does not need to sell one flat to\r\n\r\nbuy  another one, and then sell the second flat to buy  a\r\n\r\nthird one, just to be near his place of work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many of my colleagues would agree with me\r\n\r\nthat  we  should raise the income ceiling for the  rental\r\n\r\nflats.   I  think  the current ceiling  of  $800  is  not\r\n\r\nrealistic.   Imagine a worker earning  $1,000  gets  only\r\n\r\n$800 take-home pay which is hardly enough to support  his\r\n\r\nfamily, yet he is not qualified to rent a flat from  HDB.\r\n\r\nI  suggest  that the Government should review  this.   We\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  successful  in  our  home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme.  It is time for us to build more rental flats  so\r\n\r\nthat the young couples would benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, current HDB rules allow\r\n\r\nonly households with income of not more than $800 a month\r\n\r\n-  which  I  think is roughly the bottom  10%  or  so  of\r\n\r\nhouseholds  - to rent flats from it.  For the segment  of\r\n\r\nthe population just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabove that level, the next cheapest option for them would\r\n\r\nbe to buy an entry level 4-room HDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the proportion of average monthly\r\n\r\nhousehold   income,   including   the   employer's    CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution,  spent servicing a typical 4-room  mortgage\r\n\r\nfor  this segment can be large, ranging somewhere between\r\n\r\n15%  and  34% by one estimate.  This results in pressure,\r\n\r\nnot  only felt by the worker, but also in his expectation\r\n\r\non nominal wages that he would seek from his company.  It\r\n\r\nalso  raises  the  reservation wage for those  unemployed\r\n\r\nwithin this group.  Yet, as we know, the global wage  for\r\n\r\npersons in this group would be low.  Therefore, this is a\r\n\r\ncost  issue that we should help address in order  to  aid\r\n\r\nthe process of tackling structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from help with housing purchase subsidies, the\r\n\r\noption of providing affordable rental public housing  for\r\n\r\na  larger  segment of the lower middle income  population\r\n\r\nshould   also   be  considered.   Besides  reducing   the\r\n\r\nhousehold   expenditure  for  this  segment   and   while\r\n\r\nacknowledging  the  importance  of  the  home   ownership\r\n\r\nprogramme,  it is beneficial, in my view,  to  allow  for\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  at  the lower  middle  end  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  in  view  of  a more uncertain  future  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To execute such a move, related administrative\r\n\r\npolicies defining eligibility for housing rental, such as\r\n\r\nthe  $800  income  ceiling, various  forms  of  debarment\r\n\r\nrules,  as  well  as assistance that can  be  offered  in\r\n\r\nfacilitating  these kinds of moves and  transfers,  would\r\n\r\nhave  got  to be reviewed.  I hope that MND can  consider\r\n\r\nthese suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, HDB rental\r\n\r\nflats have always been seen as a haven for our low income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  They are meant for those deserving,  and  thus\r\n\r\nHDB  has  set out clear and stiff rules that  govern  the\r\n\r\noperations that allow people to rent HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of my colleagues before me, I would like\r\n\r\nto  highlight one of the groups that is affected  by  the\r\n\r\ncurrent policy, ie, the plight of the single parents with\r\n\r\ntheir  children.   Often  times,  these  are  the  single\r\n\r\nmothers and their children who are affected.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  30-month debarment period, they have little  option;\r\n\r\noften  times,  the woman is left with her  children  with\r\n\r\nnowhere to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen several cases of my residents who live\r\n\r\nlike  nomads, moving from one relative's home to another,\r\n\r\nsometimes squatting at friends' homes and, after a while,\r\n\r\nthey  would have just exhausted their options of informal\r\n\r\nsupport  providers.  In fact, I just saw  one  last  week\r\n\r\nwhen  I was doing my block visit.  She has three children\r\n\r\nand  she has been moving from one place to another, often\r\n\r\nrelying on the sympathies of others.  The impact  on  the\r\n\r\nchildren  is  negative and undesirable.  The irregularity\r\n\r\nand instability will affect their development.  Can we be\r\n\r\nmore  sympathetic  to  the  plight  of  such  women   and\r\n\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all know that they receive little or no\r\n\r\nmaintenance from their ex-husbands.  Because of the  lack\r\n\r\nof  education and skills, they face difficulty in looking\r\n\r\nfor jobs and, even if they have jobs, these jobs pay very\r\n\r\nlittle.   Certainly,  they will qualify  for  the  rental\r\n\r\nflats based on their income.  But they are stuck, due  to\r\n\r\nthe 30-month debarment period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate HDB's response. It does not want\r\n\r\nto  encourage  people  to abuse the  system  as  it  will\r\n\r\nencourage  people  to see divorce as an  easy  option  as\r\n\r\nhousing  is readily available after that.  This  argument\r\n\r\nwill stand only if people's sole motivation to divorce is\r\n\r\nto enable them to rent a flat.  Madam, divorce is complex\r\n\r\nand  does  not happen overnight.  Social workers,  family\r\n\r\nand marital therapists will tell us that sometimes it  is\r\n\r\nbetter for an acrimonious couple to separate than to live\r\n\r\ntogether.   While  we  want to strengthen  our  families,\r\n\r\nsometimes  couples  are better off divorced.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that making the rental policy more flexible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto accommodate the single mothers and their children will\r\n\r\nlead  to  higher divorce rates.  Certainly,  reasons  for\r\n\r\ndivorce  vary.   I am asking for some flexibility  to  be\r\n\r\nexercised for the genuine cases who do not have any means\r\n\r\nof purchasing their own flats.  The open rental market is\r\n\r\njust  too  expensive for them.  Let us  do  a  little  to\r\n\r\nlighten  the  burden of these families,  to  allow  their\r\n\r\nchildren to experience some stability in their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure HDB will also say that the number of\r\n\r\nrental flats is limited and that there is already a  long\r\n\r\nwaiting list.  As of March 2002, I understand that  there\r\n\r\nwere  more than 55,000 rental flats, most of which are  1\r\n\r\nto  3  rooms.  This is not a small number.   One  of  the\r\n\r\ncriteria,  as  mentioned previously, is the  $800  income\r\n\r\nceiling.   Since rental flats are heavily  subsidised,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to find out what proportion of the tenants are\r\n\r\nthose  who really deserve these rental flats.  There  are\r\n\r\nthose  who earn less than $800 per month.  They may  have\r\n\r\nqualified  initially,  but their  economic  circumstances\r\n\r\nhave  improved over the years and they are still  staying\r\n\r\nin those rental flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does HDB check their incomes regularly and determine\r\n\r\nif  they are still suitable tenants of the rental  flats?\r\n\r\nIf  the  supply  of  rental flats is considered  limited,\r\n\r\nperhaps  HDB should do regular monitoring of  the  income\r\n\r\nlevels  of  its  tenants to ensure that  only  those  who\r\n\r\nreally are low income families are allowed to rent flats,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the heavy subsidies, and encourage those  who\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to actually purchase their own  flats,  thus\r\n\r\nfreeing the flats for more deserving residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, there were five\r\n\r\nspeakers  on  rental  flats.

Members have raised  a  very\r\n\r\nbroad  range  of  issues on HDB, and  many  of  them,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, have spoken on the restructuring of  HDB  and\r\n\r\nits role thereafter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me, first of all, respond to their\r\n\r\nconcerns  about  the  role of HDB and the  restructuring.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  during  the Committee of  Supply  debate,  I\r\n\r\nannounced  that, as part of our review of the  roles  and\r\n\r\nfunctions of HDB, we were looking into the feasibility of\r\n\r\ncorporatising  HDB's  Building and  Development  Division\r\n\r\n(BDD).   Last  month,  I  announced  our  plans  for  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of HDB, ie, from 1st July this  year,  BDD\r\n\r\nwill  be  reorganised and a new company to be called  HDB\r\n\r\nCorporation Pte Ltd (HDB Corp) will be set up.  HDB  will\r\n\r\nfocus on its role as the public housing authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a major change for the organisation. The HDB\r\n\r\nwas  set  up in 1960 to tackle the acute housing shortage\r\n\r\nfacing  Singapore  at  that  time.   There  was  a   very\r\n\r\ninteresting  piece in yesterday's Sunday Times  by  Susan\r\n\r\nLong,  entitled  \"The HDB Story\".  It was  a  fascinating\r\n\r\nstory  of HDB's early days as told by its first Chairman,\r\n\r\nMr Lim Kim San.  As Mr Lim recalled:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At that time, when the HDB first came into being,\r\n\r\nonly  9%  of  Singaporeans lived in  low-cost  Government\r\n\r\nhousing.   The  rest subsisted in overcrowded  slums  and\r\n\r\nsquatter  colonies which were breeding grounds for  crime\r\n\r\nand gangsterism.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this was not too long ago - in fact,\r\n\r\ncertainly within living memory - and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  many  Members of this House would  have  had\r\n\r\npersonal experience of such conditions.  I myself  recall\r\n\r\nat  various  times of my childhood sharing  a  room  with\r\n\r\neight  or  nine  others in a shophouse in  Bugis  Street,\r\n\r\nlater  on  in  an attap hut in Lorong Ah Soo  in  Hougang\r\n\r\nwithout   running  water  or  electricity  and,  finally,\r\n\r\ngrowing  up  in an SIT flat in Kim Keat Avenue.   By  the\r\n\r\nway, all these three places have disappeared, replaced by\r\n\r\na  shopping  centre  in  the case  of  the  Bugis  Street\r\n\r\nshophouse, and by new HDB flats in the other two cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the challenges faced by HDB were formidable\r\n\r\nones.  It had to build thousands of flats in record time.\r\n\r\nIt  had to acquire land for housing estates, making  many\r\n\r\nlandowners  very,  very upset.  In fact,  some  of  these\r\n\r\nlandowners were PAP supporters.  But, despite their loss,\r\n\r\nmany  of  them today still remain loyal to the  PAP.   It\r\n\r\nalso  had  to  resettle  people  from  squatter  huts  in\r\n\r\nkampongs to high-rise flats.  Again, in this article,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim was quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When HDB first relocated 80 squatter families along\r\n\r\nKim  Seng  Road to brand-new flats in nearby  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nmore  than half of them moved back to their squatter huts\r\n\r\nin  less  than six months because they were not  used  to\r\n\r\nliving in high-rise apartments.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Mr Lim, HDB overcame the\r\n\r\nodds  and  succeeded in breaking the back of the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem.   The Senior Minister, then Prime Minister,  who\r\n\r\nappointed  Mr  Lim as Chairman of HDB in 1960,  paid  him\r\n\r\nthis tribute:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was crucial, life and death. If we failed, we\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  re-elected.  This was the first  year  of\r\n\r\noffice of the PAP.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it was as much a tribute to Mr Lim as it was\r\n\r\nto the many men and women who worked in HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, over time, HDB housing became more widely\r\n\r\naccepted.   For the first time, many Singaporeans  became\r\n\r\nproud  home  owners.  Older MPs recalled how  they  would\r\n\r\nofficiate  at  ballotting  exercises  for  allocation  of\r\n\r\nflats,  and  residents who were successful in the  ballot\r\n\r\nthanked them profusely for their good fortune.  With home\r\n\r\nownership, people began to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  tangible stake in this country.  Today, almost nine in\r\n\r\n<br><br>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are HDB dwellers.  Almost all of them own\r\n\r\ntheir own flats.  These are not tiny flats either.  If we\r\n\r\ncompare  the flats in Singapore with those in, say,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  or  even in Tokyo or Seoul, our flats are luxurious\r\n\r\nby  comparison.   Each  Singaporean  has  about,  on  the\r\n\r\naverage,  20-25 square metres of living space.   This  is\r\n\r\ndouble what a resident would enjoy in Tokyo or Seoul,  or\r\n\r\nthree  times what a public housing resident would  enjoy,\r\n\r\nsay, in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of HDB towns has also won international\r\n\r\nrecognition.   Among the many awards, I  am  particularly\r\n\r\nproud  obviously because Tampines Town was conferred  the\r\n\r\nUN World Habitat Award in 1991, and this was against very\r\n\r\nstrong competition from places like Vancouver and Boston.\r\n\r\nWe  received many, many foreign dignitaries.  They  visit\r\n\r\nus,  our  housing estates and the HDB.   They  come  from\r\n\r\nChina,  India,  Mauritius,  Mozambique,  Pakistan,  South\r\n\r\nAfrica and the UK.  Without exception, they have all been\r\n\r\nimpressed by our public housing achievements.  By housing\r\n\r\nthe   large  majority  of  Singaporeans  in  quality  and\r\n\r\naffordable  flats, HDB has contributed  significantly  to\r\n\r\nour nation-building efforts.\r\n\r\nMadam, Members may well ask: if that is the case, why are\r\n\r\nwe  tinkering with something that is not only not  broken\r\n\r\nbut  has  been extremely successful in what it  does?   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is a valid question.  Let me assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  this  decision to restructure  HDB  was  not  taken\r\n\r\nlightly.   The fact of the matter is that the  world  has\r\n\r\nchanged,  and  Singapore  has  changed  with   it.    The\r\n\r\nSingapore of today is different from the Singapore of the\r\n\r\n60s,  70s,  80s or even the 90s.  Inevitably,  this  must\r\n\r\naffect our public housing programme in many ways.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see three reasons why the HDB has to change.\r\n\r\nFirstly, economic reasons.  We have seen dramatic  shifts\r\n\r\nin the demand for public housing over the last 5-10\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyears.   For  example, in April 1997, at  its  peak,  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list  for  HDB flats under the Registration  for\r\n\r\nFlat  System (RFS) was 146,000.  About half of them  were\r\n\r\nfirst-timers.  In January 2002, slightly over a year ago,\r\n\r\nthe  waiting list fell to 12,000, slightly less than 10%.\r\n\r\nIn  1997, HDB was building more than 13,000 flats a year.\r\n\r\nLast year, its building programme was zero.  HDB did  not\r\n\r\nbuild  any  flats  as it focused on clearing  the  excess\r\n\r\nstock.   No  organisation which  faces  such  changes  in\r\n\r\ndemand  can say that it does not want to change, that  it\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to  stay the same.  The  volatility  in  the\r\n\r\ndemand  makes  it  difficult  for  any  organisation   or\r\n\r\ndeveloper, including HDB, to manage its staffing  or  its\r\n\r\nresources properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this drop in demand temporary, one might ask. I\r\n\r\ndo  not think so.  The demand from first-timers is likely\r\n\r\nto  remain  fairly constant, in tandem with the household\r\n\r\nformation  rate.   But  the days of  hectic  churning,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, are over.  The demand from second-timers is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  to return to the levels of the mid-90s.  This  is\r\n\r\ndue  mainly  to the various policy changes that  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced.  These include revisions to the  resale  levy\r\n\r\nand  also the imposition of that 10-year time bar  before\r\n\r\nhouseholds  can  apply for their second subsidised  flat.\r\n\r\nToday,  the property market is more stable, generally  in\r\n\r\nline  with economic growth.  And with the switch  to  the\r\n\r\nBuild-to-Order system which I will elaborate later on  in\r\n\r\nmy speech, it can be more responsive to certain shifts in\r\n\r\ndemand from HDB flat buyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I believe HDB has to change is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  social reasons.  As Members are well  aware,\r\n\r\nHDB  is  already  housing 85% of Singaporeans.   We  have\r\n\r\nalready far exceeded what we first set out to do when HDB\r\n\r\nwas  formed in 1960.  Can we do more? Should we  aim  to,\r\n\r\nsay,  house  90-95% of the population in public  housing?\r\n\r\nSuch a target is not realistic.  We must expect that,  as\r\n\r\nour  population  becomes better educated and  as  incomes\r\n\r\nrise,  most Singaporeans will aspire to private  housing.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of  housing  stock today,  the  public-private\r\n\r\nhousing  mix  has fallen from about 86%:14%  in  1990  to\r\n\r\nabout 81%:19% today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  could  fall even further to 75%:25% in the medium  to\r\n\r\nlong-term.   Even  for public housing, it  is  timely  to\r\n\r\nconsider  how  we  can allow the private  sector  greater\r\n\r\nparticipation, provide more choices for HDB flat buyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, political reasons. As our economy and society\r\n\r\nmature,  we need to encourage entrepreneurship and  risk-taking.  We  need  to promote greater  self-reliance  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  among those who can fend for  themselves.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the third main reason for change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public housing is a significant part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's social safety net to provide a roof over our\r\n\r\npeople's   heads.   We  should  ask  ourselves,  however,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  created  too  big  a  safety  net  and\r\n\r\ninadvertently encouraged a dependency mindset amongst our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get worried when I come across cases, either at my\r\n\r\nown  meet-the-people  sessions or when  other  MPs  bring\r\n\r\ntheir cases to me, of elderly parents who are thrown  out\r\n\r\nof  their homes by their children and told to go and look\r\n\r\nfor  HDB to solve their problem.  It is not because  that\r\n\r\nthere is not enough space in their flats.  In some cases,\r\n\r\nthe  children  are  staying  in  4-  or  5-room  or  even\r\n\r\nExecutive  flats.  There are some in financial difficulty\r\n\r\nwho can help themselves but, again, insist that HDB break\r\n\r\nthe  rules for them. Then, there are those who expect and\r\n\r\ndemand  HDB  to  repair the spalling  concrete  in  their\r\n\r\nflats,  even though their flats are 20 years  old.   When\r\n\r\nceilings  leak after 10 years, flat lessees  insist  that\r\n\r\nHDB fix it free-of-charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall a resident who bought a flat from the\r\n\r\nresale market and then demanded that HDB rectify all  the\r\n\r\ndefects  in his flat, even though they were due  to  wear\r\n\r\nand  tear.  I read the letter twice to make sure  that  I\r\n\r\nhad  got  it  correct.  He had actually bought  a  resale\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, HDB has developed a culture of\r\n\r\ncompassion and concern and it instinctively seeks to help\r\n\r\nits  residents whenever it is required to do so.  Members\r\n\r\nof this House have acknowledged this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLast  year, Mr Ahmad Khalis told this House, and I quote,\r\n\r\n\"We have the HDB bending backwards, sideways, forward, in\r\n\r\nall directions, to help accommodate the awkward positions\r\n\r\nthat the HDB flat owner is in\".  Even Mr Low Thia Khiang,\r\n\r\nin   one   of   his   questions  during  Question   Time,\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that HDB does, on compassion grounds,  help\r\n\r\nresidents who are in financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that every MP's appeal is\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   Indeed, I still remember Ms Indranee  Rajah\r\n\r\ntelling this House that it is easier for a camel to  pass\r\n\r\nthrough the eye of a needle than it is for her appeals to\r\n\r\nsucceed.  The truth is somewhere in between. The issue is\r\n\r\nhow  to  distinguish between the genuine appeals and  the\r\n\r\nnot-so-genuine.  HDB will continue to hone its  instincts\r\n\r\nin this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must ask ourselves: is it healthy to have a\r\n\r\nsafety net that catches everyone regardless of need?  Can\r\n\r\nwe  afford  this  in future when increasing  demands  are\r\n\r\nplaced on our resources by an aging population? What does\r\n\r\nit do to our drive for self-reliance and risk-taking?  We\r\n\r\nneed  to change this mindset among Singaporeans.  It will\r\n\r\ntake  time,  but  we  must  start  somewhere.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nfundamental part of our remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to provide a public\r\n\r\nhousing social safety net. We will help Singaporeans  own\r\n\r\ntheir  first home.  We will make sure that it is  a  good\r\n\r\nhome,  a quality home. We will make it worth their  while\r\n\r\nto  upgrade to new homes, or else, we will upgrade  their\r\n\r\nhomes for them.  But this safety net should be refined at\r\n\r\nthe edges to focus on those who are in genuine need.  For\r\n\r\nthose  who can look after themselves, they must start  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the restructuring of HDB.\r\n\r\nGoing  forward, we need to make HDB more focused  on  its\r\n\r\ncore  functions and also make it more flexible in meeting\r\n\r\nthe  changing housing needs of our people.  The HDB still\r\n\r\nhas  a  major role to play in planning and executing  our\r\n\r\nhome  ownership policies.  It has to ensure  that  public\r\n\r\nhousing subsidies are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisbursed  equitably.  It has to ensure that quality  and\r\n\r\naffordable flats are built, even though it does not build\r\n\r\nit  itself.  It has to make sure that leases are properly\r\n\r\nadministered   and  that  towns  with   good   supporting\r\n\r\namenities  are  planned  and developed  to  meet  demand.\r\n\r\nFinally,  it  has  to make sure that  older  estates  are\r\n\r\nsystematically renewed and revitalised so  that  cohesive\r\n\r\nand vibrant communities will continue to evolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, when I announced plans for restructuring HDB\r\n\r\nlast year, I had two main concerns. First, the quality of\r\n\r\nservice  must  not  suffer.  If anything,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nenhanced.  And second, the morale of the staff  must  not\r\n\r\nsuffer. The two are inter-related.  The quality of  staff\r\n\r\nservice will suffer if staff morale is poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered various options in the restructuring\r\n\r\nof HDB.  The first option was to do the minimal, to carry\r\n\r\non  with  HDB's present structure but to retrench surplus\r\n\r\nstaff  in the Building and Development Division (BDD)  to\r\n\r\nmatch  the building programme.  But this option is not  a\r\n\r\nlong-term solution.  HDB staff will need to be retrenched\r\n\r\neach time the building programme slows down. When private\r\n\r\nsector  participation in public housing  is  stepped  up,\r\n\r\nthere will be further retrenchments. There will be a  lot\r\n\r\nof uncertainty. Staff will be thoroughly demoralised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option was to corporatise BDD, turn it\r\n\r\ninto  a  company,  unlock  its value.  BDD  has  talented\r\n\r\npeople,  with years of experience, whose skills would  be\r\n\r\nin demand in many other countries.  It has a track record\r\n\r\nthat  few  organisations  around  the  world  can  match.\r\n\r\nCorporatisation of BDD will allow it to leverage  on  its\r\n\r\nstrength  and  capitalise  on the  HDB's  brand  name  to\r\n\r\nventure  overseas, especially in rapid growing  countries\r\n\r\nlike  China and India.  We decided on this second option,\r\n\r\nie, to corporatise BDD.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we had to decide how to corporatise BDD.\r\n\r\nAgain, we had two options,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntwo ways of doing it.  One way was for the new entity  to\r\n\r\nhire  the  staff on HDB's existing terms and  conditions.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  option,  staff  joining  BDD  would  not  be\r\n\r\nretrenched, they would not get the SRS, but they would be\r\n\r\nguaranteed  a  job, with no loss of pay or  seniority  or\r\n\r\nother  benefits.  This option would create problems  down\r\n\r\nthe  road.   The new corporatised entity will be  saddled\r\n\r\nwith high cost and it would not be nimble and flexible in\r\n\r\nreacting to changing housing preferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way was for HDB to offer voluntary early\r\n\r\nretirement   to  all  its  staff  through   the   Special\r\n\r\nResignation Scheme (SRS) of the civil service.  Those who\r\n\r\nremained,   would   be  redeployed   within   HDB's   new\r\n\r\norganisation structure, based on its new role.  Those who\r\n\r\nopted  for  SRS  and  decided to join the  new  corporate\r\n\r\nentity of BDD, ie, HDB Corp, would do so on new terms and\r\n\r\nconditions.  In other words, HDB Corp would start off  on\r\n\r\na  clean  slate.   It  would not  take  over  HDB's  cost\r\n\r\nstructure.   It would not take over terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nof  service that HDB used to offer.  We decided to  adopt\r\n\r\nthis  method.   This is a more complicated  option,  more\r\n\r\neffort  and  time are needed to retrain and  to  redeploy\r\n\r\nstaff,  but  it  is  a  win-win for  the  staff  and  the\r\n\r\norganisation.   It is fair to HDB staff.   It  shows  our\r\n\r\nappreciation to them, for their years of service.  It  is\r\n\r\nfair  to  HDB  as it allows them to cut cost, streamline,\r\n\r\nrefocus.  And, finally, it is fair to the new company  as\r\n\r\nit  gives  them  and  their staff a  fighting  chance  to\r\n\r\nsucceed,  with  no guarantee of success, but  with  every\r\n\r\nconfidence  that  they will succeed.   And,  if  they  do\r\n\r\nsucceed, they would once again bring value to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has recently been some public discussion on\r\n\r\nwhether we were actually too generous towards HDB  staff,\r\n\r\nespecially  those who leave HDB under  the  SRS  and  are\r\n\r\nsubsequently re-employed.  A few Members have also raised\r\n\r\nthis.   Let  me explain why I believe these concerns  are\r\n\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB staff are public service officers, with tenures\r\n\r\nuntil retirement.  The SRS\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecognises  this reasonable expectation of  employees  of\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and civil servants.  In previous  public\r\n\r\nservice restructuring exercises, eg, in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  all  staff  were given  the  option  to  join\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals on terms that were no  worse  off\r\n\r\nthan what they were getting.  However, in the case of HDB\r\n\r\nCorp  there  is  no guarantee of a job for  all.   Ex-HDB\r\n\r\nstaff  who are accepted by HDB Corp would be employed  on\r\n\r\nfresh terms.  They would be no different from others  who\r\n\r\nreceive  benefits,  leave HDB and join  another  company.\r\n\r\nSo,  whether  they  join XYZ or HDB Corp  they  would  be\r\n\r\ngetting  their retrenchment benefits and then they  would\r\n\r\nbe  joining the new company, if they agree to those terms\r\n\r\nand conditions.  So the offer of SRS is not unreasonable,\r\n\r\nnor is it unduly generous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, one of the considerations in\r\n\r\nthis  exercise  was to maintain the high  morale  of  the\r\n\r\norganisation and the high level of service to the  staff.\r\n\r\nSo we took a decision to keep staff informed, as early as\r\n\r\npossible,  as  openly  as  possible,  and  as  fully   as\r\n\r\npossible,  to  dispel  any  uncertainty  and  quash   any\r\n\r\nunnecessary  rumours.  The CEO met all  8,000  staff,  in\r\n\r\ngroups  of  500,  16  sessions in  all,  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  process.   HDB management  worked  closely\r\n\r\nwith   the   HDB   Staff  Union.   There   were   various\r\n\r\ncommunication channels open to staff to provide feedback.\r\n\r\nDuring the briefings, via direct emails, there was even a\r\n\r\ndedicated   staff  hot-line.   A  counsellor   was   made\r\n\r\navailable for staff who were affected by the changes  and\r\n\r\nneeded assistance.  As a result of a combination of early\r\n\r\nretirement and redeployment, HDB's staff survey indicates\r\n\r\nthat  there  may  be no need for HDB to retrench  anyone.\r\n\r\nMadam, in a major restructuring exercise such as this,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  is  an outcome which both  management  and\r\n\r\nstaff of HDB would welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the cost of the restructuring of\r\n\r\nHDB.   I  am afraid that I am not able at this  point  in\r\n\r\ntime to give a definitive answer because the exact number\r\n\r\nof staff leaving under the SRS would only be confirmed by\r\n\r\nthe end of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMay, and it is only at that point in time that we will be\r\n\r\nable to determine the cost of this exercise.  But, in any\r\n\r\ncase,  let me make this point.  This cost will eventually\r\n\r\nbe  recovered through a reduction in HDB's manpower  cost\r\n\r\nin subsequent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go on to address some of the other\r\n\r\nspecific  issues  regarding HDB Corp  that  Members  have\r\n\r\nraised.   The  HDB  Corp  will focus  on  four  strategic\r\n\r\nbusiness   areas,  namely,  building  and  infrastructure\r\n\r\nconsultancy work, including architectural and engineering\r\n\r\nworks   and   project  management;  integrated   township\r\n\r\ndevelopment; property development and the acquisition and\r\n\r\nmarketing  of  construction technology  solutions.   Some\r\n\r\nMPs,  eg, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Ang Mong Seng, amongst  others,\r\n\r\nhave  raised the concern that HDB Corp will compete  with\r\n\r\nfirms in the private sector and take away their business.\r\n\r\nI  do not think there is a need for private developers to\r\n\r\nbe  unduly worried.  In fact, the corporatisation of  BDD\r\n\r\npaves  the way for private developers to be more involved\r\n\r\nin the development of public housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public housing building programme will be\r\n\r\ngradually opened up to the private sector - 10%  in  year\r\n\r\n4,  beginning July 2006, 30% in year 5 and 50% in year 6.\r\n\r\nHDB  Corp,  through its subsidiary CESMA,  will  only  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  compete with the private sector for  non-HDB\r\n\r\nprojects in year 5.  The volume of projects in the public\r\n\r\nhousing  sector is large, compared to the volume  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  property sector.  So private companies are  more\r\n\r\nlikely to gain from the outsourcing of HDB projects  than\r\n\r\nHDB  Corp would from being allowed to compete locally  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  But, in fact, the  more  important\r\n\r\nmarket  for  HDB Corp is not in Singapore, but  overseas.\r\n\r\nSo HDB Corp's focus will be on the overseas market.  This\r\n\r\nphased approach that I mentioned earlier will ensure that\r\n\r\nthere   is  minimal  disruption  to  the  public  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme in the initial period of liberalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked, for example, whether the pace of\r\n\r\noutsourcing  can be accelerated.  My answer  is  that  we\r\n\r\nwill monitor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis outsourcing programme and, if it is going well, I do\r\n\r\nnot   see  any  reason  why  we  cannot  accelerate   the\r\n\r\nprogramme.  In any case, my Ministry has made it clear to\r\n\r\nHDB  Corp  that  there  is no moratorium  and  that  this\r\n\r\noutsourcing programme may be varied, depending on  policy\r\n\r\ndictates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in the longer term, such a move, I believe,\r\n\r\nis   a   big   plus  for  Singaporeans.    With   greater\r\n\r\ncompetition,  it  will  result  in  greater  choice   and\r\n\r\nvariety,  more  innovation in building  and  design,  and\r\n\r\nbetter value for money for flat buyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about private sector\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the implementation of  estate  renewal\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   The formation of HDB Corp will  not  change\r\n\r\nthe  level  of private sector involvement in  our  estate\r\n\r\nrenewal  programmes,  at least  in  the  beginning.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  for  precincts that are selected for  MUP,  the\r\n\r\nadviser  can  continue to choose between HDB  or  private\r\n\r\nsector  architects  to  design their  upgrading  package.\r\n\r\nBut,  over time, as the implementation moves forward,  we\r\n\r\nwill study how we can outsource more of such works to the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked about the value of the\r\n\r\ncontracts  to be allocated to HDB Corp in the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears.  Again, I must apologise that I cannot give him  a\r\n\r\nspecific  answer  because  HDB's  building  plan   really\r\n\r\ndepends on the actual demand for flats, and the number of\r\n\r\nupgrading   projects  is  dependent   on   the   economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  So, it is difficult, at this point  in  time,\r\n\r\nto estimate what that number will be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me assure Members that the restructuring\r\n\r\nof HDB will be implemented carefully.  I do not want this\r\n\r\nto   create  unnecessary  upheaval  on  the  ground,  so,\r\n\r\ntherefore, this should have minimal impact on the public.\r\n\r\nThe  new  HDB  Corp  will continue  to  carry  out  HDB's\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme  in  the  initial  years.   HDB,  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board, will continue to serve  the  public  in\r\n\r\nareas   such   as   the   sale  of   flats   that   needs\r\n\r\nadministration.  We will ensure that the fundamentals  of\r\n\r\npublic housing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  preserved,  and that Singaporeans will  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy high quality public housing at affordable prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the issue of bank\r\n\r\norigination  and the financing of HDB flats.   To  enable\r\n\r\nHDB  to  focus  on  its core functions, we  reviewed  and\r\n\r\nimplemented  the  bank origination  of  HDB  market  rate\r\n\r\nloans,  which took effect from 1st January this year.   I\r\n\r\nexplained to this House last year why we needed to go for\r\n\r\nbank  origination.  It is in line with our  move  towards\r\n\r\ngreater  self-reliance and responsibility on the part  of\r\n\r\nindividual  flat buyers.  Of course, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthose  who  take  bank  loans  can  also  expect  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in the use of their flats.   So  we  relaxed\r\n\r\nsome  of the rules and regulations regarding the  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir flats.  Flat buyers who take bank loans, of course,\r\n\r\nwould   be  subject  to  the  bank's  mortgage  financial\r\n\r\npolicies.  And, that is why I have cautioned flat  buyers\r\n\r\nwho  are taking bank loans to exercise financial prudence\r\n\r\nand to buy a flat within their means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bank origination, the Government is pulling\r\n\r\nback  the  safety net a little bit, at the  fringes,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  should not need that safety net in the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  in  other words, the financially better  off,  or\r\n\r\nthose  who  already own a flat.  At the same  time,  bank\r\n\r\norigination  has given HDB flat buyers, who  take  market\r\n\r\nrate  loans, greater choice in their mortgage  financing.\r\n\r\nThey  have  greater flexibility and leeway in the  resale\r\n\r\nand  the  use of their flats as we have recently  relaxed\r\n\r\nthe rules.  So those taking bank loans, for example, will\r\n\r\nhave  a  shorter  minimum  occupation  period,  one  year\r\n\r\ninstead  of  two and a half years, before they  can  sell\r\n\r\ntheir flat, and they will also be allowed to sublet their\r\n\r\nwhole flat after occupying it for ten years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to inform this House that the bank\r\n\r\norigination scheme has proceeded smoothly, with banks and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions offering attractive  packages  to\r\n\r\nflat  buyers  and  lessees.  To-date,  HDB  has  received\r\n\r\nnearly  3,000  resale applications and new flat  bookings\r\n\r\nwith bank loans, and another 2,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHDB  market rate mortgages out of about 100,000, who have\r\n\r\nrefinanced their loans with the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from the banks indicates that many flat\r\n\r\nbuyers are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude.   They\r\n\r\nwant  to  see  whether there are better offers  available\r\n\r\nbefore  committing to a flat purchase.  As such, I expect\r\n\r\nthe volume to pick up as the situation in the loan market\r\n\r\nstabilises.   I  would like to assure  Members,  like  Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki and Mdm Cynthia Phua, that bank origination of HDB\r\n\r\nmarket  rate  loans does not detract from our  policy  of\r\n\r\nproviding   subsidised  housing  for  the   majority   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   HDB  will continue to provide  subsidised\r\n\r\nloans to eligible flat buyers.  Indeed, Members may  wish\r\n\r\nto  know  that  this is the bulk of the  loans  that  are\r\n\r\ngranted for the purchase of HDB flats.  About 60% of  the\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans  last year, for example, granted  by  HDB\r\n\r\nwere concessionary rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether the\r\n\r\nreview of HDB's functions will cover other areas, such as\r\n\r\ncar  parks,  industrial properties, commercial properties\r\n\r\nand so on.  Madam, this restructuring exercise is a major\r\n\r\nmilestone in HDB's history.  We do not expect to make any\r\n\r\nmore  changes  of this nature.  But HDB cannot  remain  a\r\n\r\nstatic  organisation.  We will continue to  review  HDB's\r\n\r\nrules, its role and functions as circumstances change.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give Members an idea of the review that is\r\n\r\nongoing,  take  the branch office, for  example.   Branch\r\n\r\noffices  play a very important role on the ground.   They\r\n\r\ncoordinate between residents, Members of Parliament,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and HDB.  We recognise the value that they  add\r\n\r\non  the ground, and this is the reason why the operations\r\n\r\nand   functions  of  the  branch  office  are  constantly\r\n\r\nreviewed in order to improve the level of service to  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB carparks are planned and built to serve HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.  They are heavily\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and,  currently,  there  are  no   plans   to\r\n\r\ncorporatise HDB's carparks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now move on to the sale of HDB flats.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have mentioned earlier in my response, the  demand\r\n\r\nfor  HDB  flats is volatile.  In 1997, there were 146,000\r\n\r\non  the  waiting list.  The waiting time  for  new  flats\r\n\r\ncould be four or even five years.  Last year, we had  the\r\n\r\nreverse  situation.  There was an overhang of unsold  HDB\r\n\r\nflats, and we had to implement a walk-in selection scheme\r\n\r\nwhere  people could just walk in and buy a flat  off  the\r\n\r\nshelf.   There  is an overhang which we are now  steadily\r\n\r\nclearing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queuing system has worked well. When demand was\r\n\r\nhigh,  it  provided applicants with greater certainty  in\r\n\r\napplying  for  new  homes.  But it was  not  sufficiently\r\n\r\nresponsive to sudden shifts in demand.  So, we  have  now\r\n\r\nswitched from the RFS to Build-to-Order (BTO) system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTO system better matches the flat supply to\r\n\r\nbuyers'  needs and preferences in terms of the  location,\r\n\r\nthe  flat type and the design. Under this system, the HDB\r\n\r\nwill  call  tender for construction only if a  sufficient\r\n\r\nnumber of flats have been booked.  If the take-up is  too\r\n\r\nlow,  HDB will not award the contract.  Instead, it  will\r\n\r\nredesign   the  contract  according  to  the  needs   and\r\n\r\npreferences  of applicants.  And, if necessary,  it  will\r\n\r\nalso  make  adjustments to the flat mix.  Dr Teo  Ho  Pin\r\n\r\nasked, for example, whether HDB can consider providing  a\r\n\r\nbetter  mix  of  flats for each BTO project,  eg,  5-room\r\n\r\nflats, studio apartments and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more recent BTO offer in December last year,\r\n\r\nwe  only offered 4-room flats, because that was where the\r\n\r\ndemand was.  We still have an excess supply of 5-room and\r\n\r\nlarger flats.  But once the supply and the demand of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  have  reached a steady state,  we  will  certainly\r\n\r\nconsider offering other flat types, such as 5-room  flats\r\n\r\nunder  the  BTO.   As  for  studio  apartments,  HDB  has\r\n\r\nrecently announced that it will pilot the integration  of\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments with other flat types in a  few  sites\r\n\r\nwhere there is a high proportion of the elderly.  So,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe   can   also   similarly  consider  including   studio\r\n\r\napartments in BTO projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether HDB can sell surplus\r\n\r\nSERS replacement flats more quickly.  Let me explain that\r\n\r\nSERS  replacement  flats  are  still  needed  to  rehouse\r\n\r\naffected lessees from other SERS sites.   Nevertheless, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  assure her that HDB will  release  these\r\n\r\nsurplus units for sale as soon as it is practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua has also asked whether we can sell flats on\r\n\r\na   daily  basis.   I  will  ask  HDB  to  consider  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  She asked whether we can sell flats  without\r\n\r\nsubsidies  -  sell all the surplus flats, put them on the\r\n\r\nmarket at market price.   Is that correct?  Was that what\r\n\r\nshe said?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am not so sure whether the private\r\n\r\nsector  developers are going to be very happy  with  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.   But,  in  any  case,  I  am  positive   and\r\n\r\nconfident that the surplus flats that we are seeing today\r\n\r\n-   the  huge overhang that we had, say,  two years  ago,\r\n\r\nwhich has been slowly whittled down  -  will be sold  off\r\n\r\nin  time.  We now have slightly less than half the number\r\n\r\nof flats left from the time when we first started, and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that, over time, in the next two years  or  so,\r\n\r\nsuch  flats will be sold.  So, I do not think Mdm  Phua's\r\n\r\nsuggestion is a tenable one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the resale levy, Dr Teo asked if we could waive\r\n\r\nthe  resale levy for various categories of flat  lessees,\r\n\r\neg,  those who sold their flat below the purchase  price.\r\n\r\nLet  me explain why we have the resale levy  in the first\r\n\r\nplace.   When  second timers sell their first  subsidised\r\n\r\nflat, they would have cashed in on the subsidy that  they\r\n\r\nenjoyed  on  their first flat.  So, they are required  to\r\n\r\npay  a levy on the selling price of their first flat, but\r\n\r\nonly  if they purchase a second subsidised flat from HDB.\r\n\r\nThis  is  specifically meant to dampen  the  demand  from\r\n\r\nsecond  timers.  If Members recall, before this levy  was\r\n\r\nin  place,  lessees would sell off their first  flat  and\r\n\r\nqueue up for the second flat, without any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npenalty.  And why not?  Flat prices were going up.   They\r\n\r\ncould  cash  out and enjoy themselves and do many  things\r\n\r\nwith  the money, including, as Mr Zainul Abidin said,  go\r\n\r\non  haj.   But we need to ensure that housing  subsidies,\r\n\r\nwhich  are not unlimited, are fairly distributed  between\r\n\r\nfirst  timers and second timers.  Obviously, we  have  to\r\n\r\nfavour  the first timers, because they have more pressing\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic circumstances have changed. We do not see\r\n\r\nhuge  amounts of money being made from the  sale  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst flat, as in the halcyon days of the early 90s,  but\r\n\r\nthe  resale  levy  is still necessary to  ensure  a  fair\r\n\r\nallocation  of  subsidies.  Yes,  there  are  lessees  of\r\n\r\nsmaller  flats who have a need to upgrade.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we calibrate the resale levy rate,  so  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  upgrade from smaller flats - the 3-roomers  - actually  pay  a smaller resale levy.  In this  way,  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  from  the second flat that they enjoy  is  still\r\n\r\nattractive compared to the resale levy they have to  pay,\r\n\r\nand that is the reason why quite a lot of 3-roomers still\r\n\r\nreturn to HDB for a second subsidised flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those who are in financial difficulties\r\n\r\nor need to downgrade to smaller flats?  They can use part\r\n\r\nof  their  sales proceeds to finance the  purchase  of  a\r\n\r\nsecond  subsidised  flat.  Alternatively,  they  can  use\r\n\r\ntheir  sales proceeds to purchase a smaller flat  in  the\r\n\r\nresale market so that they do not have to pay the levy at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Members may not be aware that we operate a much\r\n\r\nmore generous system compared to, say, in Hong Kong.   In\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, flat owners are eligible for only one housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  the  first flat.  There is  no  second  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy.   In  addition,  when  they  sell  their   first\r\n\r\nsubsidised flat in the open market, they have  to  pay  a\r\n\r\nlevy  straightaway.   The government  creams  back  their\r\n\r\nhousing subsidy once they sell their flats.  There is  no\r\n\r\ndeferred payment, and there is no second subsidy.  In our\r\n\r\ncase, flat owners who do not purchase a second subsidised\r\n\r\nflat need not pay the resale levy, and they can keep  the\r\n\r\nfull amount of subsidy realised from their first flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me now turn to the many requests for\r\n\r\nrental  flats.  Many Members have asked whether, as  part\r\n\r\nof  the  public  housing review, we  should  revisit  our\r\n\r\npolicy  towards  home  ownership  vis-a-vis  rental,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  allow a larger rental class to avoid  tying  too\r\n\r\nmuch of Singaporeans' money on property assets  -  Dr Amy\r\n\r\nKhor, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr Ong Kian Min, Ms Irene Ng  and\r\n\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have questioned whether HDB flats are\r\n\r\nstill  affordable  in the current economic  downturn  and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should  relax  our rental  flat  eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria, so that more can benefit from subsidised rental\r\n\r\nhousing.  The end result of both requests is the same   - more  rental  flats.  But I think there are two  separate\r\n\r\nissues  here.  The first is a philosophical one,  whether\r\n\r\nhome ownership or rental.  The second is whether there is\r\n\r\nenough  housing assistance for those who are affected  by\r\n\r\nthe economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the first issue - the philosophy of\r\n\r\nhome  ownership.  Public housing in  Singapore  comprises\r\n\r\nboth  home ownership flats and rental flats.  But as home\r\n\r\nownership is a key objective, we have deliberately priced\r\n\r\nour new flats such that 90% of Singaporean households can\r\n\r\nafford  their own homes.  This policy has been a  success\r\n\r\nso  that,  today, 85% of Singaporeans stay in HDB  flats,\r\n\r\nand  95%  own  their homes.  Should we  now  deliberately\r\n\r\nrestructure our public housing subsidy so that  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion live in subsidised rental housing permanently?\r\n\r\nHave  we really built too many home ownership flats?   To\r\n\r\nme,  public  housing  in  Singapore  is  more  than  just\r\n\r\nproviding  a  roof  over  people's  heads.   It  plays  a\r\n\r\ncritical social role in promoting rootedness and a  sense\r\n\r\nof belonging among Singaporeans.  To own a home is to own\r\n\r\na   part   of   Singapore.   It  makes  Singapore   worth\r\n\r\ncontributing to and worth defending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government remains committed to home ownership,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the restructuring of HDB  or  any  other\r\n\r\npolicy changes, such as bank origination, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSocial cohesion is critical, especially for a young small\r\n\r\ncountry  like ours.  Giving Singaporeans a stake  in  the\r\n\r\nnation  through home ownership is the bedrock upon  which\r\n\r\nwe  have achieved social stability and engendered a sense\r\n\r\nof community and belonging to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for low-income families, HDB has several\r\n\r\nschemes  to assist them to buy their flats.  We have  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Housing Assistance Programme, the Sale of  Flats\r\n\r\nto  Sitting Tenants Scheme, the Rent and Purchase  Scheme\r\n\r\nfor  3-room  flats and so on and so forth.  Why?   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that we keep this dream of home ownership alive\r\n\r\nfor  as  many Singaporeans as possible, especially  lower\r\n\r\nincome  Singaporeans.  By giving them a helping  hand  to\r\n\r\nown  their  homes, we give them a stake in Singapore  now\r\n\r\nand  in the future.  And as our society develops, as  our\r\n\r\neconomy restructures and as income disparity widens, this\r\n\r\nbecomes  even  more crucial in order to  maintain  social\r\n\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I recognise that there will always\r\n\r\nbe  room for rental.  For some, rental is the better  and\r\n\r\nprobably  the only option.  Here, I would like to  assure\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Kian  Min that HDB does not intend to  stop  its\r\n\r\nrental flats scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the monthly household income ceiling for\r\n\r\nsubsidised HDB rental flats is $800.  Most of the lessees\r\n\r\nin  rental  flats  are in 1- or 2-room flats.   And  some\r\n\r\nMembers  have asked whether we can relax this eligibility\r\n\r\ncriterion.   At  $800,  we  are talking  about  the  12th\r\n\r\nhousehold  income  percentile   -   the  bottom  12%   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Yes, we will study whether  this  current\r\n\r\nincome  cut-off  is still relevant today  or  whether  it\r\n\r\nshould be raised.  But even while we are doing the study,\r\n\r\nlet  me assure Members that we are always mindful of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that there will always be some people who will fall\r\n\r\nin  between the gaps.  And for such cases, HDB  will  see\r\n\r\nhow  it  can help on a case-by-case basis.  But we should\r\n\r\nbe  careful  not  to  make subsidised rental  housing  so\r\n\r\ncomfortable  that  people are quite happy  to  remain  in\r\n\r\nthese   flats  even  when  they  no  longer   need   such\r\n\r\nassistance.   If you go to Hong Kong, for  example,  they\r\n\r\nwill tell you and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshow  you many middle to higher income families who  stay\r\n\r\nin  subsidised  rental housing throughout their  lives  - very  comfortable rental housing, no intention of  moving\r\n\r\nout, whatsoever.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, some Members have questioned whether the HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are  still  affordable,  especially  during   this\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic downturn.  Let me assure them  that  it\r\n\r\nis, and will continue to remain so.  Last year, those who\r\n\r\nbought  4-  and  5-room flats of HDB needed  to  use,  on\r\n\r\naverage,   around  18%  of  their  total  gross   monthly\r\n\r\nhousehold  income  which includes their  CPF  to  service\r\n\r\ntheir mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How mentioned just now a figure as high\r\n\r\nas  34%.  I am not too sure where the figure comes  from.\r\n\r\nBut  it may be interesting for me to have some indication\r\n\r\nfrom  Mr  Heng  so that we will be able to  verify  those\r\n\r\nfigures.  But what HDB tells me is that, on average,  18%\r\n\r\nof  the monthly household income is being used to service\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage  which  is certainly well  within  the  40%\r\n\r\nguideline  which most financial institutions  used  as  a\r\n\r\ntool of credit assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give some specific numbers. For a 3-room\r\n\r\nbuy-back  flat which HDB offers, a family would  need  to\r\n\r\nspend less than $300 on the mortgage instalment.  And for\r\n\r\nthose who opt for cheaper flats, they will pay less  than\r\n\r\n$200 per month.  Notwithstanding this, there may be those\r\n\r\nwho  wish to rent temporarily, like what Mr Ong  Ah  Heng\r\n\r\nhas  described  -  newly-married  couples,  young  mobile\r\n\r\nworkers, and so on.  They want to rent before they buy  a\r\n\r\nflat,  or they want to rent one nearer to their place  of\r\n\r\nwork,  or whatever.  I suggest that they can do so,  even\r\n\r\ntoday,  by  renting  from  the  open  market.   This   is\r\n\r\nsomething  that the Government can and will  continue  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already taken the first step by relaxing the\r\n\r\nsubletting  rules.   First of all, a few  years  ago,  we\r\n\r\nallowed elderly lessees\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   sublet   their  whole  flat,  subject   to   certain\r\n\r\nconditions.  We can relook at those conditions,  if  need\r\n\r\nbe.   We  have  relaxed the subletting  rules  since  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year  for  lessees of  non-subsidised  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  who are taking bank loans and who have not  taken\r\n\r\nany  loans  from HDB.  This will increase the  supply  of\r\n\r\nrental flats in the market and, if need be, we can relook\r\n\r\nat the rules and relax them even further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you take all these schemes into consideration,\r\n\r\ninclusive  of  flats that are sublet  under  the  elderly\r\n\r\nscheme   and  those  under  special  circumstances,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  those  who are overseas, there  are  more  than\r\n\r\n30,000  HDB flats that can be sublet.  So I believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  sufficient HDB flats available for rental  on\r\n\r\nthe open market.   Of course, as I said, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  monitor and, if necessary, we can liberalise further.\r\n\r\nBut  we have to do this consciously and gradually because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  want to disrupt the rental market  or  cause\r\n\r\ndisamenities for other residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to those households which are in\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties due to the economic downturn.   I\r\n\r\nthink  many Members have spoken about this and have  made\r\n\r\nappeals  on  their behalf.  We all know that  HDB  has  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  package of financial assistance  measures,\r\n\r\nwhether   it   is  reduced  mortgage,  loan  instalments,\r\n\r\nextension  of  loan repayment periods, etc.   Yes,  there\r\n\r\nwill still be those who are in financial difficulties and\r\n\r\nmay  have  no choice but to sell their flats.  There  are\r\n\r\nrules  which have been formulated to make sure that there\r\n\r\nis  no  abuse  of the system, for example,  the  30-month\r\n\r\ndebarment  rule.  When you sell your flat,  you  are  not\r\n\r\neligible to come back to HDB to either rent a flat or  to\r\n\r\nbuy  another flat for 30 months.  As I said, this  is  to\r\n\r\nminimise abuse of the system, generally speaking.  But  I\r\n\r\nassure Members that for those in genuine difficulty,  HDB\r\n\r\nis  prepared to consider waiving this 30-month  debarment\r\n\r\nrule on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Dr Maliki asked specifically about the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of single parent families.  As he  knows,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  public  housing  policy  is  pro-family  in\r\n\r\norientation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  do not want to inadvertently encourage divorce.   But\r\n\r\nas  he  says, there are many reasons why people  divorce.\r\n\r\nSo  for  those  who are divorced, or who  are  separated,\r\n\r\nagain,  I say that HDB will consider waiving the 30-month\r\n\r\ntime  bar  if divorced or separated parents meet  certain\r\n\r\neligibility  conditions, such as custody of a  child  and\r\n\r\nother eligibility conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Madam, Mr Othman asked about the newly\r\n\r\nintroduced  option to purchase scheme.  He asked  whether\r\n\r\nit can prevent buyers of resale flats from being cheated.\r\n\r\nIt  goes  without saying that we would like  to  see  all\r\n\r\nbuyers and sellers adequately protected.  There have been\r\n\r\nmany reviews of the resale procedures by HDB to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  they  are more simplified and people  are  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  them.   But the latest introduction  of  this\r\n\r\noption  to purchase by HDB replaces the current sale  and\r\n\r\npurchase  agreement because HDB has discovered that  many\r\n\r\ntimes, people make purchases and want to opt out, or want\r\n\r\nto cancel the purchases because of one reason or another.\r\n\r\nSo this option to purchase provides buyers with an option\r\n\r\nperiod  during  which they can reconsider  the  purchase,\r\n\r\nthey  can verify various aspects of the purchase and,  if\r\n\r\nthey  change  their  minds, they can  withdraw  from  the\r\n\r\npurchase with minimal financial loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman mentioned a case where one of his\r\n\r\nconstituents was cheated.  I will ask HDB to  investigate\r\n\r\nthis case, check the information, check the documentation\r\n\r\nprovided by the buyers and the sellers and, if necessary,\r\n\r\nwe will follow up with the relevant authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have reviewed the role of HDB. We have\r\n\r\nimplemented major changes in our public housing  policies\r\n\r\nover  the past year.  I have explained why these  changes\r\n\r\nare necessary.  I also assured the House that there is no\r\n\r\nchange  to  our  commitment to public  housing,  to  home\r\n\r\nownership  and  the provision of quality  and  affordable\r\n\r\nhousing.   We  will constantly review to do  whatever  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to ensure that our public housing policies  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  remain relevant to the needs of  our  country\r\n\r\nand our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, just a quick clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Madam, can I get\r\n\r\na  clarification  from the Minister with  regard  to  HDB\r\n\r\nCorp?

But,  today,  the\r\n\r\nsituation has changed because of the economy and  changed\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some upgrading exercises, especially the major\r\n\r\nupgrading  programmes, no longer appear  that  attractive\r\n\r\nbecause the Government is providing less money for  these\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes and payment for flats has  become  a\r\n\r\nvery heavy commitment for many of the flat dwellers.   In\r\n\r\nthe  past, when times were good and there was no  history\r\n\r\nof upgrading to learn from, I believe there were excesses\r\n\r\nin   our   upgrading  programme.   We   built   elaborate\r\n\r\nentrances,  signages, walkways and pillars.  So  we  have\r\n\r\nmade mistakes, but we gained experiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learnt from such mistakes and with the\r\n\r\nexperiences  gained, we have improved.

From all the\r\n\r\ngrumbles  and frustrations brought to us at our  MPS  and\r\n\r\nthe   feedback  sessions,  I  think  they  want   special\r\n\r\nattention to be paid to very practical needs.  They  want\r\n\r\nchanges  made to the piping system, the water pipes,  the\r\n\r\nsewer  pipes, old electrical fittings for safety reasons,\r\n\r\ntoilets to make sure they do not leak so that they have a\r\n\r\nclean   environment,   spalling   concrete   to   prevent\r\n\r\naccidents.  These are what they want.  And they  hope  we\r\n\r\ncan  use  the funds for all this major upgrading to  take\r\n\r\ncare of the wear and tear within the flats.  This is like\r\n\r\na one-off thing.  Many of these practical needs cannot be\r\n\r\nseen.   They  are all hidden, like the piping system  and\r\n\r\nsewer  pipes, which you cannot see them.  But  these  are\r\n\r\nactually the areas where you should upgrade, not so  much\r\n\r\nthe external facade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, another area that they really want\r\n\r\nupgrading  is the lifts.  They want the lift to  stop  at\r\n\r\nevery  landing, which is very practical,  and  we  should\r\n\r\nsupport  that.  The next thing they want is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat these upgrading programmes are affordable and within\r\n\r\ntheir  means.   The reason again is simple -  economy  is\r\n\r\nbad,  there  is uncertainty of jobs and loss of  jobs  in\r\n\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the HDB has a very well structured payment\r\n\r\nprogramme, the truth is that, at the end of the day, they\r\n\r\nstill have to pay.  So an item like additional space does\r\n\r\nnot  attract their attention as it costs a lot more, some\r\n\r\nabout  $20,000.  We should pay attention to how  best  to\r\n\r\nfund  these needs, perhaps taking away some of the  funds\r\n\r\nallocated  for  external use for these internal  changes.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because town councils also do a  good  deal  of\r\n\r\nexternal works, landscaping ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, can you please wrap up your\r\n\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Okay. So I was wondering\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  should leave some areas of the upgrading  to\r\n\r\nthe  town councils and some to HDB.  Maybe we could  work\r\n\r\nout  a  formula,  in  terms  of  funding  and  areas   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,   so  that  we  can  fulfill   the   four\r\n\r\nconditions   that  I  have  mentioned,  that   is,   more\r\n\r\npractical,  more  affordable,  less  wastage   and   less\r\n\r\nduplication.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Madam, residents of Ang Mo Kio GRC\r\n\r\nare  very  appreciative of the upgrading of their  flats.\r\n\r\nResidents have voted strongly in support of upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP), which was\r\n\r\nintroduced  recently, is very popular with the residents.\r\n\r\nThose  with aged parents and relatives and young children\r\n\r\nare  most happy, as the lift on every floor increases the\r\n\r\nmobility of their loved ones.  Many have expressed  their\r\n\r\npreference for the LUP over IUP and MUP, as they see more\r\n\r\nbenefits in the programme to them and the community.   If\r\n\r\nwe have seen the amount of efforts that the loved ones of\r\n\r\nlow-mobility residents have to put in to help them to get\r\n\r\nin  and  out  of the flats, we can empathise  with  their\r\n\r\nrequest.   I  would therefore join Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  in\r\n\r\nurging the Government to allocate more money for the LUP,\r\n\r\nand  to  hasten the timeframe to introduce it to all  the\r\n\r\nflats in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing plan, blocks of flats less than\r\n\r\nfive  storeys  high are excluded.  If we have  difficulty\r\n\r\nwalking, even a step is excruciating, not to say a flight\r\n\r\nof  steps.  Residents with aged parents and relatives  in\r\n\r\nthese  flats are appealing to the Government not to  shut\r\n\r\nthem out of the LUP.  I am aware that lifts are expensive\r\n\r\nfacilities  to install, operate and maintain.   Hence,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that the HDB consider smaller  and\r\n\r\nlighter  lifts  for  these  low-rise  blocks  of   flats.\r\n\r\nPresumably,  such lifts would be less costly to  install,\r\n\r\noperate  and  maintain.   If  necessary,  we  can  impose\r\n\r\nrestrictions to confine their use to the old, the infirm,\r\n\r\nthe very young and the accompanying persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the Interim\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme  is meant for blocks  which  are  at\r\n\r\nleast  17  years old. Originally, the fund allocated  for\r\n\r\nthe  IUP  Plus scheme was $7,000 per unit which  included\r\n\r\ncovered  walkways,  improved mailboxes,  senior  citizens\r\n\r\ncorners, study corners, etc.  All these improvements will\r\n\r\ngive  the  residents a better living environment.   After\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading, some estates appear to be as good as,  if\r\n\r\nnot better than, private condominiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Interim Upgrading Programme was first\r\n\r\nintroduced, the residents were all very excited and happy\r\n\r\nabout  it.  But now HDB has reduced the fund from  $7,000\r\n\r\nto $4,000, and this year it is further reduced to $2,000.\r\n\r\nWith  this reduction in the fund, we are unable to afford\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  renovation works.  We can only  afford  to\r\n\r\nput  up  covered walkways and new mailboxes.  I think  we\r\n\r\nshould not cut down the provision so drastically. I  hope\r\n\r\nthat more funds can be given to the town councils so that\r\n\r\nwe could undertake better IUP for our residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support Dr Tan Boon Wan's appeal for the Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme.  The LUP is very popularly supported\r\n\r\nby the residents. I have two blocks of 4-storey HDB flats\r\n\r\nin   my  constituency  which  are  undergoing  IUP.   The\r\n\r\nresidents  are  very anxious to know whether  they  would\r\n\r\nalso  be included for LUP.  But, according to the present\r\n\r\npolicy,  they are not eligible for LUP.  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister, if the residents are prepared to bear  part  of\r\n\r\nthe cost, whether HDB would consider extending the LUP to\r\n\r\nthem?   When  we are implementing the LUP and  IUP  Plus,\r\n\r\nthese  4-storey blocks of flats should not be treated  as\r\n\r\nsecond-class flats.  We should treat them equally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, I am glad to note\r\n\r\nthat the HDB has conducted a survey recently to find  out\r\n\r\nif  the  Studio Apartment Scheme has met its  objectives.\r\n\r\nIt shows how responsive the HDB seeks to be to its target\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original target group of the Studio Apartment\r\n\r\nScheme, when it was launched\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  1998, was the elderly.  But in his National Day Rally\r\n\r\nSpeech  in 2001, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong widened  it\r\n\r\nby  announcing that a housing option being considered for\r\n\r\nsingles   is   studio  apartments.   Studio   apartments,\r\n\r\ncustomised for the elderly, have always been offered only\r\n\r\nto Singaporeans who are at least 55 years old.  After the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's announcement, singles thought that there\r\n\r\nwas  hope  at  last for more affordable housing  directly\r\n\r\nfrom  HDB  for  singles  aged  35-54.   Presently,  their\r\n\r\nhousing  options  are  limited to resale  flats,  private\r\n\r\nhousing and rental flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, recently, after the review, HDB announced that\r\n\r\nthe  Studio  Apartment Scheme would not  be  extended  to\r\n\r\nsingles aged 35-54.  This is because, after polling about\r\n\r\n300  singles  aged  35-54, only  12%  picked  the  studio\r\n\r\napartments with the current 30-year lease as their  first\r\n\r\nchoice  for  housing, but about 30%  preferred  a  longer\r\n\r\nlease  period.   So, HDB has decided not  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nStudio Apartment Scheme to singles of this group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But has the HDB paused to consider why the Studio\r\n\r\nApartment Scheme is not the first choice of most  singles\r\n\r\npolled?    Presently,   it  comes   with   elder-friendly\r\n\r\nfeatures, such as support handbars and the 30-year lease.\r\n\r\nIf  you are a 40-year-old single, you may well expect  to\r\n\r\nbe  around  after  70, and I think that is  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nexpectation.  And if we are 35-54, I do not think we need\r\n\r\nsupport  handbars yet.  So, instead of shutting the  door\r\n\r\nof  the  Studio Apartment Scheme on singles, can the  HDB\r\n\r\nconsider  modifying  the  studio apartments  for  singles\r\n\r\nabove  35?  This would mean building a certain number  of\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments  without the elder-friendly  features.\r\n\r\nThis would also mean offering a longer lease period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB announced that it would pilot integrated\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments to encourage greater  integration  and\r\n\r\ninteraction among the elderly and younger residents,  and\r\n\r\nalso  to achieve a better mix.  Singles also want to live\r\n\r\nin a block where there are families and a mix of flats to\r\n\r\npromote  more interaction between the old and the  young.\r\n\r\nThe not-so-old singles can also be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  ready  source of volunteer help to look  out  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  in  the  block.  One of the  greatest  fears  of\r\n\r\nsingles  is dying alone and nobody finding it  out  until\r\n\r\nthere  is a stench.  But if we can build more such studio\r\n\r\napartments to allow middle-age singles to grow old in  an\r\n\r\nintegrated block with other families, it will make for  a\r\n\r\nmore  cohesive community and a better Singapore.  It will\r\n\r\nalso increase their sense of belonging to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to relook at the Studio\r\n\r\nApartment  Scheme to modify it to attract another  rising\r\n\r\ntarget  group  that  has already been identified  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, ie, the singles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Madam, the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has,  in  recent years, implemented  various\r\n\r\nvery  good  programmes  towards making  housing  and  the\r\n\r\nphysical  environment  in Singapore more  elder-friendly.\r\n\r\nExamples  of these include the introduction of  the  Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme in 2001 - referred to by Dr Tan Cheng\r\n\r\nBock  and  Dr  Tan Boon Wan before me -  and  the  Studio\r\n\r\nApartment Scheme referred to by Ms Irene Ng just now.  My\r\n\r\nNMP colleague, Mrs Fang Ai Lian, I know would be speaking\r\n\r\nlater on retirement villages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to the Code on Barrier-free\r\n\r\nAccessibility in Buildings which was first  published  in\r\n\r\n1990  and  has been revised twice since, which prescribes\r\n\r\nfeatures  to  help  the wheelchair-bound  and,  now,  the\r\n\r\nvisually-impaired,  the  aged  and  families  with  young\r\n\r\nchildren  negotiate their way around our buildings.   The\r\n\r\nCode  imposes  both  mandatory requirements  as  well  as\r\n\r\nrecommends  good  practice  guidelines  which  are   non-mandatory requirements.  The most recent revision to  the\r\n\r\nCode, in July last year, included four sets of guidelines\r\n\r\non   non-mandatory  requirements  to  cover  groups  with\r\n\r\nspecial  needs,  including  one  set  directed  at  older\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pre-empt the Minister, let me state that I am in\r\n\r\nfull  agreement with the philosophy that the  less  rules\r\n\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSo,  I am not asking for all the good practice guidelines\r\n\r\nto  be  summarily made mandatory.  However, I  would  ask\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  regularly  monitor  the  progress  - developers are responding to the guidelines - and review,\r\n\r\nif  necessary, the balance between the mandatory  \"shall\"\r\n\r\nstatements and the recommended \"should\" statements in the\r\n\r\nCode, and whether there should be a shift in balance that\r\n\r\nmight be good over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Government buildings are exempted from the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Code and, instead,  follow  internal\r\n\r\ndirectives.   For Government buildings, I would  be  less\r\n\r\nreticent  in  asking for more rigorous implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  good  practice  guidelines,  and  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National  Development  will  use  its  good\r\n\r\noffices  to  push  its fellow Ministries  and  Government\r\n\r\nagencies in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that some objections to the\r\n\r\nmandatory  requirements come not  only  from  developers,\r\n\r\nbased on cost concerns, but also from some architects who\r\n\r\nwant  to  preserve  more leeway for creative  design.   I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  encourage  our  architects  that  their\r\n\r\ncreativity  can be directed instead to how to incorporate\r\n\r\nelder-friendly features into building design at a minimum\r\n\r\nadditional cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, the HDB has, as part of its\r\n\r\nplans  to  help homeowners, encouraged the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nmore  co-owners  of  existing  flats  when  the  original\r\n\r\nlessees  have  gone into financial difficulties.   Often,\r\n\r\nthese  so-called  new  co-owners would  be  young  adults\r\n\r\nhelping out their parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I foresee a problem in the future, as many of these\r\n\r\nyoung  people eventually want to set up a family,  or  as\r\n\r\nfamily  differences cause a falling out and the  sale  of\r\n\r\nthe  flat.   This  family nucleus could  then  set  about\r\n\r\neyeing another flat even before they get married, as  one\r\n\r\nparent  and  child, in order to have a  roof  over  their\r\n\r\nheads and some place to live.  When it comes to the  turn\r\n\r\nof  the  young  person to apply for a flat, these  people\r\n\r\nwould be counted as second-timers, even when applying for\r\n\r\nwhat amounts to the first flat of their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nown.   These people, arguably, would not have had a first\r\n\r\nbite of the cherry per se with regard to HDB subsidies in\r\n\r\nterms  of  their own families.  Rather, they  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen pulling together to help each other out as a family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the concept of fairness in terms of not\r\n\r\nwanting  to  have  granted too many  subsidies  to  these\r\n\r\npeople.   But should these young people, pulling together\r\n\r\nto  help  their families in a time of need, be  penalised\r\n\r\nfor helping their parents or siblings during a rainy day?\r\n\r\nI  hope the Government could think of a creative solution\r\n\r\nto this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been this push for everyone to own a flat,\r\n\r\nand  I  think this has been a very successful  Government\r\n\r\npolicy.  But if we look around, in other countries,  many\r\n\r\nof  the  young people actually rent before they buy.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  our Ministers have mentioned something about  this\r\n\r\npossibility of young people getting smaller flats  before\r\n\r\ngetting  bigger ones.  But what happens to some of  these\r\n\r\npeople who are already stuck, living in a flat that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to continue to pay?  Is it possible  then\r\n\r\nfor  the young people to rent in situ, instead of  having\r\n\r\nto  move  everybody out and get a new flat?  Is  it  also\r\n\r\npossible for the lease term of these flats to be changed,\r\n\r\nin  such  a  way that the lease becomes shorter  and  the\r\n\r\nyoung  people are then not deemed to have taken a  second\r\n\r\nsubsidy?  Perhaps, a creative solution could be found.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Madam, HDB\r\n\r\nheadquarters  moved out from Bukit Merah Central  to  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  around June last year.

Now the environmentally-friendly,  cleaner  new markets have  taken  shape.   The\r\n\r\nneater,  cleaner  and  drier  appearance  is  a  welcomed\r\n\r\ndeparture from the wet markets of old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a market continues to fulfill its roles\r\n\r\nfrom  time  immemorial.  It is primarily  a  place  where\r\n\r\nfresh and inexpensive foodstuffs are purchased.  It is  a\r\n\r\nkey node of community life.  A market gives character  to\r\n\r\nthe   locality.   In  many  cities  and  towns  in   many\r\n\r\ncountries, there are old market streets.  We have our own\r\n\r\n-  Whampoa,  Kreta  Ayer and Tekka are  characterised  by\r\n\r\ntheir markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the less academically-inclined\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the market is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsource  of  livelihood.  In short,  a  market  is  a  key\r\n\r\nfeature  of any community. Hence, I ask that the Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  building  new markets to meet  the  demands  of\r\n\r\nresidents  in  new  towns.  In Anchorvale  and  Fernvale,\r\n\r\nparts  of  Sengkang,  they  are constantly  inundated  by\r\n\r\nrequests for a market.  From such interactions,  I  begin\r\n\r\nto  challenge the assumption that as Singapore  continues\r\n\r\non its inexorable modernisation drive, the new generation\r\n\r\nof  younger Singaporeans eschew the wet markets for other\r\n\r\nshopping   experiences.   Like  their  grandparents   and\r\n\r\nparents  before them, even career-minded and professional\r\n\r\nmen  and women continue to view the markets as fulfilling\r\n\r\nthe  needs  that I have mentioned earlier, especially  so\r\n\r\nwith  the  success  of our drive to  make  these  markets\r\n\r\nhygienic and less messy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our ingenuity in co-locating markets with multi-storey carparks or as part of a shopping facility has\r\n\r\nalleviated the concerns that wet markets suffer from poor\r\n\r\nland  utilisation.   Can  I  then  ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  need for such markets to be available  and\r\n\r\naccessible  to  residents in new towns  and  to  consider\r\n\r\nfavourably building one for those towns that suffer  from\r\n\r\na lack of such a facility?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, I am speaking on\r\n\r\nthis  cut  on  rejuvenated public housing estates.

I  think  we\r\n\r\nalso  know that the MP for that area, Mr Mohamad  Maidin,\r\n\r\nhas been working very hard towards that end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Madam, Geylang Serai is very well-known for its deep histo-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrical, social and political roots. Singapore would be the\r\n\r\nloser  if  the rejuvenated Geylang Serai would  lose  its\r\n\r\nspecial  place  as far as the hearts of  the  Malays  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.   In  fact, no Malay in Singapore  would  feel\r\n\r\ncomplete  if  he  has  not gone to Geylang  Serai  during\r\n\r\nRamadan  in  preparation for his  Hari  Raya.   For  that\r\n\r\nmatter, ask any Bruneian or Malaysian Malay who has  come\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. I think he will be able to regale us  with\r\n\r\nhis stories and experiences in visiting Geylang Serai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, actually enjoy the vanishing food which\r\n\r\nyou can still find in Geylang Serai today.  Just to share\r\n\r\nan experience with you. Even our Member of Parliament, Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman Yusof, got married in Geylang Serai. I was  there\r\n\r\nduring that wedding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my question about Geylang Serai's\r\n\r\nrejuvenation  is:  what are the plans of  HDB  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  new Geylang Serai would not lose  that  ethnic\r\n\r\nculture and historical attraction that it has?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Madam, in view of the development\r\n\r\nof new sites within existing estates, especially with the\r\n\r\nnew  MRT routes, such as the North East Line and also the\r\n\r\nCircle Line, many of the older neighbourhood centres have\r\n\r\ngiven rise to new neighbourhood and town centres next  to\r\n\r\nthe  MRT  stations.   These are generally  good  news  to\r\n\r\nresidents who benefited from these new neighbourhood  and\r\n\r\ntown  centres,  but  not the shopkeepers  who  have  been\r\n\r\noperating in the old centres for many years and who  have\r\n\r\nbought  their shops and could not move out at all.   They\r\n\r\nsee  a  drop  in the number of residents going  to  these\r\n\r\ncentres without the essential Government agency services,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  HDB branch offices, bus interchanges, and  even\r\n\r\nbanks followed suit, which is understandable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Government agencies have valid reasons to\r\n\r\nshift  out,  such as efficiency, productivity  and  cost-saving for them. Can the Minister clarify which agency is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the planning of the alternative  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing neighbourhood and town centres and ensuring\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurvival of these old neighbourhood and town centres?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three such sites come to mind. One of them is the\r\n\r\nformer Woodlands Town Centre, vacated since 1998. We have\r\n\r\njust  heard Dr Chong's vivid description of the  woes  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing shopkeepers in Bukit Merah and  his  appeal\r\n\r\nfor  his  constituents.  The landowner had  shifted  out,\r\n\r\nknowing  full well that the neighbourhood shops  depended\r\n\r\nso much on the HDB's customers and its 8,000 strong staff\r\n\r\nto  survive  and,  yet, no plans for its alternative  use\r\n\r\nwere activated before the shift.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Kovan Centre - here I must declare my\r\n\r\ninterest as it is within my division - the branch  office\r\n\r\nhad  just  shifted  out in December 2002.   I  have  just\r\n\r\nappealed to Minister Yeo Cheow Tong to consider retaining\r\n\r\nat least a few of the feeder services so as to retain the\r\n\r\nexisting  bus  interchange and bring in the residents  to\r\n\r\nthe  350 shops and offices and over 80 market and  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre   stalls,   and  the  shopping  complex   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  Just to give you the impact of the  shift\r\n\r\nof  the  essential Government services and the  transport\r\n\r\nhub  from a neighbourhood centre, NTUC Fairprice is doing\r\n\r\nabout  50%  of the business it was doing in  pre-1998  in\r\n\r\nWoodlands Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no one agency taking charge, could there\r\n\r\nbe  an  inter-ministry committee to ensure that the shops\r\n\r\nin  these  old  towns and neighbourhood centres  survive,\r\n\r\nbefore  allowing  any  shift of the essential  Government\r\n\r\nservices,  like the HDB branch offices, the CPF branches,\r\n\r\nthe  libraries,  the post-offices, into  newer  locations\r\n\r\nand,  most  importantly,  the  interchanges  which  bring\r\n\r\npeople  to  the centres?  As we appeal to each  Ministry,\r\n\r\neach  would  look  at  its own operation  and  would  not\r\n\r\nconsider   other  agencies'  operations.   However,   the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of all the relevant agencies' operations would\r\n\r\nhave  a  tremendous impact on the old centres and  nearby\r\n\r\nestates.   It is common knowledge that, as with  any  new\r\n\r\ntransport hub, the value of the commercial property  will\r\n\r\nincrease because of the human traffic. For new sites, ie,\r\n\r\nMRT stations, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  ensure that the land surrounding these  sites  is\r\n\r\nacquired  so  that  no property owner will  benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese   new  locations  of  the  MRT  stations   or   bus\r\n\r\ninterchanges.   It can be seen here the importance  of  a\r\n\r\ntransport hub to a neighbourhood or town centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Madam, let me first respond to Dr\r\n\r\nTan Cheng Bock's questions on the upgrading programme. Dr\r\n\r\nTan   suggested   that  the  HDB  review  the   upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme, especially the MUP, and to concentrate on  the\r\n\r\nmore  practical and affordable and less of those  aspects\r\n\r\nwhich  are  wasteful and duplicated.  Similarly,  Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nBoon  Wan  and Mr Ang Mong Seng made the same  point  and\r\n\r\nasked about the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, upgrading is a long-term programme. This is a\r\n\r\nprogramme that the Government is committed to.  It is  an\r\n\r\nexpensive programme and is heavily subsidised.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason, it is necessary for us to continue to review  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  programme, one, to make sure that it continues\r\n\r\nto  stay relevant to the needs of HDB residents; and two,\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  that  we get the best  value  for  money,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind that resources are limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Members will know that we have completed\r\n\r\nquite  a  few rounds of review of the upgrading programme\r\n\r\nover  the  last few years.  I think Mr Ang Mong Seng  has\r\n\r\nmentioned specifically a review of the IUP programme.  In\r\n\r\n1999,  we  revised the upgrading programme to scale  down\r\n\r\nthe   improvement   works  that  were   considered   less\r\n\r\nessential, for example, things like amphitheatres,  water\r\n\r\nfeatures,  fountains,  and  so  on.   Then,  we  reviewed\r\n\r\nfurther the scope of the upgrading programme last year to\r\n\r\nfocus on improvement items that the residents would value\r\n\r\nmore, mainly improvement items within the flats, like the\r\n\r\nchange of pipes, spalling concrete, toilets, changing  of\r\n\r\nthe windows, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in 2001, we revised the age criterion for the\r\n\r\nMUP  and  IUP  programmes so that more HDB flats  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for upgrading.  In 2001, we also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  Lift Upgrading Programme  because  there\r\n\r\nwere  a  lot  of requests from MPs for lifts to  stop  at\r\n\r\nevery  floor, and also we recognised that the  population\r\n\r\nwas  aging.   Last year, we implemented IUP Plus.   Under\r\n\r\nIUP Plus, we can have more lift upgrading works to enable\r\n\r\nmore residents to have access to the lift upgrading works\r\n\r\nearlier at the same time as they enjoy the IUP works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Ang is correct to say that under the IUP\r\n\r\nPlus, we have actually revised the budget from $4,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,000 and this is for the IUP component.  Why do  we  do\r\n\r\nthis?   The  rationale is because we want to divert  more\r\n\r\nresources to the lift upgrading works. The Lift Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  is  a  much  more sought  after  programme  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament, as well as by residents, and  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason, we diverted the funds to what we felt would\r\n\r\nbe  more  appreciated and more valuable to the residents.\r\n\r\nHowever,  within this IUP budget, the working  committee,\r\n\r\nwhich is usually chaired by the advisor, would be able to\r\n\r\nselect  from a list of improvement works. It  is  like  a\r\n\r\nmenu.  So  whether it is repainting of  the  blocks,  new\r\n\r\nletter  boxes,  covered linkways, improved  lighting,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever,  advisors and residents choose what they  think\r\n\r\nwill  bring most benefit to the residents. What  we  have\r\n\r\ndone is to keep the budget lean, divert it to areas where\r\n\r\nthey  are more appreciated and for the remaining  budget,\r\n\r\nallow  a  list  of things that residents  would  want  to\r\n\r\nchoose from.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the selection of blocks for upgrading, we do\r\n\r\nso  after  very  careful consideration.   After  we  have\r\n\r\nselected  the blocks for upgrading, it is ultimately  the\r\n\r\nresidents  themselves  who  decide,  through  a   polling\r\n\r\nprocess, by voting, whether they want their blocks to  be\r\n\r\nupgraded or not.  Based on the polling results so far, it\r\n\r\nis  clear that many residents are in favour of upgrading,\r\n\r\nin spite of the inconvenience, the noise, the dust and so\r\n\r\non,  that  they  face while the upgrading  works  are  in\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for example, we polled ten precincts for\r\n\r\nMUP  and  every  precinct voted \"yes\"  for  the  standard\r\n\r\npackage.   85%  \"yes\"  votes,  on  the  average,   is   a\r\n\r\nresounding approval for the MUP programme.  For the  Lift\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme that was implemented in 2001, out  of\r\n\r\n68 blocks that were polled in the demonstration phase, 67\r\n\r\nvoted in favour of the programme.  Remember that there is\r\n\r\na co-payment element in the lift upgrading programme, and\r\n\r\nwhy  the  one  block did not agree to the lift  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme could be because the co-payment amount  was  on\r\n\r\nthe  high  side.  As for the space-adding  item,  yes,  I\r\n\r\nagree with Dr Tan that it does cost more to have a space-adding  item  included in the upgrading programme.   But,\r\n\r\nagain, this is subject to approval of the residents.   If\r\n\r\nthe residents do not wish or they do not feel that it  is\r\n\r\ngood  value for money, all they have to do is to say  so.\r\n\r\nSome  precincts  have indeed voted \"no\"  for  the  space-adding item (SAI), especially the 5-room flats.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis is quite a pragmatic position.  They already have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  flat.   They  do not wish to  have  an  additional\r\n\r\nstoreroom or an additional balcony, and they say,  \"Thank\r\n\r\nyou  very  much.  I do not need it.\"  We say, \"Yes,  fair\r\n\r\nenough.\"   We  move on and offer it to another  precinct.\r\n\r\nSo  it is not true that the upgrading, especially MUP, is\r\n\r\nno longer attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as payment for the upgrading is concerned,\r\n\r\nagain, I would like to inform Members that so far,  HDB's\r\n\r\ndata  indicate that there are 48,000 households that have\r\n\r\nbeen  billed  for the upgrading work, and more  than  95%\r\n\r\nhave paid up, either in full or by instalments.  The rest\r\n\r\ncan  opt  for  either a longer repayment period  or  even\r\n\r\ndefer  their payment until their flat is sold,  and  this\r\n\r\naccounts for the rest of the residents.  So, again, it is\r\n\r\nnot  true  that  the  residents are not  able  to  afford\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lift upgrading, I am glad that we have been\r\n\r\nable to implement the lift upgrading programme because it\r\n\r\nis indeed a very highly appreciated programme.  But there\r\n\r\nare many blocks that are eligible for lift upgrading.  In\r\n\r\nfact, to date there are some 3,500 high-rise blocks which\r\n\r\nstill do not have lifts on every floor yet.  So, I do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsympathise with the call for lifts for four-storey blocks\r\n\r\nfrom  Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Tan Boon Wan and others.  But,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, there are many other high-rise blocks  which\r\n\r\nstill  have not had their lifts changed.  And in view  of\r\n\r\nthe funds that we have available, we need necessarily  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  prioritise this lift  upgrading  programme.\r\n\r\nSo,  I do not have good news for Mr Ang Mong Seng at this\r\n\r\npoint  in  time.   We  do not intend  to  implement  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading for four-storey blocks as yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to Mr Zainul who asked about the\r\n\r\nSERS programme for Geylang Serai.  I did not know that my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleague,  Mr  Yatiman,  was  married  in\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai.   Maybe if he tells me  which  particular\r\n\r\nplace,  we  might find a way to preserve  that  -  put  a\r\n\r\nplaque there or whatever.  It is something that has  been\r\n\r\nvery  well received by the residents and I agree with  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  that  the atmosphere and the unique character  of\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai are something worth preserving.  So, in the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  plans of Geylang Serai,  I  will  ask  the\r\n\r\nrelevant   authorities,  HDB,  the  National  Environment\r\n\r\nAgency  and  others to bear this in mind.  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nmarket, for example, serves a very important purpose.  It\r\n\r\nis,  as  I understand, an anchor facility for festivities\r\n\r\nduring  the Ramadan period, and it is a social  gathering\r\n\r\npoint  for many people.  So, we will rebuild the  Geylang\r\n\r\nmarket  at  a  prominent location, fronting Changi  Road,\r\n\r\nand,  in  this way, together with retaining many  of  the\r\n\r\nmerchants  in  that area, we hope that the character  and\r\n\r\nthe vibrancy of that area will be reinforced.  Mr Mohamad\r\n\r\nMaidin, the MP for the area, has, I believe, also set  up\r\n\r\na task force to gather feedback from all the stakeholders\r\n\r\n-  from  the  residents, the stallholders and shopkeepers\r\n\r\nand   from  the  Malay  community  generally  -  on   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of Geylang Serai.  I assure  Members  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will take note of the feedback and ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their needs are taken care of and the character  of\r\n\r\nthe place is retained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of housing for singles. Ms\r\n\r\nIrene Ng advocated passionately for singles to be allowed\r\n\r\naccess\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the studio apartments.  Let me just go one step  back\r\n\r\nand explain what is the purpose of the studio apartments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduced the Studio Apartment Scheme (SA\r\n\r\nScheme),  we really wanted it to be a customised  housing\r\n\r\noption, another housing option for the elderly.  To  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  they  were  affordable  to  the  elderly,  we\r\n\r\npurposely  sold it on a short 30-year lease, with  option\r\n\r\nfor   extension,  the  idea  being  to  keep  the   price\r\n\r\naffordable.  Then, we thought, why not consider  it  also\r\n\r\nas a housing option for singles?  We considered this very\r\n\r\nseriously.   We conducted a survey on the SA Scheme  last\r\n\r\nyear,  and  we  found  that,  in  fact,  younger  singles\r\n\r\nconsidered the studio apartments (SAs) as just one of the\r\n\r\nmany options.  And, indeed, the majority indicated non-SA\r\n\r\nhousing  options as their first housing choice,  such  as\r\n\r\nresale HDB flats and even private housing.  So, for  that\r\n\r\nreason,  we decided we would not extend the SA Scheme  at\r\n\r\nthis  point  in time because they have viable alternative\r\n\r\noptions to meet their housing needs.  They can stay  with\r\n\r\ntheir parents, they can buy a 3-room flat, loan from  the\r\n\r\nopen  market, or they can buy a bigger flat if they apply\r\n\r\ntogether  with another eligible single.  And, of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  can rent rooms.  So, the SA Scheme has worked  well\r\n\r\nas  a  housing  form for the elderly.  It has  been  well\r\n\r\nreceived.   Almost all the SAs that we offered have  been\r\n\r\nsnapped up.  And, in view of our ageing population, it is\r\n\r\nimportant  for us to continue to focus on the  SAs  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans to meet the housing needs of the elderly.  We  will\r\n\r\nbuild  more  SAs,  new  SAs, and we will  integrate  them\r\n\r\ntogether  with  other blocks and offer  them  to  elderly\r\n\r\npersons.  So, at this point in time, again I say that  we\r\n\r\ndo not have plans to open these up to singles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about the housing for the\r\n\r\nelderly,  especially  apropos the  Code  on  Barrier-free\r\n\r\nAccessibility.   Yes, she is right to say  that  we  have\r\n\r\nimplemented  several initiatives to make  living  in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  more  elderly-friendly.   In  fact,  one  of   the\r\n\r\nstrategic  thrusts of the Inter-ministerial Committee  on\r\n\r\nthe Ageing Population that I chaired, was to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencourage  \"ageing in place\".  In other words, to  enable\r\n\r\nour  elderly  to continue to live in their  homes,  their\r\n\r\ncommunities, in places that they are familiar  with.   Dr\r\n\r\nLee  has already enumerated some of the initiatives - the\r\n\r\nflats   with   elderly-friendly  features   through   the\r\n\r\nupgrading programme, the lift upgrading programme, and so\r\n\r\non and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address her concerns about the\r\n\r\nCode   on  Barrier-free  Accessibility,  especially   the\r\n\r\nvoluntary   guidelines.   Yes,  we   will   monitor   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  this Code in so  far  as  the  public\r\n\r\nhousing  estates are concerned.  I would like  to  inform\r\n\r\nher  that  HDB,  for  example, under the  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme, will provide ramps for the mobility of elderly\r\n\r\nresidents - ramps leading up to the blocks and also ramps\r\n\r\nleading to other facilities, like recreational facilities\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  I thought that I should mention  one  other\r\n\r\namenity  that we had implemented, and that is, under  the\r\n\r\nproject to Improve the Living Conditions for the Elderly,\r\n\r\napart from just improving the physical environment,  non-slip  tiles, hand-bars, alert systems and so  on,  it  is\r\n\r\nalso important to put in place some of the more community-based care and support services for the elderly.  And, in\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  we have worked very closely with  MCDS  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that there are VWOs who are in place to provide\r\n\r\nsuch  support to the elderly.  So I just want to reassure\r\n\r\nher that we have a policy framework in place to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  challenges posed by the ageing population.  We  have\r\n\r\nmade   progress   in  implementing  some   of   the   IMC\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  but,  as  in  all  things,  while   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can provide the infrastructure and the  policy\r\n\r\nframework,  it  is  the individual, the  family  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  that  have  to play a  part  in  sharing  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of  making  ageing  in  Singapore   more\r\n\r\nfulfilling and rewarding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee posed a question on children who\r\n\r\nhelped their parents to pay for mortgage instalments and,\r\n\r\nas a result of that, they lose out on their entitlement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  a housing subsidy.  Yes, we recognise that there  are\r\n\r\nsuch  situations.  Parents have difficulty to repay their\r\n\r\nmortgage and children are invited to become co-owners  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can make use of their CPF.  When the  children\r\n\r\nget married and they want to set up their own homes, they\r\n\r\nare,  in  certain  circumstances, tagged as  first-timers\r\n\r\nalready  and  are  therefore  not  eligible  for  another\r\n\r\nsubsidy.   I  would  like to inform Dr Warren  Lee  that,\r\n\r\nunder certain circumstances, they can still be considered\r\n\r\nas  first-timers, eg, if they relinquish ownership or co-ownership of their parent's flat by way of transfer.   In\r\n\r\nthis  case, the parents must agree to be tagged as having\r\n\r\nenjoyed  the  housing subsidy and they will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nliable  for  the resale levy.  I also want to  inform  Dr\r\n\r\nWarren  Lee that although we have a ten-year time bar  on\r\n\r\nlessees  before  they can apply for a  second  subsidised\r\n\r\nflat,  this  requirement will be waived for children  who\r\n\r\nare in this situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very quickly, I would like to respond to Dr Chong on\r\n\r\nHDB  Centre.  I do sympathise with the shopkeepers in the\r\n\r\nBukit  Merah  Centre.  Any major move of this  nature  is\r\n\r\nbound  to  affect them adversely.  I just want to  assure\r\n\r\nhim  that HDB is actively looking at marketing HDB Centre\r\n\r\nfor  rental.  It has appointed a panel of five  marketing\r\n\r\nagents  to  lease out the premises.  The panel of  agents\r\n\r\nhas  conducted many show arounds but, ultimately, whether\r\n\r\nHDB  can  rent  that particular premises depends  on  the\r\n\r\ndemand for office space.  The demand for office space  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  is very, very weak, not just in HDB  Centre,\r\n\r\nbut island-wide.  There is a major oversupply of space in\r\n\r\nthe  market.  Nevertheless, HDB will continue to actively\r\n\r\nlook  for tenants to occupy the vacated premises  and  it\r\n\r\nwill be prepared to offer competitive rent, especially to\r\n\r\nanchor tenants.  But, having said that, I do not think it\r\n\r\nwould  be  tenable for HDB to substantially undercut  the\r\n\r\nmarket  or  just give away the premises almost for  free,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  would  have serious repercussions  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  As to whether HDB Corp will set up shop  in  HDB\r\n\r\nCentre, it is really up to HDB Corp.  When it is  set  up\r\n\r\nin June this year, it would be run as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate  company.
