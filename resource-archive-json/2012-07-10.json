I will deal\r\nwith the first, which was a question. Can we tighten the Criminal\r\nProcedure Code (CPC) and what can be done? I would like to go back\r\nto the point I made in my answer to re-emphasise it. Bail is an\r\nimportant part of the criminal justice process that we have. In\r\nestablishing bail and conditions applicable to it, the Courts have\r\nto reconcile two important considerations. On the one hand, it has\r\nto ensure that the interest of the criminal justice system is served\r\nand perpetrators brought to task. On the other hand, it also has\r\nto respect the presumption of innocence and the right of free movement\r\nof the individual until he or she is proven guilty. This is an important\r\nprocess. The Police works with the prosecution to make sure all\r\nthe facts are brought before the Courts, so that the Courts can\r\nmake a full and informed decision on the matter. What it also means\r\nis that in the process, there may be some instances where you may\r\nhave flight. The objective of the exercise is to minimise flight\r\nrisk so that we do not have such incidents. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 376</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7f2db5b7-605c-4484-a5e3-20f2768b0788\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ba30ec25-d1fc-4303-8abf-ec25c7262d17__id-7f2db5b7-605c-4484-a5e3-20f2768b0788\"><!--a--></a>As I have mentioned before, MinLaw and\r\nMHA continually review the process and we will also look at whether\r\nthe bail system and the CPC can be enhanced to tighten this specifically.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 376</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Update on Police Inquiry into Suntec City Brawl where Foreigners\r\nInvolved Jumped Bail<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-04e99aa2-1fc6-4974-96b4-d5fdb5600ecd\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-04e99aa2-1fc6-4974-96b4-d5fdb5600ecd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-c06db225-8423-4547-8dc4-4fa53a409bc8\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-0f970952-626a-48d1-8588-5a252f17c481__id-c06db225-8423-4547-8dc4-4fa53a409bc8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ca062cfa-ce6e-47f6-b9e7-dedfcb4a71d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-0f970952-626a-48d1-8588-5a252f17c481__id-ca062cfa-ce6e-47f6-b9e7-dedfcb4a71d6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">2</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs if he will\r\nprovide an update on the police inquiry into the case in which foreigners\r\ninvolved in a brawl at Suntec City in April 2010 jumped bail after\r\nbeing charged.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-95144741-6fab-4862-8e7a-6b248b2c5ff9\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-0f970952-626a-48d1-8588-5a252f17c481__id-95144741-6fab-4862-8e7a-6b248b2c5ff9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7af3874b-9350-4cac-a131-96602294c8dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-0f970952-626a-48d1-8588-5a252f17c481__id-7af3874b-9350-4cac-a131-96602294c8dc\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr S Iswaran (for the Deputy Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\nin March this year, Deputy Prime Minister Teo informed the House\r\nthat the Police was conducting an internal inquiry to establish\r\nthe full facts of how the Suntec case was handled and whether there\r\nwere any lapses or negligence on the part of the officers handling\r\nthe case.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-92bb4f48-6b22-4658-b09d-5b3c4958835d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-0f970952-626a-48d1-8588-5a252f17c481__id-92bb4f48-6b22-4658-b09d-5b3c4958835d\"><!--a--></a>Police has now completed\r\nits internal inquiry, and has charged the Investigation Officer\r\nwho handled the case with neglect of duty.

The nature of the crime, the gravity of the\r\nimpact, the nature of the individuals' own ties to Singapore and,\r\nmost importantly and fundamentally, we have to strike that balance\r\nbetween his or her right to freedom to move, especially before he\r\nor she is judged or found to be guilty. That trade-off and that\r\njudgement have to be left to the courts.

As I mentioned in my reply,\r\nwe would expect the number to increase to about 7,000. Sir, let\r\nme explain to the House that the scheme is actually quite benign\r\ntowards being in favour of the students rather than towards the\r\nGovernment or Mendaki. If you are in the scheme, despite changes\r\nto your family income, you continue to qualify. If you are out,\r\nand there is a change in your family income and you qualify, you\r\nwill come in. So, the reason as to why the numbers will go up would\r\nbe simply because of students in the past who were not given the\r\nTTFS under the old criteria, would now qualify under the new criteria\r\nand they can apply. So, we expect many more students to qualify\r\nfor TTFS this year. This will have, obviously, an impact on the\r\nreserves which I mentioned earlier that goes towards the EDF. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-609ca069-abdb-4388-93f0-6a8dffdb20ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-da6d5eba-3c8b-4a42-bc13-94aa4aea75c4__id-609ca069-abdb-4388-93f0-6a8dffdb20ee\"><!--a--></a>As the number of Malay students\r\nhas been somewhat constant in the last few years, the reserves that\r\nwe have been getting, in fact, have been coming down and they will come\r\ndown significantly this year because of the fact that many more\r\nMalay students will qualify. As to whether or not this will impact\r\nMendaki's reserves, this matter is being studied very closely by\r\nmy staff. We have to wait until the new set of criteria is fully implemented\r\nthis year.

Similarly, Resorts World Sentosa's (RWS) profit, in terms\r\nof EBITA between the first quarter 2010 and the first quarter 2012,\r\nis also in the region of about S$3.3 billion. Quite a coincidence. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f9268b44-0e5d-44f2-9ad6-b763df7b278a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-948d2096-609d-494f-9994-c310aa3348fa__id-f9268b44-0e5d-44f2-9ad6-b763df7b278a\"><!--a--></a>So, if MBS' earnings for the rest of the\r\nyear are as strong as the first quarter this year, the total accumulated\r\nprofits, in terms of EBITA, will reach or exceed S$5 billion by\r\nthe end of this year.

In view of the above, I have\r\ntwo supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Government consider persuading\r\nthe IRs to do more Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity\r\nby helping the low-income group, especially those Singaporeans that\r\nare affected financially and emotionally by their family members\r\nwho patronise the IRs? Secondly, would the Government consider channelling\r\nthe penalties paid by the IRs into a separate pool of fund, in the\r\nevent disciplinary actions are taken against the IRs, to help to\r\nfund this same group of low-income people who are affected by gambling\r\nills? I would usually direct these questions to MCYS. Since the\r\nMinister of State for Finance is taking care of this question now,\r\nI hope she can answer us in a whole-of-Government approach [<em class=\"ph i\">Laughter</em>].</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-1ebca9a3-7e78-4777-b4be-bdf6c6a28839\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-948d2096-609d-494f-9994-c310aa3348fa__id-1ebca9a3-7e78-4777-b4be-bdf6c6a28839\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8c1b0f44-abc7-4d0a-ae51-7dd9d663326d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-948d2096-609d-494f-9994-c310aa3348fa__id-8c1b0f44-abc7-4d0a-ae51-7dd9d663326d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nI would also want to thank Mr Ang for expressing the concerns of\r\nmany Singaporeans with regard to problem gambling. Mr Ang has highlighted\r\nthe profitability of the Integrated Resort operators because of\r\nthe patronage of the casinos. I thought that perhaps, it would be\r\nuseful to highlight that in tandem with the increase in profitability,\r\nthe tax revenues that we collect from the casino operators have\r\nalso been quite considerable. And perhaps just to provide a sense\r\nof perspective, in fact, the net increase in tax revenues from the\r\nIRs was about $900 million for FY2010 and for FY2011, the figure\r\nwas about $1.1 billion. So, yes, the casino operators have made\r\nmore money but, at the same time, they have contributed to our tax\r\nrevenues. And through these tax revenues, the Government is able\r\nto provide support for Singaporeans in many areas and expand our\r\nresources, in terms of care, for Singaporeans. That is the first\r\npoint I want to make.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-06ee3383-91ea-4430-bde5-8067503e8bbf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-948d2096-609d-494f-9994-c310aa3348fa__id-06ee3383-91ea-4430-bde5-8067503e8bbf\"><!--a--></a>Mr Ang is very right, Mr\r\nSpeaker, to say that actually his questions are going to be more\r\nadequately addressed by MCYS.

Now,\r\nbefore I say more about that, Members will be familiar with the\r\nstringent social safeguards that have already been put in place\r\nto minimise the impact of casino gambling.

Second question is, would the Ministry\r\nconsider proactively setting up a taskforce to look into creatively\r\ndeveloping different types of jobs for this age group either by\r\nredesigning or ring-fencing some jobs so that they have more options,\r\nother than the cleaner jobs that many of us refer them to? Third\r\nquestion is, if that is acceptable, when can we expect some action\r\nor deliverables that can be visibly felt on the ground for those\r\nof us, and I am sure the Ministry too, who want to help this group?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-86078860-d0a2-452d-80a4-7a91c3c45aa7\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-21e88828-f446-4d6f-bc51-5c8f44f06d21__id-86078860-d0a2-452d-80a4-7a91c3c45aa7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-af6a4736-2034-407a-a18f-5793c66a2a4f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-21e88828-f446-4d6f-bc51-5c8f44f06d21__id-af6a4736-2034-407a-a18f-5793c66a2a4f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I\r\nthank the hon Member for her concern. This is something that many\r\nof us in this House share as we do meet residents who are older,\r\nless educated and less skilled and who actually do want to find\r\njobs. Indeed, due to the profile of the older workers, we do find\r\nthat there are certain sectors that they tend to congregate in.\r\nOne of the areas that we have highlighted before, in terms of the\r\nlow-wage workers sector, we also do find older workers there, particularly\r\nthe cleaning sector as well as the security agencies.

With every corresponding passing of years,\r\nyou will have older Singaporeans who actually will be better skilled\r\nand better educated. So, more jobs will be available. The challenge\r\nreally is dealing with the here and now. For the older workers today,\r\ncan we explore more jobs being created in other sectors, whether\r\nby ring-fencing or redesigning to provide employment?

Any person guiding tourists in Singapore for remuneration has\r\nto be licensed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Licensing ensures\r\nthat tourist guides in Singapore are knowledgeable about our heritage, geography\r\nand tourism offerings, and have the requisite language proficiency\r\nand professional conduct. As at 31 May 2012, there were 2,312 licensed\r\ntourist guides in Singapore. Ninety-six percent of these guides\r\nwere Singapore citizens or permanent residents. This proportion\r\nhas held steady since 2007. Many of the non-Singaporean guides are\r\nguiding in foreign languages.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f6e3e29a-eb3c-47bc-b480-4fdf1f8f86b6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-f6e3e29a-eb3c-47bc-b480-4fdf1f8f86b6\"><!--a--></a>STB takes a serious view\r\nof illegal guiding and takes enforcement action against unlicensed\r\nactivities. Unlicensed guides who are first-time offenders are issued\r\nstern warnings in lieu of prosecution, and encouraged to undergo\r\nproper training and licensing. Travel agents that engage such unlicensed\r\nguides will be similarly warned if they are first-time offenders.\r\nIn addition, these travel agents will be required to implement measures\r\nto ensure full compliance, and will also be subjected to closer scrutiny\r\nby STB.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d017688b-a631-4b5c-82f4-24afc2405bdc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-d017688b-a631-4b5c-82f4-24afc2405bdc\"><!--a--></a>The incidence of illegal\r\nguiding had not been high in the past: there were only 11 suspected\r\ncases of unlicensed guiding out of all enforcement checks conducted between\r\n2007 and 2010, with Singaporeans accounting for about half of these\r\ncases. However, such activity has become more apparent in recent\r\nyears, which may be partly attributable to the rapid growth in our\r\nvisitor arrivals. For example, feedback to STB on unlicensed guiding\r\ndoubled between 2010 and 2011.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-199127af-02e4-4ca3-a0bf-1a65e8143452\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-199127af-02e4-4ca3-a0bf-1a65e8143452\"><!--a--></a>In response, STB has more\r\nthan doubled the frequency of enforcement checks, to 200 spot-checks\r\nin 2011. In addition, STB has also mounted large-scale raids at\r\nkey tourist spots. Three such operations have been conducted since\r\n2011, yielding a total of 152 suspect cases. To date, 38 individuals\r\nand companies have been issued warning letters and advisories, with\r\nlocals and foreigners making up about an equal share of these first-time\r\noffenders.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a3186bab-3698-4313-94a0-16b5705a6316\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-a3186bab-3698-4313-94a0-16b5705a6316\"><!--a--></a>Nevertheless, there are\r\nsome inherent limitations to STB's enforcement capabilities today,\r\nwhich we are addressing. First, the provisions of the Tourist Guides\r\nRegulations today\r\nare defined quite narrowly, making detection and enforcement challenging. Second,\r\nillegal guiding is neither a seizable nor compoundable offence.\r\nThis means offenders cannot be penalised on the spot, and foreign\r\noffenders in particular may leave the country before investigations\r\nare complete. Third, the current penalties for illegal guiding were\r\nset in 1985 and we need to update them to maintain their deterrent\r\neffect.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 393</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1fa32ece-8848-41d4-9d2b-821f9302303e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-1fa32ece-8848-41d4-9d2b-821f9302303e\"><!--a--></a>To address these limitations,\r\nMTI and STB are reviewing the regulatory framework and will progressively\r\nintroduce changes and enhancements.

Indeed,\r\nas I quoted from the statistics, it is roughly in equal proportions,\r\nSingaporeans and non-Singaporeans or foreigners. So, we should bear\r\nthat in mind when we approach this. Secondly, on what number has\r\nbeen displaced, I think it would be hard for me to guess because\r\nit depends on factors that are unknown to us and we really do not\r\nknow how many are actually involved in this.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f5fa2715-d98e-4a32-a1bd-93e4741972b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-f5fa2715-d98e-4a32-a1bd-93e4741972b5\"><!--a--></a>More important than all\r\nof this, we need to be very clear that our objective is to make sure\r\nthat the tourism experience in Singapore is an authentic one for\r\nthe visitors.

Has STB considered outsourcing\r\nsome of these enforcement functions? And if so, may I also suggest\r\nthat those outsourced to conduct their enforcement checks should\r\nhave the relevant experience in detecting these unlicensed guides\r\nbecause it is an industry which is quite unique and it is not easy to\r\ndetect.

Then,\r\nthere will be other elements which may require perhaps changes in\r\nregulation or legislation, in which case it may take a bit longer.\r\nOverall, I expect that in the next 12 to 18 months, perhaps a bit\r\nlonger for some of the provisions, we should be able to address\r\nsome of them.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 394</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-505f46fa-589b-48d2-bea0-47017c1c963e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d97510e-28d2-4bbd-9fdc-5748496c2ab0__id-505f46fa-589b-48d2-bea0-47017c1c963e\"><!--a--></a>On the Member's question\r\nabout whether we will enhance the enforcement provisions, and to\r\naddress travel agents as well, the answer is \"yes\". It will be a comprehensive\r\nlook at the range of issues and the stakeholders in the industry.\r\nI want to inform Members that, today, the regime is such that we\r\ndo have penalties against those who are illegal tour guides, those\r\nwho are employing illegal tour guides and the travel agents as well,\r\nthat is, the companies, the body corporate.

They conduct the courses, and typically\r\nthese are part-time courses which take about six months.

It is relating to paternity\r\nleave. I have argued several times in the House, I have been pushing\r\nto legislate paternity leave. I recognise the other angles, the\r\nbusiness costs of it. But I think we should make a start somewhere,\r\nand legislating it even for as short as one day. It is an important\r\nsignalling effect from the Government. After all, all of us recognise\r\nthat parenting is a shared responsibility by both the mother and\r\nthe father. Having talked to many residents, young couples, many\r\nof them have cited that paternity leave is something that is important\r\nto the family. I believe it is important to push that and allow our TFR to go up.

Let me clarify that\r\nno Chinese character was used in the textbook. Instead, the <em class=\"ph i\">hanyu\r\npinyin</em> \"<em class=\"ph i\">shi</em>\" was used.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4d0669e6-faf4-471d-b366-6dbfb4914c13\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-959824e1-c2c9-49bc-aee4-536a48968606__id-4d0669e6-faf4-471d-b366-6dbfb4914c13\"><!--a--></a>The misunderstanding arose\r\nwhen the person who spotted this, translated and interpreted \"<em class=\"ph i\">shi</em>\"\r\nas in the Chinese character \"<em class=\"ph i\">boshi</em>\" (\"\u535a\u58eb\").

First question \u2013 we have seen from\r\nthe report that there have been shortcomings in the maintenance\r\nwork culture and the COI recommended that SMRT focus on being an\r\nengineering company, which suggested that it was not really focused on\r\nthat before. So, is this due to the setup of the structure of this\r\nsystem where there is a focus on making profits rather than engineering,\r\nwhich is a cost centre? Engineering is the cost centre for SMRT\r\nat this point of time and it will be for the foreseeable future. Second\r\nquestion \u2013 what leverage does LTA have over the operators? The Minister mentioned\r\nthat there are plans to increase the fines and there are also plans\r\nto work together more with the operators and have more performance\r\nmetrics. Besides all these things, I think underlying the whole\r\nthing is just the fines that are going to be increased. Is there\r\nany other leverage that LTA has over the operators to ensure that\r\nthey do what they are supposed to do?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-48374610-e627-4b87-9fc4-01ee39bb03cf\">\r\n               <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-48374610-e627-4b87-9fc4-01ee39bb03cf\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-692ba712-86bb-4f59-89cc-6f7bf641069d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-692ba712-86bb-4f59-89cc-6f7bf641069d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. Let me deal with\r\nthe second one first, which is on the leverage. In addition to working\r\nwith them, fines and so on, there is also the issue of a licence.\r\nWhat happens is that we have a licence that is for a limited duration.\r\nFor the North-South-East-West Lines (NSEWL), the licence expires\r\nin 2028. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-77835c5c-0f70-42df-a02d-f7e6c69fb6cf\">\r\n               <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-77835c5c-0f70-42df-a02d-f7e6c69fb6cf\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-35a3fa4d-740c-4155-81c8-60ed2a013e91\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-35a3fa4d-740c-4155-81c8-60ed2a013e91\"><!--a--></a>And because we have more\r\nthan one operator in the system, we do have \u2013 as we had done for\r\nthe Downtown Line earlier last year \u2013 the possibility of putting\r\nout the lines for tender and getting the best offer from potential\r\noperators to run these lines. So, it is not as if SMRT will be able\r\nto run these lines indefinitely. They have a licence. The licence\r\nis for a fixed duration and it will be up for renewal.

They have to find the balance between\r\nbeing a commercial entity as well as being an engineering company\r\nthat provides an essential public service. The COI \u2013 and I agree\r\nwith them \u2013 felt that going forward, the SMRT needed to pay more\r\nattention to the engineering aspects. Has there been an over-emphasis\r\non the commercial aspects and should we strip it out from the operator altogether?\r\nThat probably is the gist of the question. If I could continue the\r\ndiscussion from yesterday on buses and extend it to trains now \u2013\r\nand we look at what is happening in different parts of the world\r\n\u2013 back to this issue of whether public transport should be nationalised?\r\nShould it be single operator concentrating solely on not the commercial parts,\r\nbut the engineering and delivering the service? I think you will\r\nfind that there are different models. The two models that I thought\r\nmaybe worthy of bringing to the attention of the Members of the\r\nHouse is that adopted by London tube and the New York subway. Both\r\nof these systems are run by nationalised entities that focus only\r\non the delivery of the essential service.

So, that is an\r\nabsolutely valid point. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8ef6949d-a4e5-4f74-ac5d-10959027ba8e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-8ef6949d-a4e5-4f74-ac5d-10959027ba8e\"><!--a--></a>On the audits: in addition\r\nto what LTA does and will continue to do, we are talking about getting\r\nindependent auditors and assessors to come in, to take a look and\r\nprovide us with a heath check every three years or so.

I have two clarifications. One is I wonder whether the\r\nprofit nature of the operators, which forces them to look after\r\nthe bottom line, has resulted in the consequence of a lack of focus\r\nin the maintenance. Secondly, I would like to seek clarification\r\non incident management. The Minister earlier said that there is\r\nnow a new incidence classification system that is in sync with both\r\nthe SMRT and the LTA. I would like to know what the new classifications\r\nare and what happened in the past. I also understand that there\r\nis now a new code of practice on incident management. So, may I\r\nknow what can commuters expect if the December incidents were to\r\nhappen again?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-61f436ee-a4db-4da0-a413-68a3c8ef4749\">\r\n               <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-61f436ee-a4db-4da0-a413-68a3c8ef4749\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-15482149-b23e-4d18-88ca-6a33989cf66c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-15482149-b23e-4d18-88ca-6a33989cf66c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank\r\nthe Member for the questions.

After the December incidents, LTA has worked\r\nwith both the operators to make sure that we have a common alignment,\r\na harmonisation of the incident classification systems. It is important\r\nthat we can not only communicate clearly between the operators and\r\nthe regulator but also reach out to the other stakeholders like\r\nTransCom, SCDF and other agencies that might be able to provide\r\nsupport. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cf538a78-dea9-459d-ac65-2989987f11bc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-cf538a78-dea9-459d-ac65-2989987f11bc\"><!--a--></a>Now, let me say that, actually,\r\nbefore the December incidents, there was already an SOP, where the\r\noperator could draw on support from all these stakeholders.

If I take it at a deeper level, I guess\r\nthat it is really a question of whether we should have a separate\r\nentity altogether to look at the regulatory aspects, separate from\r\nwhat LTA is doing. It comes back to the question of whether we are\r\nbetter off dividing the limited expertise into two organisations\r\nor to house them centrally. Within the LTA today, we have made clear\r\na separation between the design, the development arm and the regulatory\r\narm, even though\r\nthey are housed under the same organisation. Part of it is really\r\nbecause we think that there is a great deal of value in making sure\r\nthat the people who have had some experience in design, development\r\nand the building of the system are able, for some of them, to transit\r\ninto the regulatory arm and therefore spend enough time there before they\r\nmove back to developing a new line or a new network altogether. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 410</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7797a095-f995-4978-baa4-a7378a652372\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-7797a095-f995-4978-baa4-a7378a652372\"><!--a--></a>Ultimately, it is the responsibility\r\nof the Ministry to make sure that LTA performs as we expect of it,\r\nboth in designing, developing, delivering the new networks that\r\nwe have planned, rolling them out on time and safely, as well as\r\nregulating the operators to make sure that they deliver on the standards\r\nthat we expect of them.

On financial viability, I think it is important\r\nand it is part of the PTC's role not only to set fares, not only\r\nto make sure the standards are upheld, but also to make sure that\r\nover the longer term, indeed the operators are financially viable.\r\nIf they run inefficient regimes, if they are unproductive and have\r\nlosses, ultimately it is the Government, the taxpayers, the commuters themselves,\r\nwho have to pay for it. To me, efficiency is important. Giving them incentives\r\nto be more productive is important. In the fare formula, there is\r\na productivity extract and so they have to meet that.

Whether it is making sure that the MFV\r\nis functioning properly, making sure that the vibration level is\r\nbeing tackled through more regular profiling of the wheels, picking\r\nup sags in the third rail at the appropriate times. There were a\r\nnumber of recommendations by the COI on how to improve the situation,\r\ngoing forward. On his point about recommendations, they are all\r\nimportant. It would be remiss of us not to pay attention across\r\nthe board to all the recommendations because we are trying to eliminate\r\nas many of the weak links as possible.

On the point\r\non system audits: let us do them first and, if necessary, we will do\r\nthem on a more frequent interval during the early years.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e37b25af-543a-49ec-b567-ce2479f5c326\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-e37b25af-543a-49ec-b567-ce2479f5c326\"><!--a--></a>I agree with Ms Denise Phua.\r\nEngineering is only the means towards an end. Therefore, the emphasis\r\non engineering is towards a more reliable system, fewer breakdowns,\r\nfewer train withdrawals so that the journeys of commuters are not interrupted.\r\nI have asked them to pay special attention to disruptions during\r\nthe peak hours. When you have a train withdrawal during peak hours,\r\nreally, the impact cascades for quite a while simply because commuters\r\nthat are detrained need to move on to the next train and the next\r\ntrain coming in is already reasonably crowded. The whole idea of\r\nmaking this more reliable is so that commuters can have greater\r\nassurance that they will\r\nhave a predictable journey. It is not really because engineering\r\nis now the item that the management is paying attention to \u2013 and\r\nthey should \u2013 but it is really because we want to deliver a better\r\nsystem.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 414</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-87dcded9-1f2f-4900-b882-a33b84df7f5d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"ministerial-statement__id-87dcded9-1f2f-4900-b882-a33b84df7f5d\"><!--a--></a>On Mr Png's point of whether\r\nthey should set aside more money or whether the regulator should\r\nrequire them to set aside more money: it is not the amount of money because\r\nthey do have the money. They are declaring profits. It is really\r\nwhat standards we hold them to. The standards that we hold them\r\nto and impose on them would subsequently translate into the extent\r\nand the amount of work that they have to do. It is not for us to\r\nsay, \"Better set aside another $10 million\" and so on and so forth.\r\nI am not so sure we want to micro-manage them to that extent. We\r\nwill ratchet up the standards, making sure that we pay attention\r\nto the right areas, doing the regular audits to throw up aspects\r\nthat we may not be aware of.

All applications for patents must undergo a search and examination process.\r\nUnder our existing self-assessment patent system, patent applications\r\nneed not, however, fully fulfil Singapore's patentability criteria\r\nin order to be granted.

Such a system\r\nallows inventors to decide whether they have made adequate adjustments\r\nto any objections raised by the examiners, or to disagree with the\r\nexaminer's assessment of their claims, before proceeding to seek\r\na patent grant if they wish to. We had also decided then not to\r\ncommit to the substantial investment which would have been required\r\nto build domestic patent search and examination capabilities.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-41940948-82d1-476b-bd51-c5fc720f3589\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-41940948-82d1-476b-bd51-c5fc720f3589\"><!--a--></a>Over the past five years,\r\nthe proportion of Singapore patent grants based on fully positive\r\nexamination reports has climbed to over 90%.

It is, as the title suggests,\r\na system which relies on the applicant seeking patent possession\r\nto ensure himself that it has met the patentability criteria. Thus,\r\na patent could well be granted regardless of the outcome of the\r\nexamination report and without necessary compliance with the patentability\r\ncriteria which are three things: novelty, inventive step and industrial\r\napplicability. Under the old system or the present system, the examination\r\nreports of the patent grant are made public and it is then up to\r\nthe interested party to apply to challenge it. This system was adopted\r\nin 1995 when Singapore started its own patent system because of\r\nthe then limitation in our domestic patent search and examination\r\ncapability. We also wanted to make it easier at that time to encourage\r\napplicants to apply for patents in Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f209d916-ec33-43b4-a12c-f2872f59f11d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-f209d916-ec33-43b4-a12c-f2872f59f11d\"><!--a--></a>But it is a system that\r\nremains unique in Singapore. The disadvantage, however, was that\r\npatent granted in Singapore was therefore less robust and, in some\r\nways, less recognised. With the increase in IP creation, particularly\r\nin Asia, this is no longer viable. We must enhance our patent grant\r\nsystem so that any patent granted in Singapore will be well recognised,\r\nrobust, reliable and have good standing. The amendments that this Bill\r\nseeks to introduce will achieve this by doing away with the self-assessment\r\nsystem. In its place, the Bill introduces the positive grant system.\r\nUnder the system, only applicants who have fully satisfied the patentability\r\ncriteria will be granted patents. This requires the applicant to obtain a clean\r\nexamination report, with no unresolved objections. If there are\r\nsuch objections, the applicant can apply under the proposed new section\r\n29B for an examiner to review the examination report.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 424</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d26cff22-46c0-43dd-a1ad-672c4cf45fde\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-d26cff22-46c0-43dd-a1ad-672c4cf45fde\"><!--a--></a>Sir, there is no doubt that\r\nthese changes will enhance our patent system. A successful applicant\r\nwith a Singapore granted patent will hold the patent for which an\r\nexamination has been both thorough and rigorous. And more importantly,\r\na third party dealing with such applicant or patent will know that\r\nit has been granted only after a thorough examination. This can\r\nonly lend greater certainty and promote increased confidence in the\r\nquality of locally obtained patent. In addition, these amendments\r\nalso bring Singapore's patent system in line with many established\r\njurisdictions, such as the US, the UK, Australia, Japan and also\r\nMalaysia. If we do not make these amendments now, we will risk falling\r\nbehind. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2803fa62-a5d7-46fa-b4c5-9ab9183daabe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-2803fa62-a5d7-46fa-b4c5-9ab9183daabe\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I see this as a positive\r\nstep in the enhancement of Singapore as a regional or even global\r\nhub for IP services.

For these referrals, some specialties such as orthopaedic\r\nsurgery, gastroenterology and renal medicine, have longer median\r\nwaiting times of between one and two months. A small minority \u2013\r\nabout 0.1% of subsidised patients waited six months or longer for\r\nnew SOC appointments in 2011. While such long waiting times are\r\nnot the norm in public hospitals, it is natural for these patients\r\nto be anxious as they would like to be examined by the specialists\r\nas soon as possible. We have thus been working actively with the\r\nhospitals to reduce waiting times at the SOCs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-794fd2f2-35a4-4c9f-b4ba-323314863c42\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-794fd2f2-35a4-4c9f-b4ba-323314863c42\"><!--a--></a>Hospitals employ a multi-pronged\r\napproach to reduce waiting times. First, hospitals are taking steps\r\nto improve the efficiency of the appointment system by reminding patients\r\nof their appointments via phone calls and text messages and also\r\nenabling patients to make changes of appointments more easily through\r\ndedicated central SOC appointment call centres. In this way, they\r\ncan help reduce \"no-show\" rates, where appointments are made but\r\npatients fail to show up. Second, hospitals are also working closely\r\nwith Polyclinics and GPs to continue the care of patients who no\r\nlonger require specialist care at the SOC, and to minimise unnecessary\r\nreferrals to SOC in the first place if the patients can be adequately\r\ncared for at the polyclinics and private GP clinics. This way, we\r\ncan reduce the unnecessary patient load at the SOC and free up more\r\ncapacity for those who really need specialist care. Third, as announced\r\nduring the COS debate earlier this year, we are setting up more\r\nMedical Centres (MCs) in the community. In addition to Jurong Medical\r\nCentre which opened since 2006, more will be set up over the next\r\nfew years. MCs are designed to provide broad-based specialist care\r\nin a community setting. Patients who need specialist care in selected\r\nspecialties will be able to see specialists in an MC nearer their\r\nhomes. With the support of specialists in these MCs, GPs can co-manage\r\npatients with more complex but stable conditions in the community\r\nas part of shared care programmes. The MCs will also have diagnostic\r\nand support services to serve the patients and support the GPs.\r\nThe setting up of MCs will help to further ease the load at the\r\nSOC in our acute hospitals.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 429</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Public Sector\r\nDoctors Leaving for Private Sector<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-5fdd9f3e-8c14-4a59-8e1e-d65f9b6f3ff8\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-5fdd9f3e-8c14-4a59-8e1e-d65f9b6f3ff8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <h2 class=\"shortdesc hcSubTitle\">(Trend given recent increase\r\nin private hospitals)</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-aeced605-68b6-436e-b38b-badf8cfa3eb5\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-aeced605-68b6-436e-b38b-badf8cfa3eb5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fa8bc215-d356-4abc-8879-1073892a1b6d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-fa8bc215-d356-4abc-8879-1073892a1b6d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">22</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Tan Su Shan</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Health (a) how have the upcoming new private hospitals\r\naffected the public hospitals' ability to retain senior doctors;\r\n(b) what is the percentage of senior doctors who have left for private\r\npractice recently; and (c) how does this affect the public sector's\r\nability to train and mentor young doctors from medical schools. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-e0ed45af-b2f3-4360-a677-e2b47c084aa2\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-e0ed45af-b2f3-4360-a677-e2b47c084aa2\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 430</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0b994b22-3935-421b-b8f7-43cdf62c5f86\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-0b994b22-3935-421b-b8f7-43cdf62c5f86\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr\r\nGan Kim Yong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: At the national level, MOH plans healthcare\r\ninfrastructural capacity and healthcare manpower staffing in tandem\r\nto ensure that there is sufficient manpower to meet service expansions.\r\nOver the years, we have been growing the supply of doctors (both\r\nspecialists and non-specialists) through increasing local medical undergraduate\r\nand postgraduate training pipelines.

For example, HAIs could occur during surgery when\r\na patient's skin, the body's natural defence against infection,\r\nis breached. The use of in-body medical devices, such as urinary\r\ncatheters, can predispose a patient to infections arising from such\r\ndevices. Patients with conditions, such as diabetes and kidney failure,\r\nare also more susceptible to infections because of their lowered\r\nimmune status. Some treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer,\r\nmay also lower a patient's immunity thus increasing the risk for\r\nHAIs. HAIs often occur as a result of a combination of factors.\r\nIt is therefore not conclusive that high bed occupancy rate (BOR)\r\ndirectly leads to higher HAIs. In fact, a recent study of BOR and\r\nMethicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) shows that there\r\nis a lack of consistent correlation between them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-52c44a42-b80e-44bf-ba3d-20645495ca44\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-52c44a42-b80e-44bf-ba3d-20645495ca44\"><!--a--></a>To minimise transmission\r\nof bacteria and reduce HAIs, our public hospitals have instituted\r\nstrict infection control measures.
