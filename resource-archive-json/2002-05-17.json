Prof. Chin  Tet\r\n\r\nYung].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, when we\r\n\r\nreceived news about the detention of the Singaporean with Al-Qaeda links by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, it  must\r\n\r\nhave  shocked many of us.  Many of us asked how is it that  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean could have been involved.  It brought home to  us\r\n\r\nthe  sad  truth that terrorism is a world-wide  scourge  that\r\n\r\nspares  no  country,  however small and however  secure.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  what  was most reassuring was that our  ISD,  having\r\n\r\nreceived  information from one of its sources  on  the  first\r\n\r\nsuspected  terrorist, had already been discreetly  monitoring\r\n\r\nhim  and  those linked to him.  ISD subsequently  detained  a\r\n\r\nnumber of suspects linked to him and briefed the Americans on\r\n\r\nthis  case  around  mid-December.   It  was  only  after  the\r\n\r\nbriefing  that the Americans informed ISD that the video-tape\r\n\r\nabout  targets in Singapore was found.  Fortunately  for  us,\r\n\r\nthe  people  behind the making of the tape had  already  been\r\n\r\ndetained  by the time the existence of the tape was disclosed\r\n\r\nby  the  Americans.   A potential catastrophe  was  therefore\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, combating terrorism is no longer just a national\r\n\r\nsecurity  issue.   It  is  a multi-national  security  issue.\r\n\r\nIntelligence  departments have to  work  together  and  share\r\n\r\ninformation  quickly and accurately, if we are  to  have  any\r\n\r\nsuccess in avoiding terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to read in the Straits Times that there will\r\n\r\nbe  a meeting of the ASEAN Security Ministers to come up with\r\n\r\nan ASEAN-wide counter-terrorist agreement, next week in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.   One of the items on the agenda apparently would  be\r\n\r\nto  discuss  how  to  shore  up domestic  laws  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of combating terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange how a catastrophe can change opinions\r\n\r\non   detention  laws.   Before  the  September  11  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks,  many  countries  in the  liberal  world  and  other\r\n\r\nliberal  NGOs  criticised the detention  laws,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nInternal   Security  Act  and  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act  as draconian.  Recently, the  US  Attorney-General, John Ashcroft, endorsed Malaysia's Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct, which is actually very similar to ours.  Indeed, the  US\r\n\r\nnow   has  a  Patriot  Act  that  contains  over  a  thousand\r\n\r\nprovisions,  far  exceeding  the  scope  and  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that, now, no one would question the need\r\n\r\nfor  such  legislation as a powerful weapon to fight  against\r\n\r\nterrorism.   The  task is to see how we can have  legislation\r\n\r\nthat  would enable the law enforcement agencies to  do  their\r\n\r\njob  well and yet not intrude into the lives of ordinary law-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister just two\r\n\r\nquestions.  First, whether Singapore's existing links to, and\r\n\r\nthe  level  of cooperation with, other intelligence agencies,\r\n\r\nespecially those in the region, are adequate.  And, secondly,\r\n\r\nwhether   there  needs  to  be  a  review  of  our   domestic\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  shore up the powers of the  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies to combat terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  thank  the Members for raising the questions.   They  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  about the security situation,  and  asked\r\n\r\nwhether Singapore is prepared for the threat of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first give Members an overview of the security\r\n\r\nsituation and measures that we have taken to deal with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of terrorism to Singapore is not a new one.\r\n\r\nWe  have  had  our brush with terrorist groups in  the  past.\r\n\r\nBut,  in all these incidents, the involvement of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwas  minimal.   In  contrast,  the  recent  Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\nepisode  saw  the participation of Singaporeans in  terrorist\r\n\r\nplans which, had they succeeded,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould have resulted in significant loss of lives.  Mr Tan Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon and other Members have commented on this too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group so\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the previous groups?  At the  risk  of  over-simplification, what has made the difference is impact of the\r\n\r\nAl-Qaeda.  It was the exposure of Jemaah Islamiyah leaders to\r\n\r\nthe  jihad  in  Afghanistan and to  Al-Qaeda  training  which\r\n\r\nradicalised   them,   not   only   by   imbibing   Al-Qaeda's\r\n\r\nsophisticated terrorist tradecraft, but also its ideology  of\r\n\r\nglobal jihad.  Ibrahim Maidin, the Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah\r\n\r\nleader, understood the importance of this Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda  exposure, and went to considerable lengths  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat a flow of selected Jemaah Islamiyah cadres were sent  to\r\n\r\nAfghanistan.  That the Jemaah Islamiyah subscribed to the Al-Qaeda's  global  jihad agenda is obvious.   For  even  as  it\r\n\r\nmaintained  its  own vision of, first, an Islamic  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nand later an expanded vision of an Islamic nusantara (meaning\r\n\r\nMalay   Archipelago)  comprising  Malaysia,   Indonesia   and\r\n\r\nMindanao, Jemaah Islamiyah members were ready to take part in\r\n\r\nthe  Al-Qaeda's global terrorist war against those  whom  Al-Qaeda deemed as the enemies of Islam, namely the Americans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in 1997, nearly four years before the September\r\n\r\n11,  2001  attacks, Singapore's Jemaah Islamiyah members  had\r\n\r\nthemselves  conceived  of a plan to attack  the  shuttle  bus\r\n\r\nconveying  American personnel to Yishun MRT.  This  plan  was\r\n\r\nsubmitted to, and was approved, by the Al-Qaeda leaders,  but\r\n\r\nfor  reasons  unknown,  was not subsequently  pursued.   Then\r\n\r\nagain   in  October  2001,  when  an  Arab-Canadian  Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\noperative approached the Jemaah Islamiyah for help to  launch\r\n\r\nmultiple  truck  bomb  attacks against US-linked  targets  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the local Jemaah Islamiyah cell readily acceded to\r\n\r\nthis  request.   Had  they not been stopped  in  time,  these\r\n\r\nattacks  would have no doubt occurred.  In fact,  even  after\r\n\r\nthey   learned  of  the  arrests  by  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nDepartment, the Jemaah Islamiyah leaders met in Johore a  few\r\n\r\ndays later and instructed the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah  members to continue with  the  attacks  in\r\n\r\nretaliation  of  the  arrests.  To this end,  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nJemaah Islamiyah bomb maker, Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, who  was\r\n\r\ncalled \"Mike\", was about to buy 4.8 tonnes of TNT when he was\r\n\r\narrested  by Filipino Police following intelligence from  the\r\n\r\nISD.  At the time of his arrest, he had already acquired  and\r\n\r\nstashed  away  1.2 tonnes of TNT, 2,400 metres  of  detonator\r\n\r\ncord  and  hundreds of detonator caps destined to be smuggled\r\n\r\nfrom Mindanao to Indonesia, then to Malaysia and, finally, to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist challenge that Singapore and the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  world are facing today is like nothing we have  ever\r\n\r\nencountered  before.  Terrorism is not a new phenomenon.   It\r\n\r\nis an old scourge which has plagued many countries throughout\r\n\r\nthe  world since even the turn of the 20th century.  But most\r\n\r\nof  these  terrorist  groups were generally  local  in  their\r\n\r\nagenda  and  their  operations.   These  would  include,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri  Lanka,\r\n\r\nthe  Irish  Republican Army in the UK, the Basque Separatists\r\n\r\nin  Spain  or even the Shining Path of Peru in South America.\r\n\r\nIn our region, until recent years when links were established\r\n\r\nwith  external groups, we have the Abu Sayyaf  and  the  Moro\r\n\r\nIslamic  Liberation Front in the Philippines.   All  of  them\r\n\r\nmounted  terrorist  operations mainly in their  own  national\r\n\r\ndomains.   The Al-Qaeda however is a trans-national terrorist\r\n\r\norganisation with sleeper cells all over the world.   It  has\r\n\r\noperational reach anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Al-Qaeda is, of course, not the first of its kind in\r\n\r\nthis  regard.  There were terrorist organisations which  also\r\n\r\noperated internationally.  Members of the Japanese Red  Army,\r\n\r\nfor  example, came all the way to Singapore to mount the Laju\r\n\r\nincident  in  1974.  What makes the Al-Qaeda  unique  is  its\r\n\r\nability   to   successfully  franchise  and  indigenise   its\r\n\r\nterrorist   expertise  and  ideological   agenda   to   other\r\n\r\nautonomous,  local militant Islamic organisations  throughout\r\n\r\nthe world, including, as you have seen, the Jemaah Islamiyah.\r\n\r\nThe Al-Qaeda is able to weave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntogether  a  brotherhood  of  local  terrorist  and  militant\r\n\r\norganisations,  each  with its own agenda  and  revolutionary\r\n\r\nhistories but, at the same time, ideologically linked to  the\r\n\r\nagenda of a common global jihad.  This means that even if the\r\n\r\nAl-Qaeda is dismantled, the pursuit of its jihad continues in\r\n\r\nthese local groups.  And given the internal resources and the\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  these groups, the threat of  terrorism  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  for  a long time to come.  This is what  makes  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  complex terrorist threat that we are facing  such  a\r\n\r\nresilient,  borderless and porous phenomenon.   This  is  why\r\n\r\nSingapore strongly condemns all forms of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible member of the global community,\r\n\r\nSingapore  fully supports international efforts in  combating\r\n\r\nterrorism.   In doing so, the United Nations Act was  enacted\r\n\r\nto  implement the United Nations Security Council  Resolution\r\n\r\n1373.   Under  the  Act, regulations allowing  us  to  effect\r\n\r\nmeasures  mandated by the UN Security Council can be  issued.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time, relevant international  conventions  and\r\n\r\nprotocols relating to terrorism are being reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore works closely with its ASEAN partners to\r\n\r\ncombat terrorism.  The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism\r\n\r\nthat  I am attending in Kuala Lumpur next week is an example.\r\n\r\nISD  has  regular  contacts with its foreign counterparts  to\r\n\r\nexchange  intelligence.  These have resulted  in  significant\r\n\r\nsuccesses, such as the arrest of bomb maker Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi   in  the  Philippines.   Beyond  terrorism,  our   law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies have established close  relations  with\r\n\r\nthe   other   regional  counterparts  to  deal   with   other\r\n\r\ntransnational  crimes,  such as drug  trafficking  and  other\r\n\r\nserious crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon is interested in our National\r\n\r\nEmergency  System (NEST).  The NEST has been in  place  since\r\n\r\n1982  to  ensure that Singapore survives any security threat.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  comprehensive system encompassing civil  security,\r\n\r\ncivil  defence and the smooth operation of our economy during\r\n\r\nan  emergency.   It also ensures the provision  of  essential\r\n\r\nservices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch as water, power, health services, food and fuel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Ministries and certain key Government agencies\r\n\r\nare involved in NEST.  I chair the National Emergency Council\r\n\r\ncomprising  the  Permanent Secretaries of all the  Ministries\r\n\r\nand   the  key  appointment  holders  of  certain  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  to  set  the  policies and  provide  guidelines  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate  and  prioritise  the operations  of  the  various\r\n\r\nbodies involved in this National Emergency System.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a Security and Policy Review Committee set\r\n\r\nup  since 1988 and comprising the Ministers for Defence, Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and Foreign Affairs to monitor the strategic security\r\n\r\nissues,    particularly   those   requiring    inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncoordination.  We also have the Executive Group,  chaired  by\r\n\r\nmy   Permanent   Secretary,  and  comprising  the   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries  of the key Ministries to lead in the  management\r\n\r\nof any civil security or civil emergency situation, such as a\r\n\r\nhijack, a bomb explosion, terrorist sabotage and other  civil\r\n\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we set up the National Emergency Behaviour\r\n\r\nSystem as a key component of the National Emergency System to\r\n\r\nmitigate and manage stress experienced by victims and provide\r\n\r\npsychological  support for traumatised individuals  during  a\r\n\r\ncivil  or  a  national emergency.  Today, we  have  emergency\r\n\r\nresponders, nurses and teachers who are trained as  emergency\r\n\r\nbehaviour officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various exercises are carried out from time to time.\r\n\r\nSome  are  more  visible,  such as  the  air  crash  exercise\r\n\r\nconducted  in  May  2001 along Holland  Road  which  involved\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  grassroots  organisations  as  well   as\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.  We also conduct blood donation  drives\r\n\r\nand  shelter exercises which involve the public from time  to\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Singapore Civil Defence Force conducts\r\n\r\ncivil  resource mobilisation exercises regularly.  And  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  note  that  the civil resource  owners  have  shown\r\n\r\nencouraging  support for these exercises.   There  are  other\r\n\r\nexercises which are less visible to the public, and these are\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  test  out the response plans  of  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies in handling and dealing with an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nMembers  asked me to tell in greater detail what these  plans\r\n\r\nare.   For obvious reasons, we do not publicise these  plans,\r\n\r\nlest potential trouble makers learn how to overcome them,  or\r\n\r\nto sabotage them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the emergency behaviour officers,\r\n\r\nmany of them have been put into practice when we had the  air\r\n\r\ncrashes  in  Palembang  and  Taiwan,  as  well  as  in  other\r\n\r\nearthquake disasters, such as in Taiwan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members also spoke about the need for multi-agency coordination to deal with terrorist threats. We\r\n\r\nrecognise this.  At the strategic level, the coordination  is\r\n\r\nenhanced  through the establishment of the National  Security\r\n\r\nSecretariat,  which DPM Tan mentioned yesterday,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nstaffed  by  the Home Team and officers from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence.  The Joint Counter-Terrorism Centre was also set  up\r\n\r\nto  share  intelligence on terrorism among  the  intelligence\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further tighten the inter-Ministry coordination, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has recently set up the Homefront Security  Centre,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  have  oversight of the security  operations  and\r\n\r\njoint exercises to test responses to the various threats.  It\r\n\r\nwill  work closely with MINDEF and other Government  agencies\r\n\r\nand departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's openness to trade and travel is our\r\n\r\neconomic  strength,  but it can also be a security  weakness.\r\n\r\nSo, following the September 11 attacks, security measures  at\r\n\r\nour borders have been intensified to prevent the infiltration\r\n\r\nof  undesirable persons.  Stringent immigration and  security\r\n\r\nchecks are carried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout at all sea, land and air checkpoints.  All seamen are now\r\n\r\nrequired   to   undergo  full  immigration   clearance.    To\r\n\r\nfacilitate  this, the Clifford Pier and the West Coast  Ferry\r\n\r\nTerminal have been gazetted as designated landing points with\r\n\r\nfull immigration, customs and security facilities recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, we have also enhanced our operational\r\n\r\ncapability  using technology.  The Singapore Immigration  and\r\n\r\nRegistration  has acquired equipment to detect forged  travel\r\n\r\ndocuments.   X-ray machines and walk-through metal  detectors\r\n\r\nare  deployed  to  detect weapons and explosives.   Explosive\r\n\r\nsniffers capable of detecting explosives such as TNT, or even\r\n\r\nC4   -   an explosive substance found in the shoe of the  man\r\n\r\nwho  travelled  on a plane to America  -   which  has  a  low\r\n\r\nvapour emission, are also deployed.  Mobile x-ray machines at\r\n\r\nthe  land  checkpoints enable effective inspection  of  cargo\r\n\r\nvehicles.   In  addition,  my  Ministry,  together  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of Transport, Trade and Industry and Finance,  is\r\n\r\nconsidering a security regime to screen and inspect  imports,\r\n\r\nexports  and  transhipment cargo at our ports.   This  system\r\n\r\nwill  leverage  on  technology, such as  x-ray  scanners  and\r\n\r\nradiological detectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October last year, visa requirements have also\r\n\r\nbeen  imposed on visitors from certain countries in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe   global   security  situation.   This  allows   security\r\n\r\nscreening of visitors before their arrival in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key installations and high-risk establishments are\r\n\r\nattractive  targets for terrorists.  If our key installations\r\n\r\nare   sabotaged,   lives  will  be  lost  and   Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nconfidence will be shaken.   Therefore, Police and,  in  some\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  SAF  and  Gurkha  officers  are  deployed  at\r\n\r\nestablishments  such as Changi Airport,  Tuas  and  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoints, key Government buildings as well as our oil  and\r\n\r\nwater  installations.   Regular  patrols  are  conducted  and\r\n\r\nphysical  measures,  such as closed  circuit  television  and\r\n\r\nsecurity lighting, are put in place.  Police and ISD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  also conducted training for security agencies  and  in-house guards of key installations.  The training includes the\r\n\r\nidentification of bombs, firearms and other weapons, and  how\r\n\r\nto  respond to incidents such as a bomb explosion, should  it\r\n\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when arrested, the Jemaah Islamiyah members already\r\n\r\nhad  four  tonnes of ammonium nitrate kept in a warehouse  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and were planning to acquire another 17 tonnes  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  truck bombs.  While ammonium nitrate  is  widely\r\n\r\nused  as  fertilisers, it can also be turned into explosives.\r\n\r\nThere  are  other commercial substances that can be similarly\r\n\r\nmisused.   While we have a system of monitoring  the  import,\r\n\r\ntransport and storage of hazardous materials, my Ministry  is\r\n\r\ncurrently   studying  whether  the  controls  over  hazardous\r\n\r\nmaterials  and commodities that can be misused by  terrorists\r\n\r\nneed to be refined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely believed that many terrorist activities are\r\n\r\nfunded  from  Osama  Bin Laden's personal fortune  through  a\r\n\r\nseries of money laundering operations.  It is vital that  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of our banking system be protected from such abuse.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a  rigorous system of checks  to  detect  and\r\n\r\ncounter  criminal use of the financial system.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nintroducing the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Bill  in\r\n\r\nParliament next week.  This legislation will give  effect  to\r\n\r\nthe  International  Convention for  the  Suppression  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancing  of  Terrorism,  which  Singapore  signed  on  18th\r\n\r\nDecember  2001.  Thus far, we have not detected any terrorist\r\n\r\naccounts  in  our  financial system.  Nevertheless,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue with our strict monitoring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may recall that the US had five anthrax-related deaths last year. This caused a series of anthrax\r\n\r\nhoaxes in many parts of the world.  From October last year to\r\n\r\n16th  May  this  year,  143 cases of suspected  anthrax  were\r\n\r\nreported to the Police.  All turned out to be false alarms or\r\n\r\npranks.   I  urge  those  who tried this  not  to  waste  the\r\n\r\nPolice's and the security forces'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  by  calling  them  up  and  putting  white  powder\r\n\r\nsubstances,  and therefore detracting them from  their  major\r\n\r\nrole of protecting the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Charles Chong asked if we are ready to\r\n\r\ndeal  with biochemical threats.  I would like to assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  we have a system in place to monitor and  detect\r\n\r\nany  biological  outbreak early.  Our security  agencies  and\r\n\r\nmedical services are prepared and equipped to deal with  such\r\n\r\ncontingencies.   We  have systems in  place  to  monitor  and\r\n\r\ndetect any biological outbreak early.  The Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nhas  sent  out directives to medical practitioners  to  alert\r\n\r\nthem  to  the symptoms that a patient would demonstrate  upon\r\n\r\nthe exposure to biological or chemical agents.  Our hospitals\r\n\r\nalso  have adequate facilities and medical supplies to handle\r\n\r\nsuch  a  contingency.  Since 1996, after the sarin attack  in\r\n\r\nTokyo, the Singapore Civil Defence Force has been raising its\r\n\r\nlevel   of  preparedness  to  respond  to  any  chemical   or\r\n\r\nbiological  agent  attack.   The  Civil  Defence  Force  will\r\n\r\nreorganise its resources to better handle these threats.  Two\r\n\r\nnew hazardous materials (Hazmat) stations will be established\r\n\r\non  Jurong Island and in Tuas by 2004.   The skills level  of\r\n\r\nthe   Hazmat   specialists  will   be   enhanced   and   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  equipment acquired.  We  have  also  conducted\r\n\r\nstudy  visits  to other countries to see how they  deal  with\r\n\r\nsuch threats and to learn from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is also concerned about threats to our\r\n\r\nfinancial system or cyber crime problems.  Threats like these\r\n\r\nare  certainly emerging in cyberspace.  Terrorists can  carry\r\n\r\nout cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as telecommunications networks, and cause great  damage\r\n\r\nto  our  economy  and  our lives.  To  deal  with  this,  the\r\n\r\nInfocomm Development Authority has worked out policies, plans\r\n\r\nand crisis management framework for infocomm emergencies with\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with Prof. Chin that it is just not\r\n\r\nenough  for  the  Government agencies to  be  prepared.   The\r\n\r\ncommunity has an important role to play.  Homefront  security\r\n\r\nmust  be  the  shared  responsibility of  every  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of Total Defence concept in 1984,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  consciously  enhancing  the   security\r\n\r\nawareness  amongst  Singaporeans.   For  example,  the  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  Force  provides  handbooks  containing  a  list   of\r\n\r\nimportant telephone numbers as well as information,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  improvised  covers at  home,  tips  on  cardio-pulmonary   resuscitation  (CPR),  first-aid,  dealing   with\r\n\r\nhazardous materials, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Prof. Chin that volunteers are\r\n\r\nindeed  given  a  role in ensuring the community's  security.\r\n\r\nFor  example, we have the Civil Defence Executive  Committees\r\n\r\nin  the various constituencies which focus on the fire safety\r\n\r\nand  emergency  preparedness, and manages the  Civil  Defence\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Scheme.  To date, a total of 60,000 CD  volunteers\r\n\r\nhave  been trained under this scheme in skills such as  first\r\n\r\naid,   rescue  and  evacuation  procedures,  and  basic  fire\r\n\r\nfighting.   This ensures that they are equipped to take  care\r\n\r\nof  the community in times of emergency.  Another example  is\r\n\r\nthe Neighbourhood Watch Zones which boast of a total of 4,000\r\n\r\nvolunteers,  of which about 1,000 are women.   These  provide\r\n\r\nthe  \"eyes  and  ears\" on safety and security issues  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a crisis, it is vital that the community does not\r\n\r\nfurther  dissipate our security resources through unwarranted\r\n\r\nfear,  suspicion and paranoia.  Singaporeans could also  help\r\n\r\nour  security  agencies by staying calm in an  emergency  and\r\n\r\nalerting  the security agencies if they come across something\r\n\r\nsuspicious  in  the  neighbourhood.   Police  has  and   will\r\n\r\ncontinue to share information on what to look out for and who\r\n\r\nto  call  should  suspicious items or  persons  be  found  or\r\n\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked how we can prevent ourselves from being\r\n\r\na target for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterrorists.   Let  me  say  that,  today,  every  country  is\r\n\r\npotentially vulnerable.  Singapore is no exception.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  have crippled the Jemaah Islamiyah cells and its plans in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the threat of terrorism  has not gone away, and it\r\n\r\nis  not  likely to disappear for some time to come.  We  have\r\n\r\nprotective  measures in place, but there  is  no  recipe  for\r\n\r\nimmunity.   The best we can ask our people to  do  is  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant  and take a shared sense of responsibility over  our\r\n\r\ncommon   collective  security.   For  example,  the  critical\r\n\r\ninformation  that  the ISD received that led  to  the  Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah investigation came from a concerned Singaporean who\r\n\r\ntold ISD that a Singaporean called Muhammad Aslam bin Yar Ali\r\n\r\nKhan had links with Al Qaeda.  ISD put him and his associates\r\n\r\nunder  surveillance but did not arrest him when he  left  for\r\n\r\nAfghanistan  on 4th October 2001.  After he was  arrested  by\r\n\r\nthe  Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, news broke at the  end\r\n\r\nof  November  and  MHA  was asked by the  press  to  comment.\r\n\r\nFearing  that  all  his  associates  would  flee,  ISD  began\r\n\r\narresting  the  Jemaah Islamiyah group on 9th  December  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerned Singaporean who passed ISD the information\r\n\r\nwas not the only example in this case.  There were others who\r\n\r\nstepped forward with useful information when the case  became\r\n\r\npublic.   This  included an expatriate working in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nObviously, everyone who lives in Singapore and shares in  its\r\n\r\nsafe  and secure environment can have a positive contribution\r\n\r\nto make.  The world is a less safe place today; we need to be\r\n\r\non  guard.   But we must not let this sober reality undermine\r\n\r\nour self-confidence and allow fear to reduce us into paranoia\r\n\r\nand paralysis.  We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated\r\n\r\nby terrorism; life must and will go on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are ready to deal with the challenges posed by\r\n\r\nthe  current security climate.  I can assure this House  that\r\n\r\nour  officers are well trained and equipped to handle a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of security threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans themselves must never take racial and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranted.   I  am  glad  to  note  that  Singaporeans   reject\r\n\r\nextremist  elements,  regardless of race  or  religion.   The\r\n\r\nstability  and  trust that has taken more than  30  years  to\r\n\r\nbuild  must prevail if Singapore is to survive as  a  nation.\r\n\r\nThis  requires  the  involvement  of  all  Singaporeans.   By\r\n\r\nremaining  vigilant,  united and  steadfast,  the  challenges\r\n\r\nwould be more easily overcome, and we would emerge a stronger\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the Central Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau  caught  3,417 drug abusers last  year.

Among them were  784\r\n\r\nnew abusers, representing a 17% increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to raise a primary concern that the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people caught with synthetic drugs has  gone  up.\r\n\r\nThe  new  \"club  drugs\" Ketamine, Ice and  55  are  now  more\r\n\r\npopular  with abusers, with \"K\" or Ketamine, being  the  most\r\n\r\npopular  currently.  Its popularity is due in a large measure\r\n\r\nto  the  misinformation that it is not addictive and  has  no\r\n\r\nlong  term  ill-effects.  Abusers take between two and  three\r\n\r\nswipes  of  one  gramme each time.  The  first  swipe  causes\r\n\r\nhallucination of about an hour and after that the  abuser  is\r\n\r\nsober;  hence, giving the impression that he is  in  control.\r\n\r\nThe  second  and third swipes might cause the  abuser  to  be\r\n\r\namnesic  and has no recollection of what happened  the  night\r\n\r\nbefore.  Because of that, it had been used in gang rapes that\r\n\r\nwent  unreported.  \"K\" is most commonly found  in  nightspots\r\n\r\nand  is  peddled by the drug syndicates.  Often,  the  senior\r\n\r\nsyndicate  members recruit younger boys and girls to  traffic\r\n\r\non their behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularity of \"K\" to traffickers and abusers alike\r\n\r\nlies  in  the difficulty in detecting the drug in the abusers\r\n\r\nshould they be caught.  Ketamine offences have risen to  24%,\r\n\r\nand  the  number  of  people  caught  using,  possessing   or\r\n\r\ntrafficking the drug increased to 207 last year, up from  167\r\n\r\nin  2000.  More than half of those arrested (55%) are younger\r\n\r\nthan 25, and one in three of the young abusers is female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high incidence of repeat offenders in\r\n\r\nsynthetic drugs.  The age of abusers starts as young  as  14,\r\n\r\nwhen they are still in school.  Almost always upon addiction,\r\n\r\nthe  abusers  would switch to the most popular and  sometimes\r\n\r\nstronger type of drugs.  Many young girls end up in a vicious\r\n\r\ncycle  of  crime,  abuses and flesh trade  to  sustain  their\r\n\r\nlifestyle.  The younger girls are forced into nightclubs  and\r\n\r\nKTVs  as  hostesses.  Does the Ministry of Home Affairs  have\r\n\r\nany  figures on such cases of young offenders?  If not,  will\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs have studies done on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether there\r\n\r\nare  any  proactive plans taken by his Ministry to  curb  the\r\n\r\nrising  trend of synthetic drug abusers?  May I  ask  whether\r\n\r\nthere are any local back-street synthetic drug manufacturers,\r\n\r\nsince such drugs are supposed to be easily produced?  Are  we\r\n\r\nvigilant in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since many of the synthetic drug users are young people\r\n\r\nand many starting as early as 14, should there be more public\r\n\r\neducation  and  drug  awareness programmes  targeted  at  our\r\n\r\nschool  children?  This is important because many of them  do\r\n\r\nnot realise the potency and addictive effects of Ketamine and\r\n\r\nits  long-term ill-effects.  May I beseech MHA to be  current\r\n\r\nin  its knowledge of new synthetic drugs and adapting quickly\r\n\r\nto  the prevailing scene at all times.  We need to be on  top\r\n\r\nof the current situation as best as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MHA should collaborate with MOH on a regular basis\r\n\r\nin  using the services of the Centre for Drug Evaluation  and\r\n\r\nInstitute of Science and Forensic Medicine to analyse the new\r\n\r\nsynthetic  drugs so as to design appropriate urine and  blood\r\n\r\ntests  to detect them.  Enabling drug detection will help  us\r\n\r\ncurb such drug abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, enjoying a strategic location for the air and sea routes\r\n\r\nhas   given  Singapore  tremendous  advantages  economically.\r\n\r\nThrough  this  unique geographical position, we succeeded  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  Singapore into air and sea hubs.  However,  these\r\n\r\ntwo  have brought special problems.  Along the heavy movement\r\n\r\nof goods and people through various entry points too flow the\r\n\r\nillicit drugs.  Singapore receives 7 million tourists a year.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  tens of thousands of Malaysian  workers  cross\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore  daily to work here.  Many  Singaporeans  too\r\n\r\nshuttle across the Causeway and the Second Link.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Singapore is not far away from the\r\n\r\nGolden Triangle, the nearest source of illegal drug, and  the\r\n\r\nfact that our country is a major transportation hub, the risk\r\n\r\nof  Singapore becoming a transit point for drugs is real.  We\r\n\r\nhave  lived under these circumstances for a long time and  so\r\n\r\nfar,  the  Ministry has done an excellent job  in  preventing\r\n\r\ndrugs  from flowing into Singapore.  However, for  every  new\r\n\r\nmeasure taken, the drug syndicates would always find new ways\r\n\r\nof  overcoming them.  My question is: what are the new  plans\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry has in mind to counter this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent figures released by the MHA show that the\r\n\r\nnumber of those detained for drug abuse had stabilised.  What\r\n\r\nare  the factors that have contributed to this situation, and\r\n\r\nwhat further steps the Ministry has in mind to further reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  drug  offenders?  What sort  of  support  is\r\n\r\noffered  by  MHA  to  the  affected  families  and  is   such\r\n\r\nassistance sufficient?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the number of drug offenders\r\n\r\narrested  has declined significantly, by 34% in the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears, from about 6,250 in 1992 to 4,130 in 2001.  Mr Yatiman\r\n\r\nasked what were the factors that contributed to this decline.\r\n\r\nSince  the mid-1990s, we have taken a multi-pronged  approach\r\n\r\nin  dealing with this drug problem, ie, preventive education,\r\n\r\nvigorous  enforcement and a comprehensive rehabilitative  and\r\n\r\nafter-care  regime  to tackle drug abuse.   We  do  not  work\r\n\r\nalone.  We work with all the agencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  are responsible to deal with this issue.  We work  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education.  We work with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.   We  work with the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports.   And  we  also  work  very  closely  with  many\r\n\r\ncommunity  self-help  organisations, voluntary  organisations\r\n\r\nwhich are concerned about our young people being involved  in\r\n\r\ndrugs, and help them to get out of the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, effective enforcement is a cornerstone of our\r\n\r\noverall  strategy.   So  we  doubled  our  Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau's manpower in 1995.  The CNB has also reorganised  and\r\n\r\nimproved the effectiveness of its intelligence division.   We\r\n\r\nused  to  have  a very small set-up, but we have  decided  to\r\n\r\nincrease the number of officers in this division so as to get\r\n\r\nbetter  information  to  deal  with  drug  syndicates.   This\r\n\r\nenabled  the  CNB  to  break up many more  drug  trafficking,\r\n\r\nsmuggling and distribution syndicates than before.  Just last\r\n\r\nyear  alone,  the CNB smashed 24 syndicates, six  times  more\r\n\r\nthan it did in 1994 when we had less resources.  We have also\r\n\r\nstrengthened  our  laws,  for example,  by  sending  hardcore\r\n\r\naddicts to long-term jail sentences.  Apart from acting as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent,  this has actually kept the hardcore drug  addicts\r\n\r\naway  from contaminating the young.  As a result,  we  see  a\r\n\r\ndecline of younger people in drug addiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must keep on top of this evolving trend. As Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo  has  pointed  out, new  synthetic  drugs  such  as\r\n\r\nKetamine are gaining popularity, just as Ecstasy was  gaining\r\n\r\npopularity  in  1996/1997.  Although the number  of  Ketamine\r\n\r\nabusers is small, we are paying very close attention  to  it.\r\n\r\nDr  Neo  is  concerned particularly about young  girls  being\r\n\r\naddicted  to  Ketamine.   We  are similarly  concerned.   133\r\n\r\nKetamine  abusers  were  arrested  last  year.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease from the 78 in year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is correct that one in three of these Ketamine\r\n\r\nabusers are female, as compared to one in 10 among the  other\r\n\r\nabusers.  This trend mirrors the increasing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabuse  of  such  drugs,  not  just  in  Singapore,  but  also\r\n\r\nregionally and internationally.  We are not alone  in  having\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  But that is no comfort.  20% of the  Ketamine\r\n\r\nabusers, as I said, in the last two years were actually below\r\n\r\n20  years old, of whom half were girls.  The relatively  high\r\n\r\nabuse  rate  among  the  young  females  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nmisconception  - their wrong thinking - that  Ketamine  is  a\r\n\r\nbenign  drug  which  they  think  will  not  be  harmful   or\r\n\r\naddictive.  Let me, at the outset, dispel this misconception.\r\n\r\nKetamine  produces a progression of effects from a  state  of\r\n\r\ndreamy  intoxication to delirium, accompanied by an inability\r\n\r\nto  move, feel pain, or remember what has occurred under  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of drugs.  So girls are particularly susceptible to\r\n\r\nother  problems  if  they indulge in  such  drugs.   Ketamine\r\n\r\ncauses    hallucination,   alters   sensation,    mood    and\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  It distorts hearing, touch, smell, taste  and\r\n\r\nvisual  sensation  and causes nausea, vomiting  and  loss  of\r\n\r\nmemory.  I do not see the fun in taking such a drug.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our young abusers consume Ketamine at night\r\n\r\nentertainment  outlets.  CNB regularly  conducts  enforcement\r\n\r\nactions in these places.  Just as it did with the problem  of\r\n\r\nEcstasy abuse, it requires the nightclub operators to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  CNB  should they come across such people.   However,  to\r\n\r\ndate,  neither  the Police nor CNB has come across  any  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking  syndicates luring young girls into  prostitution\r\n\r\nvia Ketamine addiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketamine is detected through urine analysis conducted by\r\n\r\nthe  Centre  for Forensic Science.  So we work  very  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Health.  Urine specimens of  suspected\r\n\r\nKetamine abusers are sent there for anlaysis.  No one  should\r\n\r\nbe under any illusion that he or she can consume Ketamine and\r\n\r\nget away with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synthetic drugs, including Ketamine, are not known to be\r\n\r\nproduced in Singapore - that is the lucky part.  But they are\r\n\r\nproduced  in clandestine laboratories in the region  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia and  smuggled\r\n\r\ninto Singapore - that is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrightening  part, because it is so widely produced  in  this\r\n\r\nregion, and they can be brought in quite easily.  We have  to\r\n\r\nensure that our border checks are tightened up as well.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have many travellers coming into Singapore every day  and\r\n\r\nthat  task  will  be difficult.  We will have  to  depend  on\r\n\r\nintelligence  to  detect syndicates and to raid  such  places\r\n\r\nwhere drug abusers hang around and arrest them.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, volunteer groups like the National Council Against\r\n\r\nDrug   Abuse   (NCADA)  and  the  Singapore  Anti   Narcotics\r\n\r\nAssociation,  working  with  the CNB,  have  undertaken  many\r\n\r\npreventive drug education programmes with the schools and the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public.   Every year, the National  Council  Against\r\n\r\nDrug Abuse has many programmes involving the schools and  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  as  well  as  many  out-of-school  youths  working\r\n\r\ntogether  with SANA.  The result is a marked decline  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of new drug abusers, from 1,421 in 1996 to  784  last\r\n\r\nyear,  and that is, in a way, an encouraging sign that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  many more new ones coming in, although we continue\r\n\r\nto  have them.  We cannot completely stop people from abusing\r\n\r\ndrug.  Only enforcement action can reduce that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aftercare is also an essential part, which is what Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman asked, in curbing the drug problem, as it helps  drug\r\n\r\naddicts  to resist and overcome their addiction.   Here,  the\r\n\r\nPrisons   Department   and  the  Singapore   Corporation   of\r\n\r\nRehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) work very closely together\r\n\r\nwith  the  volunteer  groups,  such  as  Singapore  Aftercare\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the halfway houses.  This has proven  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  keeping down the proportion  of  former  drug\r\n\r\nabusers returning to drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance is also granted to families of offenders to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  cope with the incarceration of their loved  ones.\r\n\r\nFamilies  of  offenders  can  approach  the  Industrial   and\r\n\r\nServices  Cooperative Society Ltd and SCORE  for  assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Services Cooperative Society offers annual  book  grants\r\n\r\nand  scholarships  to  help them cope with  their  children's\r\n\r\nschooling  and expenses.  It also employs family  members  of\r\n\r\noffenders.  Family members of offenders who face difficulties\r\n\r\nin  finding  jobs  can  also approach  SCORE  for  employment\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr\r\n\r\nMohamad Maidin, holds weekly meetings with the family members\r\n\r\nof  drug  addicts, to see what sort of assistance they  need.\r\n\r\nEx-drug  addicts and their family members are  given  further\r\n\r\nassistance.  Help rendered includes employment, accommodation\r\n\r\nand  counselling.  The Prisons Department and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAnti-Narcotics Association have, since 1998, spearheaded  the\r\n\r\nFamily   Education  Against  Drug  Abuse   programme.    This\r\n\r\nprogramme teaches families the necessary skills and knowledge\r\n\r\nto cope with and facilitate the addicts' recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all these measures, families of offenders can\r\n\r\nseek  help  from  other  community  agencies,  such  as   the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  Councils  and  the  Family   Service\r\n\r\nCentres.   These  measures are enough from now  to  help  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  of offenders to tide over the difficulties  arising\r\n\r\nfrom their incarceration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, Community\r\n\r\nSafety and Security Programmes (CSSP) are action plans  drawn\r\n\r\nup  by  grassroots leaders, residents and the  Home  Team  to\r\n\r\ntackle community issues and problems affecting the safety and\r\n\r\nsecurity of the local neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started in 1997. The main purpose of CSSP is to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  community to look after its  own  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity matters through self-help, mutual support and active\r\n\r\ncitizenry.  I understand that, since the year 2000, CSSP  has\r\n\r\nbeen expanded to include schools in crafting their own safety\r\n\r\nand  security  programmes.

And would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  implementing  a National  CSSP  Awards  to  provide\r\n\r\nrecognition about standing initiatives and to encourage  more\r\n\r\nin the community to get involved in CSSP?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong  has  just asked for an update on the Community  Safety\r\n\r\nand Security Programme (CSSP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that, since the CSSP was\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  1997,  we  have made very  good  progress.   In\r\n\r\nDecember  1998, there were 66 Residents' Committees  involved\r\n\r\nin  the  CSSP.  Today, we have 502 Residents' Committees  and\r\n\r\nall  53  Neighbourhood Committees have implemented the  CSSP.\r\n\r\nIn  addition to that, more than 100 schools have adopted  the\r\n\r\nCSSP.   But  numbers do not tell the whole story,  Sir.   The\r\n\r\nrange and quality of CSSPs have also seen marked improvement.\r\n\r\nToday,  CSSPs  encompass  crime  and  fire  prevention,  road\r\n\r\nsafety,  juvenile  delinquency, care and support  programmes.\r\n\r\nIn  recent  years, commercial enterprises, such  as  markets,\r\n\r\nhave also come on board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And CSSP, as we have noted, is a form of pro-active\r\n\r\ncommunity  self-help.  To maintain its effectiveness,  it  is\r\n\r\ncrucial that all CSSP practitioners receive adequate training\r\n\r\nin  problem  solving as well as in community building  tools.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the Home Team and the People's Association\r\n\r\nconducted a series of workshops in January this year to train\r\n\r\nmore than 1,700 grassroots leaders and Home Team officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  skills  needed for effective community involvement.   We\r\n\r\nwill   continue  to  build  up  the  capabilities   of   CSSP\r\n\r\npractitioners,  so that we can sustain the CSSP  efforts  and\r\n\r\nimprove the quality of the solutions devised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also expand CSSPs in our schools. School CSSPs\r\n\r\nmostly belong to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of  three categories - juvenile delinquency,  preventive\r\n\r\neducation  as  well  as road safety.  These  programmes  have\r\n\r\ngenerally been successful although we recognise that  we  can\r\n\r\nstill  do  more.   Already there are encouraging  signs  that\r\n\r\npoint  to  a  broadening of the school CSSP  programme.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Northeast CDC has been working with the National\r\n\r\nPolice  Cadet  Corps (NPCC) and the Police to  develop  young\r\n\r\nstudent  leaders  by  involving NPCC  cadets  in  local  CSSP\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion by Mr Charles Chong to consider\r\n\r\nimplementing national CSSP awards to provide recognition  for\r\n\r\noutstanding  initiatives  and  to  encourage  more   in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity to get involved in CSSP, I am pleased to inform him\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police  is  currently working  with  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to implement a common set of criteria  for  CSSP\r\n\r\nawards to cover all CDCs.  From then on, we can have a better\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to assure the House that the Home Team\r\n\r\nwill  remain committed to the CSSP.  As CSSP grows in numbers\r\n\r\nand  in scope, the Home Team will continue to provide support\r\n\r\nand  resources, wherever we can, so that we can  achieve  the\r\n\r\nCSSP's goal of building a caring community and safe homes for\r\n\r\nall our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the most\r\n\r\nchallenging  tasks in any penal system is how to rehabilitate\r\n\r\noffenders  after  they have served their  sentence.   In  our\r\n\r\nsociety, a criminal conviction carries a stigma that is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to remove.  We are not a very forgiving society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me recount the fate of an NUS graduate, who\r\n\r\ngraduated with an Upper Second Class degree, whether  through\r\n\r\nthe  rashness of youth or whatever, he was foolish enough  to\r\n\r\ncommit  a  petty theft for which he was fined $1,000.   There\r\n\r\nwas no imprisonment.  Unfortunately, that was not the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  His subsequent punishment, as it were, was much\r\n\r\nmore severe than the fine.  Even though he attended many  job\r\n\r\ninterviews, he could not find a job, because he had  to  tell\r\n\r\nthem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he was convicted of an offence.  And even when  he  was\r\n\r\noffered a job finally, he was told that the pay would be very\r\n\r\nmuch  less  than a clean graduate, and in some cases,  $1,000\r\n\r\nless.   We  do  not  seem to be able to  forgive,  let  alone\r\n\r\nforget.  We should try to give those who genuinely reform and\r\n\r\nwho have done their time a second chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem lies with the Registration of\r\n\r\nCriminals   Act.   This  Act  provides  not  just   for   the\r\n\r\nregistration  of criminals who commit offences  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nactually,  but indeed include those committed in Malaysia  as\r\n\r\nwell.  And, in fact, the Minister may additionally order  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  criminals  for crimes  committed  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   There  is  no  doubt  that  we  do   need   such\r\n\r\nlegislation,  especially  when  the  offenders   are   either\r\n\r\nrecidivists or have committed really serious offences.  But I\r\n\r\ndo think that there is scope for more discriminating approach\r\n\r\nto the registration of criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there should be a differentiation between the\r\n\r\nserious cases and the petty cases.  Indeed, there is room  to\r\n\r\nargue that there should be separate registers and that in the\r\n\r\nregister  for petty offenders, there should be a  time  limit\r\n\r\nafter which the record should be erased.  I am thinking  here\r\n\r\nespecially   of  the  first-time  offender  who   commits   a\r\n\r\nregistrable   offence   but  who   was   not   sentenced   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  If such a person were to keep a clean  record,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  for 3-5 years, I think he or  she  deserves  a\r\n\r\nsecond chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when a record is erased, I think it should be\r\n\r\nlegislated  that  it  should  not  be  regarded  as  a  false\r\n\r\ndeclaration to state in a job application form, for  example,\r\n\r\nthat he or she has not been convicted of an offence.  Because\r\n\r\nerasing  the  record  is  just  one  step  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\nregrettable  if we did not take the extra step  to  make  the\r\n\r\nerasure meaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, under current legislation, section 7 of the Act\r\n\r\nallows the Police Commissioner to exercise his discretion to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndispense  with  registration for certain types of  first-time\r\n\r\noffenders.   I  urge  the Minister to  review  the  situation\r\n\r\nimmediately  and see whether this power can be  exercised  in\r\n\r\nappropriate  cases.  In the meantime, I hope that  amendments\r\n\r\nto  the  relevant  legislation will  be  tabled  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have seen and have paid their debt to\r\n\r\nsociety,  let us try to forgive and forget.  Let  us  try  to\r\n\r\ngive these individuals a second chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, persons convicted\r\n\r\nof  crimes, and especially those who were sent to jail,  face\r\n\r\nstrong social stigma and sometimes the stigma stays with them\r\n\r\nfor  life.   As a result, many of them find it very difficult\r\n\r\nto  find  work,  try as they might.  And the  situation  that\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  Tet Yung has just described is one example,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is of a person who has not gone to jail.  In our  meet-the-people sessions, we come across cases of those  who  have\r\n\r\ngone  to jail and their difficulties are even greater.   This\r\n\r\ninability  to  find work easily, in comparison  with  others,\r\n\r\nhampers their ability to reintegrate into society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we survey the economic landscape, we know that\r\n\r\nit  is  going to be more turbulent going forward.  This means\r\n\r\nthat  even persons, who have never had brushes with the  law,\r\n\r\nwould  find it more difficult to find work and to hold on  to\r\n\r\nwork,   because   of   the  changes  in  technology,   skills\r\n\r\nrequirements, and so on.   For persons who have to endure and\r\n\r\nface   social  stigma  associated  with  their  having   been\r\n\r\nconvicted of crimes, and especially having been sent to jail,\r\n\r\nwould  actually find it extremely difficult to compete for  a\r\n\r\njob  and  to earn a living.  The strain is not only faced  by\r\n\r\nthem, it is also faced by their families and society at large\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the families, their inability to find work would\r\n\r\ndirectly reduce family income, leading to increased hardship.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of society, we would then have  to  live  with\r\n\r\nperhaps  a  higher level of long-term unemployment  for  this\r\n\r\ngroup and also a higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrate of recidivism.  Therefore, it is in the interest of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  and nation that we seek new and additional  ways  to\r\n\r\nlower  the  barriers for re-entry of such persons  back  into\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures is\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  taking, in the light of the  changed  economic\r\n\r\nlandscape,  to  further  help  these  offenders  with  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  job placement, both while  they  are  serving\r\n\r\ntheir sentences as well as after that.  I would also like  to\r\n\r\nask   the   Minister  whether  his  Ministry  could  consider\r\n\r\nextending  the use of non-custodial punishment options  to  a\r\n\r\nwider range of less serious offences.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, our vision is to be a caring,\r\n\r\ncompassionate  society. But, in order to be compassionate,  I\r\n\r\nagree with Prof. Chin that we have to be forgiving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For drug and criminal offenders, there are numerous\r\n\r\nprogrammes  carried out by the authorities, both  during  and\r\n\r\nafter detention, to enable them to return to new life.   This\r\n\r\nis,  indeed, a laudable objective.  However, the  success  of\r\n\r\nsuch effort depends on how the Government, the community, the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  the  family of the individual  concerned  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  help.  For many years, SCORE has been  actively\r\n\r\ninvolved in skills training for the law offenders.  How  many\r\n\r\nof  them have gone through such training every year, and  how\r\n\r\nmany  managed to find jobs with the help of SCORE?  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  training them and placing them under  various  pre-release schemes and post-detention programmes is to give them\r\n\r\na  second  chance.  The success of these efforts  depends  on\r\n\r\nthree factors:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether we succeed in changing the mindset of the\r\n\r\nex-offenders, and to make them lead a new life;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, whether there is societal acceptance of the ex-offenders; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, whether we can make them financially self-supporting to enable them to regain their self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the third aspect that worries me most.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is  true  that over the years there  has  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number of ex-law offenders  being  offered\r\n\r\njobs, many are still unable to do so.  During my MPS, I often\r\n\r\ncome across cases in which these people are being turned away\r\n\r\nby  potential  employers simply because  they  have  criminal\r\n\r\nrecords,  some  as  far  back as  16  years.   The  potential\r\n\r\nemployers often cite the police record as the reason for  not\r\n\r\nemploying them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern expressed by Prof. Chin on this\r\n\r\nissue,  and  I  would also like to urge the  Minister  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething to remove the stigma and help those caught in  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances to fully turn over a new leaf.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether a review could be undertaken on the\r\n\r\nnumber of offenders who have been sent to prison arising from\r\n\r\noffences    which   do   not   carry   custodial   sentences,\r\n\r\nparticularly, fine defaulters, ie, a person who is unable  to\r\n\r\npay, eg, car park summonses, or a person who is unable to pay\r\n\r\na small fine for a simple driving offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Minister to do a review to find out\r\n\r\nwhether we are sending people unnecessarily to prison.  These\r\n\r\noffences  are  usually not serious enough to  merit  custody.\r\n\r\nThey  go  to  prison  anyway,  due  to  their  inability   or\r\n\r\nunwillingness to  pay.  Such a sanction impacts most severely\r\n\r\non  those  without means, giving the impression that  justice\r\n\r\ndiscriminates  against the poor.  By sending such  people  to\r\n\r\nprison,  we  can  cause severe hardship to them.   They  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs,  the family is in distress, they  earn  the  ill\r\n\r\nrepute  of having gone to prison and, most damaging  of  all,\r\n\r\nthey are demoralised.  In many cases, the individuals who end\r\n\r\nup  in prison are those who have low incomes.  Of course,  it\r\n\r\nwould  lead to another debate, whether the punishment  should\r\n\r\nfit the crime or the offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Minister whether he could undertake a\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  number of prisoners who  have  ended  up  in\r\n\r\nprison,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  see  whether  alternative methods of punishment  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for them.  For example, they can be required to do\r\n\r\ncommunity service.  Alternatively, the courts can be asked to\r\n\r\nallow these individuals a longer period of instalment to  pay\r\n\r\nup their fines.  I am quite sure that my proposed approach is\r\n\r\na  better  approach.  Imposition of a prison term means  that\r\n\r\nthe   fine   goes  uncollected.   In  addition,   there   are\r\n\r\nsignificant costs associated with incarceration.  I feel that\r\n\r\nsuch a state of affairs is neither in the interest of justice\r\n\r\nnor  sound  financial management.  I am of the  opinion  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a pressing need to introduce reform in relation  to\r\n\r\nthe system of fines, both in the interest of justice and with\r\n\r\na   view   to  relieving  pressure  on  prison  accommodation\r\n\r\ngenerated by the current system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same review, I would also urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  alternative  means  to release  alleged  offenders,\r\n\r\npending  trial,  other  than  by using  the  bail  mechanism.\r\n\r\nPresently,  when  an alleged offender is  unable  to  furnish\r\n\r\nbail,  before he is charged and before the actual trial date,\r\n\r\nhe  is  remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison.  At times,  the\r\n\r\nbail  amount  may  be small but, as the alleged  offender  is\r\n\r\npoor,  he is unable to furnish bail.  According to statistics\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Asian and Pacific Conference of Correctional\r\n\r\nAdministrators,  as  of  mid-2000,  there  were  2,311   such\r\n\r\nunconvicted  remandees,  or 16.8%  of  prison  population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore came under this category.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really hurts me to hear of cases where such\r\n\r\nindividuals  are  subsequently acquitted and their  detention\r\n\r\nall  along was an injustice.  Perhaps we can consider a  home\r\n\r\ndetention system, or allow a bail bond insurance system  that\r\n\r\nis being practised in the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nincarceration of individuals often affects many people around\r\n\r\nhim, especially his family members.  Following incarceration,\r\n\r\noften times, the family experiences a sense of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloss  and crisis, and often sends them scrambling to  try  to\r\n\r\nmanage.   This  is  often more serious when the  incarcerated\r\n\r\nindividual is the head of the household.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge and am pleased to hear the Minister\r\n\r\nmentioning  earlier that families are more  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation process of drug offenders.  I wonder  if  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are extended to criminal offenders too,  because,\r\n\r\noften  times, in my experience, when the incarcerated  person\r\n\r\nis  in prison, the family readjusts itself and tries to adapt\r\n\r\none  way or the other in the absence of the person.   In  due\r\n\r\ncourse, the family manages one way or the other, with support\r\n\r\nservices around.  But when the person comes back, the  family\r\n\r\nhas  to readjust again to readmit him into the family system.\r\n\r\nThis often creates a lot of problem for the family.  Ever  so\r\n\r\noften, the incarcerated individual comes along and says  that\r\n\r\nthe  family  is  not  able to accept him again,  or  is  less\r\n\r\nsupportive of him.  In that regard, often times, what he does\r\n\r\nis  that he takes the easy way out and says the family is not\r\n\r\nsupportive and, therefore, he returns to his old ways and the\r\n\r\nvicious cycle continues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am asking the Minister is whether it is\r\n\r\npossible  for the Prisons Department especially,  to  include\r\n\r\nfamily  members  in  the rehabilitation process  of  criminal\r\n\r\noffenders, not just drug offenders, because what we  need  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  really maintain the family unit,  even  when  the\r\n\r\nincarcerated  person  is in.  I recognise  that  the  Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment  will  probably face constraints  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nallowing  civilians into the system, but we need to  consider\r\n\r\nthis  seriously because, otherwise, we are going to  continue\r\n\r\ndisconnecting   family   members   from   the    incarcerated\r\n\r\nindividual.   At  the  same  time,  it  may  prevent   future\r\n\r\ngeneration of incarcerated individuals or offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is with regard to\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities.  Rehabilitation is often seen as in\r\n\r\nthe  process when a person is incarcerated.  Often times,  we\r\n\r\ndo not pay too much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention when the person is released.  What is important  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  adjustment process is equally important  when  the\r\n\r\nperson  is  released, and employment opportunities have  been\r\n\r\nfound  to be critical in preventing them from going  back  to\r\n\r\ntheir criminal activities.  I recognise the role of SCORE  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  create employment opportunities for ex-offenders.\r\n\r\nBut  what  I  do hear a lot is that, often times,  these  ex-offenders  are  given employment amongst ex-offenders.   This\r\n\r\ndoes  not  create  a sense of normalcy.  What  they  need  is\r\n\r\nemployment  amongst  non-offenders,  to  create  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nnormalcy that they are reintegrating into society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that earlier this week the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs mentioned that there is  going  to  be  an\r\n\r\namendment  to the Registration of Criminals Act, and  I  echo\r\n\r\nvery  strongly Prof. Chin's call for it to be tabled as  soon\r\n\r\nas  possible, such that we are giving second chances and  new\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  ex-offenders  to  be  reintegrated   into\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also suggest - I raised this point earlier this\r\n\r\nweek  -  the idea of creating job opportunities in the  civil\r\n\r\nservice for ex-offenders?  I think MHA has responded.  I urge\r\n\r\nMHA  to  try to encourage all other Ministries to  show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  open  enough to accept ex-offenders amongst  them.\r\n\r\nThis  would  then set the example for the private  sector  to\r\n\r\nemulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki, can you wind up your speech,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, in line with our\r\n\r\nvision of accepting failures and redefining success, I  think\r\n\r\nwe need to operationalise second chances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, just one minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, not one minute.

What are the rehabilitation plans for them, especially\r\n\r\nin returning to society?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank the many Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken on this very important topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address their concerns as to the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of offenders, in particular, measures we  have\r\n\r\nput  in place to ensure, first of all, that they are properly\r\n\r\ntrained and have the skills whilst in prison or DRC, so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they get out of prison, they can find jobs.  There  are\r\n\r\ntwo  parts:  skills and training whilst in prison,  and  when\r\n\r\nout,  finding jobs.  The other main concern is this  question\r\n\r\nof  non-custodial sentences, whether more can be done to help\r\n\r\nparticularly   those  offenders  who  have  committed   minor\r\n\r\noffences, to keep them out of prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say at the outset that the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  is  committed to rehabilitating  offenders  who  are\r\n\r\nresolute about turning over a new leaf; in other words,  they\r\n\r\nare  genuine and they really want to change and start  afresh\r\n\r\nin  society.   Hence, we have adopted a number of initiatives\r\n\r\nover  the past years.  These initiatives are broad-based  and\r\n\r\nspearheaded by various agencies.  That is the way we approach\r\n\r\nthis  matter  -  not  just ourselves, but  getting  on  board\r\n\r\nvarious agencies, both statutory boards as well as VWOs,  and\r\n\r\nalso good-hearted citizens, who want to help out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, recently, we launched the CARE Network. CARE\r\n\r\nNetwork  is  spearheaded by the Prisons Department,  together\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore Corporation for Rehabilitative Enterprises\r\n\r\n(SCORE).   It brings on board agencies like SACA, SANA,  NCSS\r\n\r\nand ISCOS, where they take what we call an in-care and after-care  approach; in other words, through care, to  look  after\r\n\r\nthe  addict  and prisoner whilst he is in prison and  try  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  seamless transit to the time when he  is  out  of\r\n\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what happens when he is in incarceration? During\r\n\r\nthe period of incarceration, vocational training and academic\r\n\r\ncourses  are  offered  to selected inmates,  based  on  their\r\n\r\nsuitability,  such  as interest in the courses,  and  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  receptive to rehabilitation programmes.   Academic\r\n\r\neducation  is  also  offered to selected inmates  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  literacy.  Members would have heard of the Kaki  Bukit\r\n\r\nSchool, which has turned out very good students, some of whom\r\n\r\nhave done even better than the national average.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have highlighted the role of SCORE. Indeed,\r\n\r\nSCORE has geared up in this area.  Over the years, SCORE  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  key  player  in preparing offenders  for  the  job\r\n\r\nmarket.   SCORE  runs  vocational  training  programmes   for\r\n\r\namenable  inmates  to  equip them with relevant  job  skills.\r\n\r\nMany  of these vocational training courses lead to recognised\r\n\r\ncertification  by institutions, such as ITE.  To  ensure  the\r\n\r\nrelevance of these courses, SCORE conducts market surveys and\r\n\r\nseeks advice from representatives from industry.  Since 1982,\r\n\r\nSCORE has trained nearly 20,000 inmates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE also operates its own industries, and works with\r\n\r\nprivate companies to offer inmates the opportunities to learn\r\n\r\nuseful  skills, such as furniture making and computer repair.\r\n\r\nAt present, there are 28 firms operating different industries\r\n\r\nand  employing  more  than 2,000 inmates  annually.   Through\r\n\r\nthese  opportunities, inmates acquire  work  ethics  and  job\r\n\r\ndiscipline, preparing them for employment upon release.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  point  that Mr Yatiman talked about, this question  of\r\n\r\nself-esteem, the need for counselling.  So, it  is  not  just\r\n\r\noffering  them skills in a vacuum but, as they imbibe  skills\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  job-related skills, they  also  imbibe  social\r\n\r\nskills - how to interact with fellow workers, how to meet job\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that transiting from prison to employment\r\n\r\ncan   be   disorientating.   Hence,   SCORE   also   provides\r\n\r\npsychological counselling, collaborating with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNTUC   Skills  Development  Centre  to  conduct  Work  Skills\r\n\r\nTraining  Programmes to prepare inmates for  the  phase  when\r\n\r\nthey  will be out there without the physical support  of  the\r\n\r\nprisons,  and  having  to  relate with  different  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is in-house care. What about when they leave the\r\n\r\nprisons  and the drug centres?  That is the point  that  many\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken  about.  This  is  an  important  point\r\n\r\nbecause all would come to naught if they feel having done  so\r\n\r\nmuch,  when  they  are out there, everybody does  not  accept\r\n\r\nthem.   We want to say that society should be more accepting,\r\n\r\nfamily  should be more accepting - Dr Maliki and  Mr  Yatiman\r\n\r\nhad  talked  about the importance of family - and, hopefully,\r\n\r\nemployers will be more accepting.  This is a point that Prof.\r\n\r\nChin and various other Members have talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this is also a key concern of MHA. Here again,\r\n\r\nwe  have  got what SCORE is doing and what we have also  done\r\n\r\noutside of the SCORE efforts. First, a brief sharing on  what\r\n\r\nSCORE has done.  SCORE has in place this Corporate Assistance\r\n\r\nfor  Rehabilitation  Scheme  through  which  employers  offer\r\n\r\ntraining  sponsorships and work attachments.   So  far,  more\r\n\r\nthan 1,800 inmates have benefited from this scheme.  This  is\r\n\r\nquite important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE, as I mentioned earlier, also keeps in touch with\r\n\r\nindustries.  I think this is important.  One key  feature  is\r\n\r\nthat  SCORE maintains a database.  Currently, there are about\r\n\r\n1,500  companies which have indicated interest, readiness  or\r\n\r\nwillingness to employ these ex-offenders.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nlast  year  alone,  SCORE managed to secure  the  support  of\r\n\r\nanother  230  companies, despite the weak job  market.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  SCORE managed to give employment assistance  to  about\r\n\r\n1,600 offenders.  I think this is very good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they do? They do work as production operators,\r\n\r\ncleaners, technicians, welders, electricians and cooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr  Maliki made this comment and raised concern that not  too\r\n\r\nmany of them should be put together; otherwise, they are  not\r\n\r\nlearning  how  to relate with the outside world.   He  should\r\n\r\nrest  assured, because there is this approach where not  more\r\n\r\nthan  five ex-offenders are employed in a company at the same\r\n\r\ntime.  That is very good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHA is mindful, as Mr Heng and Mr Yatiman have noted,\r\n\r\nthat  ex-offenders  face barriers in  their  job  search,  as\r\n\r\nsociety  stigmatises them.  I have answered earlier  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that we are reviewing, and will amend the Registration\r\n\r\nof  Criminals  Act, so that those who are convicted  of  very\r\n\r\nminor  offences  will have their criminal records  considered\r\n\r\nspent  or  expunged after a certain period of time,  provided\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  re-offend.  This will, therefore,  be  a  step\r\n\r\ntowards helping them to rehabilitate so that should there  be\r\n\r\nscreening of their records by employers, the records will not\r\n\r\nsurface.   Also  on  its part, prisons give testimonials  and\r\n\r\nalso help in referrals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin made a good point because the question in\r\n\r\nmost  of these application forms will be, \"Have you ever been\r\n\r\nconvicted  by  a  Court of Law?\"  The fact  is,  despite  the\r\n\r\nrecord  being  expunged  or considered  spent,  the  truthful\r\n\r\nanswer must be \"yes\", and that will remain so.  That is why I\r\n\r\nwill, like many of the Members here, urge employers to take a\r\n\r\nmore flexible and compassionate approach.  In other words, do\r\n\r\nnot just balk at the fact that the prospective employee has a\r\n\r\nrecord.   Come on board because Government, society, families\r\n\r\n-  all  of  us  are trying to give offenders with  a  genuine\r\n\r\ndesire  to  turn  over a new leaf - a fresh  start  in  life.\r\n\r\nEmployers should also think about it and do their part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki, in particular, has mentioned family\r\n\r\ninvolvement.  I want to assure him that prisons  indeed  take\r\n\r\nthis  very seriously.  If he has followed media coverage,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have read about ground-breaking initiatives  involving\r\n\r\nfamilies, bringing them into the prisons setting.  He  talked\r\n\r\nabout whether this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwise.   I  think  they  do it selectively  and  wisely.   For\r\n\r\nexample, Mother's Day.  We have had occasions in the past  to\r\n\r\nbring in even children to spend some time with their mothers.\r\n\r\nThe  Prisons Department tells us that this works  because  it\r\n\r\nstarts  the  mother thinking whether what  she  has  done  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  There is fresh resolve when they part company  that\r\n\r\nshe  will  not  do it again. There are other programmes  also\r\n\r\nwhere  families  are  involved,  for  example,  play-and-wait\r\n\r\nprogrammes and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that has been raised by Members is\r\n\r\nwhether  there should not be a more non-custodial  punishment\r\n\r\nfor  a  wider  range  of less serious  offences.   An  Inter-Ministry   Committee,  which  I  headed  a  few  years   ago,\r\n\r\nrecommended a range of community-based sentences (CBS).  Some\r\n\r\nof  these are indeed being rolled out.  We all know that when\r\n\r\nappropriately   applied,  CBS  address  the  limitations   of\r\n\r\nexisting  sentencing options, such as hardship on  offenders'\r\n\r\nfamilies,  no  break in employment, because the offender  can\r\n\r\ncontinue working, and also the question of difficulties in re-integrating into society, because he would remain in society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to highlight the Tail-End Home\r\n\r\nDetention scheme which was implemented two years ago in April\r\n\r\n2000.   This  scheme  basically allows  prisoners,  who  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  minor  offences, to serve the tail  end  of  their\r\n\r\nimprisonment  at  home,  subject to  electronically-monitored\r\n\r\ncurfew via tagging.  As of 30th April 2002, a total of almost\r\n\r\n1,200  inmates have been placed on the scheme.  I am  pleased\r\n\r\nto report that the success rate is 99.8%.  Only two offenders\r\n\r\nhave  so  far  failed  this  programme.   Recently,  we  also\r\n\r\nintroduced a community-based programme, involving a stay in a\r\n\r\nHalf-way House, for drug addicts on long term imprisonment  - I think that is Dr Maliki's concern. He talks about long term\r\n\r\nimprisonment offenders who are coming out.  We  are  doing  a\r\n\r\npilot programme now to ascertain whether after the period  of\r\n\r\nincarceration, a stint at a half-way house will help them  to\r\n\r\nre-integrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the success of the Tail-End Home Detention Scheme,\r\n\r\nMHA is considering widening its scope.  We are also exploring\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of introducing Front-End Home  Detention  to\r\n\r\nallow  offenders, who have committed very minor offences,  to\r\n\r\nserve their sentences at home.  A feasibility study is now in\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Attorney-General's Chambers' Law Reform\r\n\r\nDivision  is  conducting a study on the decriminalisation  of\r\n\r\nminor  regulatory  offences.  In its study,  it  will  assess\r\n\r\nwhether  and  in  what circumstances some  criminal  offences\r\n\r\nshould  be  reclassified  as non-criminal  infringement.  The\r\n\r\nstudy  will  also  investigate the use of administrative  and\r\n\r\ncivil  sanctions  as  enforcement mechanisms  to  replace  or\r\n\r\ncomplement enforcement through criminal sanctions  for  these\r\n\r\nminor regulatory offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran has raised a concern about fine defaulters.\r\n\r\nHe  suggests  that more should be allowed  to  pay  fines  by\r\n\r\ninstalments.   I think that is one way to go.   Mr  Ravindran\r\n\r\nwill  know  that under the CPC, fine instalments are  already\r\n\r\nallowed,  and  my  understanding is that the  Courts  already\r\n\r\nallow  this for deserving cases.  I agree that more  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  done.  MHA will work with the Courts to  see  how\r\n\r\nbest  to move forward.  Fine defaulters, who are genuine  and\r\n\r\nreally  want to pay the fines by instalments, can do  so.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that, on request, more offenders are given  longer\r\n\r\ngrace  periods  to  pay  their fines.   Under  the  Automatic\r\n\r\nTraffic  Offence Management System (ATOMS),  you  can  settle\r\n\r\nyour fines electronically.  ATOMS is not so much to give  the\r\n\r\noffender the opportunity to pay by instalments, but to settle\r\n\r\nit  more  quickly  and to settle it more expeditiously.   The\r\n\r\nCourts  will  enhance the system.  They are thinking  of  the\r\n\r\npossibility of extending ATOMS to other regulatory  offences,\r\n\r\nwhich are commonly processed in the night courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about bail which Mr Ravindran mentioned? Here\r\n\r\nagain, we have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbalance  the  interests  of  the  State,  public  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  with the concerns that he has raised regarding  the\r\n\r\noffender.  A bail system applies in many places in the world.\r\n\r\nThe thing is to set bail realistically.  Here, in most cases,\r\n\r\nno  cash is put upfront.  It is a matter of getting a  surety\r\n\r\nwith  sufficient  assets to stand as  your  guarantor.   This\r\n\r\nsystem  works well. The question is that those who  stand  as\r\n\r\nsurety must do so with their eyes open.  In MPS cases, a  lot\r\n\r\nof  them are sureties, who stand as surety and later on  find\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to  pay because the person  has  absconded.\r\n\r\nExplaining  the system is important.  I hope that the  Member\r\n\r\nwill  appreciate  that there is a need  to  maintain  a  bail\r\n\r\nsystem, so that the integrity of the court is kept intact and\r\n\r\nthe  person who is required to appear in court at  a  certain\r\n\r\ntime will do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have covered most of the points. Time runs. The\r\n\r\npoint is that we have done quite a bit in this area.  Let  me\r\n\r\nend  by  saying that it is not just what Government will  do,\r\n\r\nbut everybody must play a part, including employers, families\r\n\r\nand society out there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time indeed runs. I would like to remind\r\n\r\nMembers that we have another 10 speakers plus the reply which\r\n\r\nshould be finished within 41 minutes.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I have just three\r\n\r\nquick  questions  to  ask the Minister.   My  first  question\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  road  accidents involving  the  motorcyclists.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  about 100 motorcyclists died on our roads.   The\r\n\r\nsad thing is that many of them who died were in the prime  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lives.   A  lot  of accidents involving  motorcyclists\r\n\r\ninvolve motorcycles which were below 200 cc.  My question is:\r\n\r\nwhat  can  we  do  to  reduce the number  of  road  accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving motorcyclists?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in the United States, the authorities\r\n\r\nthere  are  very strict regarding motorcyclists.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  it  is  compulsory to  wear  crash  helmets,\r\n\r\nauthorities   there  issue  guidelines   as   to   what   the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists should wear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  roads.   For example, they advise that motorcyclists\r\n\r\nshould  put on jackets, so that in case they are involved  in\r\n\r\nsome  accidents, the jacket would help to protect  them  from\r\n\r\ninjuries. They even advise something like \"do not wear  shoes\r\n\r\nwith shoe laces\", because the shoe lace can get entangled  in\r\n\r\nthe motorcycle in case of an accident.  But over here, we can\r\n\r\nsee  people riding around a motorcycle wearing a singlet  and\r\n\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question involves the recent imposition of the\r\n\r\nseat belt rule for passengers in the rear seats of motorcars.\r\n\r\nI  applaud this move.  I think the seat belt rule has been in\r\n\r\nplace  for many years.  I am only surprised that it  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented  until recently, and  vigorously.   What  I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand is why the driver, apart from being fined,\r\n\r\nis  given  three  demerit points.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  or  the  Traffic Police not to be too  generous  in\r\n\r\ngiving  demerit  points.   I think  this  is  a  question  of\r\n\r\noverkill.   When we first had this system of demerit  points,\r\n\r\nthe idea was to punish road users or drivers, who drive their\r\n\r\nvehicles in such a way that they cause a hazard to other road\r\n\r\nusers.   I can well understand that we need to issue  demerit\r\n\r\npoints  to people who speed, or even to people who use  their\r\n\r\nhandphones  when they are driving.  But why  are  we  issuing\r\n\r\ndemerit points to a driver when it is his rear seat passenger\r\n\r\nwho  refuses to buckle up, or maybe the passenger could  have\r\n\r\nbuckled  up, but along the way, while the vehicle is  moving,\r\n\r\nhe  unbuckles himself?  How can the driver, who is  right  in\r\n\r\nfront, see what is going on behind him?  Sir, it is just like\r\n\r\nwhen you fly on an airplane, if the seat belt sign comes  on,\r\n\r\nand  you  still refuse to buckle up, and something happens  - bumpy weather, you bump your head - well, good luck to you  - but you do not punish the pilot.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I refer to the report some 2-3 weeks ago in\r\n\r\nthe  Sunday Times souped up cars were speeding along  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad in the early wee hours of Sunday morning, something like\r\n\r\n3-4 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat surprises me also is why the Traffic Police were unaware\r\n\r\nof  this,  because I understand that this is common knowledge\r\n\r\namongst quite a lot of people in the motor industry or in the\r\n\r\nbusiness of souping up cars, and I think at that early Sunday\r\n\r\nmorning  hours there are still a lot of people walking  along\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road.   So I do not understand why the  Police,  who\r\n\r\nwere  patrolling the streets, were not aware of this problem,\r\n\r\nunless,  of course, at 3.00 am on Sunday morning, the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice have gone to bed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  want to touch on two of the topics that Mr Tan also talked\r\n\r\nabout, but in a different aspect.  I also applaud the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice (TP) for requiring motorists to belt up, but it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  punitive  measures have been taken for  non-compliance.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  enforcing  this law, the  TP  did  not  carry  out\r\n\r\nsufficient educational programmes to educate motorists on the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  belting  up.  It  would  be  a  pity  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to resort to using punitive measures to ensure\r\n\r\ncompliance of all our laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, fatal motorcycle accidents. Like Mr Tan, I\r\n\r\nshare this concern, but I also want to declare my interest as\r\n\r\nthe President of an active motorcycling club.  The statistics\r\n\r\nsupplied  by the Ministry confirmed my belief.   82%  of  all\r\n\r\nfatal accidents over the last 5 years happened on bikes below\r\n\r\n200  cc.   24%  of these victims got their class  2B  licence\r\n\r\nwithin  a  year and met with an accident.  Many of them  died\r\n\r\nalso  as  a pillion to these new riders.  Something is  wrong\r\n\r\nhere.  Either bikes below 200 cc are inherently not safe,  or\r\n\r\nnewer riders are more accident prone, or both.  The answer is\r\n\r\nprobably somewhere in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a motorcyclist, it always pains me to hear of a\r\n\r\nmotorcycle accident, and my heart usually skips  a  beat.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Traffic Police will act on my suggestion, from  the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclist's  point of view, on how to  improve  motorcycle\r\n\r\nsafety.  It will be different from what Mr Tan mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the TP should prohibit P-plate motorcyclists from\r\n\r\npillioning passengers.  These new motorcyclists on  the  road\r\n\r\nhave not clocked enough riding hours, experience or defensive\r\n\r\nskills.   How then can they be allowed to take responsibility\r\n\r\nof the life of their pillion passenger?  They should take the\r\n\r\nfirst  year  of their licence to familiarise themselves  with\r\n\r\nthe  road hazards and improve their riding skills before they\r\n\r\nbe allowed to pillion a passenger.  This may sound harsh, but\r\n\r\nmy  experience in motorcycling tells me that this  will  save\r\n\r\nlives.  Having a pillion on a small cc motorcycle changes the\r\n\r\npower  and  handling dynamics of the bike.  If a motorcyclist\r\n\r\nis  a  new rider, he will not be able to handle a sudden road\r\n\r\nhazard like a negligent or drunk driver driving straight into\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, defensive skills training. All class 2B bike\r\n\r\nlicence  holders  should  be encouraged  to  go  for  licence\r\n\r\nupgrade  after  one year.  This could be done with  insurance\r\n\r\ncompany  to offer higher discounts for insurance premium  for\r\n\r\nthe  licence upgrader.  The class 2A test should also include\r\n\r\ngreater defensive skills element in its training content.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, heavier punishment like jail and caning for\r\n\r\nmotorists  who  cause fatal accidents through  negligence  or\r\n\r\ndrink   driving,   or  for  lack  of  care   for   vulnerable\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists.   My  experience and many  anecdotal  evidence\r\n\r\nfrom  fellow  bikers confirmed that there are  many  big  car\r\n\r\nowners  out  there who neglect the safety and risk  of  other\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists by cutting too close into their  lanes.   There\r\n\r\nare also some crazy drivers\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, could you speed up and finish\r\n\r\nyour speech, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Some crazy drivers reportedly\r\n\r\neven disturbed a motorcyclist by cutting in very closely  by,\r\n\r\nthen slowed down, and then cutting in again.  Others pressure\r\n\r\nthe  small cc motorcyclists by tailgating so closely  behind.\r\n\r\nWe  always hear of newspaper reports of a motorcyclist losing\r\n\r\ncontrol of his motorcycle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  never explained why.  Something is wrong somewhere here.\r\n\r\nI hope the Police will investigate further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, please end your speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Finally, Sir, I hope the\r\n\r\nPolice will take a serious view of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  could  review why there is a delay  in  allowing\r\n\r\npeople   to   take   driving  tests  in   Singapore.    Here,\r\n\r\nparticularly, I would like to ask whether he can look at  the\r\n\r\nsupply and demand side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply side, whether we can explore the\r\n\r\npossibility of having more driving centres or, alternatively,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can  recognise driving test  results  issued  by\r\n\r\noverseas  driving test centres which are properly  accredited\r\n\r\nand  which  conduct  their tests according  to  international\r\n\r\nstandards.   And,  thirdly, whether we can also  consider  if\r\n\r\nsomebody  wants  to  set  up a proper  driving  centre  in  a\r\n\r\nneighbouring country, say, in one of the islands and have  it\r\n\r\nproperly  accredited,  and  have international  standards  of\r\n\r\ntesting, we can recognise such driving test results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, one of the groups of people who\r\n\r\nregularly go for driving tests in Singapore, and adding on to\r\n\r\nthe  queue,  are  those who get 24 demerit points,  or  whose\r\n\r\nlicences are suspended by the court.  At the moment, there is\r\n\r\na double whammy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you commit an offence, you get a fine and you\r\n\r\nget  24  points,  your licence is suspended.   Then  if  your\r\n\r\nlicence  is  suspended for a year, you get a  triple  whammy.\r\n\r\nYou are required to go for a driving test all over again.  My\r\n\r\nquestion  is whether we can decouple the third whammy,  which\r\n\r\nis  the  requirement to go for a driving test one more  time.\r\n\r\nBecause there are certain offences, for example, driving in a\r\n\r\nbus  lane, which carries three demerit points, not wearing  a\r\n\r\nseat belt, carries three demerit points - all these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings do not really relate to driving skills.  They are more\r\n\r\nmistakes  and  simple offences which do  not  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ndriving  ability or pose any serious danger to other  drivers\r\n\r\non  the  road.   So  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nseriously  consider whether there is really a need for  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  been suspended for a year to go for  driving  test\r\n\r\nagain,  and whether we can decouple this exercise so that  we\r\n\r\nreduce demand on our driving test centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  a question on what I perceive to be too long a waiting\r\n\r\nperiod  for  conversion of Malaysian class 5 licence  to  our\r\n\r\nSingapore class 4 vocational driving licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our private bus operators employ Malaysians with\r\n\r\nclass  5  licence as bus drivers in Singapore.  Upon approval\r\n\r\nof  their work permit, their class 5 licence is converted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  class  3  licence.  This is  followed  by  another\r\n\r\nwaiting period of some three months or so before a test  date\r\n\r\nis   given  for  conversion  to  class  4.   Upon  successful\r\n\r\nconversion  to class 4, another waiting period of 2-3  months\r\n\r\nis  again  required before a date is given for the vocational\r\n\r\nclass 4 licence driving test.  By the time the Malaysian  bus\r\n\r\ndriver obtains his vocational class 4 driving licence, it can\r\n\r\nstretch to a 6-month waiting time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the need for Malaysians working in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  hold  a  Singapore driving  licence.   What  I\r\n\r\nconsider as inconsistent is the fact that there are Malaysian-registered  heavy  vehicles which ply our  roads  daily.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, I am referring to Malaysian lorry and van drivers\r\n\r\nwho  come  in from the Causeway or the Second Link,  and  ply\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles  all the way to our port container  terminal.\r\n\r\nThese  drivers do not have a Singapore class 4  licence,  and\r\n\r\nyet  are considered safe and competent enough to drive on our\r\n\r\nSingapore  roads.   That being the case, the  long  wait  for\r\n\r\nconversion  cannot  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  these\r\n\r\nMalaysians waiting to be employed must first be tested to  be\r\n\r\ncompetent and safe.  If this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  so, then there seems to be inconsistency in our policy.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the long waiting time has dire consequences on  the\r\n\r\nbus  operators.  Very often, the recruited bus drivers decide\r\n\r\nto  give  up  their jobs as they find the waiting period  too\r\n\r\nlong  and cannot afford to go on without a salary during this\r\n\r\nperiod, since they are not yet productive on their jobs.  The\r\n\r\nbus   operators,  in  this  instance,  would  have   expended\r\n\r\nresources that only brought in futile results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I request for the Minister to kindly look into\r\n\r\nshortening  the  waiting  period  for  conversion   of   such\r\n\r\nlicences?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, questions concerning the\r\n\r\nsafety on our roads have been raised by Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and\r\n\r\nMr  Steve  Chia.  May I first, at the outset,  say  that  our\r\n\r\nroads are generally safe for our road users.  They are mostly\r\n\r\nin  good condition, well-maintained but, at the same time, we\r\n\r\nalso  have people who speed on our roads and there  are  also\r\n\r\npeople with dangerous driving habits.  As a result, accidents\r\n\r\ndo  happen.   Unfortunately,  as mentioned  by  Members,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  those who died, or who were seriously  injured,\r\n\r\neg,  last  year, were motorcyclists, and some  of  them  with\r\n\r\npillion  riders.  They formed about 89 out of 197 fatalities,\r\n\r\nand  210 out of 340 people who were seriously injured on  our\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely, the Police takes a very serious view of the\r\n\r\nvulnerability of this group of road users.  And measures have\r\n\r\nbeen put in place to enhance the safety of our motorists,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  motorcyclists.  For motorcyclists,  specifically\r\n\r\nour approach involves:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Improving the quality and standard of rider\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training and testing;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Vigorous enforcement; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Intensive public education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first touch on improving the quality and\r\n\r\nstandard  of our rider training.  Learner riders need  to  be\r\n\r\nequipped with good riding skills and habits in handling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  motorcycles  on  the roads  and  also  when  they  are\r\n\r\ninteracting with other road users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-the-road-training was introduced since 1985; in other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  have  to experience what it  is  like  actually\r\n\r\ndriving  on  the  road before they get  their  licence.   And\r\n\r\ncomputer-simulated  training  was  also  started   in   1998.\r\n\r\nEmergency braking on wet surfaces and also riding at night on\r\n\r\npublic  roads have also become part of the curriculum.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  training syllabus for learner motorcyclists is regularly\r\n\r\nreviewed.   All these were designed to improve  the  training\r\n\r\nsystem  so that they are better prepared when they are  ready\r\n\r\nto ride the motorbike on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police also partners various organisations\r\n\r\nto  promote motorcyclists' safety and to improve road safety.\r\n\r\nThese  organisations include the ITE Ang Mo Kio  Safe  Riding\r\n\r\nClub, Harley Davidson Club, National Safety Council, tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions   and  organisations  with   large   fleets   of\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, I must say that other motorists\r\n\r\nhave also a role to play in ensuring a safer road environment\r\n\r\nfor  our  motorcyclists, and they should  give  motorcyclists\r\n\r\nsufficient space on the road.  This is the concern raised  by\r\n\r\nMr   Chia   earlier.   Tailgating  and  also   squeezing   of\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  to  the  side  of  the  lane   is   not   only\r\n\r\ninconsiderate,  but  is  also very  dangerous.   The  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  has been conducting on-going public education efforts\r\n\r\nto  stress the need for drivers of motor vehicles to give way\r\n\r\nto motorcyclists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the problem of speeding on our roads.\r\n\r\nIn the first three months of this year, about 7,000 motorists\r\n\r\nwere  booked for speeding.  But this is down from 9,500  over\r\n\r\nthe  same period last year, partly because of our enforcement\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for motorcyclists, 3,307 of them were caught speeding\r\n\r\nlast year as compared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  2,400  in the year 2000.  The thrust of Traffic  Police's\r\n\r\nenforcement  efforts  is  to  curb  speeding  and   dangerous\r\n\r\ndriving.   Enforcement actions against dangerous drivers  and\r\n\r\nriders  are conducted regularly.  This is the concern  raised\r\n\r\nby  Mr Tan earlier.  In fact, for those people who were found\r\n\r\nspeeding  at 40 km or more above our speed limit,  they  will\r\n\r\nimmediately be charged in court and may face disqualification\r\n\r\nfrom driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is also continuously looking out for\r\n\r\nillegal  racing,  as  it is not only a nuisance,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  dangerous to the racers and to other  road  users.\r\n\r\nSir,  Traffic  Police regularly patrols areas  where  illegal\r\n\r\nracing  is  known to take place.  Between January  and  April\r\n\r\nthis  year,  the  Traffic  Police  mounted  a  total  of  325\r\n\r\noperations   against  speedsters,  out  of  which   69   were\r\n\r\nconcentrated  at  the Lim Chua Kang area, Tuas,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road.  As rightly pointed our by Mr Tan,  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  known  to  be  racing in these places  illegally.   The\r\n\r\npenalties  faced  by these speedsters range from  composition\r\n\r\nfines  to  possible  conviction and disqualification  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt.   The  Traffic  Police will continue  its  enforcement\r\n\r\naction against these speedsters.  But I must say that because\r\n\r\nthey  are  illegal and they are organised  at  times  and  at\r\n\r\nplaces  which  they  did  not inform the  Traffic  Police  in\r\n\r\nadvance, it will not be possible for the Traffic Police to be\r\n\r\nat  all the places where they are racing.  But where we know,\r\n\r\nwhere  information has been given to us, we will indeed  take\r\n\r\naction to stop them, and to take all necessary action against\r\n\r\nthis group.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, could you please speed up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Mr Chia raised his concern about\r\n\r\nL-riders.   Actually, the number of riders in Class  2B,  new\r\n\r\nlicence holders, were very few.  The majority of this  group,\r\n\r\nabout  85%  who were involved in accidents have been  on  the\r\n\r\nroad  for  more than one year.  They are experienced drivers.\r\n\r\nAs   I  said,  part  of  the  problem  is  speeding  by   the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists and other motorists, and also some dangerous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndriving habits which have contributed to such accidents.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, we hope that with a better training programme,\r\n\r\nwe  could  help them to be even better drivers, and  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat other motorists will not make it difficult for them.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ravindran earlier mentioned about learner\r\n\r\ndrivers  who  can  take their test faster.   At  the  moment,\r\n\r\nlearner drivers take their training at our driving schools as\r\n\r\nwell  as from private instructors.  On the average, they take\r\n\r\nabout  five  months  just to undergo  practical  training  in\r\n\r\ndriving.   And  the  five  months of training  is  considered\r\n\r\nreasonable,  because learner drivers have  to  cover  a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of driving skills and pick up good driving habits  and,\r\n\r\nhopefully, make our roads safer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period of training also provides learner drivers\r\n\r\nample time to familiarise themselves with the traffic as well\r\n\r\nas  road conditions in Singapore.  And we believe that for  a\r\n\r\nlife  time of driving, this initial investment of five months\r\n\r\nis well worth it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wait for a test slot takes another two months.\r\n\r\nHence,  on average, the total time taken for a learner driver\r\n\r\nwho  passes on the first try is about seven months.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  still  well  worth it.  The are a limited  number  of\r\n\r\npractical driving test slots.  Between January and March this\r\n\r\nyear, there were 17,100 driving test slots available compared\r\n\r\nto  19,000 learner drivers seeking to take their tests.   So,\r\n\r\ntest  slots  are somewhat limited by about 2,000  in  number,\r\n\r\npartly  because of the availability of driving  circuits  for\r\n\r\npractical  tests.  There  are currently  only  three  driving\r\n\r\ncircuits here.  As the three driving schools need to  conduct\r\n\r\npractical  training using the driving circuits as well,  test\r\n\r\nslots  have  to  be properly spaced out and  scheduled.   The\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police is aware of this constraint, as mentioned  by\r\n\r\nMr  Ravindran,  and  is working with the driving  schools  to\r\n\r\nexplore  ways  to  increase the number of test  slots.   With\r\n\r\nthat,  perhaps the timeframe for passing one's  driving  test\r\n\r\ncan be shortened slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singaporeans taking the test, for example, in\r\n\r\nBatam,  at  the moment, we have our own programme  or  scheme\r\n\r\nbecause of various reasons, including the fact that our  road\r\n\r\nconditions,   users and the traffic here are not  similar  to\r\n\r\nother  countries, let alone Batam.  So there is a constraint,\r\n\r\nAt  the moment, in fact, Singaporeans who go overseas and get\r\n\r\ntheir licences do not get automatic recognition here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, we have 18 minutes left, and\r\n\r\nthere are still six Members who want to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, I have one more point to\r\n\r\nanswer Mdm Ho.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do it quickly, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Yes, Sir. A foreigner can drive\r\n\r\nin  Singapore without converting his foreign driving licence,\r\n\r\nif it is for short periods.  He is allowed to drive up to one\r\n\r\nyear,  if he is driving in and out of Singapore.  Thereafter,\r\n\r\nhe is required to obtain a Singapore driving licence.  But  a\r\n\r\nforeigner  who  is  working  in  Singapore  is  considered  a\r\n\r\nresident.  Therefore, he is treated like a Singaporean and he\r\n\r\nmust  get a Singapore driving licence before he can  drive  a\r\n\r\nvehicle   in  Singapore.   These  include  drivers  who   are\r\n\r\nMalaysians  and who are working for SBS and other  companies.\r\n\r\nForeigners  with  foreign driving licences  are  nevertheless\r\n\r\nsubject to our regulatory regime of our Traffic Act, and have\r\n\r\nto comply with all the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, it is not possible to shorten the period\r\n\r\nfor foreigners.  They have to wait for a while.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards concerns raised about seat belts and\r\n\r\nwhether or not demerit points are justified, I must say  that\r\n\r\nthe  concern  now is not to reduce the three  demerit  points\r\n\r\nagainst  drivers  who  fail to ensure  and  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nregulations.    Instead,  our thinking  now  is  to  consider\r\n\r\nwhether  the passengers, especially those who have a  licence\r\n\r\nand did not belt up, should also be considered to get three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemerit points.  Because he is a qualified driver and he  did\r\n\r\nnot comply with the regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes a fine is good enough. Sometimes it is\r\n\r\nnot  good  enough.   Sometimes many of our drivers  are  more\r\n\r\nconcerned with demerit points.  Therefore, demerit points can\r\n\r\nalso  play  a very important part to ensure that  people  are\r\n\r\nmore caring and wear seat belts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I asked the question on decoupling\r\n\r\nthe  suspension and the driving test, and I did  not  get  an\r\n\r\nanswer.   Perhaps  the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary  could\r\n\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, normally, people get\r\n\r\nsuspended  because  the  court  is  satisfied  that  he   has\r\n\r\ncommitted  a very serious offence.  Therefore, the suspension\r\n\r\nis necessary.  And the idea of sending them back to school is\r\n\r\nto make sure that they re-familiarise themselves with the law\r\n\r\nand,  hopefully, pick up good driving habits.   The  idea  is\r\n\r\nthat,  in the end, when they go back to the road, it  is  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  safety  and for the safety of other  road  users.\r\n\r\nThat is the key reason and I think it is still relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I just want to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister why visitors from China, both social visit pass\r\n\r\nand  business pass visitors, face a more lengthy  application\r\n\r\nprocess compared to visitors from other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect I would like to ask is on the student\r\n\r\npass.   It  seems to me that SIR must be the only immigration\r\n\r\nauthority  in the world that terminates student passes  based\r\n\r\non  their  examination results.

The first is that\r\n\r\nI  have come across cases where permanent resident status was\r\n\r\ngranted to one spouse and not to the other.  This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreates  a  problem  for  them, as the  family  unit  has  no\r\n\r\ncertainty  in  making Singapore its permanent home.   If  the\r\n\r\nwife  is  working  here and the husband  is  left  behind  in\r\n\r\nShandong province in China, what do you think the most likely\r\n\r\noutcome  would  be?  One outcome is that they make  plans  to\r\n\r\nmove  on to the United States or some other country,  and  we\r\n\r\nlose  them  eventually.  The other possibility  is  that  the\r\n\r\nhusband  finds  another woman there and  divorces  his  wife.\r\n\r\nNow,  what  business do we have in breaking up families?   If\r\n\r\nfor  some reason, we cannot grant the other immediate  family\r\n\r\nmember  PR  status,  then I think we should  not  grant  that\r\n\r\napplicant  PR status in the first place, as he is not  likely\r\n\r\nto  be  here permanently without his family.  In not allowing\r\n\r\nall  the family members to reside here, we force him  to  use\r\n\r\nthis  place as a stepping stone to something else,  and  this\r\n\r\ndefeats our purpose and our objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to permanent residents becoming\r\n\r\nso  permanent  that  they do not want to accept  citizenship.\r\n\r\nMany PRs who have been PR for many years do not actually want\r\n\r\nto   be  Singapore  citizens,  unless  and   until  something\r\n\r\nterrible  happens  to  their home country.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nreasons  for their decision.  The main reason, I suspect,  is\r\n\r\nthat  they enjoy the best of both worlds, and can always take\r\n\r\nthat  step  at a later stage.  In the meantime,  they  remain\r\n\r\nmobile  and  continue to enjoy the rights of  citizenship  in\r\n\r\ntheir  home country and the many benefits of being  a  PR  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  the  envy of Singaporeans.  I  know  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence  means  they can reside here on a permanent  basis.\r\n\r\nBut  I would like to ask the Minister whether an expiry  date\r\n\r\nshould be imposed on the PR status.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, the precursor\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Penal Code is the Penal Code of the Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements, which was passed by the Legislative  Council  of\r\n\r\nthe Straits Settlements in 1871, and this was, in turn, based\r\n\r\non  the Indian Penal Code of 1860.  Come September this year,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Penal Code would have been in force  for  130\r\n\r\nyears.   This  is significant if we consider that  while  the\r\n\r\nPenal Code has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namended  from  time  to  time,  it  still  retains  its  main\r\n\r\nprovisions in their original form.  The wait of 130 years  is\r\n\r\nshowing  in the Penal Code, and several of the provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Code appear to be rather inappropriate for the Singapore\r\n\r\nof  today.   For example, section 429 provides  that  whoever\r\n\r\ncommits mischief by killing or rendering useless an elephant,\r\n\r\na  camel  and  a  host  of  other  non-indigenous   creatures\r\n\r\nincluding cows shall be punished with imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nwhich may extend to five years or with a fine or with both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in present times, as we remake Singapore and are\r\n\r\nwilling to sacrifice sacred cows, section 429 appears  to  be\r\n\r\ngrossly out of date; similarly, for sections 428 and 498  for\r\n\r\nwhich  I  do  not have the time to go into.   Many  of  these\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  rarely or never used to prosecute  offenders\r\n\r\nprecisely because they are so irrelevant to society today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that a comprehensive review of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Penal Code be done to re-evaluate  the  role,  the\r\n\r\nscope  and the relevance of its provisions, and to  weed  out\r\n\r\nprovisions which are no longer needed or desirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nspeak  on the topic on a gap in our law, and this is  in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  stalking and harassment.

As   regards\r\n\r\nstalking, we all know what that means.   Harassment can  take\r\n\r\nmany forms; particularly with the use of IT, it is taking the\r\n\r\nform of e-mails and SMS messages through the handphone.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent   status  of  the  law  does  not  afford  sufficient\r\n\r\nprotection.    The   only   relevant   legislation   is   the\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.   The\r\n\r\ncombined  effect of section 13 (a), (b) and (c)  is  that  it\r\n\r\nprohibits   threatening,  abusive  or  insulting   words   or\r\n\r\nbehaviour  in written or oral form within sight of a  person,\r\n\r\nor  in  such  a manner as to believe that immediate  unlawful\r\n\r\nviolence will be used.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  is  you can have a conduct which is not threatening,\r\n\r\nabusive  or  insulting, but which is nevertheless harassment,\r\n\r\neg, silent phone calls in the middle of the night, persistent\r\n\r\ncalls of conduct.  Or you send flowers which the person  does\r\n\r\nnot  want  or  if you send dead flowers.  Or you  could  send\r\n\r\nunwanted  gifts  which people do not  want  either.   When  I\r\n\r\nbecame  an  MP, I received a message to return  a call.   And\r\n\r\nwhen I did, I discovered he had not called but this woman had\r\n\r\nleft messages with a whole host of people to call him, and it\r\n\r\nwas a form of harassment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only in October of last year that it became an\r\n\r\nactionable  tort in Singapore when our High Court ruled  that\r\n\r\nyou  could actually have a civil course of action.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nproblem   seems  to  be  that  we  do  not  have   sufficient\r\n\r\nlegislation, and I would like to ask the Minister if he would\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to look into legislation to provide for it to be\r\n\r\nan  offence  for  the police to have appropriate  powers  for\r\n\r\nother  remedial  action,  eg,  referral  for  counselling  or\r\n\r\npsychiatric evaluation.  And, finally, if the person is not a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen, then perhaps to review the conditions  of\r\n\r\nhis stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, I give you two minutes to\r\n\r\nraise both your points before the Minister replies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Sir. I will make\r\n\r\nit in two minutes with my questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can the Minister tell us how many applications\r\n\r\nfor  society  registrations have been rejected  in  the  last\r\n\r\nthree years?  If any, can the Minister also explain what  and\r\n\r\nwhy they were rejected?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is unreasonable for the Registry of Societies\r\n\r\nto charge $400 simply for the registration of a society.  Any\r\n\r\nsubsequent changes to the constitution, the ROS charges $140.\r\n\r\nCan   the   Minister   look  into  reducing   these   charges\r\n\r\nsignificantly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, can the Minister kindly explain the rationale for\r\n\r\nrestricting the societies to certain parts of Singapore, like\r\n\r\nin   Geylang?   In  view  of  the  excess  capacity  of   HDB\r\n\r\nshophouses, will the Minister look into allowing societies to\r\n\r\nregister and function in these shophouses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to my second cut on public\r\n\r\nentertainment licence.  Can the Minister also explain why  it\r\n\r\ntakes  21  days to issue a speaking permit?  Can the Minister\r\n\r\nlook  into  reducing that?  The Minister said  previously  in\r\n\r\nParliament that they are going to shorten the period.  I want\r\n\r\nto  know  how it is getting along.  Can the Minister cut  the\r\n\r\napproval  down  to three days in the name of  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nproductivity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point. Can the Ministry also do away with the\r\n\r\nneed  to  apply  for the entertainment permit personally  and\r\n\r\nphysically?   Like  all  Government Ministries,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\napplication for the public entertainment licence can also  be\r\n\r\ndone electronically on line?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, you have about seven minutes to\r\n\r\nanswer all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chia said that he had two\r\n\r\nquestions, but he had four questions.  The Minister is not  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  who is able to produce all these specific  answers.\r\n\r\nI will try, but then I have got six minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Dr Wang's cut first. I think Dr Wang is\r\n\r\nconcerned about tourists coming particularly from China,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should  in fact tap this vast  market.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure him that MHA is aware that there is a large market out\r\n\r\nthere.  And together with other agencies, we will do our part\r\n\r\nto  facilitate the entry of these tourists.  But, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe   Member   must  be  aware  that  we  must  balance   the\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  because besides genuine  tourists  who  come\r\n\r\nhere,  there are also others who come here illegally and  who\r\n\r\nwork  illegally.  And this includes, in fact, even  students.\r\n\r\nWhilst we also want to tap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents and, in fact, many PRC students study here,  we  are\r\n\r\nalso mindful that the system must be able to sieve those  who\r\n\r\nare genuine from those who come here for other reasons, using\r\n\r\neither  the tourist visa or the student pass as subterfuge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that we have been flexible in granting\r\n\r\nvisas  to  genuine  visitors.  For example,  last  year,  SIR\r\n\r\nreceived  330,000 visa applications from Chinese  and  Indian\r\n\r\ntourists,  and  99%  of  these were approved.   Only  1%  was\r\n\r\nrejected.   I  do not have the breakdown for the Chinese  and\r\n\r\nIndians,  but taking them as a group, both these markets  are\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we do recognise.  Most of these  visas  were\r\n\r\nprocessed  within 2-3 days.  So, it is not true  that  it  is\r\n\r\ntaking a long time.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we also hold regular dialogues,\r\n\r\nnot  only  with economic agencies but, for example, with  the\r\n\r\nNational Association of Travel Agents (NATAS) to explore ways\r\n\r\nto  facilitate  the  entry  of genuine  visitors  from  these\r\n\r\ncountries.   For  example, we revised the banker's  guarantee\r\n\r\nrecently  for the 96-hour visa for PRC tourists.  Previously,\r\n\r\neach  travel  agent  had to furnish a banker's  guarantee  of\r\n\r\n$100,000.   But, with effect from 15th April this  year,  the\r\n\r\nbanker's  guarantee  has  been waived  for  Singapore  travel\r\n\r\nagents  who  consistently bring in PRC tourists  who  do  not\r\n\r\noverstay; in other words, based on their record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, is the approach we also take with\r\n\r\napplicants  - schools and other training institutes  -  which\r\n\r\nwant to bring in Chinese students to study in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nrealise that there is a market out there.  Many of them  want\r\n\r\nto  come  here,  but we also must realise  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nplethora  of  agencies  here.   For  example,  we  have   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools.   We  have  the  institutes  of   higher\r\n\r\nlearning.  We have schools with good reputation like NAFA and\r\n\r\nLaSalle.   And  then there are private institutions  doing  a\r\n\r\nwhole  range of activities.  The approach SIR takes will  put\r\n\r\nthe onus on these training institutes and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  to ensure that whoever they bring out do not violate\r\n\r\nconditions, like not working, and so forth.  In fact, SIR  is\r\n\r\nfine-tuning  its  procedures,  examining  things  like,   for\r\n\r\nexample, the need for a sponsorship so that more students can\r\n\r\ncome out.  Basically, the point is that we are mindful of the\r\n\r\nneed to tap this market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min talks about permanent residence. In\r\n\r\nfact, we are mindful that we should not separate family units\r\n\r\nwhen they apply for PR.  Generally, that is the principle  we\r\n\r\nwork  on  - preservation of family unity.  Hence, the spouses\r\n\r\nand  children of Singapore citizens and Singapore PRs may  be\r\n\r\ngranted  PR  under their sponsorship.  In the instance  where\r\n\r\nfamily members apply for PR together, they are considered  as\r\n\r\na  family  unit.  I am informed that in a large  majority  of\r\n\r\ncases,  if  the  main  applicant is successful,  PR  is  also\r\n\r\ngranted to the spouse and children.  In these cases,  if  the\r\n\r\nspouses  and  dependants are not able to come in because  the\r\n\r\nmain  applicant economically does not satisfy the salary cut-off,  or  is not able to establish an income that is  stable,\r\n\r\nthen,  in many cases, they are also granted long-term  social\r\n\r\nvisit  passes.  That is the main point.  If Mr  Ong  has  any\r\n\r\nparticular  case, he can refer them to me.  I  think  we  are\r\n\r\nconsidering one of his cases now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that PR is granted on the basis of\r\n\r\nfree  entry  in  and out of Singapore, based  on  a  re-entry\r\n\r\npermit.   That  is the system we work on.  PRs  who  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  who  live  in  Singapore,  because  of   our   PR\r\n\r\nassessment scheme, they are assessed to be able to contribute\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  That is why for those who live in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  take  it  on that basis.  When they renew their  REP,  at\r\n\r\nleast  that shows an indication on their part that they  want\r\n\r\nto  continue using Singapore as their proxy home.   Some  may\r\n\r\nnot  want to become Singapore citizens straightaway.  But the\r\n\r\npoint is that they do contribute to Singapore's well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong's point on the Penal Code, yes, indeed,\r\n\r\nit  is  an  old dame enacted in 1871, and so we are reviewing\r\n\r\nit.   There  is  a  process where, together with  MinLaw  and\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChambers, we are looking at all the 400 provisions to  update\r\n\r\nthe  provisions,  and also to update the  penalties.   It  is\r\n\r\ntaking  some  time because there is a need to  integrate  the\r\n\r\nscheme that we want the Penal Code to have, not only internal\r\n\r\nconsistency  amongst  the various provisions  but  also  with\r\n\r\nother statutes as well.  This is just to assure Mr Chong that\r\n\r\nwe have this in hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah has expressed concerns about what she\r\n\r\ncalls  a lacuna, or gap, in the law.  Let me assure her  that\r\n\r\nwe are indeed studying the issue of whether or not there is a\r\n\r\nneed to enact specific anti-stalking and anti-harassment laws\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  I think she is aware of a study made  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy  of  Law.  We will  look  at  it  and,  if\r\n\r\nappropriate, we will enact it.  But I must say  that  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore context, we must be careful.  Because of our  close\r\n\r\nproximity,  Police  must  be very  satisfied  that  they  can\r\n\r\npractically be able to implement any anti-stalking  or  anti-harassment law.  Otherwise, somebody just lingering around in\r\n\r\nthe void deck may fall foul of that law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. \"Guillotine\" time.

I believe they constitute about probably  15-20%\r\n\r\nof  its  turnover.  Recently, the Minister has also announced\r\n\r\nthat   $80   million   will   be  spent   to   develop   more\r\n\r\ninfrastructural facilities for the maritime cluster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of top customers should not be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nAlready, we hear that Tanjung Pelepas is expanding the number\r\n\r\nof  berths for more shipping lines.  In this area, I  believe\r\n\r\ncustomer  relationship management is  an  important  area  of\r\n\r\nfocus  for  any  business.   Whether  Tanjung  Pelepas   went\r\n\r\nbackwards  to  entice  the top two customers  that  is  quite\r\n\r\nimmaterial  to me.  The fact is that two top customers  went.\r\n\r\nWe  should not under-estimate what two top shipping lines can\r\n\r\ndo there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has argued that there is more than just\r\n\r\ncost  in  the  equation.  There is also  value  in  our  port\r\n\r\nfacilities,   infrastructure,  IT  connection,  connectivity,\r\n\r\nreliability, efficiency, and so on.  What I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  is  that we should be aware  of  industry-wide\r\n\r\nchanges  in  order to estimate this kind of  demands  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   It  is  definitely not cost alone.  Shipping  lines\r\n\r\nwant  to  operate their own berths or terminal for maximising\r\n\r\ntheir  own  value, and also because they want to build  their\r\n\r\nown  global supply chain integration.  Supply chain  linkages\r\n\r\nin  extracting  value from the competitive environment  is  a\r\n\r\nvery important part of modern business.  Many managements  in\r\n\r\nthese   shipping  lines  are  answerable  to  their   boards.\r\n\r\nBuilding  their  own global supply chain,  therefore,  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  strategic  objective of  these  companies,  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve PSA should collaborate with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these big shipping lines and big corporations\r\n\r\nhave  their  own  advance schedule planning in  supply  chain\r\n\r\nnetwork  for  these  global players  and  they  can  maximise\r\n\r\nupstream and downstream\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning  schedules and connection.  These,  I  believe,  can\r\n\r\novercome connectivity advantages of PSA.  Global players also\r\n\r\nhave  their  own  IT and infrastructural strengths,  we  must\r\n\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been arguing for a private operation of berths\r\n\r\nfor  the last three years.  I hope the Minister's answer this\r\n\r\ntime  would  be  different.  But  I  believe  we  can  anchor\r\n\r\nimportant  customers  and shipping  lines  by  tendering  out\r\n\r\nfacilities over a lease period, and also a possibility  could\r\n\r\nbe  through schemes of joint share of revenue.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe can establish partnership with the major players.  We must\r\n\r\nnever  under-estimate the downstream losses  of  the  linkage\r\n\r\neffects  in  the economy arising from this loss of customers,\r\n\r\nwhether   it  is  in  the  service  sector,  freight  sector,\r\n\r\nlogistics  or ship-chandling.  Will the Minister  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that policies will be applied to prevent further  loss\r\n\r\nof customers and prevent the erosion of primacy of our port?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, Singapore's status as a premier\r\n\r\nport  in  the region and a transshipment hub is under  siege.\r\n\r\nThe  loss of Maersk Sealand last year to Tanjung Pelepas  and\r\n\r\nnow,  this year, Evergreen, means creaming off at least  $2.2\r\n\r\nmillion twenty-foot equivalent units of containers, or 15% of\r\n\r\nPSA's  annual  volume.  What is probably just as  serious  is\r\n\r\nthat  if you lose two big customers, you also lose the feeder\r\n\r\nlines that provide the connectivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how will a line like Evergreen manage to squeeze a\r\n\r\ngood  deal is something which is quite well-known in shipping\r\n\r\ncircles.   It just went from PSA to Tanjung Pelepas back  and\r\n\r\nforth, pushing down prices with each offer and counter offer,\r\n\r\nuntil  one  side blinked.  This is a common business  tactic.\r\n\r\nWhen  you have a choice, you can bargain until the other side\r\n\r\ngives  way.  It also shows that during bad times,  no  matter\r\n\r\nhow  much  you tout your strength, in terms of efficiency  or\r\n\r\ninnovation,  or  how  far  you  are  ahead  with  information\r\n\r\ntechnology  in your operations, in the end, what counts  most\r\n\r\nto the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncustomers  is  cost.   Sir, when you  are  in  business,  you\r\n\r\nsometimes  have to be prepared to take a cut in  your  profit\r\n\r\njust  to make it attractive for you to lure a customer.   The\r\n\r\nimportant thing is to get your customer first, then make  the\r\n\r\nmoney later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that PSA did go through great lengths to\r\n\r\nkeep  these two major customers.  But I think the danger here\r\n\r\nis  whether the loss of these two major lines will in the end\r\n\r\nattract others to move ahead, others like COSCO of China  and\r\n\r\n\"K\" Line of Japan.  And Mr Chay Wai Chuen has just said, what\r\n\r\nabout the downstream effects on the economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason why Maersk moved was that it could not get a\r\n\r\ndedicated  terminal from PSA with which it  could  have  then\r\n\r\nbeen  in  a  better position to manage its own logistics  and\r\n\r\ncosts.   I  join  Mr Chay in asking whether PSA  is  now  re-thinking this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maersk Line was also attracted to Pelepas because it was\r\n\r\noffered  a  30% ownership in the port.  Recently,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  suggested  that PSA should  think  of  selling\r\n\r\nshares to the major shipping lines.  I also read just  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  that PSA's IPO has now been postponed.  Does  this\r\n\r\nmean  that  PSA  is now re-looking at it or will  it  have  a\r\n\r\nprivate placement of shares to shipping lines?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the horizon, there is a bigger threat to us.\r\n\r\nJust  yesterday, it was announced that Thailand  has  revived\r\n\r\nthe  idea of a canal through the Kra Isthmus, and it is going\r\n\r\nto  be  called the Thai Canal.  This idea of a canal  through\r\n\r\nthe  Kra Isthmus has been on the cards for something like 200\r\n\r\nyears.   But,  I  think, this time the Thais  mean  business.\r\n\r\nThis will cut shipping traffic through the Straits of Malacca\r\n\r\nand  certainly  will  affect not just Singapore  but  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelepas.   But I also understand that the Thais have  offered\r\n\r\nSingapore a stake in the project.  I would like to  know  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's thinking on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, like my colleagues, Mr Tan\r\n\r\nand Mr Chay, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  before  me,  I  am  equally  concerned  by  the\r\n\r\ndeparture  of Maersk Sealand and Evergreen Marine to  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelepas.   While  the  Minister  had,  during  last  Monday's\r\n\r\nQuestions  for Oral Answer, explained the transfer  of  these\r\n\r\ntwo  shipping  lines  would not affect our  port  positioning\r\n\r\ndramatically, I am still a bit concerned on the impact it has\r\n\r\non our workers and businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the port does not stand by itself. There are so\r\n\r\nmany parties that are directly or indirectly involved in  its\r\n\r\ndownstream  operations.   The  decline  in  terms  of  volume\r\n\r\nhandled  by PSA would also mean that those working  with  the\r\n\r\nport  - in the transportation of goods and the processing  of\r\n\r\nthem  -  would  be affected.  These are people  who  work  as\r\n\r\nmovers,  crane  operators,  bulk breakers,  distributors  and\r\n\r\npackagers.  They face a real prospect of losing their jobs or\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure of the two shipping lines is a signal that\r\n\r\nPSA's  current approach and strategy require serious  review.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister  elaborate on the future  direction  and\r\n\r\nfresh  efforts to ensure PSA remain competitive on  a  global\r\n\r\nscale?  Other ports are also facing similar competition,  for\r\n\r\nexample, Pusan in Korea versus the fast growing Chinese ports\r\n\r\nof  Shanghai  and Dailan, and Rotterdam versus  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nEurope.   We  have to make necessary changes  to  avoid  from\r\n\r\nfollowing the fate of Liverpool when the America-Europe trade\r\n\r\npattern changed.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from facing challenge from the emerging\r\n\r\ncompetitors  from  the  region,  Singapore  is  also   facing\r\n\r\nchanging  pattern of shipping routes and shipping technology.\r\n\r\nWhat plan does the Ministry have to return to our port's pre-eminence?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, the port is Singapore's life line\r\n\r\nand  supports many local businesses.  I share my  colleagues'\r\n\r\nconcern that any decrease in PSA's local freight volume  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  serious  impact  on  the other  related  sectors  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people were therefore cheered when they read the\r\n\r\nheadlines  on the back page of the Straits Times of  7th  May\r\n\r\n2002,  which  states, \"PSA stays buoyant, handling  39%  more\r\n\r\ncontainers  in  April\".   This appeared  remarkable.   But  a\r\n\r\ncloser  reading  of the article revealed that the  pronounced\r\n\r\njump  was, to a large part, due to the 182% surge in  traffic\r\n\r\nhandled by PSA's overseas terminals.  Although volumes at its\r\n\r\nSingapore's terminals grew 8.6% in the first four  months  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, PSA handled 15.52 million TEUs for the  whole  of\r\n\r\nlast year, a fall of 8.9% over the year 2000.  Latest figures\r\n\r\nshow that PSA is handling 1.4 million TEUs in Singapore,  ie,\r\n\r\ntwo   thirds   of  its  total,  and  740,000   TEUs   abroad,\r\n\r\nrepresenting one third of its total.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether PSA, by having\r\n\r\noperations  in various parts of the globe, would  divert  its\r\n\r\nmanagement's  attention away from the local port  operations.\r\n\r\nOverseas volume represents one third of PSA Corp's total, and\r\n\r\nis  growing  rapidly.  If other ports are more profitable  to\r\n\r\nmanage  or  have more potential for growth, would  management\r\n\r\nfocus more on these high growth areas?  How do we ensure that\r\n\r\nPSA  is committed to managing its Singapore's port operations\r\n\r\nwell?  Would it not be better for PSA to be split into two or\r\n\r\nmore  separate  companies,  like  Singapore  Power,  one   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on international business and the other to  focus\r\n\r\non  management  of  the local port?

We pride ourselves as an important air  hub  when\r\n\r\nour  airline  -  Singapore Airlines - by its  superior  brand\r\n\r\nname,  has been anchoring many of our hub services.  In  this\r\n\r\nprocess,  Singapore, as an air hub, in competition  with  the\r\n\r\nmany regional air hubs, such as KL, Bangkok or Hong Kong, has\r\n\r\nemerged creditably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of China as a power economy and\r\n\r\nNortheast  Asia  as  a  significant growth  region,  and  the\r\n\r\nrelative  slower  growth  of the Southeast  Asian  economies,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  air hub location is slightly tangent.    Coupled\r\n\r\nwith this background, one must seriously ask what is the cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our air hub.  One of the most powerful key\r\n\r\nmacro economic variables that has changed as a result of  the\r\n\r\nlast  Asian financial crisis was the dramatic realignment  of\r\n\r\nexchange  rates  of  many  of our competing  countries.   The\r\n\r\nmerger  and acquisition and the rescue buy-out faced in  this\r\n\r\nrestructuring  is  over.  Today, what we are  seeing  is  the\r\n\r\nrealigned competitiveness at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can reassure us. Today, if one\r\n\r\nwere to ask many average businessmen chasing sales, it is not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  they  will switch planes  at  many  of  our\r\n\r\nregional  airports,  eg, KL, Bangkok,  even  Perth.   Airline\r\n\r\ntickets  originating from these centres are much cheaper,  as\r\n\r\nmuch as 50% or more than SQ.  I assume the airport facilities\r\n\r\nare  equally cheaper than Singapore airport.  This  underlies\r\n\r\nmy concern about the competitiveness of our airport as a hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our port and our airport have been important pillars in\r\n\r\nour  economy.  How does the Minister ensure that they get the\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  the  competitive  environment,  just  like   the\r\n\r\npolicies  on  market  competition and deregulation  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposed in the telecommunications sector  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  which have driven costs down and value  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumer  up?   It is not just the bottom line  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirlines  that matters, but also many of the related services\r\n\r\nin the air freight businesses that will be of concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although Singapore\r\n\r\nis  just a little red little dot on the world map, it is well\r\n\r\nknown throughout the world for its excellent  airport. Changi\r\n\r\nAirport  has, over the years, won accolades and  awards  from\r\n\r\nvarious  international  agencies, and has  been  consistently\r\n\r\nrated as the best in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With very intense competition ahead, are we able to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  enviable position and supremacy for  the  next\r\n\r\ndecade?   First of all, the new Bangkok International Airport\r\n\r\nwill   be   opened  in  2004  and,  recently,  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nInternational  Airport  has  been  offering  very  attractive\r\n\r\ndiscounts to attract more carriers to land there.  The  other\r\n\r\nairports  in  the neighouring countries are also  seeking  to\r\n\r\nimprove their facilities and services.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   whether  these  competitions   will   affect\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as an aviation hub.   What measures  are\r\n\r\nbeing taken to face these competitions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of technology, airplanes can now\r\n\r\nfly  longer  distances without having to make  midway  stops.\r\n\r\nMany  airlines are cutting down stops in between destinations\r\n\r\nin  long-haul  flights. I believe this must  have  a  certain\r\n\r\neffect on us.  The growth of the airline business depends not\r\n\r\nonly  on  the efficiency and facilities of the airports,  but\r\n\r\nalso on the economic development of the country, its  tourism\r\n\r\nindustry and the convention business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these businesses will generate tourist arrivals in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  especially if we can attract more conventions  to\r\n\r\nbe  held  in Singapore.  We should spruce up our  attractions\r\n\r\nin  Sentosa so that we can attract more tourists.  We  should\r\n\r\nalso   step   up  our  efforts  to  sell  Singapore   as   an\r\n\r\ninternational   convention venue.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether   the  Ministry  of  Transport   has   any\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   plan   to   match   these   challenges,    by\r\n\r\nstrengthening our airport services to cater for  heavier  air\r\n\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Soo Khoon is not speaking.

Competition from the  region  is\r\n\r\ngetting  stronger and could be fiercer, in terms of selecting\r\n\r\nairlines,  passengers and cargoes.  Countries in this  region\r\n\r\nand beyond are offering services and facilities at much lower\r\n\r\ncost.   I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  a clear strategy to ensure the pre-eminence is retained.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  SIA  is  key  player in the  development  of  Changi\r\n\r\nInternational Airport as an air hub, I would also like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  comment whether the current  SIA's  ticket\r\n\r\npricing  structure  will  have  a  long-term  effect  on  our\r\n\r\nposition as a top air hub in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, has the Ministry considered the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of a trucking exchange by siting  a  depot,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in the centre of the island to provide  a  trucking\r\n\r\nexchange, so that containers can be switched to other  trucks\r\n\r\nwhich  ply  in  that sector?  I believe productivity  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved  in this way.  Often, in a journey, a truck carrying\r\n\r\ncargo  on  a container might ply empty on the return journey.\r\n\r\nI  am  talking about Singapore.  The journey is twice as long\r\n\r\nas  necessary and productivity on the return trip  is  nearly\r\n\r\nzero.   The trucking exchange, through B2B IT infrastructure,\r\n\r\ncan   exchange  information  and  plan  schedules   so   that\r\n\r\nparticipants  in this exchange can minimise  costs  and  plan\r\n\r\nschedules.   Naturally,  to  anchor  this,  big  players  are\r\n\r\nneeded.   But once it is up, it is the small players who  can\r\n\r\ndistinctly  benefit by lower time cost and  equipment  driver\r\n\r\ncost.  Roads also will be less heavily used with less charges\r\n\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, such depots exist for trucking to exchange\r\n\r\ncontainers running in different sectors.  Essentially, it  is\r\n\r\nan  informational exchange with B2B business transaction, and\r\n\r\nthe  rest is a matter of schedule planning and organisational\r\n\r\narrangements.  IT costs are not so prohibitive these days and\r\n\r\nthe  space required, I believe, may not be so big.

Mr Chay, Mr Tan Soo Khoon,  Mr  Yatiman\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Ong Kian Min have expressed deep concerns about  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of our port and our ability  to  retain  the\r\n\r\nshipping lines in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such concerns are understandable. As I informed\r\n\r\nthe  House  on Monday, the port sector is a very  competitive\r\n\r\none, not just in our region, but all over the world.  This is\r\n\r\nbecause new ports are being developed, and existing ones  are\r\n\r\nalways  striving to upgrade their services and  capabilities.\r\n\r\nFor  example, Hong Kong faces stiff competition from the  new\r\n\r\nports  in  Yantian,  Shekou and Chiwan.  In  such  a  dynamic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  with so many competing ports,  we  must  expect\r\n\r\nshipping  lines to adjust their ports of call  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure Members that PSA is no stranger to\r\n\r\ncompetition.   As Members know, PSA is largely a transhipment\r\n\r\nhub.   Transhipment containers can be handled anywhere  along\r\n\r\nthe  route  of  the  container  ships.   They  need  not   be\r\n\r\ntranshipped here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the competition, PSA continues to do well. Its\r\n\r\ncontainer  terminals handled 1.42 million  TEUs  (Twenty-foot\r\n\r\nEquivalent Units) in March 2002, the highest throughput in 17\r\n\r\nmonths,  and  this is despite the loss of a  major  customer.\r\n\r\nIts  container volume grew by 8.5% for the first  quarter  of\r\n\r\nthis year.  It has an extensive network of 250 shipping lines\r\n\r\nconnecting to 600 ports in more than 100 countries around the\r\n\r\nworld.   All these shipping lines are PSA customers,  because\r\n\r\nPSA  offers  them  a  highly  cost-effective  value-for-money\r\n\r\nservice and a shipping connectivity that few ports can match.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Members have noted, the competitive environment\r\n\r\nis  constantly  changing.   PSA  recognises  this.   It  also\r\n\r\nrecognises  that it cannot afford to be complacent.   PSA  is\r\n\r\nnow  reviewing all facets of its business strategy, with  the\r\n\r\naim  of  partnering and anchoring the customers here for  the\r\n\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PSA knows that many shipping companies are facing\r\n\r\nlow  profit  margins.  As such, the shipping lines  would  be\r\n\r\nshopping  for  lower  prices.  PSA understands  this  and  is\r\n\r\ncommitted   to  remaining  price  competitive  and  remaining\r\n\r\nresponsive to the needs of the customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong expressed worry about PSA's overseas operations\r\n\r\nand  that  these  operations may divert management  attention\r\n\r\naway  from  their operations in Singapore.  He proposed  that\r\n\r\nPSA  splits  into two companies, one to manage the  Singapore\r\n\r\noperations,  and one to manage the foreign investment.   Sir,\r\n\r\nas  Members are aware, PSA has been investing in ports abroad\r\n\r\nthat  have  a  high growth potential.  It now has significant\r\n\r\nport  operations  in China, Europe, India  and  Brunei.   The\r\n\r\ncontainer volume handled abroad now totalled about 8  million\r\n\r\nTEUs  a  year, and is expected to grow rapidly.  The overseas\r\n\r\noperations  give PSA greater economies of scale.   Even  more\r\n\r\nimportant,  they  enable  PSA to  provide  an  international,\r\n\r\nrather  than just local service to the shipping lines.   And,\r\n\r\nthis   is   important,   because   shipping   lines   operate\r\n\r\ninternationally.  So, PSA must be in a position to serve them\r\n\r\nin as many places as they go to.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These advantages and synergies would be lost if PSA were\r\n\r\nto be split into two companies, as Mr Ong has suggested.  But\r\n\r\nI can assure Members that Singapore will remain PSA's largest\r\n\r\nand  most  important operation for many, many years to  come.\r\n\r\nBecause of the strategic value of the port to Singapore,  not\r\n\r\nonly  will  PSA management be fully focused on it,  but  also\r\n\r\nthat  of  the Government leaders and, as we have shown  here,\r\n\r\nthe Members of the House as well.  So, PSA's management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot afford to divert its attention from the operations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay mentioned about the dedicated terminals,\r\n\r\nwhether  PSA  will  be  prepared to look  at  other  options,\r\n\r\nincluding the dedicated terminals.  As I have mentioned,  PSA\r\n\r\nis  doing  a  complete review of its business  strategy,  and\r\n\r\nnothing should be discounted.  It will be talking to all  its\r\n\r\ncustomers,  and  it  will  be as responsive  as  possible  in\r\n\r\nmeeting the needs of the customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that these are\r\n\r\nchallenging times for our port. PSA is acutely aware  of  the\r\n\r\never-changing  competitive landscape.  I can assure  Mr  Chay\r\n\r\nand  other Members of the House that PSA is not about to give\r\n\r\nup  its  position as the number one transhipment port in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   It  will,  therefore, do all that  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\npartner  its  shipping  clients  and  help  them  to  compete\r\n\r\neffectively and to grow.  This, in turn, will enable  PSA  to\r\n\r\ncontinue growing and to remain as a top transhipment port  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon also asked about the Kra Canal. Sir,\r\n\r\ncontrary to the newspaper reports, we have not been consulted\r\n\r\nor  approached about investment in the Kra Canal, and we are,\r\n\r\ntherefore, just learning from the newspaper reports  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on in Thailand with regard to the canal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the remarks of the MPs on\r\n\r\nairport competition.  What I have said about the port applies\r\n\r\ngenerally to airports as well.  Inevitably, airports  compete\r\n\r\nwith  one another, especially within the region.  As  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nhas pointed out, countries such as Thailand and Malaysia have\r\n\r\nrecognised the economic importance of a hub airport, and  are\r\n\r\ninvesting heavily in this sector.  The competition  faced  by\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport in the years ahead can, therefore,  only  get\r\n\r\nmore intense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, despite the competition, Changi Airport is still\r\n\r\nmaking good progress. Let me quote Members some figures.  For\r\n\r\nthe two months of March and April this year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassenger  and cargo traffic at Changi Airport grew  by  1.5%\r\n\r\nand  8.9%  respectively, compared to a year ago.  SIA's  load\r\n\r\nfactors  are up by five percentage points in March and,  what\r\n\r\nis  more  important, airlines are adding  new  or  additional\r\n\r\nflights  into Changi.  For example, SIA will start  new  city\r\n\r\nlinks  to Las Vegas and Chicago later this year.  Qantas  has\r\n\r\nstarted a new service to Rome through Singapore, while  China\r\n\r\nEastern Airlines has doubled its flights to Shanghai to 14  a\r\n\r\nweek  from seven a week.  In the next few months, Changi will\r\n\r\nwelcome  Australian Airlines, which is the new subsidiary  of\r\n\r\nQantas,  and it will be starting a new service to  Cairns  in\r\n\r\nQueensland.   And Swiss International, the new  airline  that\r\n\r\nreplaced Swissair, has also started operations from Changi to\r\n\r\nZurich.   Changi's air cargo network has also expanded,  with\r\n\r\nCargoLux  and  Northwest starting links to Budapest,  and  to\r\n\r\nCincinnati in the USA, respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new city links and services are part of our never-ending efforts to improve Singapore's connectivity.\r\n\r\nPresently,  58 scheduled airlines serve Singapore, connecting\r\n\r\nus to 139 city links in 50 countries.  This high connectivity\r\n\r\nis  a  key reason why 28 million passengers used Changi  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, while the prospects for the aviation sector are\r\n\r\nimproving,  we have to continue upgrading our facilities  and\r\n\r\nimproving  our  services,  in order  to  keep  ahead  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetition.  So, what will we do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will continue with our policy of enhancing our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to  cater  to the  ever-increasing  needs  of\r\n\r\nairlines and passengers.  When Terminal 3 (T3) opens  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  2006  or early 2007, we will have a state-of-the-art\r\n\r\nterminal  that will increase Changi's capacity by about  one-third.   The  other  two  existing  terminals  will  not   be\r\n\r\nneglected.    Expansion  works for T1 will  be  completed  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year,  and we will be  investing  some  $240\r\n\r\nmillion  after that to improve T2, to make sure that all  our\r\n\r\nfacilities are really up to scratch and are at the  forefront\r\n\r\nof service and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in building the new infrastructure, we are aware\r\n\r\nthat  we have to cater to the latest technologies that  might\r\n\r\ncome  along and, therefore, works are underway to ensure that\r\n\r\nour   runway  and  terminal  facilities  will  be   able   to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  new  Airbus  A380,  which  can  carry   555\r\n\r\npassengers,  and  which  should  be  the  largest   passenger\r\n\r\naircraft  in the world.  SIA and other airlines have  ordered\r\n\r\nthis  aircraft and they will be flying this aircraft  through\r\n\r\nSingapore  and,  therefore, we must be ready to  accept  this\r\n\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have also mentioned the need for Changi to\r\n\r\nbe  cost-effective and cost competitive.   We  have,  indeed,\r\n\r\nalways  been  conscious about the need to provide  value  for\r\n\r\nmoney to our airlines and to our passengers.  In fact, we  do\r\n\r\nthis  without demands being placed on us.  For example,  CAAS\r\n\r\nextended  the  off-Budget measures, such as a 10%  rebate  on\r\n\r\nlanding  fees,  15% rebates on office and warehouse  rentals,\r\n\r\nand  a  15% rebate for concessionaires until the end of  this\r\n\r\nyear. The rebates cost CAAS about $17.4 million.  But what is\r\n\r\nmore  important  is  that the rebates have  brought  Changi's\r\n\r\nlanding  fees close to 1981 levels, ie, what we were charging\r\n\r\n20 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS also has several schemes that enable new airlines,\r\n\r\nor  airlines that start new services, to enjoy heavy  rebates\r\n\r\non  landing  fees and grants for several years.  Since  their\r\n\r\nintroduction in 1998, about $7 million has been awarded under\r\n\r\nthese schemes to 18 airlines.  I can assure Members that CAAS\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  review  these  incentive  programmes  and\r\n\r\npartnership programmes with the airlines, and we will  tailor\r\n\r\nthem further to suit the needs of the individual airlines and\r\n\r\nanchor them here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have also expressed concerns about\r\n\r\nthe  pricing  policy of SIA and how it is forcing  passengers\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore to fly elsewhere to obtain better deals.  As I\r\n\r\nhave  told the House before, CAAS does not intervene  in  the\r\n\r\npricing policies of SIA or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  other airline that operates through Singapore.  Airlines\r\n\r\nare free to set their own airfares.  But what is important to\r\n\r\nnote  is  that the aviation sector in Singapore is very  open\r\n\r\nand  very  competitive, with multiple airlines  competing  on\r\n\r\nmany  of  the routes.  Air travellers can, therefore,  choose\r\n\r\nthe  airline that best suits their requirements in  terms  of\r\n\r\nservice,  price and flight times.  Many airlines offer  fares\r\n\r\nfor direct flights to popular destinations that are, in fact,\r\n\r\nmuch,  much  lower  than  SIA's.  With  such  attractive  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive choices, there is really no need for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto   transfer   at   other  airports,  en  route   to   their\r\n\r\ndestinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some examples. Let us say to\r\n\r\nBangkok.   There  are 11 airlines that fly  to  Bangkok  from\r\n\r\nChangi,  and the price of an economy class return ticket  can\r\n\r\nrange  from  only  $200  to  as  high  as  about  $400.   So,\r\n\r\npassengers  have  a  full range to choose  from.   Similarly,\r\n\r\npassengers  flying  to Jakarta can choose from  13  airlines,\r\n\r\nwith  ticket prices ranging from $580 at the high end, to  as\r\n\r\nlow as only $160.  So, tremendous choices are available.  And\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially  Singaporean  businessmen  who  are\r\n\r\nlooking to cut costs, should actually shop wisely.  They will\r\n\r\nbe rewarded if they do shop around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will continue to work with CAAS to\r\n\r\nattract  as  many  airlines as possible to  Changi,  so  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  have a wider range  of  choices  and  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay touched on the logistics area. He\r\n\r\nmentioned  the existence of trucking depots or dry depots  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  where trucks can then exchange their load  in  order\r\n\r\nnot  to  have  to return empty.  This concept is  very,  very\r\n\r\napplicable  to countries with large land mass,  because  then\r\n\r\nthe distances are huge, and that is why we see such dry ports\r\n\r\nor  land  depots in the USA, Europe and even in China.   They\r\n\r\nare  sprouting up in many parts of China.  The potential  for\r\n\r\nsuch  \"land  hubs\" in Singapore is not that good, because  we\r\n\r\nare too compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is merit in helping industry players\r\n\r\nbetter  deploy their assets as best as possible,  within  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and  between companies, as this will  then  help  to\r\n\r\nensure better asset utilisation and help to lower costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that, at present, there are two Vehicle\r\n\r\nScheduling  and  Tracking Systems (VSTS)  in  place  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  better  optimise their  truck  usage.   These  are\r\n\r\nprovided by Transnet and Sunray, and these systems are linked\r\n\r\nto  PSA's IT systems as well.  So, not only can they  use  it\r\n\r\nfor  their own usage, but they can link it to PSA,  so  that,\r\n\r\nfor  cargo  that is going through PSA, it helps to  make  the\r\n\r\ndata  exchange  seamless and electronic.  We will  definitely\r\n\r\nencourage more of such systems to be developed, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan help our companies better deploy their assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Have we achieved what  we\r\n\r\nspelt out in the paper?  Let us take a brief close look.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have expanded our MRT network to serve the heavy\r\n\r\ntransit corridors.  We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt the LRT system in Bukit Panjang.  We have improved  our\r\n\r\nroad  network system, linking the major parts of  the  island\r\n\r\nwith  expressways.  It seems, however, as  the  Chinese  say,\r\n\r\n\"lei  sheng  da, yu dian xiao\" - much said and  little  done.\r\n\r\nThose  projects  completed are also not perfect.  There  were\r\n\r\nbreaches  and  breakdowns.  Some  examples  were:   the  many\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  of  the  LRT system, the problems  with  the  MRT\r\n\r\ntrains,  cutting  down the frequency of the  MRT  service  to\r\n\r\nChangi Airport, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the authorities and agencies took\r\n\r\nimmediate  steps to address the problems when they  surfaced.\r\n\r\nBut could they have been prevented in the first place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has made changes to the vehicle\r\n\r\nregistration and tax system.  We can expect to see  that  car\r\n\r\nownership will rise and more vehicles will be on the roads in\r\n\r\nthe  future. What are LTA's plans to absorb this increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of vehicles?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport infrastructure is like the blood\r\n\r\ncirculation  system in our body.  It connects our  residents'\r\n\r\nhomes,  workplaces and places of recreation.  It must  remain\r\n\r\nhealthy  and free flowing so that our nation can grow.   What\r\n\r\nare  the Ministry's plans for the future development  of  our\r\n\r\nroads and transportation infrastructure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Ministry has announced its intention\r\n\r\nto  put  in  place a comprehensive Rail Transit System  (RTS)\r\n\r\nnetwork,  there has not been a firm commitment  on  the  date\r\n\r\nwhen the network will be in place. With the plans to increase\r\n\r\ncar  population  and with the fact that most  of  our  people\r\n\r\ntoday  have  to  spend  more  than  one  hour  taking  public\r\n\r\ntransport from home to the workplace, it is critical that the\r\n\r\nRTS network be expanded more expeditiously, so as to make the\r\n\r\npublic  transport an attractive alternative  to  the  private\r\n\r\ntransport.   When can we expect the RTS to link  up  all  our\r\n\r\nhousing  estates?  If the Ministry is unable to put in  place\r\n\r\nthe RTS network quickly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  should consider alternatives, such as maybe, the mini-bus\r\n\r\nscheme in Hong Kong to make the public transport in Singapore\r\n\r\nmore attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, in the latest Budget, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has reduced the duties and registration  fees  on\r\n\r\nbuying   cars   and   re-peg   the  Preferential   Additional\r\n\r\nRegistration  Fee (PARF) to the ARF component instead  of  to\r\n\r\nthe  OMV component.  The rationale was to shift the ownership\r\n\r\ncost to usage cost.  In adjusting this rate to peg ARF a  bit\r\n\r\nlower,  from  140% to 130% of the OMV and reduce  the  excise\r\n\r\nduty  by 11%, the total upfront savings on taxes on new  cars\r\n\r\nis  about 21% of the OMV.  This benefits new buyers, although\r\n\r\nI  hasten to add I am not sure how it will be negated by  the\r\n\r\nbidding on COE prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to more usage cost, as proposed, will mean\r\n\r\nthat  previous car owners are unduly penalised by  having  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  lower resale value of their cars because new  cars\r\n\r\nnow cost lower, because of the reduced cost, and have to bear\r\n\r\nthe  likely  increased usage cost as  well.   In  our  legacy\r\n\r\nstructure, the cost of owning a car has to be shared  between\r\n\r\nownership  and usage cost.  With the lowering of  the  excise\r\n\r\nduty  and  the ARF, I am afraid the Government is  signalling\r\n\r\nanother  round  of increase in ERP and usage cost,  including\r\n\r\nincreased  recovery rate for car parking.  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister can assure the House that even as he is now  relying\r\n\r\nmore on usage, he should be wary of letting more cars on  the\r\n\r\nroads  in  order  to tax them more as they crowd  the  roads.\r\n\r\nThere  is a trade-off between the pain on one-time high price\r\n\r\nof  purchase of a car versus the daily grind and pain of high\r\n\r\nERP  and  parking charges as more cars clog  the  roads  with\r\n\r\nlower ownership cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge him to be more cautious in dismantling the\r\n\r\ncurrent  parity, even as the carrot of lower upfront cost  is\r\n\r\ndangled.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> The Government uses\r\n\r\ntwo ways to control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncongestion  on  our  roads.   One  is  the  control  of   car\r\n\r\npopulation, and the other is to control their usage. We  have\r\n\r\nheard  that the Government is switching its emphasis  of  car\r\n\r\ncontrol  from  that of ownership to that  of  car  usage.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  whatever method the Government uses,  the  car\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Singapore shall be at  a  fairly  high  level\r\n\r\nbecause  motorcars  are  a good source  of  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone in this House, I would say, drives a car\r\n\r\nand  we  all know that our roads are not entirely congestion-free.   In fact, there are perpetual traffic jams in  certain\r\n\r\nof  our  roads.  Prominent examples that come to mind readily\r\n\r\nare  the  CTE towards Braddell Road and at Toa Payoh PIE  and\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon  Road.  I must say that  the  quota  system,\r\n\r\nimposed   by  the  Government,  supposedly  to  control   car\r\n\r\ncongestion  on  our  roads,  to me,  is  more  a  system  for\r\n\r\ncollecting revenue than the control of traffic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the so-called quota system, the cost of motorcars\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  has  escalated to levels where  the  costs  of\r\n\r\nmotorcars  in our country are the highest in the world.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment does not seem to be unduly concerned or worried of\r\n\r\nthe  high  car prices in Singapore. Why should it?  High  car\r\n\r\nprices  are good business for the Government.  The prices  of\r\n\r\nCOE  shall  be  higher when the car prices are high  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can rake in more money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to reduce taxes on motorcars. I\r\n\r\nsay to car owners, \"Do not be too elated\", for this reduction\r\n\r\nof  revenue, most likely, shall be made good by the increases\r\n\r\nin  revenue  from  car  usage.  More ERP  gantries  shall  be\r\n\r\nconstructed,  like  those which have already  gone  up  along\r\n\r\nDunearn Road, the cost of HDB car park lots and car park lots\r\n\r\noutside  HDB estates throughout the island shall  be  quickly\r\n\r\nincreased.   As far as I can see, car ownership in  Singapore\r\n\r\nshall never be cheap.  The Government has used motorcars as a\r\n\r\nphenomenal  revenue source and it shall continue  to  exploit\r\n\r\nthat  source  for  revenue  with more  creative  means.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has earned a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  money  from  motorcars and I think the Government  should\r\n\r\nplough  back  some  of those revenues to the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing ways:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government should build bicycle lanes in\r\n\r\nall  HDB  housing estates so that residents there can  safely\r\n\r\ncycle  in  their estates, whether to go shopping or to  visit\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, or whether to go for a swim, visit friends\r\n\r\nor whatever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in other countries like Denmark and Holland\r\n\r\nuse  the  humble  bicycle extensively as a  mode  of  travel.\r\n\r\nWhen  costs  of  motorcars remain so prohibitively  high  and\r\n\r\nbeyond the reach of the ordinary HDB heartlanders, I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the construction of safe bicycle lanes shall be  gladly\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  the people there.  I hope the Government  shall\r\n\r\nlook  into the possibility of constructing safe bicycle lanes\r\n\r\nin all HDB housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion I would like to make is the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should persuade bus companies to use low-capacity\r\n\r\nbuses to ply in private housing estates to pick up passengers\r\n\r\nto bring them to bus-stands or to the nearest MRT stations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, could you please finish your\r\n\r\nsecond suggestion quickly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have one more suggestion. I wish\r\n\r\nthat  the  park-and-ride idea be revived as  land  costs  are\r\n\r\nhigh.   The  Government can construct high-rise parking  lots\r\n\r\nnear  MRT  stations so that car owners need  not  drive  into\r\n\r\ntown.   They can park their motor vehicles in those high-rise\r\n\r\nparks  and ride the MRT or bus to town.  In this way, traffic\r\n\r\nproblems in town can be abated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Chairman, I am sure that\r\n\r\nfollowing the review on the car tax announced by the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  on  3rd  May, 2002, many car owners  and  potential\r\n\r\nbuyers will have to recalculate the cost of owning cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new tax on cars gave upfront reduction in terms\r\n\r\nof  excise duties and ARF.  As the time-line value of the car\r\n\r\nis  being moved from OMV to ARF, private car owners who scrap\r\n\r\ntheir cars before eight years can get more benefit.  But  the\r\n\r\nsame  cannot be said for taxis.  While it costs more  to  car\r\n\r\nowners  because  the  PARF is lower, it costs  more  to  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  when the burden of tax is shifted from ownership  to\r\n\r\nusage.  This means that the taxi drivers will have to pay for\r\n\r\nthe  increase of the ERP charges and GST.  On the  one  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  taxi drivers are concerned over the possible impact this\r\n\r\nmust  have  on  them, while on the other, the  commuters  are\r\n\r\nworried that they may have to pay more taxi fare for the  use\r\n\r\nof  taxis.  Could the Minister clarify that this is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the light of this development, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Ministry  whether there is an  overall  package  to\r\n\r\nminimise the cost to commuters using taxis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I share Mr Chay's concerns.\r\n\r\nWith  the  change in motor vehicle taxes, the PARF rebate  is\r\n\r\nnow  pegged  to the ARF actually paid on each car.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask if the Minister could clarify whether this  new\r\n\r\nway  of calculating the PARF rebate applies to existing motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  which  were registered before May  2002.   When  an\r\n\r\nexisting car registered before May 2002 is scrapped,  is  the\r\n\r\nowner  entitled to PARF rebate, calculated based on the car's\r\n\r\nOMV,  which was the case at the time when he bought the  car,\r\n\r\nor is it based on the car's ARF?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to reduce ARF and excise duties and extend\r\n\r\nERP  is  a double whammy for existing vehicle owners.   Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  having to bear a drop in the value of their cars,  they\r\n\r\nwould  also be subject to higher usage charges.  At least  43\r\n\r\ngantry  points  have been set up, the latest addition  is  at\r\n\r\nDunearn  Road.  What is the Ministry's plan for the  roll-out\r\n\r\nof  ERP and in doing so, will it take into consideration  its\r\n\r\nimpact on existing vehicle owners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Chairman, the car tax structure\r\n\r\nhas  been  shifted from the burden of tax from  ownership  to\r\n\r\nusage.

You can take them altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to take the 3 cuts\r\n\r\ntogether, but to tackle the 2nd one on bus services first  as\r\n\r\nthis is more important, in case I get \"guillotined\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as MPs, when we do our rounds of block visits and\r\n\r\nmeeting  residents,  one  issue  that  attracts  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ncomplaints  is bus service.  Currently, there  are  only  two\r\n\r\ncompanies, SBS and TIBS, providing scheduled bus services  in\r\n\r\nthe  housing  estates.  Whenever there are requests  for  new\r\n\r\nroutes,  the common reason for rejection by SBS is  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  route  would not be commercially viable.   But  who\r\n\r\ndetermines   that   the  proposed  service   would   not   be\r\n\r\ncommercially  viable?   It is SBS,  based  on  its  own,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps inefficient, or archaic method of operations.  Is the\r\n\r\nSBS way the best, or the perfect way of doing things?  Surely\r\n\r\nnot.   Surely it can be improved.  But how do we improve  it?\r\n\r\nCan someone else with a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidea, a different mode of operations or business model,  come\r\n\r\nup  with  a better way of running that service?  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure it can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to offer a few suggestions as a layman.\r\n\r\nFirst, why should feeder bus services be operated by SBS?   I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that the public bus service  be  restructured\r\n\r\ninto two or more smaller networks.  SBS can operate the trunk\r\n\r\nservices, and be like NOL, the main shipping liner calling on\r\n\r\nhub  ports  and  have  smaller vessels  feeding  to  it.   In\r\n\r\nshipping, it does not make commercial sense for a main  liner\r\n\r\nto  run  feeder  services.  Smaller  feeder  vessels  can  be\r\n\r\noperated by smaller operators who are more familiar with  the\r\n\r\nlocal  conditions.   This can be done without  much  loss  of\r\n\r\nefficiencies or integration.  In any case, there is not  such\r\n\r\na  high  degree  of  integration in the first  place  between\r\n\r\nfeeder,  trunk and MRT services.  It is not as if a passenger\r\n\r\ncan  time it so precisely to catch the 7.45 am feeder,  which\r\n\r\nwill bring him to the station to catch the 8.03 MRT train.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I have an RC Zone, whose residents have been\r\n\r\ncomplaining, and I have been complaining, for many years that\r\n\r\nthe  SBS  feeder  bus  service  for  that  area  is  bad  and\r\n\r\ninefficient.  At times they have to wait 15 minutes  for  the\r\n\r\nbus  to  arrive,  and then it goes on this  circuitous  route\r\n\r\nbefore  reaching the bus interchange.  There has been  little\r\n\r\nimprovement over the years.  The feeder bus fare is 65 cents.\r\n\r\nIf  you take a taxi from that zone to the bus interchange, it\r\n\r\ncosts  $3.   So, if five persons come together  and  share  a\r\n\r\ntaxi,  they  would  have  broken  even.   Of  course,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for them to get five persons together at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.   But  if you operate a mini-bus and make  small  loops\r\n\r\nbetween  the  interchange and the zone, picking up,  say,  10\r\n\r\npassengers at a time, I think you can make money.   The  math\r\n\r\nis  quite straightforward.  Taxis are considered expensive to\r\n\r\noperate.  But if a taxi can charge $3 per trip, and the mini-bus collects more passengers, it should do better.  Would not\r\n\r\nit  be  better  to have buses of a suitable size  and  making\r\n\r\nsmaller  loops, instead of a big bus making a long circuitous\r\n\r\nroute?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, SBS runs its services in a hub and spokes manner,\r\n\r\nthe  hubs being the bus interchanges and MRT stations.   This\r\n\r\nlooks  good on paper.  This assumes that every commuter wants\r\n\r\nto  take a trunk service or the MRT to get out of the estate.\r\n\r\nBut  how  about intra-town travel?  Could not a neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncentre  be  a hub?  Could not there be more mini-hubs  within\r\n\r\nthe estate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, SBS started intra-town feeder services that\r\n\r\nbasically  connect two feeder services together.  They  bring\r\n\r\ncommuters  from one end of the estate to the  centre  and  it\r\n\r\ngoes  on  to  the  other end of the estate.   Now,  how  many\r\n\r\npassengers actually need to go from one end of the estate  to\r\n\r\nthe  other end?  SBS told me, \"actually not many\".   I  think\r\n\r\nresidents  are more likely to want to travel to an  adjoining\r\n\r\nprecinct if there is something like a neighbourhood centre or\r\n\r\nschool there.  Sir, I think this goes to show that it is  not\r\n\r\none-size-fits-all and we need local operators  who  are  more\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with  the  conditions,  with  the  needs   of   the\r\n\r\nresidents, to be able to provide a better service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we reorganise feeder\r\n\r\nservices  into smaller geographical regional hubs  and  allow\r\n\r\nfor more competition so that new methods of running a service\r\n\r\nfor  that  area  can be implemented.  If an  entrepreneur  is\r\n\r\nconvinced that he can find lower cost solutions that can meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the commuters and is prepared to put his  money\r\n\r\nwhere  his  ideas are, why not let him try it?  If  we  worry\r\n\r\nthat  he  may  not  be  viable  and  fold  up,  thus  causing\r\n\r\ndisruption to commuters, should not the same worry also apply\r\n\r\nto electricity suppliers and telecommunication providers?  If\r\n\r\nwe  worry about him cherry-picking the profitable routes  and\r\n\r\nneglecting  the  less viable ones, then may  I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nmaybe  the incumbent operators can be given a call option  to\r\n\r\nbuy  over the route at a pre-determined valuation.  So if the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur takes the risk, proves that the route is viable,\r\n\r\nthe  commuters  would be happy and he would be  happy  to  be\r\n\r\nrewarded  for  the risk taken.  This is already happening  in\r\n\r\nother industries, where the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnimble small boys try it, prove that the idea works, and cash\r\n\r\nout by selling to the bigger boys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should liberalise and allow new players, with\r\n\r\ncreative  ways  of running a service to come in  to  compete.\r\n\r\nLiberalising  the public bus services can help raise  service\r\n\r\nstandards  and serve commuters better.  Maybe even Virgin  is\r\n\r\ninterested and wants to bundle with its mobile phones.   This\r\n\r\nwould be in line with the liberalisation of services in other\r\n\r\nsectors.  In today's economy, when virtually everything  from\r\n\r\nlegal services to telecommunications to banking, and even the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  basic  utilities, are opening  up  to  promote\r\n\r\ncompetition and consumer choice, I am not convinced that more\r\n\r\nplayers  cannot  be introduced to provide better  public  bus\r\n\r\nservices.   This  must  be  one  of  the  last  bastions   of\r\n\r\nprotectionism.  There is not even direct competition  between\r\n\r\nTIBS and SBS as they serve different routes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, MRT is providing\r\n\r\nan   excellent   service,  making  it  very  convenient   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to travel rapidly from one part of the island to\r\n\r\nanother.   However,  it  generates  some  problem  of   noise\r\n\r\npollution   too.

I  have  referred  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to the Ministry of Transport.  May I ask the Ministry\r\n\r\nwhether it has any plan to reduce the noise level and improve\r\n\r\non the situation.  Is there any regular monitoring and review\r\n\r\nto ensure that the noise level is within the permitted level,\r\n\r\nespecially when the trains travel within the housing estates?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask whether there will be an overall plan for\r\n\r\nour nation-wide public transportation system, upon completion\r\n\r\nof the North-East line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> The Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  LRT is designed to provide people from Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nand  Chua  Chua Kang a rapid and reliable means to access  to\r\n\r\nthe  MRT  service  in  Chua Chua Kang.   After  the  LRT  has\r\n\r\noperated for almost three years, one would wonder whether the\r\n\r\nLRT  is  reliable.  Based on a newspaper report that the  LRT\r\n\r\nservices had been interrupted 50 times in its less than three\r\n\r\nyears  of operation, it worked out to be one failure in every\r\n\r\nthree  weeks.  This is highly unacceptable and could  not  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   as   a   reliable  service.    It   has   caused\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the residents as they could not rely on  the\r\n\r\nLRT to get them to work and to school on time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent breakdowns imply that the LRT system\r\n\r\nselected  does not meet the objective of providing a reliable\r\n\r\nservice at a high commuter volume.  As far as reliability  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  unmanned system is not based on  well-tested\r\n\r\nand  proven  technology as otherwise it should  not  fail  so\r\n\r\noften.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, what are the actions\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry will take to ensure that the LRT would be  free\r\n\r\nfrom breakdowns in the future.  As we are building a new  LRT\r\n\r\nin  Sengkang,  is the new one going to be more reliable?   We\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  LRT  is  a  rapid link  from  the  place  of\r\n\r\npopulation  catchment to the MRT stations.  In no way  should\r\n\r\nthe  LRT play the role of internal feeder service because  of\r\n\r\nits   rigid   route.   From  my  understanding,   after   the\r\n\r\nreshuffling of the existing bus services and the introduction\r\n\r\nof  the LRT, I realise that the LRT built for Chua Chua  Kang\r\n\r\nand  Bukit Panjang has many shortcomings.  One, there  is  no\r\n\r\ncoordination  between the road design system, the  LRT  route\r\n\r\nand  the bus services, right from the beginning of the design\r\n\r\nstage.   Two,  the LRT tries to take in as many commuters  as\r\n\r\npossible,  even  though the LRT route  is  not  ideal  for  a\r\n\r\ncertain particular population catchment.  Three, the decision\r\n\r\nmakers   are  not  hesitant  in  sacrificing  the  commuters'\r\n\r\ninterest for the sake of increasing ridership of the LRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular reason given is LRT's viability and the\r\n\r\navoidance  of duplication.  A typical example is bus  service\r\n\r\n307  in  Chua Chu Kang.  Ever since it was withdrawn, it  has\r\n\r\ncaused  a  lot of problems for the people - shopping  centres\r\n\r\nlack  business,  people's style of travel has  been  changed,\r\n\r\npeople go less often to the park where they normally do their\r\n\r\nmorning  exercises,  and  they  do  not  patronise  our   six\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops  in  Teck  Whye Shopping Centre  anymore.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  it  has  caused a lot of discontent and  unhappiness\r\n\r\namong  the  people.   After two years of withdrawal  of  this\r\n\r\nfeeder  service,  I am happy to note that  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\neventually decided that they have to look after the  interest\r\n\r\nand  convenience of the people and reinstated bus service 307\r\n\r\njust last weekend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson learned from the social impact of the first\r\n\r\nLRT  system in my Constituency will be a very valuable lesson\r\n\r\nfor  the next LRT in Sengkang.  Will the Minister ensure that\r\n\r\nin  any  future LRT development, there is a good coordination\r\n\r\nbetween  the  road  network design, LRT  route  and  the  bus\r\n\r\nservice,  before any intention of building a  new  LRT?

I\r\n\r\nseek to disagree with him.  In fact, much has been done.  And\r\n\r\nmore  has  been done than what has been set out in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.   In  terms of the rail network, we expect to  have  a\r\n\r\nmuch  wider rail network than has been laid down in the White\r\n\r\nPaper.  It is going to be more than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo-and-a-half  times longer than what was  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper.   In terms of road building, we are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nahead of what was stated in the White Paper.  So, actually it\r\n\r\nis little said, much done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on the key point which most of the\r\n\r\nMembers  have spoken about, which is on the shift in the  car\r\n\r\npolicy towards more usage restraint measures, rather than  on\r\n\r\nownership cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership cost affects all car owners, regardless of how\r\n\r\nmuch  they drive and how much they actually add to  the  road\r\n\r\ncongestion.  Usage restraint measures are more focused,  more\r\n\r\nefficient  and more equitable.  Car owners pay  according  to\r\n\r\nwhat  they  use and how much they add to the road congestion.\r\n\r\nERP  has been found to be able to divert car traffic from the\r\n\r\ncongested  roads during peak period and shift the traffic  to\r\n\r\nthe  less  busy period.  So the shift to the usage  restraint\r\n\r\nmeasures   will  therefore  bring  about  a  more   effective\r\n\r\nutilisation of our limited roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay has asked that we be aware of the impact of\r\n\r\nhaving more cars on the roads because this will then increase\r\n\r\nthe usage cost.  We are indeed aware of that, which is why we\r\n\r\nare   introducing  the  shift  gradually  so  that  the   car\r\n\r\npopulation  will  still  be kept under  control  and  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to expand significantly.  The 5,000 COEs that we  are\r\n\r\nadding  should be seen in the context of the overall  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation.   We  have  a total vehicle population  of  about\r\n\r\n700,000 vehicles on the roads.  So the additional 5,000  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  adding will only add 0.7% to our overall population,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not think this will increase the congestion  very\r\n\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the MPs have asked about the expansion of the\r\n\r\nERP  system.   With regard to the expansion of ERP  coverage,\r\n\r\nLTA  had announced in May 1999 the Phase 2 expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nERP  system.   This will form a second ERP cordon  along  the\r\n\r\nouter  ring  roads.  Existing car owners have therefore  been\r\n\r\ngiven ample notice that the ERP coverage will be expanded  in\r\n\r\ndue course.  A total of seven gantries were implemented under\r\n\r\nphase 2A in September\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1999.   Gantries  at  the remaining 10-12 locations  will  be\r\n\r\nerected as and when traffic conditions warrant it, ie, it  is\r\n\r\na  congestion control and we will only implement ERP at those\r\n\r\nspots when the congestion on those spots warrants it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman mentioned that there are heavy traffic jams\r\n\r\nat certain roads - and I think Mr Chiam said the same thing - at  CTE  and Toa Payoh PIE interchange.  Based on our studies\r\n\r\nwhere  there are ERP gantries, the traffic along those  roads\r\n\r\nmay  be  heavy,  but they are still within the optimal  speed\r\n\r\nrange  established  by  LTA for the efficient  use  of  those\r\n\r\nroads, ie, they are above the speed of 45 kph.  I think where\r\n\r\nthe  roads  are  heavily  congested now  are  really  in  the\r\n\r\nevenings.  CTE is almost like a parking lot in some stretches\r\n\r\nand this is because we do not have ERP during those evenings.\r\n\r\nI  would like to inform Members that my Ministry and LTA  are\r\n\r\nnow  looking  seriously at how to relieve the  congestion  on\r\n\r\nthose  roads.   Where there is no scope  for  us  to  further\r\n\r\nexpand those roads, one alternative is to introduce ERP there\r\n\r\nin  the  evening  hours as well.  That would  help  to  shift\r\n\r\ntraffic to those roads that are not so congested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern about the impact on\r\n\r\nexisting  car owners when ERP is expanded, ie, when we  shift\r\n\r\nmore  to  usage restraint, the existing car owners  have  not\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  the lower upfront costs, and therefore  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  benefited from the change.  It is true that  these\r\n\r\nowners  did not benefit from the lower ownership costs.   But\r\n\r\nthey  will  still benefit when the road tax for all  cars  is\r\n\r\nreduced by about 20% from September this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as Members will recall, when ERP was introduced in\r\n\r\n1998,  the  Government had announced that  road  tax  rebates\r\n\r\nwould  be  given  for  a  period of five  years.   The  final\r\n\r\ninstalment  of the 5-year rebate package is due in  September\r\n\r\nthis  year.   I am happy to inform Members that  we  will  be\r\n\r\ngiving a road tax rebate of $100 per passenger car unit (PCU)\r\n\r\nthis  year.   This  rebate is the same  as  last  year's  and\r\n\r\ntogether with the coming road tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduction, this will help motorists adjust to the progressive\r\n\r\nshift to the usage restraint measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked about the PARF for cars registered before\r\n\r\nMay 2002.  I am happy to inform him that cars bought with pre-May 2002 COEs will enjoy the PARF rebate calculated based  on\r\n\r\nthe OMV.  This is only fair as they bought the COEs under the\r\n\r\nold ARF and PARF rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo and Mr Yatiman asked about our plans for\r\n\r\nupgrading  the  road network in view of the  growing  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation.  There are numerous road projects underway today.\r\n\r\nThese   projects   include  the  Braddell  Road/Bishan   Road\r\n\r\nInterchange,  PIE/Adam Road Interchange, upgrading  of  Upper\r\n\r\nBukit Timah Road, the Telok Blangah Semi Expressway, and  the\r\n\r\nCTE/Braddell  Road  Interchange,  which  will  also  help  to\r\n\r\nrelieve  the traffic on the CTE when all these are completed.\r\n\r\nAlso, the 12-km Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE), which is\r\n\r\na  very  important project, will be completed in 2007.   This\r\n\r\nproject, when completed, will also help to relieve a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthe  traffic from the CTE.  All these on-going projects  will\r\n\r\ncost  almost  $2  billion.  In addition, LTA will  embark  on\r\n\r\nseveral  road upgrading and development projects  worth  $570\r\n\r\nmillion over the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must also alert MPs that there is a limit to what\r\n\r\nwe  can  do,  because we have a limited  amount  of  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Already, roads take up 12%  of  our  total  land\r\n\r\narea,  and  this  is  the  same  amount  of  land  used   for\r\n\r\nresidential  purposes.   Going  forward,  we  will  have   to\r\n\r\nincreasingly rely on ERP to manage road congestion and ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our limited roads are used optimally.  But we all  need\r\n\r\nto  travel  for  one reason or another.  The Government  will\r\n\r\ntherefore ensure that commuters have an efficient alternative\r\n\r\nto  cars.  Our priority, therefore, is to continue to  expand\r\n\r\nthe  rail network, as this will be the backbone of our public\r\n\r\ntransport  system.   SMS Khaw Boon Wan  will  shortly  update\r\n\r\nMembers on the development of the rail network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to Mr Chiam's remarks. Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nwent  on  a very convoluted argument about car ownership  and\r\n\r\nrevenues.  With our limited land, I think even Mr Chiam  will\r\n\r\nagree, we have no choice but to control car ownership.  If he\r\n\r\nis able to give us a better alternative on how to control car\r\n\r\nownership without imposing a cost on the owners of  cars,  we\r\n\r\nwill be very happy to review his suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system we have for controlling of car ownership\r\n\r\nis  not  a  revenue-generating system.  Yes, we  do  generate\r\n\r\nrevenue from that, but that is not the primary interest.  The\r\n\r\nprimary  interest is to make sure that, firstly, we  have  an\r\n\r\nefficient  system  for transporting people around  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPrivate  cars is one element of that system.  But the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system is an even more important element  of  that\r\n\r\npolicy.   Having allowed the people to meet their aspirations\r\n\r\nto own cars, how do we make sure that our roads do not become\r\n\r\ngiant  parking lots that we see in many countries?  The  only\r\n\r\nway is to have congestion control which, in our case, is ERP.\r\n\r\nThe  ERP  has worked and we will continue to have to rely  on\r\n\r\nthe ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has made three suggestions. First, he brought\r\n\r\nup  the issue of people in Amsterdam using bicycles.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen to Amsterdam before and if I were living in a climate as\r\n\r\npleasant as Amsterdam, I will be very happy to ride a bicycle\r\n\r\nto  work  too.   But,  unfortunately,  the  reality  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  too hot a place to be riding  bicycles.   Yes,\r\n\r\npeople  do  ride bicycles for leisure but I think few  people\r\n\r\nwould want to ride to work and arrive at work sweating away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for bicycle lanes to be built in the HDB\r\n\r\nestates.  Sir, already we are so land short.  We are  already\r\n\r\nstruggling  to find spaces for parks, recreation  usage,  and\r\n\r\nresidential usage.  It would be very difficult for us to  put\r\n\r\naside  land  for  bicycle lanes.  In any  case,  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  during the day time hours, or during  most  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  other  than the peak hours in the morning and  evening,\r\n\r\nthe roads are actually quite sparsely used.  Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  very safe for people to be riding bicycles.  In fact,\r\n\r\nmany  of my senior citizens do ride bicycles around, and they\r\n\r\nhave  never  complained  to me about the  dangers  of  riding\r\n\r\nbicycles  around.   But they do not  use  it  as  a  form  of\r\n\r\ntransport, even though they have bicycles.  They use it as  a\r\n\r\nform  of  leisure and they ride it during the  cooler  hours,\r\n\r\nrather  than  at noon time when they have to go  out  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir lunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to persuade bus companies to use\r\n\r\nlow capacity buses for private estates.  Private estates are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, free to set up their own cooperative and hire a bus\r\n\r\nto  run  a  shuttle  service  from  the  estate  to  the  key\r\n\r\namenities.   In  fact, some condominiums  are  already  doing\r\n\r\nthat.   They  hire  a shuttle bus service that  shuttles  the\r\n\r\nresidents  to  either  the shopping centres  or  to  the  MRT\r\n\r\nstation.  So they are free to do that.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked us to expand the Park-and-Ride location.\r\n\r\nSir, we do have the Park-and-Ride locations.  The feedback we\r\n\r\nhave  is  that  they are still not well used.   If  there  is\r\n\r\nadditional demand, we will definitely be very happy  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  that.  So if Mr Chiam has got suggestions as  to  which\r\n\r\nPark-and-Ride carpark is overly utilised, do let us know,  we\r\n\r\nwill definitely look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yatiman talked about the impact on taxi drivers\r\n\r\nand  that  taxi drivers will not benefit and, in  fact,  they\r\n\r\nhave to pay more from the increased ERP.  It is true that  if\r\n\r\nthere are more ERP gantries, and if the ERP rates still go up\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the increased congestion, the taxi  drivers  may\r\n\r\nhave  to incur more expenditure on the ERP charges.  But this\r\n\r\nis  because  of  the  driving patterns of the  taxi  drivers.\r\n\r\nToday, taxi drivers tend to cruise around even when they  are\r\n\r\nempty   looking  for  passengers.   Increasingly,  the   taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies and taxi drivers will have to review their  driving\r\n\r\nhabits  and driving patterns.  They may have to rely more  on\r\n\r\nthe  call  service and wait for the passenger to  call  them,\r\n\r\nrather  than  cruise  around and pay for  the  increased  ERP\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to Mr Ong Kian Min's points on the\r\n\r\nfeeder  bus  service.  Sir, he proposed that  we  review  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of introducing competition into the  feeder  bus\r\n\r\nservice because quite often he gets complaints from residents\r\n\r\nthat  the  existing bus companies are unable  to  meet  their\r\n\r\nexpectations.  First, let me explain to Members a little  bit\r\n\r\nabout  the  public bus framework.  The current  bus  industry\r\n\r\nframework allows the basic bus operators, ie, SBS Transit and\r\n\r\nTIBS,  to achieve economies of scale.  This enables  them  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  affordable  fares, while  complying  with  the  bus\r\n\r\nservice standards set by the PTC.  The service standards  set\r\n\r\nby  PTC  include quality of buses, service frequency and  the\r\n\r\nmaximum number of transfers allowed on a particular trip.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, PTC imposes universal service\r\n\r\nobligations on the operators.  This means that they  have  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  comprehensive network of bus services,  including\r\n\r\nregular  bus  services,  to the less  populated  areas,  even\r\n\r\nthough these routes may not be profitable.  The bus operators\r\n\r\ntherefore  have to balance between the profitable  areas  and\r\n\r\nroutes  that  are not profitable.  People living in  sparsely\r\n\r\npopulated  areas,  or working in newly developed  areas,  are\r\n\r\ntherefore not penalised by having to pay higher fares, or  to\r\n\r\nbe  deprived of a public bus service.  But that does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  we do not see a role for private bus operators, and  we\r\n\r\ndo  not have private bus operators operating in certain niche\r\n\r\nareas and on the Scheme B services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bus routing is a very complicated business. There\r\n\r\nis  a  certain amount of ridership and the ridership  can  be\r\n\r\nbest  met by a certain deployment of bus resources.   If  you\r\n\r\ndeploy  more  bus resources, yes, the residents  will  get  a\r\n\r\nbetter  service.  But more bus resources with lower ridership\r\n\r\nper  bus  must  translate into a higher fare.  It  cannot  be\r\n\r\nhaving  fewer passengers and being able to charge a low  fare\r\n\r\nunless  the  fares  are being subsidised.   I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nprivate  bus  companies  are in the business  of  subsidising\r\n\r\nridership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, let me inform Members that we are\r\n\r\nopen  to  the  idea  of introducing competition  in  the  bus\r\n\r\nindustry.   As  Mr Ong has mentioned, one possibility  is  to\r\n\r\nallow private bus operators to operate a feeder service on  a\r\n\r\npilot  basis.   Unlike  trunk  routes,  feeder  services  are\r\n\r\nconfined to a certain geographical area and therefore  it  is\r\n\r\neasier to monitor them and to see how they are performing and\r\n\r\nto  get  feedback from the commuters.  I would  be  happy  to\r\n\r\ninvite  Members  who are not happy with their current  feeder\r\n\r\nbus  service, if they are willing, to volunteer  his  or  her\r\n\r\nestate  for this pilot project.  Just let me know and I  will\r\n\r\nask PTC to explore this option with him or her.  Perhaps,  Mr\r\n\r\nOng may be the first guinea pig for this project.  But please\r\n\r\nmake sure that our GRC members agree with you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have replied to all the questions. I\r\n\r\nwill  now  ask  SMS  Khaw to reply to the  questions  on  the\r\n\r\ntrains.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said that transport\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  should  be  free  flowing  like   the   blood\r\n\r\ncirculation  system.  I totally concur.  To achieve  such  an\r\n\r\noutcome  requires careful planning and sound  execution.   Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  is  again correct to say that an efficient Rapid Transit\r\n\r\nSystem  (RTS)  network is an important part of our  transport\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and its timely expansion is critical to making\r\n\r\npublic   transport  an  attractive  alternative  to   private\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our RTS network has reached 100 km. We are\r\n\r\nincreasing it by 50% to about 150 km by 2006.  This would  be\r\n\r\nachieved when we complete the following projects.  First, the\r\n\r\nNorth-East Line and the Sengkang LRT by the end of this year.\r\n\r\nSecond,  the Punggol LRT by the end of 2004.  And third,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  two  stages of Circle Line by 2006.  Beyond that,  our\r\n\r\nplan is to further expand the network by another 60% to about\r\n\r\n240 km by 2015.  By then, almost 90% of our City Centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  practically every job or employment would be within  400\r\n\r\nmetres  of  the  nearest MRT station.  This is  an  ambitious\r\n\r\nproject and requires tens of billions of dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ambitious plan of this kind will need to be executed\r\n\r\nin  phases.  First, we will complete the remaining stages  of\r\n\r\nCircle  Line  by  the year 2010, at the end of  this  decade.\r\n\r\nNext,  we  will  build several new lines  which  are  now  at\r\n\r\nvarious stages of planning.  They are, first, the Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nLine  to serve the Bukit Panjang, Upper Bukit Timah and Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  areas.  Second, the Eastern Region Line, to complement\r\n\r\nthe  existing  East-West Line in the East and,  finally,  the\r\n\r\nJurong Region Line, which is a light rail system to serve the\r\n\r\nresidents in Jurong as well as NTU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggested that we expedite the\r\n\r\nexpansion of the network.  We will do our best, provided  the\r\n\r\neconomy performs well.  We can realise these plans within the\r\n\r\nnext 15 years or earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the noise created by trains. As\r\n\r\nwe  build more rails and bring them closer to the people,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  avoid  some degree of noise pollution.  To  eliminate\r\n\r\nit, we have to stop building apartments near to the roads, or\r\n\r\nMRT  tracks.  In that case, then there will be no Guilin View\r\n\r\nin  Mr  Ang Mong Seng's constituency.  In Singapore, we  know\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  practical.  So we have  to  accept  that  some\r\n\r\napartment  blocks will be subjected to some noise  pollution.\r\n\r\nBut  we  must certainly do our best to cut down the level  of\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang spoke specifically about the noise level created\r\n\r\nby  MRT trains around the Bukit Gombak Station.  He wrote  to\r\n\r\nme.   I went there to take a look.  Within 200 metres of this\r\n\r\nstation,  there  is this Guilin View, a private  condominium,\r\n\r\nand  about  a dozen HDB blocks located near there.   We  have\r\n\r\ntried  to  cut  down  the noise levels  by  adopting  several\r\n\r\nmeasures.   First,  LTA sets very strict criteria  when  they\r\n\r\nselect trains so that the noise emission limit is subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain  guidelines  which are set by  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  Secondly, LTA designs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstructs  the  MRT  tracks to allow them  to  absorb  noise\r\n\r\nbetter.  That is why ballasted tracks on timber sleepers  are\r\n\r\nused  on  all our MRT viaducts.  Third, and this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  point,  we require our MRT operators  to  properly\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  trains and their tracks.   Good  maintenance\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that  noise levels are kept within  environment\r\n\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has taken noise measurements near Bukit Gombak\r\n\r\nStation, and those measurements indicate that the levels  are\r\n\r\nstill  within ENV's guidelines.  But, nevertheless,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to work with Mr Ang and his grassroots  leaders  to\r\n\r\nfind if there are better and practical solutions to bring the\r\n\r\nnoise level down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the frequent breakdowns of Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  LRT  when it first started.  Prof. Low stressed  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  us to minimise disruptions and make it a  reliable\r\n\r\nsystem.    I   totally   agree.    Breakdowns   inconvenience\r\n\r\ncommuters.  They are therefore not welcome.  That is  why  we\r\n\r\nimpose  a very high performance standard on the LRT operator.\r\n\r\nWhat  is our expectation?  We set a standard, what is  called\r\n\r\nservice  availability standard of at least 99.7%.  What  does\r\n\r\nthis  mean?  This means that everyday, over a daily operating\r\n\r\nperiod  of 20 hours, the maximum down time should not  exceed\r\n\r\nfour minutes.  This is a very demanding standard.  But it can\r\n\r\nbe  achieved.  Unfortunately, the Bukit Panjang LRT  did  not\r\n\r\nperform to standard initially.  During its first two years of\r\n\r\noperation, there were a number of occasions when it could not\r\n\r\nmeet  the  standard.  We share the frustration of the  Member\r\n\r\nand  his residents.  We had not sat on our palms.  A  lot  of\r\n\r\nefforts and resources were mobilised to first understand  the\r\n\r\nproblem and then to fix them.  We have made progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last September, for a continuous six months\r\n\r\nperiod,  the Bukit Panjang LRT system succeeded in  achieving\r\n\r\nthis  very high standard of 99.7%.  Unfortunately, this  very\r\n\r\ngood  record  was  interrupted by two incidents.   One,  last\r\n\r\nmonth, and a second one, this month.  Detailed investigations\r\n\r\nare ongoing but the preliminary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessment  confirms that the LRT system is  robust  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  is  functioning as designed.  On both  occasions,  the\r\n\r\nsystem  was  shut down automatically because  the  IT  system\r\n\r\ndetected  some faults which were eventually traced to  wiring\r\n\r\nproblems  at  the termination panels.  Given  an  experienced\r\n\r\noperational  and maintenance crew, the wiring faults  at  the\r\n\r\npanels  could  have  been identified and rectified  speedily.\r\n\r\nBut as it turned out, the operator took longer than necessary\r\n\r\nin   troubleshooting  the  faults,  resulting  in   prolonged\r\n\r\nshutdowns.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, therefore, continue to stress on staff training\r\n\r\nand retraining, and, particularly, in troubleshooting skills.\r\n\r\nTowards  this  end,  the operator, SLRT,  intends  to  engage\r\n\r\nBombardier  Transportation,  which  is  the  original  system\r\n\r\nsupplier,  to  help  in  its staff  training  programme.   No\r\n\r\nefforts will be spared by SLRT to ensure compliance with  the\r\n\r\n99.7% service standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, could the initial teething problems of the\r\n\r\nBP  LRT  system be prevented?  Yes.  What are the steps  that\r\n\r\ncan be taken to ensure that we avoided it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the LTA applies stringent criteria when selecting\r\n\r\na  system.   We  take  into account  the  experience  of  the\r\n\r\ndesigner  and  supplier, their reliability  and  their  track\r\n\r\nrecord.  This is done at the tender evaluation stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the selected system is put through rigorous\r\n\r\ntrials and tests before we put it into service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, involve the operator early. The LTA brings the\r\n\r\nappointed  operator on board at an early stage to be  closely\r\n\r\ninvolved in the system's development.  Such early involvement\r\n\r\nenhances  the  operator's knowledge and appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem, and it allows him to build up expertise, so that they\r\n\r\nare operationally ready before the start of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why did Bukit Panjang LRT system fail to perform as\r\n\r\nexpected?  First, on selection.  I think we did well.  The BP\r\n\r\nLRT system is a sound system, based on proven technology.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  mature system, has been running for more than 20 years\r\n\r\nin  other parts of the world and in many cities.  So, we  got\r\n\r\nan \"A\" there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we did put it through rigorous tests before we\r\n\r\nstarted commercial service although, on hindsight, perhaps we\r\n\r\ncould have allowed more time for trial running.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I think we did not do as well on the\r\n\r\nthird  step.  We did not appoint the operator, which is SLRT,\r\n\r\nearly  enough.  So, this is a very important lesson which  we\r\n\r\nhave  learnt,  and that is why for the North East  Line,  for\r\n\r\nSengkang  LRT and Punggol LRT, LTA has stepped up efforts  to\r\n\r\ninvolve  the operator, which will be SBS Transit, to  prepare\r\n\r\nit, to gear it up for its tasks ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also stressed the need to integrate the LRT\r\n\r\nwith  bus  routes.  I totally agree.  LRT and bus routes  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  components of a system.  They should synergise  to\r\n\r\nbring maximum benefits to the majority of residents, and that\r\n\r\nis  why each time a new LRT system is put in, we have  to  do\r\n\r\nsome rationalisation of existing bus routes.  It cannot be  a\r\n\r\nsimple  add-on.  But, in any rationalisation,  we  will  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the interests and concerns of  the  residents.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, the Member of Parliament plays a significant role,\r\n\r\nin  articulating the interests, feedback and  suggestions  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents.   This  was a role  which  Prof.  Low  played\r\n\r\nwonderfully.   And  in the recent general  election  results,\r\n\r\nthere was clear evidence of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government\r\n\r\nintroduced a rebate on green vehicles in January 2001  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three years to encourage the use of electric  and\r\n\r\nhybrid  cars in Singapore.  Is this measure effective?   Some\r\n\r\n67,000  cars were registered in Singapore last year,  out  of\r\n\r\nwhich only 13,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  less  than 0.2%, were green cars. There seems  to  be  no\r\n\r\nattraction  in this.  From the pricing point of  view,  after\r\n\r\nthe  rebate,  a  1.5 litre Toyota hybrid car costs  $134,488.\r\n\r\nThat  is  about 60% more than a Toyota Corolla  of  the  same\r\n\r\nengine  capacity, even after the rebate.  Another example  is\r\n\r\nthat  a  995  cc Honda hybrid car costs about $141,000.   For\r\n\r\nless  than  that price, a motorist can buy a 2.3 litre  Honda\r\n\r\nAccord, which is much bigger.  There is a huge difference  in\r\n\r\nprices.  How do we expect people to switch to green vehicles?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to look at the rebates again\r\n\r\nto  make  the  green cars more attractive to  buyers  and  to\r\n\r\nextend the 3-year rebate period.  In Sweden and Britain, they\r\n\r\nhave already provided bold incentives to encourage people  to\r\n\r\nswitch  to  green cars.  I think we should  go  in  the  same\r\n\r\ndirection.   We  can  further  lower  the  cost  differential\r\n\r\nbetween petrol-propelled vehicles and the green vehicles,  so\r\n\r\nthat, car for car, motorists can be drawn towards the greener\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, we saw the launch of Compressed Natural Gas\r\n\r\n(CNG)  buses  and taxis in Singapore.  I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Ministry of Transport has any plan to  introduce\r\n\r\nthe  CNG  vehicles in Singapore.  We should have  more  green\r\n\r\ncars  in  Singapore,  for  the sake  of  a  green  and  clean\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not present. Prof. Chin is\r\n\r\nalso not present.  Mr Khaw, do you want to reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang spoke in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  green vehicles.  He felt that  our  current  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  were inadequate and, as a result, we do  not  see\r\n\r\nmany  of them on our roads.  As pointed out by him, we  first\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  rebates  for hybrid  and  electric  cars  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  last year.  Then, in October 2001, he may  not  have\r\n\r\nnoticed, we extended the rebates to natural gas vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rebates comprise two components. First, a one-off\r\n\r\nrebate  to  reduce the upfront cost of purchase.   For  cars,\r\n\r\nthis is 20% of the Open Market Value (OMV).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  buses, the rebate is 5% of OMV, so, fully offsetting the\r\n\r\nARF of a bus, ie, green buses do not have to pay any ARF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a recurrent rebate on the annual road\r\n\r\ntax  payable.  For green vehicles, the rebates amount to  20%\r\n\r\nof  road tax.  For hybrid vehicles, a lower rebate of 10%  is\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these rebates lower the upfront and annual\r\n\r\nrunning  costs  of  green  vehicles,  and  reduce  the   cost\r\n\r\ndifferential  with  the conventional  vehicles.   With  these\r\n\r\nrebates  and the lower fuel costs, the total cost  of  owning\r\n\r\nand  using  green vehicles should be comparable  to  that  of\r\n\r\nconventional vehicles of equivalent OMV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the take-up rate is, indeed, very low. To-date,\r\n\r\nonly  15  green vehicles are on the road.  Why  is  this  so?\r\n\r\nObviously, there are many other factors, apart from cost  and\r\n\r\nrebates, which affect a motorist's decision on whether or not\r\n\r\nto  buy  a  green vehicle.  For example, how many models  are\r\n\r\navailable?   Is  it  a limited range?  In the  market  today,\r\n\r\nthere  are  only three models.  And, for some  of  the  young\r\n\r\nbuyers, what is the design like?  Is it cool?  And there  are\r\n\r\nother factors, eg, what is the subsequent maintenance support\r\n\r\nby the dealers?  All these are very important considerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all new technology, the rate of uptake would\r\n\r\ninitially  be  low, due to consumer inertia.   Green  vehicle\r\n\r\ntechnology is still new, and it will take time for it to earn\r\n\r\nconsumer  acceptance.  In fact, our low uptake  here  is  not\r\n\r\nunique.   In Japan and the US, their take-up rates  are  also\r\n\r\nvery low.  Last week, I read a Business Week article on green\r\n\r\ncars  which drew the conclusion that the technology is  still\r\n\r\nevolving, and they made the point that, realistically,  green\r\n\r\ncars  are  not going to be a big thing for another 10  years.\r\n\r\nSo  this  is a crucial point.  What does it mean?   It  means\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  remain a niche product for quite  some  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  economy  of  scale,  which  is  enjoyed   by\r\n\r\nconventional cars, will not benefit green cars.  So,  despite\r\n\r\nwhatever  rebates  we  may  give,  green  cars  will   remain\r\n\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like Mr Yeo, my Ministry supports the intent to\r\n\r\nreduce  car pollution, and we will continue to promote  green\r\n\r\nvehicles, and lean in their favour.  But, at the same time, I\r\n\r\ndo  not think we should go over-board and, certainly, not too\r\n\r\nmuch  ahead of consumer acceptance.  But, meanwhile, we  will\r\n\r\nmonitor the development, and we can always review the rebates\r\n\r\nat the end of next year.  We will then see if further changes\r\n\r\nwill be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, would you like to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister   and  his  Senior  Minister  of  State  for   their\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  answers,  and  beg  leave  to   withdraw   the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. 2, Dr Chong Weng Chiew.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code WA 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Yesterday, the Comfort Group announced\r\n\r\ntheir  results.

The high turnover is because they  have  more\r\n\r\ntaxis  available.  I understand that many people have already\r\n\r\nregistered themselves with CityCab, and are waiting for taxis\r\n\r\nto be allocated to them to drive. I believe  when people lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs, one of the options is to become a taxi driver.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, taxi drivers are subject to very great\r\n\r\npressure.  At the time of an economic slowdown, people  would\r\n\r\navoid taking taxis, and hence less passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, many unemployed people are switching  over\r\n\r\nto  taxi  driving.   So, the competition  for  passengers  is\r\n\r\ninvariably intensified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with this recent stepping up of the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  action  against non-conformity with  the  safety-belt\r\n\r\nrules,  the taxi drivers are the first to be victimised.   If\r\n\r\nthe rear-seat passengers do not belt up, the taxi driver will\r\n\r\nbe fined and penalised with three demerit points.  Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  taxi drivers can turn down passengers who refuse to belt\r\n\r\nup, but if the passengers complain to the authority about the\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver's refusal to service them, the taxi driver  will\r\n\r\nbe  penalised all the same.  If the taxi driver chalks up  24\r\n\r\ndemerit  points  within  two  years,  he  loses  his  driving\r\n\r\nlicence,  and consequently, his job. What if he is  the  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner of the family. Many are!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, these taxi drivers will complain\r\n\r\nand  seek the help of the MPs.  Of course, we cannot do  very\r\n\r\nmuch  to  help them.  Mr Chairman, I would like to  make  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Traffic Police could be more sympathetic and\r\n\r\nlenient towards the taxi drivers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for taxi drivers who have accumulated 24\r\n\r\ndemerit  points within two years owing to the fault of  their\r\n\r\npassengers,  they  should  be  given  an  extra  six  points.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, these six points may be for a period of six  months.\r\n\r\nIn  this way, taxi drivers will not be penalised unduly, just\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the   non-cooperation  of  some   unreasonable\r\n\r\npassengers.   These are special circumstances  which  warrant\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, the in-vehicle unit was\r\n\r\nintroduced into our cars with the implementation of  the  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem  some  years back.  Since then, there have  been  many\r\n\r\ncases  of  thieves breaking into vehicles to steal  the  cash\r\n\r\ncards that were exposed to view.  I would like to ask whether\r\n\r\nit is time, after all these years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor an upgrade model to be designed and introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Chong Weng Chiew for\r\n\r\nhis  feedback on the effects of the current economic slowdown\r\n\r\non taxi drivers, and he asked if we could assist them in some\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic downturn affects everybody, so taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  are  not exempted.  I have looked at their  earnings\r\n\r\ndata  and I notice that their average earnings for last  year\r\n\r\nhave indeed come down by 10% in the second half, compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  first half, something like from $2,300 per month on  one\r\n\r\nshift  operation  to about $2,100.  But there  are  signs  of\r\n\r\nrecovery.   This year's data, in fact, show steady increases,\r\n\r\nmonth by month, in their earnings.  Their average earnings in\r\n\r\nthe  first  few  months of this year, $2,500  for  one  shift\r\n\r\noperation,  is  now  much higher than the average  of  $2,150\r\n\r\nrecorded  in  the last quarter of last year.  This  trend,  I\r\n\r\nthink, should continue as the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared to other workers, taxi drivers have done\r\n\r\nmuch  better.  That is why, as Dr Chong noticed, there  is  a\r\n\r\nlong queue outside waiting to join this profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is alive to the economic hardship of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans during the current recession.  That  is  why  we\r\n\r\nhave  implemented  various schemes to help Singaporeans  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the hard times -  New Singapore Shares, rebates on  HDB\r\n\r\nservice  and  conservancy  charges, utilities  rebates,  etc.\r\n\r\nMost taxi drivers are able to benefit from such schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong mentioned the safety belt problem experienced\r\n\r\nby  taxi  drivers.  We have checked with the  Traffic  Police\r\n\r\nbecause  this is enforced by them.  Traffic Police said  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  encounter much problem with taxi  drivers  and\r\n\r\ntheir passengers during enforcement.  But certainly, we  will\r\n\r\ntake a sympathetic approach, as suggested by Dr Chong, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindeed taxi drivers have uncooperative passengers.

In  fact, by the end of this year, the  LRT  and  MRT\r\n\r\nwould be ready and my residents would enjoy the option  of  a\r\n\r\nsky route out of Sengkang Town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Assoc. Prof. Low has expressed earlier on,\r\n\r\nthe  experiences of LRT riders have been less than  heavenly.\r\n\r\nThe much publicised breakdowns and accidents have caused much\r\n\r\nworry  among my residents and I am pleased to say that  I  am\r\n\r\nvery  happy with Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan's\r\n\r\nreply on that.  I would like to ask if there are any specific\r\n\r\nmeasures  that are taken to ensure the safety and the  smooth\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the LRT in Sengkang in particular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I also urge that the rationalisation of the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system, especially since the operator  this\r\n\r\ntime  round  is  SBS  Transit, be slower to  implement  their\r\n\r\nplans, to rationalise the entire system, to reduce the feeder\r\n\r\nservice and trunk service.  Perhaps, it could be put on  hold\r\n\r\nuntil  there  is  some  certainty  that  the  LRT  is  indeed\r\n\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the development in the Sengkang Town has been\r\n\r\nimpressive, the same cannot be said of the road and transport\r\n\r\ndevelopment  across the Tampines Expressway (TPE).   Here,  I\r\n\r\nrefer to Punggol 21.  While Punggol 21 has been heralded as a\r\n\r\nmodel town, residents there have been battling long jams in a\r\n\r\nless  than good public transport system.  In fact,  the  very\r\n\r\nsame  old Punggol Road remains the only link that Punggol  21\r\n\r\nresidents  have to the rest of Singapore.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nshow a photograph here that was given to me by a resident  of\r\n\r\nmine.   He  claims that he would need at least half  an  hour\r\n\r\njust  to move a few hundred metres to get out of Punggol Road\r\n\r\ninto  Tampines  Expressway.  I quote him, \"The  situation  is\r\n\r\ngetting  worse over the months as more Punggol residents  are\r\n\r\nmoving  into  their new homes.  It is beyond my understanding\r\n\r\nhow  a major town like Punggol can have only one road out  to\r\n\r\nthe  rest of Singapore.\"  In addition, he said, \"Imagine what\r\n\r\nwould happen if a major traffic accident closes Punggol Road.\r\n\r\nTens  of thousands of Punggol residents would not be able  to\r\n\r\nleave or return to their beloved home.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, Punggol North, while about 5,000 of\r\n\r\nmy Sengkang households would enjoy the convenience of the LRT\r\n\r\nat  the  end of this year, my 6,365 Punggol 21 residents  and\r\n\r\ntwo  schools in Punggol 21 will have to make do with only one\r\n\r\ntrunk  service, which is Service No. 83.  Meanwhile,  as  the\r\n\r\nLRT is being built, dual carriageways are converted to single\r\n\r\nlanes, and public transport operators like SBS Transit,  have\r\n\r\nclaimed that both the LRT and HDB developments in Punggol  21\r\n\r\nhave  caused some of the roads to become unusable.  As  such,\r\n\r\nthey  too have been reluctant to bring in more service routes\r\n\r\nto serve the population heartland of Punggol 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a growing problem as Punggol 21 is a fast-growing town. In addition, I have one good news and one bad\r\n\r\nnews.   The good news is, together with the North-East  line,\r\n\r\nPunggol  MRT station will be ready by the end of  this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  bad news is, it is surrounded by vacant land at the west\r\n\r\nside of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPunggol Road, while the population centre is located  on  the\r\n\r\neast  side of Punggol Road.  To make things worse, the  other\r\n\r\ntwo  long distance service routes that ply along Punggol have\r\n\r\nfrequently  rejected the residents' call  to  turn  into  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  Punggol 21 estate because they have  engineered  the\r\n\r\nroads  to  go and serve the future population around  Punggol\r\n\r\nMRT station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry would look into hastening the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the LRT in Punggol 21.  I have confidence that\r\n\r\nwith the new testings and the measures that have been put  in\r\n\r\nplace, this LRT will be different.  Of course, it is left  to\r\n\r\nbe  seen.  In addition, I would also hope that there will  be\r\n\r\nan  increase in the number of exit routes from Punggol 21 and\r\n\r\nan overall improvement in the transport system in Punggol 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my residents are eagerly awaiting the new\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, since the Bukit Panjang LRT was launched in\r\n\r\n1999,  it  has  encountered a lot  of  problems.  The  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State has already explained why these  problems\r\n\r\noccurred.  But these problems have yet to be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a number of bus service routes have been\r\n\r\nwithdrawn in Bukit Panjang,  and the residents there have  to\r\n\r\nrely  more  on  the  LRT  service.  As  such,   the  frequent\r\n\r\ninterruptions of the LRT service have caused them  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble and inconvenience.  Students who have to go to school\r\n\r\nby  LRT will be late, workers depending on LRT to go to  work\r\n\r\nwill  be late and, worst of all, those who have  examinations\r\n\r\nto  take  will lose precious time when they turn up late  for\r\n\r\nthe papers.   This is certainly cause for concern.  If we  do\r\n\r\nnot  take immediate steps to rectify the situation, very soon\r\n\r\npeople  will  lose confidence in LRT, and  the  LRT  will  be\r\n\r\ndeemed to be an unreliable form of transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Senior State of Minister has\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that the Bukit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanjang  LRT  service has not been performing satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nBut  I would like to ask the Land Transport Authority whether\r\n\r\nit has got any plan to improve the LRT  service.  I know that\r\n\r\nat  the moment, there is some fine or penalty imposed on  the\r\n\r\nservice provider if their service is not up to the mark.  But\r\n\r\nsuch  penalty  does not help ease the problem  faced  by  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  I know that the operator does provide  a  back-up\r\n\r\nshuttle bus every time there is a breakdown. This is good but\r\n\r\nnot  entirely satisfactory. It is no replacement for reliable\r\n\r\nand efficient service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to suggest to the Minister or\r\n\r\nthe  Senior  Minister  of State that  unless  and  until  the\r\n\r\noperator  is able to provide a reliable service, regular  bus\r\n\r\nservices should be restored to service the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, should there be a major disruption to the LRT\r\n\r\nservice   in  future,   the  operator  should  be  asked   to\r\n\r\ncompensate the commuters, say, by providing free rides for  a\r\n\r\nweek, or even for a month. In this way, more pressure will be\r\n\r\nexerted on the service operator to improve their services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would suggest that if the operator is unable\r\n\r\nto  resolve  the problem, and frequent disruptions  continue,\r\n\r\nthe  operator should be replaced if they are unable to comply\r\n\r\nwith  the  requirement  to  rectify  the  problem  within   a\r\n\r\nprescribed period of time. If there are more interruptions, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  terminate their contract  and  get  a  new\r\n\r\nservice provider to replace them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I have noted Mr Gan Kim Yong's\r\n\r\nsuggestions on the Bukit Panjang LRT problem.  As I explained\r\n\r\nearlier, let us have some confidence.  The period of teething\r\n\r\nproblems is over and the last six months' record gave us that\r\n\r\nconfidence  that they have been able, continuously,  for  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  to achieve that 99.7%, which is a very high  service\r\n\r\nstandard despite the last two incidents a few weeks ago.  But\r\n\r\nthose  two  incidents merely confirm that  there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong with the system.  This is not rocket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscience.  LRT has been around for decades.  Like all systems,\r\n\r\nit requires to be properly maintained.  You can have the best\r\n\r\nof  systems,  but  if it is not maintained, then  it  creates\r\n\r\nproblems.  Having identified that this is the problem, and  I\r\n\r\nthink that is the efforts the operator is committed to do, we\r\n\r\nwill  make sure that the operator delivers on this  one.   It\r\n\r\ncan  be  done.   It  has  been proven for  six  months  since\r\n\r\nSeptember  last year, and I see no reason why  it  could  not\r\n\r\ncontinue that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, I can reassure Miss Penny Low that the\r\n\r\nproblems  of Bukit Panjang LRT of the past will be  contained\r\n\r\nin the history book there. It will not spill over to Sengkang\r\n\r\nor Punggol.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point about Punggol roads and so on, and the\r\n\r\nvarious  possibilities, I must confess I am not too  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the Punggol area.  The last time I went there was  many\r\n\r\nyears ago.  But I took her feedback, I have to see what  does\r\n\r\nit  mean.  But she did talk about the gap period between  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the Punggol MRT station and when the LRT  opens,\r\n\r\nand  there would be a need for service to be delivered during\r\n\r\nthat period, and this is something that we will sort out with\r\n\r\nthe operator of the MRT which happens to be SBS Transit.

This assurance  was\r\n\r\ntimely  because  there  have been  many  discussions  on  the\r\n\r\npossible  changes to the CPF system and such discussions  can\r\n\r\nbe  easily misunderstood, if not seen in the full context  of\r\n\r\nthe discussions and consultations.  I would like to raise the\r\n\r\nfollowing  concerns  based on feedback I have  received  from\r\n\r\ndiscussions with union members and leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF Minimum Sum. The Minimum Sum helps CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  set  aside sufficient savings to  support  a  modest\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living  after retirement and  enables  them  to\r\n\r\nremain  self-reliant.  I would like to know how, and on  what\r\n\r\nbasis,  does  the  CPF Board determine the  adequacy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.   Based  on  the current  CPF  Minimum  Sum  of\r\n\r\n$70,000,  a CPF member would have $537 monthly from  age  62.\r\n\r\nIs  this  sum adequate?  One concern is that the sum will  be\r\n\r\nmuch  lower  if a member pledges part of the Minimum  Sum  in\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, because of the CPF system, we have one of the\r\n\r\nhighest  saving  rates  in the world.   Yet  many  are  still\r\n\r\nworried that they do not have enough cash for retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently,  many  have  raised the concern  that  one  of  the\r\n\r\npossible  causes  of this is because CPF members  invest  too\r\n\r\nheavily in property.  They become asset rich, but cash  poor.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  was  also recently an  analyst's  report  in\r\n\r\nBusiness Times on 1st of May that there is no over-investment\r\n\r\nin housing.  I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower for\r\n\r\nits  assessment.  Does the present system lead  to  an  over-consumption or over-investment in property?  If this  is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  then  should the Government review our housing  policy\r\n\r\nand   consider  granting  Singaporeans  with  other   housing\r\n\r\noptions, such as rental flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea hotly debated, in public and the media, is\r\n\r\nto  have  a lower CPF contribution rate for older workers  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  remain  competitive.  I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower for its assessment of  the  situation.\r\n\r\nShould  the  CPF contribution rate be cut for older  workers,\r\n\r\nwhat  will  be the impact?  Can the Ministry share  with  the\r\n\r\nHouse   the  different  extent  of  impact  should  the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate be lowered at various rates for workers  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  age  groups, for example,  40,  45  and  50?   For\r\n\r\nexample, should CPF contribution rate be reduced for  workers\r\n\r\nabove  40,  45  or 50 years old, how many of them  will  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties servicing their housing mortgages?   Would  they\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  save enough CPF for their old age  and  medical\r\n\r\nneeds?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF is fundamentally for old age, medical expenses\r\n\r\nand  basic  housing.  We have to continue this system  around\r\n\r\nthese  core  objectives.  We have to be extremely careful  in\r\n\r\nsuggesting changes to such a system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, is too much CPF\r\n\r\nmoney  tied  to housing, and not enough cash for  retirement?\r\n\r\nThis  was  raised by Minister Lim Boon Heng, and this  kicked\r\n\r\noff   a  debate  among  Singaporeans  who  are  worried  that\r\n\r\nsomething is going to happen to their property, their  prized\r\n\r\nasset.   But  is  this true or not?  Too much  CPF  money  in\r\n\r\nhousing?  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness  Times and New Paper carried a report by  CapitaLand\r\n\r\nto  show otherwise.  They say, \"No such thing.  Only 25%  for\r\n\r\npublic  housing and 15% for private housing.\"  Who is  right?\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  want to know.  So in the New  Paper,  Dr  Money\r\n\r\nasked  CPF,  \"Is this true?\"  CPF kept silent at  first,  but\r\n\r\nwhen  they  were  pressed, they said they had  no  such  data\r\n\r\navailable.  This is all in the New Paper dated 6th May, 2002.\r\n\r\nOf  course, I know CapitaLand's vested interest.  But  surely\r\n\r\nCPF should come out and challenge the report.  But apparently\r\n\r\nit did not, or I could have missed it as I was away.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could provide the answers.  Is  too  much  CPF\r\n\r\nmoney in housing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later Labour Chief, Lim Boon Heng, went further and\r\n\r\nfloated  the possible 40 years and above CPF cut kite.   This\r\n\r\nwas echoed by the Minister for Manpower, Lee Boon Yang's call\r\n\r\nto study CPF cut for those above 40 years seriously.  I quote\r\n\r\nhim.   He  was concerned by the over-priced older workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  market.   When both Ministers concur, one Labour  Chief,\r\n\r\nand  one Manpower Chief, then Singaporeans better sit up  and\r\n\r\nlisten  carefully.  They had better go back quickly  and  re-examine  their  financial commitments to  their  home,  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  education,  their  mortgages  and  their   loans,\r\n\r\nbecause it would probably turn out to be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I listened to DPM and Finance Minister Lee\r\n\r\nHsien Loong's strong commitment to restoring the CPF to  40%,\r\n\r\nat the last debate, and I presume restoration also applies to\r\n\r\nthe  40 years and above, I wonder how Singaporeans will feel.\r\n\r\nThis time, the talk is restoration, and not cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many conflicting messages for the employer and\r\n\r\nemployee.  When you talk about 40% restoration, employers sit\r\n\r\nup and look at the bottom line, but employees are happy.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  you tell employees that when you reach 40 years,  their\r\n\r\nCPF would be reduced, they are going to be more than sad.  So\r\n\r\nif  you  float so many kites, you better bring all the  kites\r\n\r\ndown  soon and ease the anxiety of those concerned.  We  must\r\n\r\nremember,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  deciding on this CPF change, that at age 40 and  above,\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans  are  at  the height  of  their  financial\r\n\r\ncommitment - at their peak.  Remembe, at this age group,  the\r\n\r\nchildren  have  grown  up.  They are  either  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nsecondary school, in JC or in the university.  They are  also\r\n\r\ncommitted to their mortgages, insurance, and loan repayments,\r\n\r\nand  many must have planned to settle, or hope to settle, all\r\n\r\nthese before they retire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower Minister's reason for support of this idea is\r\n\r\nhis  concern  that  Singapore's seniority-based  wage  system\r\n\r\ncould have over-priced older workers in the market, that  has\r\n\r\nbecome  more demanding, and where high-skilled and innovative\r\n\r\nworkforce  is  key to the country's prosperity,  and  changes\r\n\r\nmust  be made, including CPF, to be in line with new economic\r\n\r\nchanges.  So said the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so sure which category of the labour workforce\r\n\r\nhas many older over-priced workers.  I have no data.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  can  enlighten the House  on  this.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  not to hurry with this because of the low morale  of\r\n\r\nmany workers in the present downturn.  Perhaps, since we have\r\n\r\nmade  a  commitment to the present workforce, on  their  CPF,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  first joined the labour market, we  should  start\r\n\r\nthis,  if  we  have  so  decided,  with  those  entering  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  for the first time.  I think acceptance  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter  as they would know how to plan with the new  changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, whatever CPF changes you want to do, we must bear in\r\n\r\nmind  the  very  fundamental objective of our  CPF,  ie,  for\r\n\r\nhousing, health and retirement.  You can refine this, but  do\r\n\r\nnot  change this too much.  As Matthias Yao said, and I fully\r\n\r\nagree  with  him, stick to our three fundamentals -  housing,\r\n\r\nmedical and retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I filed this as a $10 cut on a\r\n\r\nmatter of detail, but it has been elevated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is a simple one. When an employer is\r\n\r\nlate in paying the employee's contribution, the CPF Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges  interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the  amount\r\n\r\noutstanding from the due date until the payment is made.  Who\r\n\r\nshould be entitled to this interest which, at the rate of 18%\r\n\r\nper  annum,  is quite close to the exorbitant 24% charged  by\r\n\r\ncredit  card  companies?  Should it not be paid over  to  the\r\n\r\nemployee,  who, after all, is bearing the risk of  not  being\r\n\r\npaid the CPF contributions, which, in some cases, can add  up\r\n\r\nto a few months' worth, if his employer becomes insolvent and\r\n\r\ngoes under?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to request that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Manpower consider the use of the Medisave  part\r\n\r\nof  CPF for the purchase of portable medical insurance (PMI).\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  allow  employees to use  the  Medisave  to  buy\r\n\r\nindividual portable medical care products to cover  illnesses\r\n\r\nbecause  their employers are not providing for this  type  of\r\n\r\nmedical coverage, while they are still working, and also when\r\n\r\nthey are in-between jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PMI can help to ensure guaranteed long-term\r\n\r\ncoverage for the employees when they are in-between jobs  and\r\n\r\nin  retirement, and to ensure that the accepted coverage will\r\n\r\nnot be cancelled for subsequent ill-health, provided premiums\r\n\r\nare  paid.   I  would  like to augment my  request  with  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Medical expenditure, especially for old age, is the\r\n\r\nconcern of many Singaporeans.  They are always worried  about\r\n\r\nfalling  sick  and  having to end up incurring  unmanageable,\r\n\r\nhuge  hospital bills.  Many fear that the $26,000 savings  in\r\n\r\ntheir   Medisave   may  not  be  enough  should   they   need\r\n\r\nhospitalisation and surgery, when they are no more  employed,\r\n\r\nor become unemployed.  Many people also fear running the risk\r\n\r\nof financial hardship in the end as medical treatment becomes\r\n\r\nmore expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Many want the peace of mind by ensuring for better\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  and surgical coverage as MediShield  is  for\r\n\r\nthe masses, and the benefits are limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Help risk pooling through insurance, a risk-transfer mechanism, is a better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmethod than just depending on the Medisave alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The use of Medisave to purchase medical insurance\r\n\r\nwill  stress  the principle of individual responsibility  for\r\n\r\none's  own healthcare needs.  It also encourages Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  better  plan  and save when they are  younger.   This  is\r\n\r\nbetter than to just depend on Medisave alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Portable medical hospitalisation and surgical cover\r\n\r\nwill  take care of the subscribers in their old age and  they\r\n\r\nneed  only  pay  low premiums in their younger working  days.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly better than to depend solely on the savings\r\n\r\nin their Medisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) There should not be any fear of encouraging the\r\n\r\nbuffet-syndrome, or of driving up healthcare cost, as long as\r\n\r\nthey  are accredited insurance companies and carry co-payment\r\n\r\nand deductible elements in their policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Lastly, there should not be fear of unrestricted\r\n\r\nmedical and insurance schemes using Medisave as long as there\r\n\r\nis  a mechanism in place that prevents frivolous premiums and\r\n\r\ncoverage by requiring the insured to pay any difference  with\r\n\r\ncash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister for Manpower whether more\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies can be accredited for usage of  Medisave\r\n\r\nfrom  the  present three, so that Singaporeans can have  more\r\n\r\noptions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, my points have\r\n\r\nbeen raised and so I will not speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Like my colleagues\r\n\r\nbefore  me, I also know from feedback that many Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  those above 40 years, are very apprehensive  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  Government raised concerns that Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nputting  too  much CPF money into housing, and  subsequently,\r\n\r\nalso suggested that CPF contribution rates for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose above 40 years may have to be reduced to make them more\r\n\r\nemployable.   This is despite the assurances that  have  been\r\n\r\nsubsequently given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus good that the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nTrade  and  Industry has said that changes to the CPF  system\r\n\r\nwill  be  announced  next  month.   This  will  put  to  rest\r\n\r\nunhelpful speculation and uncertainty.  However, I would like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister, if his Ministry, together with the ERC's\r\n\r\nSub-Committee on CPF, could endeavour to seek the views of  a\r\n\r\nwide  cross-section  of  the  community  and  comprehensively\r\n\r\nassess  the  impact of the proposed changes before finalising\r\n\r\nand  announcing  the proposals.  This is because  the  issues\r\n\r\ninvolved  are complex and changing the CPF rates may  not  be\r\n\r\nthe only, or the best, way to resolve the problems.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many Singaporeans may now realise and agree that\r\n\r\ntoo much CPF money has been ploughed into housing, they worry\r\n\r\nthat any reduction in the amount of CPF that can be used  for\r\n\r\nhousing  will  impact  on  their  ability  to  service  their\r\n\r\noutstanding mortgages.  This is in addition to the fact  that\r\n\r\nmany have suffered pay cuts, which have yet to be restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting employers' CPF contribution rate for those above\r\n\r\n40  but below 55 is an even greater cause for concern as many\r\n\r\nof them still have heavy financial liabilities.  In fact, the\r\n\r\n40s  are also likely to be the years when housing consumption\r\n\r\nis  at  its  maximum in the family life cycle, and hence  any\r\n\r\ntinkering with the CPF would impact them most severely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for this group of workers who are\r\n\r\nsupposedly in the prime of their working lives, cutting their\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution  is  viewed  by  many   as   an\r\n\r\nindictment of their economic worth.  Many experts  have  also\r\n\r\nexpressed doubt that this would spur employers to engage more\r\n\r\nolder  workers since the key issue with most of these  people\r\n\r\nwho have lost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  is that they suffer from outdated  skills.   For\r\n\r\nthis  category  of workers, it would be better  to  focus  on\r\n\r\nskills upgrading and job retraining and changing the mindsets\r\n\r\nof both the employers and employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister for Finance has announced that the\r\n\r\nCPF  rate will eventually be restored to 40%, may I therefore\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  one  way to start mitigating  the  problem  of\r\n\r\ninadequate   retirement  savings   would   be   to   consider\r\n\r\nchannelling the yet to be restored remaining 4% of employers'\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the Special Account, leaving  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount intact when the rate is restored to 40%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Minimum Sum could also be increased in\r\n\r\nthe  future beyond the targeted $80,000 to keep pace with the\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, there appears to be a problem and we should\r\n\r\nfix  it.   However, we should avoid breaking a host of  other\r\n\r\nthings in the process.  I would thus again like to appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to carefully consider the ramifications of  any\r\n\r\nproposed  changes  to the CPF, as instead  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nDream,  many Singaporeans are now nervous about the  prospect\r\n\r\nof a possible Singapore Nightmare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the heady asset enhancement days in the early\r\n\r\n1990s, many Singaporeans then believed that they would become\r\n\r\nasset rich and cash rich.  Since then, many Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nrealised  that  they  are asset rich  but  cash  poor.   More\r\n\r\nrecently,  with  the  downturn in  the  property  market  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  that changes would be made to  the  CPF  scheme,\r\n\r\nmany  have  lamented that they are now asset  poor  and  cash\r\n\r\npoor, and some may perhaps even find themselves assetless and\r\n\r\ncashless!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Soo Khoon is not here.

They  are  the insurance  agents,  housing\r\n\r\nagents,  hawkers  and  taxi drivers.  They  also  own  public\r\n\r\nhousing flats, like other Singaporeans, but they pay by cash,\r\n\r\nnot  CPF.  Thus, they are not caught by the ups and downs  of\r\n\r\nthe CPF rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument on the issue, in fact, has developed from\r\n\r\nrational  public  discussion  to emotional  appeal,  although\r\n\r\nnothing has firmed up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many agree that we need to review the CPF rate to\r\n\r\nhelp  older  workers to become more employable,  many  become\r\n\r\nemotional  when the age is set at 40.  This is  because  they\r\n\r\nare  either on the wrong side of 40 or on the right  side  of\r\n\r\n40.    They  thought  they  were  right  the  last  time  and\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that they are wrong this time, that  is,  putting\r\n\r\ntoo  much CPF in housing.  Many, in fact, have confessed that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  signed up to buy a flat, it was  like  signing  a\r\n\r\ncredit card.  Even when they needed just a 4-room flat,  they\r\n\r\nwould sign for a 5-room flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, too much CPF in property at the individual level\r\n\r\nis  an issue.  We need to resolve their predicament.  Whether\r\n\r\nwe  should  reduce the rate at the age of 40,  45  or  50,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,   is   a  political  decision,  and  I   trust   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's political wisdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to move fast to come\r\n\r\nup  with  a  decision not only on the rate of CPF  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers but also to set a cap on the use of CPF for housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> The fact that we are a nation of\r\n\r\nsavers  is  through  no accident.

Our people are able to go to bed in comfort with  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  our  hard-earned  reserves  would   not   be\r\n\r\nfoolishly  squandered away.  It is also  comforting  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  our workers' hard-earned money in our Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund are well managed and closely guarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is so closely guarded that members are\r\n\r\nallowed  only  very  limited  utilisation  until  retirement.\r\n\r\nRightly so too that our CPF is not allowed for liberal uses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to present another angle of looking at our\r\n\r\nCPF  savings.  CPF's primary role is for \"retirement,  health\r\n\r\ncare and housing\".  After you have taken care of your housing\r\n\r\nand  bought enough health care insurance, the next  time  you\r\n\r\nmay use your CPF monies is upon retirement.  You may also, in\r\n\r\na  limited  amount,  use  them for  investment  purposes  and\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the capital gain, if any, at the end of  the  year.\r\n\r\nEven that is being slowly taken away from you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are in a different world. Many people out there\r\n\r\nare facing very different types of problems.  Many are facing\r\n\r\nbunching  financial problems.  There are those who previously\r\n\r\nheld  high-earning jobs.  They are also highly leveraged with\r\n\r\nhouse  and car mortgages, and other financial demands.  After\r\n\r\nhaving  lost their jobs, they are pressed by banks to top  up\r\n\r\ntheir  monetary  differences to the deflated value  of  their\r\n\r\nproperty,  cars and other investments.  They will  grow  more\r\n\r\nfrustrated as their problems mount and bunch while they watch\r\n\r\nhelplessly  at  their  huge CPF balances  in  their  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccounts.   It  is not uncommon to see an unemployed  person,\r\n\r\nwho previously may be a bank manager, having $500,000 balance\r\n\r\nin his Ordinary CPF Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this group of people, CPF for retirement, they say,\r\n\r\n\"I may not get to retirement at all!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister thus consider allowing this group of\r\n\r\npeople  flexible and limited utilisation to  help  them  tide\r\n\r\nthrough these difficult times?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, an immediate concern over\r\n\r\nlinking  a cut in CPF rate to the age of employees  rests  on\r\n\r\nthe issue of equal remuneration for equal job performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of the over-40s whose skill levels may\r\n\r\nbe  roughly  comparable to those who are  younger.   If  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  over-40s are doing the same jobs as their  younger\r\n\r\ncounterparts, and yet have to suffer a pay cut in the form of\r\n\r\na  reduced CPF rate, then, we may find ourselves endorsing  a\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory precedent in the compensation  system  of  our\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this knowledge-based economy, knowledge, skills and\r\n\r\nintellectual capital of our human capital puts a  premium  on\r\n\r\nthe  value  of the job.  If we say, as a matter of  principle\r\n\r\nthat  since  older workers need to make themselves employable\r\n\r\nby  accepting a CPF cut, irregardless of their contributions,\r\n\r\nthen would this practice not be extended into other areas  of\r\n\r\ncompensation as well?  Employers may then justify  all  types\r\n\r\nof  remuneration cuts to older workers in the name of  making\r\n\r\nthese workers more employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really want to move towards a compensation system\r\n\r\nthat  rewards employees for what they do, and not  for  their\r\n\r\nage,  then this proposal for a reduction in the CPF rate  may\r\n\r\nactually  set  a  dangerous precedent by endorsing  age-based\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  This, Sir, would then constitute an instance\r\n\r\nof reverse discrimination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of\r\n\r\nSingapore, it states: \"All persons are equal before  the  law\r\n\r\nand  entitled  to the equal protection of the law.\"   If  all\r\n\r\npersons  are  equal before the law, we should not  make  laws\r\n\r\nthat  discriminate against persons in different  age  groups.\r\n\r\nHaving  different levels of CPF contributions  for  different\r\n\r\nage groups is therefore discriminatory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing CPF contributions for the 40s age group tends\r\n\r\nto  send  the  wrong  signals to  this  group  of  employees,\r\n\r\nparticularly  managers,  executives and  professionals,  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  being recognised for their  contributions  to\r\n\r\nsociety.   In fact, in this age group, they are in the  prime\r\n\r\nof their working life with plenty of experience and skills to\r\n\r\ngive to their employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   particular,  and  society  in  general.   Reducing   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  as  a  solution  to  encourage  employers   to\r\n\r\ncontinue   keeping  these  people  on  the  payroll   is   an\r\n\r\ninsignificant solution, and a knee-jerk solution.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nit  is not unknown that a few employers have seen the need to\r\n\r\nincrease the CPF contributions for the over-50s to be in line\r\n\r\nwith   the  younger  employees  where  they  see  that  these\r\n\r\nemployees' services are required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are true to regarding our workers and executives\r\n\r\nas  human capital, then why do we zero in on wages as a  cost\r\n\r\nof  doing  business?   Why do we not  look  at  wages  as  an\r\n\r\ninvestment in building our human capital?  There are existing\r\n\r\nmechanisms  that  can be fully explored to achieve  the  same\r\n\r\nresult.   For  example, we can use the MVC mechanism  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest.  Why bother to tinker with the CPF again when  there\r\n\r\nis another option?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means, we should do what we can, and expect older\r\n\r\nworkers  to  do what they can, to make themselves employable.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  the  proposal may not be  an  entirely  fair  nor\r\n\r\neffective   means   by   which  to  achieve   the   goal   of\r\n\r\nemployability.   As such, I would urge the Minister  and  all\r\n\r\nthose   concerned,  to  seriously  consider  the   long-range\r\n\r\nimplications of the proposal before even thinking of  passing\r\n\r\nit into law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, the problems faced by older\r\n\r\nworkers have come under much spotlight and discussion lately.\r\n\r\nEmployers, it seems, are less willing to hire older  workers.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  it  so?   One key reason is because  of  the  higher\r\n\r\nmedical  costs.   Employers are not willing to  incur  higher\r\n\r\nmedical costs associated with the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible solution that has been suggested is that of\r\n\r\nthe  medical benefit system.  The system can provide a worker\r\n\r\nwith  portable  and  continuous coverage during  his  working\r\n\r\nyears,  and  extending  into even  his  retirement.   It  can\r\n\r\ncomplement and build on existing schemes such as Medisave and\r\n\r\nMediShield.   It  helps workers to save  for  future  medical\r\n\r\nneeds.  Most importantly, under the scheme, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker  does not lose out when he changes jobs,  even  if  he\r\n\r\ndevelops  medical conditions.  At the same time,  there  will\r\n\r\nnot  be unnecessary cost burdens to his employers as he ages.\r\n\r\nThe  scheme can be multi-tiered to provide a compulsory basic\r\n\r\nlevel  of  coverage  at  the national level  with  affordable\r\n\r\npremiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC has advocated that Singapore move towards a\r\n\r\nportable  medical  benefit system.  As a  labour  MP,  I  can\r\n\r\nclearly see that such a portable scheme will benefit workers,\r\n\r\nas  it  provides all workers with continuous medical coverage\r\n\r\nwithout  affecting their employability.  In  fact,  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  many  older  workers  realise  the  hard\r\n\r\nreality of the existing employer-based medical benefits  that\r\n\r\nthey have.  It is more like a cheque that, when they need  to\r\n\r\ncash  it,  the supporting account could have been terminated.\r\n\r\nIt is something that is unreal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, \"a bird in hand is worth two in the bush\".\r\n\r\nThus,  more  and  more  union  leaders  have  accepted   that\r\n\r\nportability  is a more effective way to retain  the  workers'\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits.  However, the response from  employers  is\r\n\r\nnot  forthcoming.  One reason is that employers perceive that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system would be more costly.  I would like to remind\r\n\r\nthe  employers  to treat workers as stakeholders.   Companies\r\n\r\nhave an obligation to stakeholders and should not reduce  its\r\n\r\ncorporate  responsibility to enhance  the  welfare  of  their\r\n\r\nemployees.  I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower what\r\n\r\nmore can be done to push for a more widespread implementation\r\n\r\nof a portable medical benefit system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to raise an issue\r\n\r\nwith  respect  to  the  proposed  increase  in  the  Medisave\r\n\r\ncomponent  of our CPF to cover insurance premiums  that  will\r\n\r\nensure the portability of medical insurance for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report outlining the preliminary recommendations\r\n\r\nfor a portable medical benefit scheme, I note that there is a\r\n\r\ntwo-tier  scheme  being proposed, one  covers  basic  medical\r\n\r\ninsurance, which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupposed to be compulsory, while the second-tier provides for\r\n\r\nan enhanced and optional medical insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that I would like to raise with the Minister\r\n\r\npertains  to the first-tier basic medical insurance  that  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to be compulsory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed scheme, employers will have to pay an\r\n\r\nadditional  1% of the employee's monthly salary as additional\r\n\r\ncontribution to the employee's Medisave account, subject to a\r\n\r\nsalary  cap  of  $6,000.

I would like to  address  their\r\n\r\nconcerns now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a quick word by way of introduction. I am sure\r\n\r\nall  Members  are  very familiar with  the  CPF  system.   We\r\n\r\nstarted  out in 1955 as a very basic retirement saving  plan.\r\n\r\nOver the years, it has evolved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto a comprehensive social security scheme to enable workers\r\n\r\nto save for their homes, to save for old age and also to meet\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure.  The system has served us  well  over\r\n\r\nthe  years  since  its inception in 1955.  The  question  is,\r\n\r\ngoing into the future, will the same system continue to serve\r\n\r\nus as well as it had in the past?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are facing more competition. In fact,\r\n\r\ncompetition  is  so fierce that the Malaysian Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nrecently publicly spoke about skinning Singapore in more ways\r\n\r\nthan  one.   If  we  are  complacent,  we  may  well  end  up\r\n\r\ndecorating somebody's trophy wall.  So we should not just  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent  and  depend on an institutional system  that  has\r\n\r\nworked for us in the past, to carry us on to the future.   It\r\n\r\nis  in fact timely for us to take a hard look at our economic\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  including our CPF system, in  preparation  for\r\n\r\nthese new challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me make it absolutely clear right from the\r\n\r\nbeginning that the fundamental objectives of the CPF  system,\r\n\r\nhome  ownership, retirement and healthcare, are  still  valid\r\n\r\nand  relevant and will remain so for the future.  As DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nsaid,   we   do  not  intend  to  muck  around   with   these\r\n\r\nfundamentals.  However, we do need to examine whether the CPF\r\n\r\ncan  be  refashioned  to better cope with  the  new  economic\r\n\r\nchallenges.   While  the 40% total contribution  remains  our\r\n\r\ntarget, we must still try to see whether we can fine-tune and\r\n\r\nseek  a  new  balance for the CPF system to help our  workers\r\n\r\nstay ahead and employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of these areas or issues that we must\r\n\r\nexamine  with  a critical eye?  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  has  asked\r\n\r\nwhether CPF for older workers should be lowered and,  if  so,\r\n\r\nwhat  would  be the impact and how serious is the problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment  amongst these older workers.   As  at  December\r\n\r\n2001,  the  unemployment rate for older workers aged  40  and\r\n\r\nabove was 4.9%.  This may not appear exceptionally high.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  is  of  greater concern is that, once retrenched,  they\r\n\r\nface  more  difficulty in securing re-employment compared  to\r\n\r\nthose who are younger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir  re-employment rate last year was 62% compared  to  the\r\n\r\nyounger  workers' re-employment rate of 70%.   It  also  took\r\n\r\nolder workers longer to get another job.  The median duration\r\n\r\nof unemployment for workers aged 40 and above was 14.2 weeks.\r\n\r\nFor  those aged 50 and above, it was 21 weeks.  This compares\r\n\r\nvery unfavourably to the 11.5 weeks for younger workers below\r\n\r\n40 to get re-employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with continued economic restructuring, we must\r\n\r\nexpect  this trend to worsen.  There are a number of  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  this trend.  Older workers may not have the right skill-set  for  the new jobs.  Dr Amy Khor mentioned that  outdated\r\n\r\nskills may well be a very important factor for the difficulty\r\n\r\nconfronting older workers in seeking re-employment.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith Dr Khor.  So we have introduced many programmes, such as\r\n\r\nthe   Skills  Redevelopment  Programme,  the  People-for-Jobs\r\n\r\nTraineeship Programme, even basic training, such as  critical\r\n\r\nskills  and  skills in IT, to help the older workers  acquire\r\n\r\nrelevant  marketable skills.  More needs to be done  in  this\r\n\r\narea.   Let  me  assure  hon. Members  that  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconstantly exploring how to better help older workers  bridge\r\n\r\nthis skills gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, skills upgrading alone may not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nUnder a seniority-based wage system, the higher cost of older\r\n\r\nworkers can be an impediment.  This puts older workers  at  a\r\n\r\ngreater  risk when a company is forced to downsize.  It  also\r\n\r\nmakes  it  more  difficult  for older  workers  to  seek  re-employment because of their higher wage expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could leave it to market forces to make all\r\n\r\nthese  adjustments.   But our experience with  promoting  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable component, for instance, since  1999  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the wage structures cannot be changed readily  just  by\r\n\r\nmarket  forces alone.  Furthermore, for an unskilled  worker,\r\n\r\nthe  take-home  pay, net of CPF, may well be too  low  to  be\r\n\r\nattractive.   And  this  is  one reason  why  some  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  stay without regular jobs.  They prefer to  do  \"odd\r\n\r\njobs\" for cash without making any CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo said that any change to the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate on the basis of age would be discriminatory\r\n\r\nand  unfair.  Let me point out that currently, employers' CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  are lower for workers who  are  more  than  55\r\n\r\nyears old.  Workers below 55 receive a total CPF of 36%,  the\r\n\r\nemployer  contributes  16%,  the  employee  contributes  20%.\r\n\r\nWorkers  from age 55 to 60 get a total of 18.5%, the employer\r\n\r\ncontributes only 6% and the employee contributes 12 1/2%.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the CPF rates for workers above the age of 60 is  even\r\n\r\nlower.   When  we  moved to make this change,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nallegation  that  it was unconstitutional,  or  that  it  was\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory.   In  fact,  everybody  understood  when   we\r\n\r\nintroduced this change that it was to help the older  workers\r\n\r\naged 55 and above to remain employed.  And everybody accepted\r\n\r\nthat it was a good move.  We discussed it thoroughly with the\r\n\r\nunions  and  it was accepted that this was a good  move.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  over the years since we made these changes, the labour\r\n\r\nforce participation of the group of workers aged 55 and above\r\n\r\nhad  increased year by year which shows that it had  achieved\r\n\r\nits purpose of helping the older workers stay employed.  So I\r\n\r\nthink the allegation that it is unconstitutional, or that  it\r\n\r\nis discriminatory, is not valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we have to consider is whether some adjustments\r\n\r\nin  the  CPF  rates for workers who are approaching  55  will\r\n\r\ncomplement  the  effort  to retrain and  reskill  workers  to\r\n\r\nenhance  their employability.  This is a separate issue  from\r\n\r\nthe  CPF rate in general, which we still aim to restore  from\r\n\r\n36%  to  40%  as soon as feasible, as soon as the economy  is\r\n\r\nable to bear this additional cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor was concerned that if we change the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate,  it  would  cause  bigger  problems  than\r\n\r\nbenefits  and  urged the Government to look  for  some  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  as  it may not be the best way.  Mdm Ho  Geok  Choo\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  workers aged 40 are  still  in  their  prime\r\n\r\nworking years and should not be considered as senior citizens\r\n\r\nor  liabilities.  I agree with both Dr Khor and Mdm Ho.   The\r\n\r\nCPF  is  a  very entrenched system.  Changes to  contribution\r\n\r\nrates for any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup   of  workers  will  have  far-reaching  impact.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  certainly  not  make  any  change  without\r\n\r\ncareful consideration.  If any adjustment is needed, we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  try  to  zero  in on the group  of  workers  whose\r\n\r\nemployability we are trying to enhance, in other  words,  the\r\n\r\nolder group of workers approaching age 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Seng Han\r\n\r\nThong   are  concerned  that  reducing  the  employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution for older workers will affect their  ability  to\r\n\r\nservice their housing loan.  Mr Yeo also asked whether  older\r\n\r\nworkers  would  then  have enough savings  for  old  age  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare needs.  Sir, the Economic Review Committee and its\r\n\r\nSub-Committee  on  Wages,  CPF  and  Taxation  are  currently\r\n\r\nassessing the impact of various CPF changes on the ability of\r\n\r\nmortgagors  to service their mortgages, and the  accumulation\r\n\r\nof  savings  for  old age and healthcare.  We will  certainly\r\n\r\ncontinue to adopt a very careful approach in this study.   We\r\n\r\nwill not disregard the needs of CPF members, especially those\r\n\r\nwith  housing  commitments.  Let me assure hon. Members  that\r\n\r\nsurfacing  of these issues for discussion, at this  juncture,\r\n\r\nis not indicative of a decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock said that with two Ministers speaking\r\n\r\nabout  it,  Singaporeans think that the decision has  already\r\n\r\nbeen made and will be implemented.  Let me assure Dr Tan  and\r\n\r\nhon.  Members that a decision has not been reached.   We  are\r\n\r\nstill studying this issue.  The Economic Review Committee and\r\n\r\nits  Sub-Committee are looking at the data,  looking  at  the\r\n\r\nstatistics.  We will study carefully what could be the impact\r\n\r\nfrom the changes that are being considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has also asked whether Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave over-consumed or over-invested in property.  Sir, today,\r\n\r\n86%  of Singaporeans live in public housing flats and 92%  of\r\n\r\nHDB residents own their own flats.  Without the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCPF  and  the  HDB,  it  would not  have  been  possible  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to attain one of the highest home ownership  rates\r\n\r\nin the world.  Is this good for the nation?  The answer is an\r\n\r\nunequivocal  \"yes\".  Home ownership added  to  our  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging, rootedness and share of economic progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we ask a further question: have some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nover-consumed  or over-invested in property,  the  answer  is\r\n\r\nless  clear.  For those who are prudent and bought properties\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  their income to house  their  families,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  \"no\".   They  have  not  over-invested  or  over-consumed.   But  for those who rush into the property  market\r\n\r\nfor  speculative gains, especially at the top of the property\r\n\r\nboom  and over committed themselves, the answer is a  painful\r\n\r\n\"yes\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as in everything else, prudence is very important.\r\n\r\nCPF members should be prudent in their property purchases and\r\n\r\nnot  over-stretch themselves financially.  They cannot assume\r\n\r\nthat  their  wages  will go up year after year,  they  cannot\r\n\r\nassume  that  they will never become unemployed during  their\r\n\r\nwhole  working  lives.  Otherwise, they may  find  themselves\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to sudden shifts in the economy and the  property\r\n\r\nmarket, such as the recent recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also need to ask another question. Having\r\n\r\nreached  practically full home ownership, going forward,  how\r\n\r\ndo  we  refine  the CPF system?  There are two aspects  worth\r\n\r\nconsidering.  First, we have announced in year 2000  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  gradually  increase  the contribution  to  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount to reach 4%, 6% and 8%, depending on the age.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  rates are 4%, 6% and 6%.  It would take us some time  to\r\n\r\nreach  4%,  6%  and  8%, the ultimate  target  that  we  have\r\n\r\nannounced two years ago.  Beyond that, over the longer  term,\r\n\r\nwill this target rate be sufficient?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, currently, it is not uncommon for a CPF member\r\n\r\nto  withdraw up to 130%, or even 140%, of the valuation price\r\n\r\nof  a  property  to service a mortgage.  This obviously  eats\r\n\r\ninto the saving that he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneeds  for  old  age.  By the end of the  mortgage,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nmember   may   find  that,  even  though  his  property   has\r\n\r\nappreciated in value, it is still worth less than  the  total\r\n\r\namount of CPF that he has used up.  Over the longer term,  is\r\n\r\nthis prudent, or is this sustainable?\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has asked whether the Government\r\n\r\nshould  consider setting a cap on the use of CPF for housing.\r\n\r\nThis  is related to the question of whether it is prudent  or\r\n\r\nnot  to allow such a high level of withdrawal to service  the\r\n\r\nmortgages.   The  ERC  is, in fact, at the  same  time,  also\r\n\r\nreviewing CPF housing schemes to ensure that we do not, willy-nilly,  end  up doing what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and  other  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers are concerned about, ie, encouraging over-consumption\r\n\r\nin  housing.  However, we are well aware that this is a  very\r\n\r\nsensitive  area, tied to the assets of many Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nthe  health  of the property market.  The Government  has  no\r\n\r\nintention of spooking property prices and hurting practically\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans.   We  are  talking  about  fine-tuning   a\r\n\r\nbasically sound system, and not making emergency repairs to a\r\n\r\nbroken-down  system.  If any changes are necessary,  we  will\r\n\r\nimplement  them cautiously and gradually, and we  will  phase\r\n\r\nthem  in  over  an extended period, probably lasting  several\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for the basis that the CPF Board\r\n\r\nuses  to  determine  the adequacy of the  Minimum  Sum.   The\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  is  pegged  at a level  that  would  enable  an\r\n\r\nindividual to maintain a modest standard of living,  somewhat\r\n\r\nhigher   than  the  subsistence  level,  upon  reaching   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  retirement  age.  The CPF  Minimum  Sum  was  not\r\n\r\nintended  to be the only source of income for retirees.   CPF\r\n\r\nmembers would have withdrawn part of their CPF at age 55 and,\r\n\r\nhopefully, invested these CPF savings either in the  form  of\r\n\r\nan  annuity  or some other investments to generate additional\r\n\r\nincome  when  they finally retire at age 62.  They  may  also\r\n\r\nhave their own private savings to supplement the monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  from  the  Minimum  Sum.   I  agree  with  Mr   Yeo's\r\n\r\nobservation that the cash amount that members set aside would\r\n\r\nbe  much lower, if they pledge their property for part of the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.  The property itself may not generate cash  for\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  members.  Of course, it could, if they are prepared\r\n\r\nto sublet part of their property, eg, a room, if it is a 4 or\r\n\r\n5-room HDB flat, or, in a more drastic case, maybe willing to\r\n\r\ndowngrade  to  a smaller property or find a reverse  mortgage\r\n\r\nfor  the property.  But let me reiterate that the CPF Minimum\r\n\r\nSum  is what its name implies: the bare minimum, adjusted for\r\n\r\ninflation,  to  see  us  through retirement.   It  was  never\r\n\r\nintended   to  maintain  one's  standard  of  living   before\r\n\r\nretirement and after retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew requested that needy CPF members,\r\n\r\nwho have financial difficulties, be allowed to withdraw their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings to meet their current financial problems.   This\r\n\r\nis  a very well-intentioned plea.  While I do sympathize with\r\n\r\nthose  who face such difficulties, I am also fearful  of  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  when  we rush to unlock the  CPF  savings.   No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  if  we  face  a prolonged recession  with  very  high\r\n\r\nunemployment,  the  CPF  will have to  be  unlocked  to  bail\r\n\r\nSingaporeans out, and the Government is prepared  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nBut, our present situation is not so grave as yet.  Premature\r\n\r\nunlocking of the CPF can do us more harm than good.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  suggest  that we make use of other  Government  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  assistance  schemes,  eg,  the  Economic  Downturn\r\n\r\nRelief Scheme (EDRS), the many programmes that we have in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry for training and job placement assistance, before we\r\n\r\nturn  to  prematurely unlocking the CPF  for  this  group  of\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some Members are asking for the CPF to be opened\r\n\r\nup,  I note that Dr Tan and Mr Yeo argued that the CPF should\r\n\r\nbe  re-focused to its original objective of providing for CPF\r\n\r\nmembers'  home  ownership, retirement and  healthcare  needs.\r\n\r\nThis   clearly  illustrates  the  tension  in  our  different\r\n\r\nobjectives.   The  more liberal we are with CPF  withdrawals,\r\n\r\nthe  harder  it is for Singaporeans to accumulate enough  for\r\n\r\nthe core objectives of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  CPF.  So, I agree with both Dr Tan and Mr Yeo,  that  we\r\n\r\nshould go back to the fundamentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion on the CPF issues, Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  will appreciate that what I have sketched out are  not\r\n\r\nstraightforward issues.  I may not have given all the answers\r\n\r\nto the questions that Members have raised.  But, these issues\r\n\r\nare  interconnected.  Each has an implication on the  others,\r\n\r\nand we need to look at these issues as integrated and part of\r\n\r\nthe  same  solution.  Let me reiterate that no  decision  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  at  this point in time.  While  Members  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  are understandably anxious about the outcome  of  the\r\n\r\nCPF review, let us wait for the Economic Review Committee  to\r\n\r\nthoroughly  review  and debate the issues before  making  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   I would like to assure  Members  that  our\r\n\r\nintention  is  to help workers cope with future uncertainties\r\n\r\nand to enhance employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to the points that have been raised\r\n\r\nby  Mr Yeo and Mdm Ho on the medical benefits system.  Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nhas  asked  what is the progress and prospect with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the portable medical benefits  system.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  update Members  of  the  House  that  the\r\n\r\nTripartite Committee, chaired by former Minister of State, Mr\r\n\r\nOthman  Haron Eusofe, had concluded its study on the portable\r\n\r\nmedical benefits system.  In a nutshell, it recommended  that\r\n\r\na   medical  benefits  scheme,  based  on  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nportability,  co-payment  and affordability,  be  introduced.\r\n\r\nThe  scheme will cover both inpatient and outpatient benefits\r\n\r\nsupported by a medical insurance structure - deductibles  and\r\n\r\nco-payment  features, and allow accumulation  of  the  unused\r\n\r\nmedical benefits to meet future medical needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed system will ensure that employees are\r\n\r\ncovered  by medical insurance not only during employment  but\r\n\r\nalso  when  they  are in between employment  and  even  after\r\n\r\nretirement.  By\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenabling younger workers to start putting aside more  savings\r\n\r\nin  their Medisave for their later years, the proposed system\r\n\r\ncould   also   help  to  improve  cost  competitiveness   and\r\n\r\nemployability  of  older  workers.   With  the   element   of\r\n\r\ndeductible   and   co-payment,  the  scheme  will   encourage\r\n\r\nindividuals to take greater personal responsibility for their\r\n\r\nown health, and this will help to contain the rise of medical\r\n\r\ncosts in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the points raised by Mdm Ho on whether an\r\n\r\nadditional  1%  Medisave contribution will be sufficient  for\r\n\r\nemployees moving on to this portable medical benefits  system\r\n\r\nto  buy their health insurance, our experience with a similar\r\n\r\nsystem that has been in operation in the civil service  since\r\n\r\n1994  is  that,  with an additional 1% Medisave contribution,\r\n\r\nmost of the employees should be able to buy an adequate level\r\n\r\nof  health  insurance.   Of course,  this  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed over time, and they should also be given options  in\r\n\r\nthe  choice  of  the level of insurance health coverage  that\r\n\r\nthey want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that the Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's Sub-Committee on Wages, CPF and  Taxation\r\n\r\nis  also reviewing the recommendation of the study report  by\r\n\r\nthe  Tripartite  Committee, and  it  will  then  recommend  a\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  implement  such a  portable  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nsystem.  So, we will have to wait for the ERC to complete its\r\n\r\nreview of this proposal before I would be able to inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on what else we need to do and how we should implement\r\n\r\nthis recommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has also asked whether we could allow CPF\r\n\r\nmembers or workers to use their Medisave to pay premiums  for\r\n\r\nprivate  health insurance.  The answer is yes.  We  do  allow\r\n\r\nCPF  members  to  use their Medisave to buy health  insurance\r\n\r\nfrom   private-sector  insurance  companies.   In   fact,   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that, currently, there are five approved  private\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance schemes, namely, Income Shield and Managed\r\n\r\nHealthcare  from NTUC Income Cooperative, Health Shield  from\r\n\r\nAIA, Supreme Health from Great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern  Life,  and  Max Health from the  Overseas  Assurance\r\n\r\nCorporation.   These  are the companies  that  have  approved\r\n\r\nhealth  insurance which CPF members can purchase using  their\r\n\r\nMedisave  savings.  They can use their Medisave to  buy  this\r\n\r\nhealth  insurance, not just for themselves  only.   They  can\r\n\r\nalso  use  Medisave to buy insurance for their spouse,  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  parents or grandparents, up to the withdrawal  cap\r\n\r\nfor  every  policy.  There is a withdrawal cap  of  $660  per\r\n\r\nyear, and this has been set to prevent premature depletion of\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave savings.  Private-sector insurance schemes also\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  designed  with co-payment  and  deductible,  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  demand  and over-consumption of  medical  services,\r\n\r\nwhich  Dr  Neo  also mentioned as to be important  points  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, over and above this private-sector health\r\n\r\ninsurance,  CPF  also  offers members  the  basic  MediShield\r\n\r\ninsurance, which is a catastrophic insurance scheme, and also\r\n\r\nMediShield Plus.  Later this year, when ElderShield, a scheme\r\n\r\nunder  which  senior  citizens  can  be  insured  by  private\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies, is launched, CPF members can  also  use\r\n\r\nMedisave to pay for their ElderShield premiums, not just  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  but  also premiums for their spouses,  children,\r\n\r\nparents  or  grandparents.   As and  when  we  implement  the\r\n\r\nportable medical benefits system, the Ministry of Health  and\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board will also allow workers to use their Medisave\r\n\r\nto  buy appropriate health insurance for themselves and their\r\n\r\nfamily members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, let me respond to Mr Ong Kian Min's\r\n\r\npoint.   He asked what happens to the interest that  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  charges or levies on employers who are late in  paying\r\n\r\ntheir  employees' CPF contributions.  He mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nCPF  charges a penalty interest at the rate of 18% per  annum\r\n\r\non  such late payments.  Let me explain.  Currently, the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard gives employers a 14-day grace period, from the end  of\r\n\r\nthe month, to make the CPF contributions for their employees.\r\n\r\nIf  payment  is  not made at the end of the  14  days'  grace\r\n\r\nperiod,  a penalty interest is charged.  The purpose of  this\r\n\r\npenalty interest is to ensure that the defaulting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers  make  the payment as quickly as possible,  and  to\r\n\r\ndeter  them  from  paying  CPF contributions  late  again  in\r\n\r\nfuture.   It  is  not  true that CPF keeps  all  the  penalty\r\n\r\ninterest.  The penalty interest is 11/2% per month - that  is\r\n\r\nwhere  we  get  this 18% per annum - but very  few  employers\r\n\r\ndelay their payment for such a long period of time.  Whatever\r\n\r\npenalty  interest  that  the  CPF  Board  collects  from  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  at  the  end of the day, the  first  charge  goes\r\n\r\ntowards restoring the lost interest, the interest which would\r\n\r\nhave  otherwise been earned if the CPF contribution had  been\r\n\r\npaid  on time into the employee's account.  That is the  most\r\n\r\nimportant portion of the penalty interest collected that will\r\n\r\nbe  credited back into the member's account immediately  and,\r\n\r\nwhat is left over, is used to defray the expenses incurred by\r\n\r\nthe Board in collecting this overdue payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty interest is necessary to ensure that\r\n\r\nemployers  are  on  time  in  paying  their  employees'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.  After all, the majority today, 20% comes  out\r\n\r\nof  the  employees'  wages and only 16% comes  out  from  the\r\n\r\nemployer.   So  it is part of the employee's  wages  and  any\r\n\r\ndelay  is  unfair  to  the employee.  We  have  to  impose  a\r\n\r\nsufficiently effective deterrent to ensure that employers pay\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF contribution on time.  I am glad to say  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority of employers do pay their CPF contribution for their\r\n\r\nemployees  on time.  It is only a small percentage  of  cases\r\n\r\nwho are delayed in such payment.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, can I just seek a point of\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister?  I think he did  not  answer\r\n\r\nmy  question as to how much of CPF money is tied to  housing.\r\n\r\nSomebody in the private sector has given a figure of 25%.   I\r\n\r\nwant to know whether this is correct or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures with\r\n\r\nme.

It is all  published\r\n\r\nin the annual report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, structural\r\n\r\nunemployment has arrived in Singapore and looks set  to  stay\r\n\r\nfor  some  time.   Over  the  last  five  years,  those  with\r\n\r\nsecondary  and  below  secondary qualifications  made  up  an\r\n\r\naverage of 75% of unemployed Singapore residents.  It did not\r\n\r\nmatter  if  it was a good year or a bad year.  In 1998,  when\r\n\r\nour growth rate was minus 1%, this group made up about 77% of\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singapore residents.  In a good  year,  in  2000,\r\n\r\nwhen the growth rate was a whopping 10.3%, they made up about\r\n\r\n74%, just a minimal drop.  These figures are culled from  the\r\n\r\nLabour Force Survey of the Manpower Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems clear that economic growth has had little\r\n\r\neffect  on the lot of these workers.  In good years  or  bad,\r\n\r\njobs are not coming their way.  This is despite the array  of\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes  rolled out  over  the  years,  and  the\r\n\r\nmillions spent on these initiatives.  They are victims of the\r\n\r\nrestructuring process.  My Parliamentary colleague,  Mr  Khaw\r\n\r\nBoon  Wan,  once talked about the Singapore  Cause.   He  was\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the core ideals of this society - meritocracy,\r\n\r\nfair   play   and   equal  opportunities.   This   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment is the Singapore Cost.  We cannot allow an under-class  to develop and harden in Singapore.  There are  social\r\n\r\ncosts  associated  with unemployment.  There  is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nchange  the employment system to bring it in line with socio-economic changes that make structural reform necessary in the\r\n\r\nfirst place.  We restructure the economy to create more  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans.  The problem is that in the short-term  to\r\n\r\nthe   medium-term,   structural  reform  will   create   more\r\n\r\nunemployment for this particular group of workers.  It is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Government to deal with  the  emerging\r\n\r\nemployment problems resulting from these structural reforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present measures may not be effective enough to help\r\n\r\nthese low-skilled workers find jobs going by the rate of job-matching.   We need to foster the informal economy which  can\r\n\r\nprovide jobs for these workers.  I would urge the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  to  work  with our Community  Development  Councils\r\n\r\n(CDCs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto expand job opportunities for these workers - not on an ad-hoc  basis, as some CDCs do now, but in a structured way  all\r\n\r\nover  the  island.  These jobless people may,  otherwise,  be\r\n\r\nsusceptible to engage in illegal activities or rely on public\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the Government\r\n\r\nintends to deal with the problem of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in August 1999, the Manpower\r\n\r\nMinistry  launched Manpower 21, a blueprint to transform  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  to  meet  our future manpower needs,  enhance  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and minimise structural unemployment.   Many\r\n\r\ndevelopments  have  happened in these three  years.   We  see\r\n\r\nrecord numbers of workers losing their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a close study of the Manpower 21 blueprint\r\n\r\nagain  shows that its objectives are as valid today  as  when\r\n\r\nthe  blueprint  was  launched.  For example,  the  vision  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a talent capital is still relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area that I wish the Government to strive to do\r\n\r\nbetter  is the accurate projections of future manpower  needs\r\n\r\nin  the  various  sectors.  This is  crucial,  as  otherwise,\r\n\r\nworkers may not choose the right skills to be trained in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower for its\r\n\r\nassessment   of  the  implementation  of  the   Manpower   21\r\n\r\nblueprint.   How  has  the  economic recession  affected  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the plan?  Is the Ministry satisfied  with\r\n\r\nthe progress of lifelong learning?  What more can be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest preliminary estimates by the Ministry show\r\n\r\nthat  total  employment contracted by  16,100  in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  of  2002.   It  was the third consecutive  quarterly\r\n\r\ndecline  in  employment.   The  seasonally  adjusted  overall\r\n\r\nunemployment rate was 4.5% in March 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has stepped up its employment assistance\r\n\r\nprogrammes such as People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork   Skills  Training  Programme  and  the  Self-Employment\r\n\r\nTraining Programme.  All these will help, but I think we need\r\n\r\nto do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such efforts should also continue even as the economy\r\n\r\nrecovers in the near future, as the jobs that were lost might\r\n\r\nnot  come  back.  In the Manpower Minister's  own  words,  it\r\n\r\ncould be a \"jobless recovery\".  How will the Ministry further\r\n\r\nstrengthen our efforts to help the retrenched workers and the\r\n\r\nolder workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  I  know  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has  set  up\r\n\r\nemployment assistance centres to help jobless people to  find\r\n\r\njobs.   I also know that the Government has set up a National\r\n\r\nEmployment  Task  Force  to  coordinate  and  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nassistance given to the retrenched and unemployed people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from my meet-the-people sessions, I know that\r\n\r\nalthough  the Ministry of Manpower has been giving this  kind\r\n\r\nof  assistance to the unemployed people, many job  applicants\r\n\r\nhave called the companies recommended by MOM, only to be told\r\n\r\nthat  no  vacancy was available. Some may be  called  up  for\r\n\r\ninterview  but,  at the interview, they were  told  that  the\r\n\r\nvacancies   had  already  been  filled.  Time  and  transport\r\n\r\nexpenses were wasted for nothing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these unemployed people have already lost\r\n\r\nconfidence  in MOM.  They told me that seeking the assistance\r\n\r\nof MOM and the CDCs was merely some form of self-consolation.\r\n\r\nThe result is that their hope of getting a job is dashed, and\r\n\r\nthey have still to wait for a job opportunity to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th January, the Straits Times reported that a\r\n\r\ncertain  CDC  had misplaced the application form  of  a  job-seeker,  and the information of companies listed  by  another\r\n\r\nCDC for the reference of job applicants was outdated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should re-assess whether the\r\n\r\npresent mechanism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  assist the unemployed people is still effective,  and  is\r\n\r\nthere  room for improvement.  Assessment of the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof this mechanism should be based on the number of people who\r\n\r\nare successful in getting a job through the assistance of the\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th April, Lianhe Zaobao reported that out of the\r\n\r\n1,600  unemployed   people who sought  help  from  MOM  every\r\n\r\nmonth,  only  about 6% were given referrals for   jobs.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is: out of the 1,600 unemployed people  per  month,\r\n\r\nhow  many  people  were successful in  getting  a  job?   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower said in Parliament a few days ago  that\r\n\r\nabout 15% of the people were successful in getting jobs.   Is\r\n\r\nhe happy with the 15% success rate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when MOM recommends jobs to the people, what\r\n\r\nis  the  ratio between the number of vacancies and the number\r\n\r\nof  applicants?  If  there are only  10  vacancies,  do  they\r\n\r\nrecommend  these  10  vacancies to some 100  applicants,  and\r\n\r\nconsider itself as having helped these applicants?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Ministry of Manpower must have\r\n\r\nsystematically collected  information on the people who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  unemployed  for  a  long  time    and  conduct  further\r\n\r\nanalysis on the profile of these prolonged unemployed, so  as\r\n\r\nto follow up and resolve their unemployment problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is ascertained that a certain category of\r\n\r\nunemployed  people is no longer able to secure suitable  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  they  would want to undertake in the market,  then  MOM\r\n\r\nshould  consider  providing employment counselling  to  these\r\n\r\npeople, to advise them to switch over to other suitable lines\r\n\r\nof  employment, so as to prevent them from being  perpetually\r\n\r\nunemployed in the face of economic restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am glad that\r\n\r\nGovernment  expenditure  in the Economic  Development  sector\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to emphasise worker training  and  upgrading.\r\n\r\nThis year alone, there will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   100,000  training  places  provided  under  the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers who are most vulnerable to retrenchments\r\n\r\nduring an economic downturn are the older ones. They are most\r\n\r\nat  risk  of  remaining  unemployed  even  when  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers, because some industries which they were working  in\r\n\r\nmay  be relocated to other countries where the business cost,\r\n\r\nparticularly labour cost, is much lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, over the past few years, quite a lot of\r\n\r\nolder   workers  have  started  to  accept  the  concept   of\r\n\r\nretraining, and have actually put in efforts to upgrade or re-skill  themselves.  The increase in training  allowances  for\r\n\r\nolder workers could have helped to a certain extent. However,\r\n\r\nthe  important  consideration is not  so  much  on  how  many\r\n\r\nworkers have undergone retraining, but more on how many  have\r\n\r\ngained re-employment or have escaped retrenchment because  of\r\n\r\ntheir retraining. This is what matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has MOM any plan to encourage our employers to identify\r\n\r\nthe  new  skills or the fields of work that would be required\r\n\r\nin  the  future, so that we could match the workers' training\r\n\r\nwith  the  relevant skills and know-how to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nretrained  workers would not be wasting their  time  and  our\r\n\r\nresources  on  acquiring  skills  which  are  irrelevant   or\r\n\r\nobsolete?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we urge our workers to adapt to change, we must\r\n\r\nnot  forget also to get the employers to change their mindset\r\n\r\nand be more positive towards the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way can we strengthen our efforts to help our\r\n\r\nworkers to enhance their employability?   Since employability\r\n\r\nand skills are inter-related, I would like to suggest that we\r\n\r\nallow  our workers to accumulate and bring forward the unused\r\n\r\nportion  of  their 4% employer-based annual training  budget,\r\n\r\nlike  the  way  we  bring  forward our  unused  annual  leave\r\n\r\nentitlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that MOM look at other countries' best\r\n\r\npractices.  We  could  tie  up  with  our  polytechnics   and\r\n\r\nInstitutes  of Technical Training, to work out some  training\r\n\r\npossibilities.  Many countries are constantly  searching  for\r\n\r\nnew  ways to do things better, and some of them have  already\r\n\r\ngone ahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the case of Sweden, the government sets\r\n\r\nup  an  Individual Training Account (ILA) for each  of  their\r\n\r\nworkers.  The individual worker can decide how much he  wants\r\n\r\nto  put  into  this account and how much to  draw  from  this\r\n\r\naccount  and  for what purpose. Employers are  encouraged  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to their employees' ILAs. Such contributions  are\r\n\r\ntax-deductible, and amount to 10 percentage points  of  their\r\n\r\npayroll tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be useful for us to consider adopting other\r\n\r\ncountries'  measures  if  they are applicable  to  our  local\r\n\r\nsituation.   We  need to find ways and means to  enhance  our\r\n\r\nglobal competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, there are many\r\n\r\ntraining  schemes in place to assist the unemployed  workers,\r\n\r\ngenerously funded by the Government.  In fact, in this year's\r\n\r\nbudget allocated to MOM, a high percentage, 28%, I note, will\r\n\r\nbe allocated to lifelong learning, skills upgrading and other\r\n\r\ntraining programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on the feedback which I have received,\r\n\r\nindividual workers still find it difficult to find  out  what\r\n\r\nprogrammes are in place and are confused on the objectives of\r\n\r\nthe different schemes, as well as how they are funded.  Also,\r\n\r\nthose  wishing to prepare themselves for other  jobs  because\r\n\r\ntheir  own  jobs are at risk do not know where to  find  such\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, there appears to be a gap between the information\r\n\r\non  training  and  other labour market information  that  are\r\n\r\navailable and workers' understanding and knowledge of it.   I\r\n\r\nam  aware  that  MOM has set up a website to  assist  workers\r\n\r\ncalled  CareerLink.  But, Sir, we have not reached the  level\r\n\r\nyet where everyone in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   IT-literate  so  that  they  can  easily   access   such\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question to the Minister is what more can be\r\n\r\ndone to ensure that important labour market information, such\r\n\r\nas   training,  job  opportunities  and  new  job  areas  are\r\n\r\naccessible to all workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, there is a need to link training to jobs.\r\n\r\nIf  people  still  cannot  find jobs,  even  after  they  are\r\n\r\ntrained, over time, they will get very disillusioned and  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of training and skills upgrading will diminish.   This\r\n\r\nis  particularly  problematic for older  workers  because  of\r\n\r\nemployers'  strong bias against them.  No  matter  how  well-trained  the  older worker is, he may not be employed  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  of his age.  I am aware that there are fussy workers\r\n\r\nbut,  on  the  flip side, there are also many  discriminatory\r\n\r\nemployers although the older worker may be prepared  to  take\r\n\r\nlower pay, work shifts or work in 3D jobs.  A unionist in the\r\n\r\nbanking  sector  told me about a retrenched bank  worker  who\r\n\r\nwent  for  a  job  interview, but was told that  he  did  not\r\n\r\nqualify because he was simply too old, despite the fact  that\r\n\r\nhe was prepared to take a huge pay cut.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme,\r\n\r\nbut   this  programme  appears  to  have  limited  reach  and\r\n\r\napplication.   So  my  second question  to  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are  ways  of  enhancing  this  programme  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen its reach and application.  Also, whether there is\r\n\r\na way that we can facilitate employment for our older workers\r\n\r\nin some jobs in the non-trading sectors, for instance, in the\r\n\r\nschools, hospitals and other Ministries.  I remember  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  days of Singapore's development, we did reserve hawker\r\n\r\nlicences for the needy and poor.  The objective then was  not\r\n\r\njust economics, but social considerations also played a part.\r\n\r\nIt  may  not be necessary for the Ministry to outsource  some\r\n\r\njobs, which many Ministries are currently doing, probably  to\r\n\r\nsave cost, when these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs could then be left for the older workers to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that no matter how much we train\r\n\r\npeople, if employers still insist on imposing non-job related\r\n\r\nconditions for employment, such as language, then it would be\r\n\r\ndifficult for those retrenched to find employment.  Hence,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that the Minister consider putting  in\r\n\r\nplace  a  more  proactive  mechanism  to  enquire  into  such\r\n\r\npractices, and to do more to educate employers not to  impose\r\n\r\nnon-job   related  requirements  for  employment.   In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  MOM could even consider coming out with  guidelines\r\n\r\non  what constitute good human resource management practices,\r\n\r\none  indicator of which could be whether or not  an  employer\r\n\r\nhas imposed a non-job related requirement for employment.   I\r\n\r\nwould appreciate the Minister's reaction on my suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, generally I would like to\r\n\r\ncommend the Ministry of Manpower for initiating programmes to\r\n\r\nhelp   our   workers  to  be  employed  and  better  trained,\r\n\r\nparticularly for those who have lost their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Ministry's Report, and as has been widely\r\n\r\nknown,  older workers, ie, those 40 and above and  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  lower educational qualification and skills level,  have\r\n\r\ngreater problems to find re-employment.  There are a  lot  of\r\n\r\nopportunities for retrenched workers to get help, as both the\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  Community  Development Councils  have  intensified\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  to match them with available jobs.   Here,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to make two points to help such workers  to  get\r\n\r\njobs  and  enhance their employability.  First,  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave problems getting re-employed need help in managing their\r\n\r\nexpectations  in  terms of salary level  and  the  nature  of\r\n\r\navailable  jobs.  This calls for counselling.   MOM  and  CDC\r\n\r\nofficers  who  help workers in job matching  are  in  a  good\r\n\r\nposition to advise retrenched workers about the need to  keep\r\n\r\nsome perspective in their choice of jobs, in terms of salary,\r\n\r\nworking hours, distance from work-places, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officers can also advise them about the skills\r\n\r\ntraining courses that workers should take up in order to take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the available jobs.  The question is:  are  such\r\n\r\nofficers  trained to counsel workers?  Will  these  officers,\r\n\r\nwho are likely to be younger than the retrenched workers,  be\r\n\r\nable to communicate with the workers and empathise with them?\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Ministry  can look into the  training  of  such\r\n\r\nworkers, including the CDC staffers, so that we can help  our\r\n\r\nolder  and  less  skilled  retrenched  workers  manage  their\r\n\r\nemployability better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to have a closer link between\r\n\r\njob  training and job placement.  I would allude to the point\r\n\r\nearlier   raised   by   Mdm  Halimah.   The   People-for-Jobs\r\n\r\nTraineeship  programme is a good effort to ensure  employment\r\n\r\nfor  those who are willing and able to take up relevant skill\r\n\r\ncourses.   I  believe this programme, which I understand  has\r\n\r\nbeen able to emplace 2,000 workers, should be expanded.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of retrenched workers, who have problems getting  re-employment,  could grow in future.  So I urge that  we  widen\r\n\r\nthese  training  for job schemes.  Even though  the  DPM  has\r\n\r\nearlier  this  week advised that we should try  out  existing\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to help retrenched workers before venturing  into\r\n\r\nnew  schemes, I would urge that MOM look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof engaging employment agencies in the private sector to help\r\n\r\nin this effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, may I ask the Minister to update the\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the success of the Skills Redevelopment  Programme\r\n\r\nand  the  SRP's  Facilitators Scheme, and his plans  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture of the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I do not need to\r\n\r\nbelabour  the point, but I would like to echo the  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  Mr  Hawazi that the Ministry of  Manpower,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  has  done a very creditable job in terms  of  handling\r\n\r\nsituations.

How the children are brought up  to\r\n\r\nthink  about  choice careers is one such mindset.   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry look into this phenomenon and, if need be, work with\r\n\r\nMOE  and other non-formal educational institutions, including\r\n\r\ncivil  organisations, VWOs and CDCs, to  help  alleviate  the\r\n\r\nendemic problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in school, my parents wished that I had\r\n\r\ndone medicine.  When I failed to get a place in one, a mentor\r\n\r\nteased me by saying not to worry, I should make a good nurse.\r\n\r\nI clearly ended up with humanities - working as a journalist,\r\n\r\nlater  doing social work, and later as a politician - and  it\r\n\r\ngave  me the opportunity to nurse the community.  I am happy,\r\n\r\nand I am sure many other parents too wanted their children to\r\n\r\nbe  doctors,  engineers, lawyers, and at one time,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nBusiness  Administration  was  the  choice.   They  are  good\r\n\r\nprofessions,  but  the  whole  world  is  so  wide  open  for\r\n\r\ndifferent roles to contribute to, and to earn a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at how the profile of work and professions has\r\n\r\nchanged,  not  commensurate with what parents were  used  to.\r\n\r\nThere are workers who wanted to be policemen or firemen their\r\n\r\nwhole  life,  as  with my experience serving  with  the  Port\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union in PSA.  Some of them refused to be retrained,\r\n\r\nthus  making  themselves inflexible, and not  employable  for\r\n\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, to continue to be employable, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  nimble.  We need life-long learning,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, training and retraining.  As some experts say, perhaps\r\n\r\neight  or  even more times, during our whole work life.   MOM\r\n\r\nneeds   to  help  create  more  awareness,  and  make  easily\r\n\r\naccessible  information  with regard  to  alternative  career\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, almost all our current training\r\n\r\nschemes that are significant are employer-based.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat these schemes subsidise employers who send their workers\r\n\r\nfor training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer-based training incentive schemes remain\r\n\r\nrelevant and important, but I believe that they are no longer\r\n\r\nsufficient.  Sir, as our economy restructures, the employment\r\n\r\nstructure will also change very fundamentally.  So instead of\r\n\r\na  lifetime  employment with a single employer,  workers  are\r\n\r\nmore  likely to have to work in several different jobs during\r\n\r\ntheir  life.  And with shorter expected stints of  employment\r\n\r\nwith  each employer, the incentive for any given employer  to\r\n\r\ntrain  their workers may be further weakened.  Yet,  in  this\r\n\r\nnew  setting,  as  so  many  of our colleagues  have  already\r\n\r\nmentioned,  updated  skills  are so  important  for  lifelong\r\n\r\nemployability.   So  what this means  is  that  the  existing\r\n\r\npolicy  of  funding  training, mainly through  employers,  is\r\n\r\nlikely to miss out on an increasing number of workers who are\r\n\r\ncaught in the churn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traditionally, I understand that the concern about\r\n\r\nfunding,   the   employee-initiated  or  individual-initiated\r\n\r\ntraining,  is a fear about wasteful expenditure, a fear  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  both  trainees  and training  providers  may  pursue\r\n\r\nirrelevant and unproductive learning and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that steps must indeed be taken to minimise\r\n\r\nsuch  risks and waste.  But, given the changed situation,  we\r\n\r\nmust not let such fears deter us from doing what is necessary\r\n\r\nto  help  workers remain employable in this changed  setting.\r\n\r\nThe Government has taken the first step in this direction  by\r\n\r\nsupporting the NTUC Education and Training Fund, which allows\r\n\r\nindividual union members initiate training under an  approved\r\n\r\ncourse list, and then claim for subsidy from this Fund.   And\r\n\r\nthe  experience,  in the last three years  since  the  Fund's\r\n\r\ninception, has shown that workers are indeed very keen to  do\r\n\r\nso.  Last year, for example, more than 40,000 training places\r\n\r\nwere supported under the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the changed operating environment, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister what additional measures  will\r\n\r\nthe  Government be taking to assist individuals who take  the\r\n\r\ninitiative and make the effort to upgrade, to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome  other  countries,  such as  Britain  and  Sweden,  have\r\n\r\nalready  taken the step of setting up individual training  or\r\n\r\nlearning accounts for their workers.  The question is:   will\r\n\r\nour  Government also consider the setting up of such accounts\r\n\r\nfor our workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to raise an issue\r\n\r\nwith  respect to whether enough money has been set  aside  to\r\n\r\ntrain  our  professionals, executives and managers  above  40\r\n\r\nyears of age who have lost their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various funding or training funds and schemes,\r\n\r\nsuch as the SDF, SRP, Education Endowment Fund, available for\r\n\r\nworkers.   On  the  other hand, except for  some  pockets  of\r\n\r\ntraining  fund available under the MOM Work Skills and  Self-Employed  Training for unemployed executives, there seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  dearth  of  such  initiatives for  the  professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives and managers.  For them to survive and progress in\r\n\r\nthe new economy, they must continually upgrade themselves and\r\n\r\nacquire  new  knowledge and skills through higher  education.\r\n\r\nWhile  requests to use the CPF fund for such purposes, except\r\n\r\nonly  for  studies  at NUS and NTU, have understandably  been\r\n\r\nfrowned  upon  by Government, especially when the  CPF  money\r\n\r\ncould  be easily lost through poor academic course, we should\r\n\r\nalso  not  be averse to exploring alternative ways  by  which\r\n\r\nfunding   can   be   made  available  to   help   train   our\r\n\r\nprofessionals, executives and managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the Government\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the setting up of what I call a HEED Fund,  which\r\n\r\nstands    for   Higher   Education   Endowment   Fund,    for\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  executives and managers.  The Government  can\r\n\r\nhelp  to  encourage employers, employer groups,  professional\r\n\r\nbodies,    charitable    organisations,    foundations    and\r\n\r\nindividuals,  to  donate  to  the  fund  and  to  match  such\r\n\r\ndonations,  as  they  have done for the  endowment  fund  for\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  HEED Fund will help to empower professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives and managers, with relevant skills which, in turn,\r\n\r\nwill help to increase their employability and ability to fend\r\n\r\nfor themselves,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough   self-employment,  part-time   and   flexible   work\r\n\r\narrangement.   The  availability of such resource  will  also\r\n\r\nhelp  to  attract  investments towards  making  Singapore  an\r\n\r\neducational   hub.   My  question  really  is   whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be positively disposed towards the  idea  of\r\n\r\nmatching  donations for this proposed fund,  and  whether  it\r\n\r\nwill lend a hand in facilitating the setting up of this fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  on  behalf of my Minister, I  share  the  concerns\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by the hon. Members, Ms Irene Ng,  Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang,  Mdm Halimah, Mr Hawazi, Mr Ong and Mr Zainul  Abidin,\r\n\r\nregarding   unemployment  and  how   we   can   better   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  find  jobs.  This Government  ran  the  General\r\n\r\nElection   on  the  platform  of  \"Jobs,  Jobs,  Jobs\".    An\r\n\r\noverwhelming  75% of the public voted for us, based  on  that\r\n\r\npledge.   We  are honouring that commitment.  The  Jobs  Task\r\n\r\nForce  was  formed in January, 2002, to oversee the  national\r\n\r\neffort to help our workers cope with the downturn.  Thus far,\r\n\r\nwe have some impact, albeit limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how successful have our efforts\r\n\r\nbeen  together with the job centres and the CDCs, NTUC, SNEF,\r\n\r\nSPEM  and other self-help groups.  We are helping about 1,200\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to secure jobs each month.  About  70%  of  jobs\r\n\r\nseekers   at   our  Career  Centres  receive  referrals   for\r\n\r\ninterviews,  and 15% of them are successfully  placed.   Many\r\n\r\nworkers  continue  to  harbour misconceptions  about  certain\r\n\r\nindustries and are unwilling to take on jobs offered.  We are\r\n\r\nhighlighting  some of these industries, like marine  industry\r\n\r\nand  hotel  sector,  which  have been  chronically  short  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  where jobs are available.  We  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nchange  mindsets.  We need, and will continue, to work harder\r\n\r\nto increase the number of job placements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with Mr Hawazi that more counselling\r\n\r\nand  training are required.  In part, our limited success has\r\n\r\nbeen that there are a limited number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs.   If  the well has a little water, no matter  how  many\r\n\r\ntimes  you  throw the bucket in, you will draw little  water.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  that the well is completely dry, but  there  are\r\n\r\nlittle  returns.  The other limitation is that Singapore  has\r\n\r\nnever  had  a  protracted time of unemployment, so  that  the\r\n\r\nexpertise  in terms of job placement, job counselling,  never\r\n\r\nhad  the opportunities nor the length of time to develop.   I\r\n\r\nam not ashamed of this.  I am quite happy that we do not have\r\n\r\nthe  expertise.  But we have learned as we go along.  We will\r\n\r\ncontinue to try to do better.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the MPs will rightly accept, the solution to\r\n\r\nunemployment is not job placement but job creation.   Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat Kwang rightly pointed out that even if you train someone\r\n\r\nand  there  are  no  jobs, it is a futile  effort.   The  MTI\r\n\r\neconomists report that every 1% of GDP growth translates into\r\n\r\n14,000  jobs.   So  we  need the  economy  to  grow.   It  is\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility to  create  the  conditions  for\r\n\r\ngrowth.   But each Singaporean must equip himself or  herself\r\n\r\nwith  the  necessary skills so that when the  uptake  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy arrives, he or she can be employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, equanimity is in order. This is not the\r\n\r\nfirst  recession Singapore has faced.  Severe as it is,  this\r\n\r\nrecession  would not last forever.  Neither would it  be  the\r\n\r\nlast.   All countries face business cycles.  So the pessimism\r\n\r\nin some quarters of our society is overdone.  Yes, China is a\r\n\r\nformidable  challenge.   But  the  Singapore  worker  is   no\r\n\r\npushover.   As Minister George Yeo rightly pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nWashington-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence rates\r\n\r\nour  workforce  of the highest quality.  We had uninterrupted\r\n\r\ngrowth  for  the last decade and our surpluses were  ploughed\r\n\r\nback  into  infrastructure development and education.   These\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  remain  competitive  advantages.   There   are\r\n\r\nadjustments to be made.  But if we are to emerge stronger, we\r\n\r\nhave to learn lessons from this current recession.  We should\r\n\r\nmove forward with our chins up and our confidence intact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important lesson to be learned is that life-long learning is here to stay. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what\r\n\r\nhas  happened to the Manpower 21 plans.  They are  very  much\r\n\r\nalive.  I agree fully with Mr Zainul Abidin and Mr Heng  Chee\r\n\r\nHow   that  life-long  learning  is  a  strategic  capability\r\n\r\nnecessary for our survival.  Lifelong learning must  permeate\r\n\r\nthe  air  we  breathe, the way we think.  It is no  longer  a\r\n\r\nchoice,  but  an  imperative for both workers and  employers,\r\n\r\nwithout  which  we  would  not  be  able  to  secure  further\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business cycles are shorter and growth sectors may\r\n\r\nchange  quickly and completely.  Companies, like Philips  and\r\n\r\nMatsushita,  that have relocated their production  operations\r\n\r\nmay never come back.  Workers will have to be more nimble and\r\n\r\nexpand  their  skill  sets.   It  is  Government's  role  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  create  jobs  and  provide  training  for\r\n\r\nworkers.   But no one can promise jobs that will always  fall\r\n\r\nwithin the comfort and familiarity zones and expectations  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi wanted to know the progress of our Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme.   Mdm  Halimah  also  echoed  these\r\n\r\nconcerns  and  wanted  to  know how  effective  our  training\r\n\r\nschemes have been in helping workers cope in this transition.\r\n\r\nSome  are  heeding the call for more training and benefiting.\r\n\r\nTo-date,  about  80,000  workers have  taken  up  our  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme since its  inception  in  1999.   Of\r\n\r\nthese,   70%   of  the  employers  noticed  an  increase   in\r\n\r\nproductivity.  65% were able to find jobs within six  months.\r\n\r\nMENDAKI,  one of our surrogate employers, conducted a  survey\r\n\r\nlast  year  among the retrenched.  70%, after attending  SRP,\r\n\r\nsecured  employment in three months, and 80%  said  that  the\r\n\r\ntraining  they  received was useful in  helping  them  secure\r\n\r\nemployment.  But I agree with Mdm Halimah and other MPs  that\r\n\r\nmore needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey in 2001 showed that three out of 10 firms did\r\n\r\nnot  provide employees with training.  So we have an  arduous\r\n\r\ntask to convince employers and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are current issues that the Jobs Task Force and the ERC\r\n\r\nare  grappling  with.  How do we accomplish this?   Is  it  a\r\n\r\nquestion   of  insufficient  funds?   I  do  not  think   so.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has set aside about $200 million for its  various\r\n\r\nschemes  and  for various training programmes - the  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Assistance  Scheme,   the   Lifelong   Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Scheme,  the  Skills Development  Fund,  the  SRP.\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister Lee has publicly committed more funds,\r\n\r\nif required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Yeo have suggested that if we\r\n\r\nindividualised these funds - in other words, each person gets\r\n\r\nhis  own learning account - then the user may be more  likely\r\n\r\nto  use them.  If we did, individualise these accounts,  will\r\n\r\nmore  people  take up courses?  Perhaps.  But there  will  be\r\n\r\nsignificant drawbacks.  Even if we say 40% of account holders\r\n\r\nuse  their  funds, the remainder would be wastage.   Even  if\r\n\r\nmore  went for training so that they can use up the money  in\r\n\r\nthat  account, we might not achieve our ultimate goal,  which\r\n\r\nis to enhance employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individualised learning account is not an idea which\r\n\r\nwe  summarily dismiss, but we should try other options first.\r\n\r\nOther  countries, like Denmark, have had more  success,  even\r\n\r\nwithout  these  individualised  accounts,  in  getting  their\r\n\r\nworkers to accept further training as a way of life.  We will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to learn from them.       One recurring  impression\r\n\r\ngleaned  from their successes is that specific and  different\r\n\r\napproaches,  quite  different  from  student  teaching,   are\r\n\r\nrequired for adult learning.  I guess that is intuitive.   We\r\n\r\nall  realise  that  as  we  grow  older,  we  tend  to  learn\r\n\r\ndifferently, and our motivations also change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mdm Halimah and Mr Hawazi that the more\r\n\r\ntargeted train-and-place scheme might be more effective.  MOM\r\n\r\nlaunched  such  schemes with NTUC and  EDB  for  training  of\r\n\r\naerospace technicians and core centre operators.  We will try\r\n\r\nto expand on these schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng made a similar point that we need to do\r\n\r\nmore,  rather than the ad hoc training and matching.  Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat  Kwang  echoed these sentiments.  Indeed, to expand  and\r\n\r\ndeepen  the effectiveness of these training initiatives,  the\r\n\r\nERC  is  considering  the  need  for  a  national  continuing\r\n\r\nemployability and training body, including a centre for adult\r\n\r\nlearning.   These  bodies  can then work  more  closely  with\r\n\r\nindustry  employers and professional associations to identify\r\n\r\nnew and emerging skills and needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create a training and education system for\r\n\r\nworking  people that is seamless so that prior  learning  and\r\n\r\nwork  experience can contribute to the acquisition of  formal\r\n\r\nqualifications.  We have to study and understand why and  how\r\n\r\nadults learn.  We have to, as Mr Low Thia Khiang says, deepen\r\n\r\nour  capabilities in career counselling so  as  to  help  our\r\n\r\nworkers plan for alternative careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that more attention\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be paid to our professionals, executives, managers\r\n\r\nand technicians.  They now form 40% of our workforce.  So  if\r\n\r\nwe  exclude our foreign workers, which constitute about  25%,\r\n\r\nPEMs form the majority of our workforce.  It has by virtue of\r\n\r\nits  composition become a strategic advantage.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nshortsighted  not  to enhance this asset.  We  must  oversee,\r\n\r\nguide,  facilitate the strengthening of our middle-management\r\n\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some schemes in place, together with EDB, in\r\n\r\nterms  of enhancing new technology with IDA, in terms of  the\r\n\r\ncritical  infocomm technology, and with MAS in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector development, and for the strategic  manpower\r\n\r\nconversion  programme with MOM.  But we  can  and  should  do\r\n\r\nmore.  I welcome the idea that Mdm Ho brought up in terms  of\r\n\r\nher  HEED.  Government will facilitate, but whether  we  will\r\n\r\ndonate is something that we will further consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mdm Halimah brought the point across of older\r\n\r\nworkers, which I will touch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps tomorrow when more Members bring up the subject.  But\r\n\r\nshe   also  brought  up  another  aspect,  ie,  to  eliminate\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  job advertisements.  I would like  to  inform\r\n\r\nher  that  a Tripartite Committee, comprising representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  employers, trade unions and the Ministry  of  Manpower,\r\n\r\nwas  set  up  in  1999 to study these issues.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nrecommended  that an educational, instead of  a  legislative,\r\n\r\napproach  be adopted.  In line with the promotional  approach\r\n\r\nin  dealing  with  this  issue, there  have  been  guidelines\r\n\r\nintroduced on non-discriminatory job advertisements to  guide\r\n\r\nemployers  on  how  job advertisements  should  be  presented\r\n\r\nwithout   discriminating  factors,  such  as  age,   language\r\n\r\nrequirements  or other criteria.  The Tripartite  Committee's\r\n\r\nguidelines have been implemented effectively.  To-date,  only\r\n\r\na   small   percentage   of   job  advertisements   stipulate\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  criteria such as gender, age, race,  religion\r\n\r\nor   language.   Notwithstanding  that  these  discriminatory\r\n\r\nadvertisements  are  no  longer a serious  problem,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to urge employers to put into practice selection  of\r\n\r\ncandidates based on their merits and capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the exercise, the message we want to\r\n\r\nsend  to  investors  is  that  when  they  set  up  shops  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Singapore workforce has got skills,  training\r\n\r\nand attitudes that far surpass that of our competitors.  Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  cost  more, but the Singapore brand worker is well  worth\r\n\r\nit.   When we can do that successfully, we will then be  able\r\n\r\nto create jobs, jobs and more jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, do I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek a clarification from the Minister of State?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know from the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State whether he is satisfied with the  way  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  offers  employment assistance.

Even if we did more, would we be more successful?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  a  little bit.  But if there are no jobs, no  matter\r\n\r\nhow  much  we  do it, that is not a permanent solution.   The\r\n\r\nsolution to unemployment is not more job placements  but  job\r\n\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, our workers have contributed\r\n\r\nimmensely to the development and growth of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies   they   work  for.   They  are   generally   well-disciplined, hardworking, loyal and productive.  In the  face\r\n\r\nof   economic   globalisation  and   the   resulting   keener\r\n\r\ncompetition  for investments, jobs and markets,  our  workers\r\n\r\nnow  know  that  they  have to change, and  this  has  caused\r\n\r\nanxiety  as  they fear that they may join the  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nretrenched and the unemployed.  They have to make adjustments\r\n\r\nto  the  new work environment where employment structure  has\r\n\r\nchanged and where the types of jobs have changed, the pattern\r\n\r\nof  work has changed and where there is no more certainty  of\r\n\r\nlifelong employment with the same employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all these changes, we should ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  relationship  among  the social  partners  -  employers,\r\n\r\nunions  as  representatives of workers and the  Government  - must prevail, and be improved especially as we are undergoing\r\n\r\nunprecedented changes.  Our hope to see a new social  compact\r\n\r\nmust  include  an even stronger cooperation among  the  three\r\n\r\npartners.  This relationship can be best demonstrated at  the\r\n\r\ncompany  level.  But this is where it seems we have  to  work\r\n\r\nthe hardest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a union adviser to four unions, I have received\r\n\r\nfeedback that some employers tend to be intolerant, and  even\r\n\r\nmore   intolerant  now,  to  simple  mistakes   among   their\r\n\r\nemployees,  especially  during these difficult  times.   When\r\n\r\nworkers  fear  that they may lose their jobs,  such  attitude\r\n\r\namong employers creates even more fear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  them.  I would like to know from the Minister if there\r\n\r\nhas  been an increase in the number of complaints by  workers\r\n\r\nof the intolerant behaviour or attitude of employers, and how\r\n\r\nare these problems between employers and employees resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, as many of my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues have highlighted, job security is one of  the  top\r\n\r\nconcerns  of our people today.  Minister George Yeo mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  while  our economy  will  recover,  the  job\r\n\r\nsituation   is  likely  to  deteriorate  further  before   it\r\n\r\nimproves.   The  problem is more acute  even  for  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Manpower Minister Dr Lee said on 13th May that only\r\n\r\n8%  of  the  job  seekers aged above 40  who  approached  his\r\n\r\nMinistry for help was successfully placed.  This situation is\r\n\r\nrather  worrying.  Workers aged between 40 and 50 are  likely\r\n\r\nto  be at their most productive age.  At the same time,  they\r\n\r\nare  also  most likely to be at a point where they  have  the\r\n\r\nheaviest financial commitments.  Being out of job at this age\r\n\r\nwill  pose  great pressure not only to the workers themselves\r\n\r\nbut to their families, including their children.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Minister also said that one of the main\r\n\r\nreasons  commonly  cited includes high wage  costs  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  our seniority-based wage system.  Sir, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister what plans his Ministry has to encourage our\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees to shift away from  the  seniority-based  system  to one that is based on workers'  productivity\r\n\r\nand contribution.  I know that there has been some talk about\r\n\r\npossible  reduction to the CPF rate contributed by  employers\r\n\r\nin  order to help employers lower their cost of hiring  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  While the details have not been announced, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the Minister to consider these  changes  very\r\n\r\ncarefully because any reduction in CPF will have far reaching\r\n\r\nimplications and may affect the workers' ability  to  service\r\n\r\ntheir housing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, these changes will not only affect those\r\n\r\nwho are retrenched, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   also  affect  those  who  are  currently  productively\r\n\r\nemployed.  Worse, it may deal a double blow to those who have\r\n\r\ntaken a voluntary pay cut in order to find a job, or just  to\r\n\r\nstay  in their current job.  Sir, I would like to suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that  it may be useful to  consider  promoting\r\n\r\ngreater  use  of a flexible wage system, instead  of  cutting\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution for older workers.   Some  years\r\n\r\nago,  the  concept  of monthly variable allowance  (MVA)  was\r\n\r\nintroduced.   It may not have been as widely accepted  as  we\r\n\r\nwish  because  of the recession.  But as Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState Mr Khaw said just now, let us have a little faith, give\r\n\r\nit time, let us give it a try and it may work after all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of the across-the-board annual increment in\r\n\r\nour  seniority-based wage system, perhaps the MVA concept can\r\n\r\nbe  modified  and extended to deal with the seniority  issue.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  workers can be given a lower annual  increment\r\n\r\njust  to reflect inflation while additional increments should\r\n\r\nbe  given in the form of MVA, and this will be adjusted  from\r\n\r\nyear to year to reflect the productivity and contribution  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual workers.  This means that the wages of  older\r\n\r\nworkers  may  go  up or may go down, or may  stay  the  same,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the individuals.  Workers who  can  contribute\r\n\r\nmore due to their experience and maturity can continue to  be\r\n\r\nrewarded through higher MVAs as they get older.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  those  who have been doing the same job all  the  time\r\n\r\nwill not become costly as they get older because the MVAs can\r\n\r\nbe reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the greater emphasis on a flexible wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  such as MVA, is a more effective long-term  solution\r\n\r\nthan   cutting  the  employer's  contribution  to  the   CPF.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  MVA, or a modified form of it,  to  help  older\r\n\r\nworkers before deciding on cutting the CPF rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, when Singapore met with a\r\n\r\nrecession in 1985, an important lesson was learnt,  and  that\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat business cost, including wage cost, cannot be too rigid.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  companies will not be able to adjust to  changing\r\n\r\nconditions  and  may  go  bust prematurely.   And  when  that\r\n\r\nhappens, workers lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from that, the first component of flexibility in\r\n\r\nour wage system, namely, the idea of having mid-year or year-end  bonuses,  as  an  adjustable quantity,  was  encouraged.\r\n\r\nThus,  when a company does better, it must reward its workers\r\n\r\nwith  better  bonuses, and vice versa.  That flexibility  was\r\n\r\nadequate  in  a  fairly stable environment.  But  as  product\r\n\r\ncycle  shortened and the pace of change increased,  then  the\r\n\r\nmore  refined  instrument of flexibility is  needed  and,  by\r\n\r\n\"refined\",  I  mean that it should not be an across-the-board\r\n\r\nnational  move,  like a national CPF cut, or an  annual  move\r\n\r\nthat  you  can  only  do  so with,  say,  a  year-end  bonus.\r\n\r\nSomething more timely and company-based was needed.   And  it\r\n\r\nwas  exactly for this reason that the National Wages  Council\r\n\r\nrecommended  the monthly variable component (MVC)  since  its\r\n\r\ndeliberation in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to ask the Minister for an update\r\n\r\non  the  progress  of  the implementation  of  MVC  and  what\r\n\r\nadditional  measures the Government is taking to promote  its\r\n\r\nadoption  so  as  to minimise the need for retrenchments  and\r\n\r\nalso to minimise the need for any future across-the-board CPF\r\n\r\ncuts.   Sir,  I  particularly want to mention  this  because,\r\n\r\nwhilst  we  are  all very much caught up in  the  discussions\r\n\r\nabout  proposed changes to our CPF system, I think we  should\r\n\r\nalso  remember  some of the other systemic  adjustments  that\r\n\r\nhave  earlier  been proposed and are in the course  of  being\r\n\r\nimplemented and we should not be distracted from  putting  in\r\n\r\nplace the necessary structures in order to safeguard the long-term cost effectiveness and prospects for our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the Manpower Minister\r\n\r\nearlier told us about the problems faced by older workers  to\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  in  today's market.  It is true that  one  reason\r\n\r\nolder  workers find it harder to get a job is our  seniority-based wage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem.  First of all, I would like to put on record  that  I\r\n\r\ndo  not support the idea of lowering the CPF contribution for\r\n\r\nolder workers.  You may be older, but if you can do the  same\r\n\r\njob  just as well as a younger person, why should you take  a\r\n\r\nCPF  cut  for  it?   What is needed  is  not  a  cut  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF but a change in the compensation system  under\r\n\r\nwhich  workers are paid - make sure that they  are  paid  not\r\n\r\naccording  to  their age but according to  their  specialised\r\n\r\nskills  and  their  contribution to  the  company.   Like  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues before me, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Heng Chee How, I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the Manpower Ministry to look at the  flexi-wage\r\n\r\nsystem  and  see how it can be implemented and  restructured,\r\n\r\nrather  than cut the CPF rate for older workers.  The  result\r\n\r\nwould be that companies would no longer assume that they have\r\n\r\nto pay older workers more.  Our older workers should also get\r\n\r\nused to this.  But the employers must give them that chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a misconception to say that older workers are\r\n\r\nreluctant to take on new challenges or harder work.   Let  me\r\n\r\ncite  an example of my office colleague, K.C. Vijayan.   K.C.\r\n\r\nVijayan was a Prison Officer for 24 years and he retired when\r\n\r\nhe  was  50, about two years ago.  Conventional wisdom  would\r\n\r\nsay  that,  well, most people would want to  take  it  easier\r\n\r\nafter  retirement.  But, no, at the age of 50,  he  became  a\r\n\r\ncrime  reporter for the Straits Times.  Those of  us  in  the\r\n\r\nnews  business know that the job of a crime reporter is quite\r\n\r\ndemanding  and to write for a daily newspaper  is  also  very\r\n\r\ntaxing, with tight deadlines to meet.  And he is working next\r\n\r\nto  younger reporters eager to prove themselves.  I asked him\r\n\r\nwhy  he  wanted  to  take on such a daunting  challenge.   He\r\n\r\nreplied that he wanted to be relevant to society, and the way\r\n\r\nto be relevant is to be around people who are younger and who\r\n\r\nare at the centre of things.  Then you would know how you can\r\n\r\ncontribute and the role you can play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, negative attitudes towards older adults are a major\r\n\r\nbarrier  to  moving  forward.  Many employers  view  them  as\r\n\r\nproblems  to be solved, rather than resources to  be  tapped.\r\n\r\nOlder adults themselves often believe these stereotypes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  are  consequently fearful of making changes and  seizing\r\n\r\nnew  opportunities.  The employment system should change  and\r\n\r\nso  should  the  compensation system  so  that,  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible, age is not a factor in employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, two years ago, when we talked\r\n\r\nabout  older  workers, we referred to workers 60  and  above.\r\n\r\nLast year, when we talked about older workers, we referred to\r\n\r\nworkers 50 and above.  Now, if you are 40 and above, you  are\r\n\r\nconsidered as older workers.  And if you lose your job, it is\r\n\r\nvery difficult to find re-employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we always cite McDonalds as a model employer which\r\n\r\nemploys  older workers.  I believe we can come  out  with  an\r\n\r\nincentive   scheme  to  help  some  local  food  chains   and\r\n\r\ncoffeeshop chains to re-employ older workers, like McDonalds.\r\n\r\nMany coffeeshops and food courts are employing a large number\r\n\r\nof  foreign workers even, at this point of time, when we  are\r\n\r\nfacing a high level of unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to urge the Ministry to come out\r\n\r\nwith  a  creative, generous incentive scheme for food  courts\r\n\r\nand  coffeeshops  to  implement work  redesign  and  flexible\r\n\r\nworking  arrangements for 40 plus workers.   We  should  also\r\n\r\nreview  the existing work permit policy which has  been  very\r\n\r\nliberal  in  allowing foreign workers to work in  coffeeshops\r\n\r\nand food courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Many of our colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  talked about the problem of older workers.  As a labour\r\n\r\nMP,  I  would like to raise my concern for the older workers.\r\n\r\nOur  main concern is the worsening unemployment situation  of\r\n\r\nour older workers, many of whom are lowly-educated.  Although\r\n\r\nwe have been urging them, from time to time, to upgrade their\r\n\r\nskills,  we still read in the newspapers that many  of  these\r\n\r\nolder  workers  are  turned away at job  interviews,  despite\r\n\r\nhaving taken up our advice to upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, it is not that they do not possess the\r\n\r\nright skills or mindset, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore often than not, it is their age that prevented them from\r\n\r\ngetting   the  job  they  want.   Even  in  many   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and statutory boards, we find that many  mundane\r\n\r\njobs,  such as sweepers, car park attendants, cleaners,  etc,\r\n\r\nare farmed out to contractors.  As we all know, many of these\r\n\r\ncontractors  operate  on the basis of maximising  profit.  So\r\n\r\nthey  would like to employ the cheaper foreign workers rather\r\n\r\nthan  local workers.  Although our local workers are  not  as\r\n\r\nnimble  or  young as the younger foreign workers,  they  have\r\n\r\nmore than made up for this with their experience and maturity\r\n\r\nin  handling difficult situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if given the opportunity, they will be able to put\r\n\r\ntheir  talents  to  good  use.  In  certain  industries,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in day-care centres and hospitals, we can find  ways\r\n\r\nto  make  use of our local workers and put their  talents  to\r\n\r\ngood  use.   Our  Ministry for Manpower  has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  give  the  companies  that   employ  local\r\n\r\nworkers some form of relief for six months. However,  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  that  the  period  of six months  is  insufficient  in\r\n\r\ntesting  out  the local workers, can the relief be  extended?\r\n\r\nUnder  this  scheme, older workers can continue  to  work  in\r\n\r\nthese  companies.   This  scheme  has  not  been  given  much\r\n\r\npublicity  and most employers are not aware of the  existence\r\n\r\nof such a scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government Ministries and statutory boards are the\r\n\r\nlargest  employer in Singapore.  I wish the statutory  boards\r\n\r\nand the Ministries would take the lead and set an example  in\r\n\r\nrecruiting  our  older workers so that other companies  could\r\n\r\nfollow  suit.   We  often read in the  newspapers  that  some\r\n\r\nSingapore  employers were giving ang pows on certain  festive\r\n\r\noccasions  to  senior citizens as a form of charity.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthese  employers can also employ the older workers.
