They  presumably will be  removed  from\r\n\r\noffice  should  at the next election another  Party\r\n\r\nform  the  Government. There is therefore  a  basic\r\n\r\ndistinction between the Political Secretary and the\r\n\r\ncareer  civil  servant whose duty it  is  to  serve\r\n\r\nimpartially  and  to the best of  his  ability  any\r\n\r\nelected government. The post of Political Secretary\r\n\r\ndoes  not therefore offer a career and, because  of\r\n\r\nthis   and   the   difference  in   functions   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  from those of  the  career  civil\r\n\r\nservants,   is  not  subject  to  the  disciplinary\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   General  Orders.  The   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary is a member of the political party in the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of the day.

Our  basic attitude and  philosophy  on\r\n\r\nthis  question  have been stated  and  restated  on\r\n\r\ninnumerable  past occasions when the Party  was  in\r\n\r\nthe Opposition. However, today is the first time we\r\n\r\nrestate  the  position in some detail after  having\r\n\r\nassumed  office.  It  has  not  been  made  earlier\r\n\r\nbecause  up  to the third meeting of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  on the 8th October  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  us  to make any statements  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter. Suffice it to say between the 5th June  and\r\n\r\n28th  August  there was correspondence between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, the British Government  and\r\n\r\nourselves to clarify the rights, powers and  duties\r\n\r\nof  the  Internal Security Council as laid down  in\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Constitution. At the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst meeting of the Internal Security Council, the\r\n\r\nprovisions  contained in sections 65  and  66  were\r\n\r\nconsidered, and the powers of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  were noted and placed on record in  simple\r\n\r\nlanguage as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) \"The competence of the Singapore Government to\r\n\r\nformulate   and  implement  the  policy   affecting\r\n\r\ninternal  security  is subject  to  the  overriding\r\n\r\npowers of the Internal Security Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) \"In addition to consultation and decisions on\r\n\r\nquestions of policy, the Internal Security  Council\r\n\r\nis  competent to make executive decisions  for  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of internal security in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nany  such  decision which has been communicated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government must be given  immediate\r\n\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) \"The Singapore Government is competent to\r\n\r\ntake  executive  action on  its  own  authority  in\r\n\r\nmatters  of  internal security. For its  part,  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council is  competent  to  take\r\n\r\ndecisions in these same matters, and in so  far  as\r\n\r\nit  does those decisions, by virtue of section  66,\r\n\r\nparagraph (2), endorse, supplement or override  any\r\n\r\ndecisions which the Singapore Government may itself\r\n\r\nhave  taken and constitute binding directives  with\r\n\r\nwhich  the subsequent decisions and actions of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government must conform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) \"The Singapore Government should not take any\r\n\r\naction  in  any  field which would be  contrary  to\r\n\r\npolicy  already  agreed by,  or  decisions  already\r\n\r\ntaken  by, the Council or would be likely to  raise\r\n\r\npolicy   issues,   or   would  have   repercussions\r\n\r\naffecting   internal   security,   without    prior\r\n\r\nreference to the Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has considered it\r\n\r\nimportant that not only the constitutional but also\r\n\r\nthe  military and economic power positions  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  Governments participating  in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council should be clearly recognised. This\r\n\r\npower position prevails for this term of office  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government up till June 1964, and will not  be\r\n\r\nchanged  just  by  the United Kingdom  Commissioner\r\n\r\nwithdrawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  on\r\n\r\nthe 3rd December, 1959. We have nothing to gain  by\r\n\r\ntrying to assume, as the last Government did to its\r\n\r\nown  destruction, powers and responsibilities which\r\n\r\nwere  not properly within its province. But at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time such powers and responsibilities as  are\r\n\r\nwithin  our competence, we shall discharge  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest in the interests of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed to the provisions for an Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council   in  June  1957,   giving   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  representative  a  deciding\r\n\r\nvote on our Security Council, because we recognised\r\n\r\nthat  that  was  better  than  giving  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment the decisive say and that, in  fact,  if\r\n\r\nwe  achieved independence we can only do  so  as  a\r\n\r\nMember  State of the Federation, in which case  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government would have a decisive  voice\r\n\r\nin  our national policies anyway. Therefore,  until\r\n\r\nindependence through merger is achieved, we  accept\r\n\r\nthe position of the Federation Government having  a\r\n\r\ndeciding vote in the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from the constitutional position, it\r\n\r\nmight  be useful to remember also the military  and\r\n\r\neconomic positions of the State of Singapore vis-a-vis  the  British  Government  and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. We have the doubtful honour  of  having\r\n\r\nthe  largest  and  most important British  military\r\n\r\nbase  East  of  Cyprus. The British Government  has\r\n\r\nalso a defence pact with the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nIn   effect,  this  means  that,  to  succeed,  the\r\n\r\nCommunist challenge for supremacy would have to  be\r\n\r\nstrong enough to subdue both the armed might of the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the British, because  in  military\r\n\r\nterms  a  Communist Singapore would not be possible\r\n\r\nuntil  there  is a Communist Malaya.  No  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  can  hope to capture power in Singapore  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  exist,  unless there  was  already  a\r\n\r\nCommunist Government in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so simple an analysis that it is not\r\n\r\nworth further argument or discussion. The fact that\r\n\r\nthe  tactics of the Communist Party of Malaya  have\r\n\r\nshifted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  emphasis from armed struggle to  penetration\r\n\r\nand  subversion does not alter the validity of  the\r\n\r\nabove analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the economic power position is not so easily\r\n\r\ndiscernible    and    requires    more    elaborate\r\n\r\nexplanation.  For  the last 140  years  of  British\r\n\r\nrule,  whatever the constitutional niceties of  the\r\n\r\nColonies  in the Straits Settlements, the Federated\r\n\r\nMalay  States  and  the Unfederated  Malay  States,\r\n\r\nMalaya  was in fact one economic unit, administered\r\n\r\nas  such by one civil administration manned by  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Civil Service. Now, since independence,  we\r\n\r\nhave  watched with concern the growing tendency  to\r\n\r\nseparate the economy. A fact worth noting  is  that\r\n\r\nin  both  the  Federation and Singapore,  the  same\r\n\r\nBritish trading interests have investments.  It  is\r\n\r\nobviously  in the interest of not only the  British\r\n\r\nbut also of Malaya to remain as one economy. But if\r\n\r\nfor  political reasons the position cannot be  held\r\n\r\nin the immediate future, then we run grave risks of\r\n\r\nhaving  the  British and the Federation Governments\r\n\r\nsettling  such political differences  that  we  may\r\n\r\nhave from time to time through economic instead  of\r\n\r\npolitical action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, we have considered it important\r\n\r\nat   the   outset  of  our  discussions  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation to make it unmistakably clear  that  our\r\n\r\nhope is to co-operate and not to compete with them,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the economic and social fields. But\r\n\r\nto  avoid  any misunderstanding, we have deemed  it\r\n\r\nimportant  that we should not mislead  by  word  or\r\n\r\nconduct our British overlord, or anyone else,  into\r\n\r\nbelieving that the Singapore Government can be made\r\n\r\ninto a stooge government. We shall do everything in\r\n\r\nour  power to work for the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  These  interests demand  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nreunification  of  the  two  territories,  but  co-operation  must  be on the basis of mutual  respect\r\n\r\nand  adherence  to  certain  principles  agreed  to\r\n\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence it was necessary to clarify the difference\r\n\r\nin  approaches to security problems between a  non-Communist  Socialist Singapore  Government  and  an\r\n\r\nanti-Communist Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government stressed their different\r\n\r\nposition, particularly as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresult  of  a militant Communist insurrection.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government  has  stated  the  following\r\n\r\nprinciples by which it would be guided on  security\r\n\r\nproblems:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Singapore Government shall not act as a\r\n\r\nbuffer  to protect pro-Communist Party forces\r\n\r\nagainst the Federation Government. These pro-Communist Party forces, some originally  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation and some from Singapore,  who\r\n\r\nare  hoping  to use Singapore as a  refitting\r\n\r\nbase  for  their struggle in the  Federation,\r\n\r\nmust take the consequences of their actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) That it is the duty of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to defend in Singapore the  rights\r\n\r\nof  left-wing non-Communist Party forces  and\r\n\r\nto  encourage their growth. It is the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment's   view   that   the   democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist     is    the    most     effective\r\n\r\ncountervailing  force in the labour  movement\r\n\r\nin  this  country,  and that  our  policy  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to aid the growth of the democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  and  not a Communist  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) That while the Singapore Government shall\r\n\r\nby  social, economic and political  policies,\r\n\r\nnegate  the  Communist claim  that  only  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   can  resolve  the   social   and\r\n\r\neconomic injustices in our society, it  would\r\n\r\nin  the meantime prevent the security of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic state from being undermined by the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having made our stand on principle, we\r\n\r\ndiscussed the question of some 30 odd detainees who\r\n\r\nwere  arrested  by the previous government  in  two\r\n\r\npurges - in October 1956 and September 1957.  On  the\r\n\r\n22nd  May,  1959, during the election  campaign,  I\r\n\r\nstated  that  \"The  P.A.P. would  not  take  office\r\n\r\nunless  former  members  of  the  Party  who   were\r\n\r\nintimately  connected  with the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee and who are now in jail are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreleased.\"  This  pledge we have  fulfilled.  Eight\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members all those intimately connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the Party were released  at  our\r\n\r\ninsistence on the 4th June before we assumed office\r\n\r\non  5th  June.  On the 1st June, 1959,  immediately\r\n\r\nafter   the   elections  and  before  forming   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, my Party's Secretary-General,  now  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, stated that: \"The  record  of  the\r\n\r\nother  detainees will be reviewed and justice  done\r\n\r\non  the merits of each case.\" At present we do  not\r\n\r\nknow the full facts leading to their detention. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. does not intend to be or even appear  to  be\r\n\r\nthe hand-maid of the Communist Party. But we do not\r\n\r\nintend  to  soil our hands by putting them  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  gloves  once used by the previous Government.\r\n\r\nThat is still our stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a lenient line and released four detainees\r\n\r\non  the  22nd day of June, 1959. Immediately  after\r\n\r\nthat,  the Internal Security Council joined in  the\r\n\r\nreview  of  all cases. On the 1st day  of  October,\r\n\r\n1959,  after  prior consideration by  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council,  four  women   detainees   were\r\n\r\nreleased. The work of the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nof  reviewing the other cases is still  proceeding.\r\n\r\nBut  let  us  make it clear to all  concerned  that\r\n\r\nwhilst  we  do not wish to be in any way associated\r\n\r\nwith   the   purge  carried  out  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we shall be less inhibited  in  taking\r\n\r\nour own steps to ensure that there is no recurrence\r\n\r\nof pro-Communist Party activities. Those who embark\r\n\r\non such activities do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a convenient time for us to say that\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council is vigilant  and  on\r\n\r\nthe watchout for any re-appearance of pro-Communist\r\n\r\nactivists  in  rural organisations,  trade  unions,\r\n\r\nstudent  groups  and  all the other  societies  and\r\n\r\nassociations  which  were  formerly  exploited  for\r\n\r\nunited front purposes. All we wish to say at  this\r\n\r\nstage  is  that ill-advised activists should  learn\r\n\r\nthe lessons of 1956 and 1957. It is our business to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  welfare  and  well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  have  no intention to  jeopardise  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people as a whole for the benefit of\r\n\r\na small group whose cause we consider mistaken.

It was with circumspection that  we  set\r\n\r\nout  the principles which guided us, and which  led\r\n\r\nus  to  the  conclusion that as long as  there  are\r\n\r\nEmergency  laws in the Federation,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nEmergency laws in Singapore. But for the benefit of\r\n\r\nMembers  who  were  not in this House  on  the  8th\r\n\r\nOctober  last year, may I refer them to  Volume  3,\r\n\r\nNo.  9  of  the Hansard, column 800 for my  speech,\r\n\r\ncolumn  815  for  the speech of my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\npresent Minister for Health, and column 819 for the\r\n\r\nspeech of my colleague, the Member for Tampines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I read a few passages out of the speech I\r\n\r\nmade on that occasion? The beginning of column 803:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But, there may be people - I am quite sure that\r\n\r\nthere  may be some in important positions not  only\r\n\r\nin  Singapore but across the Causeway - who may  want\r\n\r\nto  know what the People's Action Party propose  to\r\n\r\ndo in the next elections. Is it going to repeat the\r\n\r\nsame  anti-Emergency Regulations stand? Is it going\r\n\r\nto make this an election issue, and then having won\r\n\r\nthe   elections  seek  to  abolish  the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations and precipitate a crisis? Under  normal\r\n\r\nconditions,  Sir,  I  would  tell  such  nosey  and\r\n\r\ncurious people to wait for the proper time  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  months  when  we shall  be  issuing  our\r\n\r\nelection   manifesto.  But  it  may  be  that   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  would  like  to  know   its\r\n\r\nposition vis a vis Singapore after the next general\r\n\r\nelections, because the Federation of Malaya has  to\r\n\r\nbe  represented  on our Internal  Security  Council\r\n\r\nunder the new Constitution. In fact, it is to  have\r\n\r\nthe  decisive  vote.  What is to  happen  to  these\r\n\r\nEmergency  laws  is  a matter of some  considerable\r\n\r\nimportance  to  them, because  there  are  now  two\r\n\r\npolitical situations; one in the Federation and one\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, both distinct and separate and self-contained with a cordon sanitaire in the Straits of\r\n\r\nJohore.  And they would like to know whether  there\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  a crisis immediately  after  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, with an emergency meeting of the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council summoned by the  British\r\n\r\nto   oppose  any  intended  moves  to  abolish  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance. In  such\r\n\r\na  situation, the Federation may find themselves in\r\n\r\nthe  embarrassing position of (1) voting with  the\r\n\r\nBritish  against the Singapore representatives;  or\r\n\r\n(2)  voting  with the Singapore representatives  to\r\n\r\nabolish  the  Emergency  laws  which  they  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation still consider necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May I then take Members to column 804?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As a Party of the \"Left\", we may not always agree\r\n\r\nor see eye to eye with a Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  \"Right\", as the Tunku has once called  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Malay Nationalist Organisation.

Sir, we state this now  in\r\n\r\nthe full knowledge and anticipation that there will\r\n\r\nbe  political bankrupts and charlatans,  those  who\r\n\r\nhave, and those who have not ever graced the chairs\r\n\r\nof this Assembly, who will make promises to abolish\r\n\r\nthem  in the next elections. We have met such types\r\n\r\nbefore,  and  we expect to meet them  in  the  next\r\n\r\nelections.  When that time comes, we shall  justify\r\n\r\nout  view  and  our stand, that there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nabolition of the Emergency laws in Singapore  until\r\n\r\nthey  have been abolished in the Federation.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  want the Emergency laws abolished in Singapore\r\n\r\nshould try to help to establish conditions of peace\r\n\r\nand security in the Federation so that they may  no\r\n\r\nlonger be required there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And again in column 807:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But we also wish to say that the use of these\r\n\r\nEmergency  powers  depends upon the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\npersons  who are equipped with them, and  we  stand\r\n\r\nfor   an   independent,  democratic,  non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya. Within this democratic system, everyone has\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  compete, to  preach  his  political\r\n\r\nviews,  but the competition must be for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  working the system, not of destroying it. These\r\n\r\npowers  will  not  be allowed to  be  used  against\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents within the system who  compete\r\n\r\nfor   the  right  to  work  the  system.  That   is\r\n\r\nfundamental  and  basic, or the  powers  will  have\r\n\r\ndestroyed  the purpose for which they were  forged.\r\n\r\nIf  in using these powers you, in fact, negate  the\r\n\r\npurpose for which you made them, then you will  end\r\n\r\nup  with  a situation where force, and more  force,\r\n\r\nwill become increasingly necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May I pass on to column 810?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let this also be made known, that our definition\r\n\r\nof the word \"subversion\" is probably different from\r\n\r\nthe British definition of that term, and maybe even\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Labour   Front  definition   of   that\r\n\r\nterm - \"subversion\".  In our definition  \"subversion\"\r\n\r\nis  any political activity designed to further  the\r\n\r\naims  and  interests not of our own people  but  of\r\n\r\nforeign  powers; and by foreign powers we mean  not\r\n\r\njust  Russia  and  China,  but  also  America   and\r\n\r\nFormosa, and the Western bloc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And we went on to say on that occasion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We in the People's Action Party would prefer to\r\n\r\nlose  an  election  rather than  win  it  on  false\r\n\r\npremises and promises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed to deal with the amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  this  Bill seeks to make, may I  remind  the\r\n\r\nRight  that  our antipathy to local  or  expatriate\r\n\r\nagents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  subordinate  the interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to foreign power interests, is as  strong\r\n\r\nnow  as  it  was  when we were the Opposition?  Lip\r\n\r\nservice  docility  will not hide  their  malevolent\r\n\r\nintentions to see that the Left Wing Government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore does not succeed to the detriment of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really unnecessary for me to elaborate on\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  for  this Bill. But  there  are  some\r\n\r\nchanges  about  which  Members  may  wish   to   be\r\n\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 5 of the Bill repeals section 5 of\r\n\r\nthe  present Ordinance which provides for an Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal   consisting   of   three   judges,    and\r\n\r\nsubstitutes  in  its  place the  original  position\r\n\r\nobtaining  under the Emergency laws,  that  is,  an\r\n\r\nadvisory committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September this year, I had discussions with the\r\n\r\npresent  Chief Justice about the functions  of  the\r\n\r\njudiciary under the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance, which is due to lapse later this  month.\r\n\r\nThe  position is that the judges have been  unhappy\r\n\r\nover   their  duties  under  section   6   of   the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance and  have\r\n\r\nindicated  that they would like to be  relieved  of\r\n\r\ntheir executive responsibilities under that section\r\n\r\nand act only in an advisory capacity. Sir, this  is\r\n\r\nnot  something new. In 1955, when the former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr David Saul Marshall, had to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe people into believing that he had abolished the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, as he promised  to  in  the\r\n\r\nlast   elections,   by  replacing   it   with   the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance,   he\r\n\r\nobtained the consent of the then Chief Justice, Sir\r\n\r\nCharles  Murray-Aynsley, to  allow  the  judges  to\r\n\r\nserve  on  an executive appeal tribunal.  When  Sir\r\n\r\nCharles  retired and Sir John Whyatt succeeded  him\r\n\r\nas  Chief  Justice, protests were made to the  then\r\n\r\nGovernment about the improper use of the  judiciary\r\n\r\nunder   the   Preservation   of   Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1958, one month before the Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas  due  to expire, or come up for extension,  the\r\n\r\nthen  Chief Minister wrote to the then Acting Chief\r\n\r\nJustice,  Mr Tan Ah Tah, asking him  to  agree  to\r\n\r\nallow the judges to continue for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  more year under the P.P.S.O. The Acting  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice replied in these terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My brother judges and I are all of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat it is extremely undesirable for members of the\r\n\r\njudiciary  to constitute the Appeal Tribunal  under\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation  of Public Security  Ordinance...we\r\n\r\nthink it was a mistake to have caused the judiciary\r\n\r\nto  be  associated with the work of  the  tribunal.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  view of the reasons for extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  life  of the Ordinance set out in your  letter\r\n\r\nand  more  particularly in view of  your  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  the judiciary will not be called upon  to  do\r\n\r\nthis  work  for  more than one  further  year,  the\r\n\r\njudges who constitute the tribunal have agreed with\r\n\r\ngreat reluctance to continue to serve as members of\r\n\r\nthe tribunal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these letters are on record and leaders of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition who constituted the last Government\r\n\r\nare  fully aware of their contents and of the  real\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we state that on principle it is wrong to use\r\n\r\nthe  judges in this way. First, by the very  nature\r\n\r\nof the tribunal the judges are not presented with a\r\n\r\njusticiable  issue.  They are  not  presented  with\r\n\r\nissues either of fact or of law and asked to decide\r\n\r\non  the  evidence adduced before them according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Evidence Ordinance. They have either to accept\r\n\r\nor  reject the Government's intelligence reports on\r\n\r\na   particular  person.  If  they  agree  with  the\r\n\r\ndecisions of the Executive in all cases, then  they\r\n\r\nbecome  a rubber stamp for the Executive.  If  they\r\n\r\nreject  the intelligence reports so received,  then\r\n\r\nthey   will   have  to  be  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\nconsequences it may bring about on the security  of\r\n\r\nthe  State.  The net result has been that,  in  the\r\n\r\nvast   majority   of  cases,  they  have   accepted\r\n\r\nGovernment intelligence reports. But now and  again\r\n\r\nthey have allowed a few appeals. This they must  do\r\n\r\nunless they are to be obvious rubber stamps for the\r\n\r\nExecutive.   This  position  they  have  considered\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory and, in fact, it demeans their  high\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on principle, the responsibility for the\r\n\r\ndetention   or   otherwise  of   a   person   under\r\n\r\nextraordinary powers such as these cannot rest with\r\n\r\nthe  judiciary.  An  Executive  which  shifts  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  the judges by  asking  them  to\r\n\r\nsuperimpose their judicial stamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   an   Executive   decision  is   shirking   its\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  abusing  the   judiciary.   On\r\n\r\nprinciple,  it is not the duty of the judiciary  to\r\n\r\nact  as administrative or executive officers of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  nor  are  they  properly  equipped  to\r\n\r\ndischarge   such   functions.  In   all   civilised\r\n\r\ncountries  the responsibility for the  security  of\r\n\r\nthe  State  rests with the elected government,  not\r\n\r\nthe  judges of the State. In Singapore, our's is  a\r\n\r\nspecial  position, as the Leader of the House,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister, has  stated - that  ultimate\r\n\r\npower  rests not with the Singapore Government  but\r\n\r\nwith   the  Internal  Security  Council,  on  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  three out of seven representatives.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  the last analysis, let  us  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstand  that these extraordinary  powers  under\r\n\r\nthe  P.P.S.O. are  vested  not  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  but in the Security Council.  Certainly\r\n\r\nthey are not vested in our judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other amendment set out in clause 3 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  intended to give the  Minister  more\r\n\r\nflexibility in the exercise of these powers.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  present law restrictions can only  be  imposed\r\n\r\nafter  a person has been detained. A man must first\r\n\r\nbe   detained   before  he  can  be   released   on\r\n\r\nconditions.  Under clause 3 of the Bill,  a  person\r\n\r\ncan be placed on conditions without first having to\r\n\r\nhave  him  detained.  This will  avoid  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndetentions.  Also  for the same purpose,  to  avoid\r\n\r\nhaving to detain more people than is necessary, the\r\n\r\npowers  of  restrictions have now  been  made  more\r\n\r\nflexible  to  allow a wider field  of  cases  where\r\n\r\nconditions  can be imposed on a person  allowed  to\r\n\r\nremain  outside, instead of keeping  him  inside  a\r\n\r\nplace of detention. Hence clause 3, which sets  out\r\n\r\nthat  restrictions  can be specified  not  only  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  residence but also  of  employment  or\r\n\r\nactivities.  These, Mr Speaker, Sir, are  the  two\r\n\r\nprincipal amendments that the Bill seeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me be the first to remind this House that\r\n\r\nthe  final answer to the Communist challenge is not\r\n\r\nprovided  by  this type of legislation  giving  the\r\n\r\nExecutive   Emergency   or  extraordinary   powers.\r\n\r\nFinally   it  is  the  economic,  the  social   and\r\n\r\npolitical conditions and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbattles   on  these  fields  that  decide   whether\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  indeed  Malaya,  will  grow   from\r\n\r\nstrength to strength as a democratic State in which\r\n\r\nthe  more  tolerant features of human  civilization\r\n\r\nare   preserved,  whilst  the  economic  needs  and\r\n\r\nnecessities  of the people are adequately  met;  or\r\n\r\nwhether  a  totalitarian system  will  succeed  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  State  and  cater  for  these  economic\r\n\r\nneeds.  These powers can only provide  a  temporary\r\n\r\ndamper  against  those who set  out  to  wreck  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles which guide this Government in the\r\n\r\nexercise  of its primary functions as a  Government\r\n\r\nhave  been enumerated by the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to harken back to what  I  said  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of my Party last year:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Within this democratic system, everyone has the\r\n\r\nright  to  compete, to preach his political  views,\r\n\r\nbut  the  competition must be for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nworking  the  system, not of destroying  it.  These\r\n\r\npowers  will  not  be allowed to  be  used  against\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents within the system  to  compete\r\n\r\nfor   the  right  to  work  the  system.  That   is\r\n\r\nfundamental  and  basic, for the powers  will  have\r\n\r\ndestroyed the purpose for which they were forged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we state quite categorically that\r\n\r\nwe  believe in the democratic system, that we  will\r\n\r\nallow   full   competition  within  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem,   but  competition  for  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\ndestroying the democratic system will be resisted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, we meet here today to discuss\r\n\r\nthe  P.P.S.O. in  a political situation  which  my\r\n\r\nParty  had envisaged as early as October 1958.  The\r\n\r\nstand of the People's Action Party taken before the\r\n\r\nGeneral Elections as stated in October 1958 in this\r\n\r\nAssembly was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is because this is a fundamental issue that I\r\n\r\nhave  a  mandate  from my Party to  state  now  our\r\n\r\nfuture  position. If it were the British Government\r\n\r\nin  control of the Federation of Malaya, as it  was\r\n\r\nthree   years  ago,  we  would  still  oppose   the\r\n\r\nEmergency laws as vehemently as we did three  years\r\n\r\nago,  because then the Emergency laws could be used\r\n\r\nand  were  sometimes used, not  only  to  curb  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,   but   also  to  curb   the   militant\r\n\r\nNationalists.  It was a simple issue  then  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  versus British imperialism, and  we  stated\r\n\r\nunequivocally where we stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were asked to vote for these laws\r\n\r\nthree years ago, we opposed them, for the centre of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  the Federation  was  the  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner  and his nominated officials,  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  it  was then, and now is still,  in  the\r\n\r\ntriumvirate of the three official Ministers  headed\r\n\r\nby  the Governor with over-riding powers. These are\r\n\r\nmen  who  are  not answerable to the people.  Their\r\n\r\nmasters are not in Singapore but in London. In that\r\n\r\nsituation, we allied ourselves with all  the  anti-colonial  forces to fight colonialism and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do  so  until the  last  vestiges  of\r\n\r\ncolonial rule are removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, however -\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Next  year,  we  are   to   be   only\r\n\r\ninternally  self-governing,  and  in  all  security\r\n\r\nmatters   which  affect  defence  upon  which   the\r\n\r\nSingapore and the British Governments disagree, the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government is to  be  the  arbiter.  We\r\n\r\naccepted  that position because we accepted  merger\r\n\r\nas the only way to independence. If we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept the Federation and join it as  a  member\r\n\r\nstate, then it means that we are prepared to allow\r\n\r\nthe  Government representing the 11 States  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation to have a decisive voice in the  affairs\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is still our position and it will be our\r\n\r\nposition  for  all the years to come until  merger.\r\n\r\nThis   is  the  basic  analysis  of  our  political\r\n\r\nsituation.  If  that  analysis  is  correct,   then\r\n\r\ncertain   logical  consequences  follow.  We   must\r\n\r\nrecognise that our over-riding objective is merger\r\n\r\nand  that means that we must acknowledge that until\r\n\r\nmerger  the over-riding interests of the Federation\r\n\r\nmust prevail over Singapore. Therefore, we say that\r\n\r\nif we are the Government of Singapore, we will take\r\n\r\nno  steps which will undermine the interests of the\r\n\r\nFederation. We state our stand now on the  question\r\n\r\nof the Emergency laws, and it is this: that as long\r\n\r\nas  they are necessary for the maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the Federation, so long will  they  be\r\n\r\nnecessary for Singapore\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are now taking the same stand on the extension of the life of the P.P.S.O. as we had\r\n\r\nopenly stateed in this Assembly before the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party became the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt   is  being  fully  recognised,  under  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution  granted to Singapore by  the  British\r\n\r\nmasters, that the decisive say in internal security\r\n\r\nin this Island is the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the amendment of the Appeal Tribunal, not only\r\n\r\nis  the  position of the Judges untenable  but  the\r\n\r\namendment  would bring more into line the  existing\r\n\r\ndifferences between the Emergency laws of  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries. Mr Speaker, I support the Bill moved by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nare  glad  to  receive  from  the  Hon. the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  certain assurances: firstly, that  within\r\n\r\nthe  democratic system we should compete  to  build\r\n\r\nand  not to destroy; secondly, that so long as  the\r\n\r\nFederation finds it necessary to have an  Ordinance\r\n\r\nlike this one then Singapore must have it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having stated our points of agreement, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave also to state that on certain points we do not\r\n\r\nquite  see eye to eye. Firstly, it seems  to  be  a\r\n\r\ngrowing practice for the Government to rush through\r\n\r\nvery  important  Bills  at very  short  notice  and\r\n\r\nthrough  all  the  three stages,  thus  giving  the\r\n\r\npublic  no  chance to weigh the pros and cons.  The\r\n\r\nessence  of  democracy is to enable the  public  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  share in the government of the country  by\r\n\r\nbeing  given time to think on the coming Bills  and\r\n\r\nby    expressing   their   views   through    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  Sir,  we would  request  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture where possible - we know that at times it  may\r\n\r\nnot be possible - Bills should not be rushed through,\r\n\r\nand longer notice should be given to the public and\r\n\r\nto Assemblymen. I would suggest that where possible\r\n\r\nthere  should be a time lapse of at least one  week\r\n\r\nto  ten  days between the publication of a Bill  in\r\n\r\nthe Gazette and the debate on it in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think none of us - not even those on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side - would like to live  in  a  country\r\n\r\nwhere  there is an Ordinance like this one  forever\r\n\r\nin   force.  We  know  that  under  this  Ordinance\r\n\r\ncitizens' liberties are curtailed. They do not feel\r\n\r\nthat they are free as they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be.  There is always the fear that  through\r\n\r\nsome   error   or  through  some  wrong  complaint,\r\n\r\nsomebody might be taken in by the Police and locked\r\n\r\nup  for  an indefinite period. I have always  quite\r\n\r\nappreciated  the  position that Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  are going  through  a  very\r\n\r\nunusual  period and that there is a secret struggle\r\n\r\ngoing on underground, and therefore it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  an  Ordinance like this one  to  be  still  in\r\n\r\nexistence. At the same time, we on this  side  feel\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  despite any practical difficulties,\r\n\r\nthere must be a right of appeal to prevent acts  of\r\n\r\ninjustice.  Therefore, we feel that if  the  Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal  is  abolished,  then  that  would  be   a\r\n\r\nretrograde step for this country. It could be  said\r\n\r\nthat an Advisory Committee would be able to perform\r\n\r\nthe  same functions. Sir, we do not think that this\r\n\r\nis  possible  because, when the Advisory  Committee\r\n\r\nhave  made  their decisions and the detainees  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sentenced, where a victim feels  that  he  is\r\n\r\ninnocent, he still has no right of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point to remember - that there are\r\n\r\nusually  one  judge  and  two  appointees  on   the\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee.  Now  we  know  that  the  two\r\n\r\nappointees,  who  are not legally trained,  may  be\r\n\r\nswayed by other feelings, and injustice may be the\r\n\r\nresult. At this point, I wish to refer to something\r\n\r\nnot quite pleasant which I might have hesitated  to\r\n\r\nmention  but for the fact that people feel  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  mention it here. We have noticed a tendency\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  the - Government  that  when  they\r\n\r\nappoint a Committee, a Board or a Commission,  they\r\n\r\nappoint mostly - sometimes all - members of their  own\r\n\r\nParty.  We note that in the list of members of  the\r\n\r\nRent Conciliation Board practically all are members\r\n\r\nof  the  Government Party. Sir, to  be  democratic,\r\n\r\nthere  must be opportunities for minority or  other\r\n\r\nviews  to  be  expressed,  otherwise  we  run   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  along  a  one-track  line.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nessence  of  democracy, Sir,  that  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nminorities must be preserved, otherwise it  becomes\r\n\r\njust  a  one-Party  Government,  and  democracy  as\r\n\r\npractised  would be a Government of one  Party,  by\r\n\r\none  Party  and for one Party; whereas  we  believe\r\n\r\nthat democracy in essence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans  a  Government of the people, by the people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and for all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we feel that although we do not oppose\r\n\r\nthis  amending  Bill in principle,  we  oppose  the\r\n\r\nabolition of the provision for an Appeal Tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You oppose the judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, Sir, I say this: it is a\r\n\r\ncase of whether we want to preserve for the man who\r\n\r\nis  detained  the  right of  appeal.  A  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  allows an appeal, otherwise  it  becomes  a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of our views and I believe\r\n\r\nthat  before  the  Bar  of  world  opinion,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide ways and means for an appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has the power and the numbers\r\n\r\nto  override all objections but we trust  that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of Singapore, we present to the world\r\n\r\nthe  view that we are running a democratic  system,\r\n\r\nand  that  nobody will be sent to gaol without  the\r\n\r\nright  of appeal. I beg of the Government therefore\r\n\r\nthat they will try and preserve the right of appeal\r\n\r\nin the amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is accepted, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary  in  the existing  conditions  in\r\n\r\nMalaya that such an Ordinance as this is necessary.\r\n\r\nThere  rare  three main ponits to which  this  Bill\r\n\r\ngives rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is there a necessity for this Ordinance to\r\n\r\nbe  extended? The second point is: For how long  is\r\n\r\nit to be extended? And thirdly, and by no means the\r\n\r\nleast,  the question of the abolition of the Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal  and the substitution therefor of Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first two points - that is, the necessity\r\n\r\nfor  the  extension of the life of this  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand  the  number of years in respect of  which  the\r\n\r\nextension is necessary - there is unanimity  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House and on the Government side. But,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, there is a difference of opinion\r\n\r\non the question of whether, in the existing context\r\n\r\nof public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopinion  and public reaction to Ordinances such  as\r\n\r\nthis,  it  is  wise to change the  Appeal  Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich has functioned successfully - I presume for the\r\n\r\nlast four years - to Advisory Committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I admit, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to deprive human liberties arbitrarily in\r\n\r\nthe  overall interests of the preservation  of  the\r\n\r\nState, but in our concept of Government, that is, a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  form of Government, the  liberty  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  is  such  a precious thing  that  where  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  necessary  to  deprive  a  person  of  his\r\n\r\nliberty,   then   there   must   be   corresponding\r\n\r\nprovisions which will ensure, as far as is  humanly\r\n\r\npossible,  that the person detained or  the  person\r\n\r\nwho  has  been deprived of his liberty,  can  avail\r\n\r\nhimself of for the purpose of defending himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one point on which every citizen in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  agreed  is  the  absolute impartiality  of  our\r\n\r\nJudges.  It  is  a good thing that  the  public  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have such faith in our Judges.  Once  the\r\n\r\nfaith   in  our  Judges  is  destroyed,  then   the\r\n\r\nfundamental   basis  of  the  rule  of   law   will\r\n\r\ndisappear.  However, we are now  in  the  fortunate\r\n\r\nposition that our Judiciary is held in high  esteem\r\n\r\nby  the  public  of  Singapore. If  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  at  this  stage,  after  four  years  of  a\r\n\r\njudicial  Tribunal  listening  to  the  appeals  of\r\n\r\ndetained  persons,  change it suddenly  to  one  of\r\n\r\nAdvisory   Committees  and  place  this   political\r\n\r\nprisoner - if   I   may  use  the  words   \"political\r\n\r\nprisoner\", Mr Speaker, Sir - in the same position as\r\n\r\na  thug,  then I think there is something radically\r\n\r\nwrong.  Under our existing law, the Appeal Tribunal\r\n\r\nconsists  of two High Court Judges and  a  District\r\n\r\nCourt Judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two points raised in support of this issue are\r\n\r\nas   follows.  First,  that  the  Judges  find   it\r\n\r\nembarrassing  to  sit  in judgment  over  executive\r\n\r\nactions of Ministers. The second point is that such\r\n\r\njudgments have to be formed by the Judges  on  data\r\n\r\nwhich  they  themselves  do not  consider  judicial\r\n\r\nevidence. I cannot appreciate the first point,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, because very often in such  a  legal\r\n\r\nsystem  as ours, Judges are called upon to  sit  in\r\n\r\njudgment  over the executive actions of  Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe  rule  of  law  is the final control  over  the\r\n\r\nillegal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacts  of  Ministers, and very often Judges  of  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  are, in fact, called upon  to  sit  in\r\n\r\njudgment   over   executive  decisions   taken   by\r\n\r\nMinisters.  So  the first point, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\ndoes  not appeal to me. The second point is a  more\r\n\r\nvalid  one  in  that Judges are given  evidence  or\r\n\r\nstatements which they normally would not accept  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Courts. I accept the statement of  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister that this is a weakness in  the\r\n\r\nsystem and our Judges should not normally be called\r\n\r\nupon  to  adjudicate on such evidence; but I  would\r\n\r\nappeal  to  him  to suggest to the  Judges  of  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court that the situation in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsuch that only the Judges themselves can adequately\r\n\r\nsatisfy the members of the public that no injustice\r\n\r\nwould be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is proposed by this amending\r\n\r\nBill   to   appoint  as  Chairman  of  an  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee a person who has seven years' standing as\r\n\r\na  lawyer  in this country and two others  who  are\r\n\r\neither laymen or lawyers to sit with him. Recently.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been   treated   to\r\n\r\nappointments  made  by  the present  Government  to\r\n\r\njudicial or semi-judicial Committees of persons who\r\n\r\nare openly and blatantly Party men. In the context\r\n\r\nof  other  appointments, this Bill would  not  have\r\n\r\nreceived  the  opposition that it is receiving  but\r\n\r\nfor  this.  When  one  sees,  from  time  to  time,\r\n\r\nappointments    to   judicial   or    semi-judicial\r\n\r\nCommittees  being made of persons who  are  openly,\r\n\r\npublicly and blatantly Party men, then one does get\r\n\r\na  bit nervous as to who would be Chairmen of these\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committees. It is an undoubted fact  that\r\n\r\nif  a person of legal standing is appointed and two\r\n\r\nlaymen  are  appointed to sit with  him,  then  the\r\n\r\ntendency is for the two laymen to accept the advice\r\n\r\nof the Chairman, and if the Chairman is an out-and-out  Party man, then surely, Sir, the faith in that\r\n\r\nCommittee is destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning this Bill which is\r\n\r\nto  amend the P.P.S.O., we are of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nin principle the old Ordinance is good. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  not  deny  the good intentions of  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment in wanting to co-operate in many aspects\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government of the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the  matter of  annihilating  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  the Federation or  suppressing  the\r\n\r\nremnants  of  Communism  in  Singapore.  But,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the strange thing which I would  like\r\n\r\nto  emphasise is this. If I were to relate a  story\r\n\r\nconcerning this Public Security Bill, it would be a\r\n\r\nlong  story, which has its background not  only  in\r\n\r\nour  organisation, the U.M.N.O., but also in others\r\n\r\nwho had voiced their protest against this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, U.M.N.O. was a Member of the\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, and although U.M.N.O. youth\r\n\r\nhad  opposed it vehemently in principle, this Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,  was eventually agreed to by  U.M.N.O.  We\r\n\r\ntoo suffered as a result, because at that time some\r\n\r\nof  my colleagues became victims of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on that basis, we are apprehensive about\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, because, even when U.M.N.O. was in  the\r\n\r\nCoalition Government, it could not prevent our  own\r\n\r\nmembers   from  being  victims  of  the  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nHowever,   because  of  our  demands  and  appeals,\r\n\r\nparticularly  from U.M.N.O. youth and its  branches\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation and Singapore,  we  managed  to\r\n\r\nsettle  the matter concerning this P.P.S.O.,  which\r\n\r\nwas passed by the previous government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, this amending Bill today,\r\n\r\nin  the  opinion  of U.M.N.O., is not  fit  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot   accept  the  substitution  of  the  Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal for an Advisory Committee. There are  many\r\n\r\nmatters  contained  in the Bill  which  we  oppose.\r\n\r\nToday, we have a Government elected by the majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people,  and therefore we,  the  U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\ncannot  carry  out fully the wishes of  the  people\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point  of view of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil, in line with the Federation of Malaya. But\r\n\r\nwe must remember that doubts or anything which will\r\n\r\nundermine  the peace of Singapore cannot  certainly\r\n\r\nbe  overcome  by  the Government  alone.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason, U.M.N.O. considers that the substitution of\r\n\r\nthe Appeal Tribunal for an Advisory Committee is to\r\n\r\nmonopolise the powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  to diminish the hopes of the detainees. It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that the detained persons are victims  of\r\n\r\ncases  without  thorough  investigation.  So  these\r\n\r\nvictims  will  have no opportunity to pursue  their\r\n\r\nstruggle in a democratic institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we want to follow truly the steps of the Federation of Malaya, I cannot deny that on\r\n\r\nprinciple this is not of benefit to the Federation.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are many big matters which I think  can\r\n\r\nsuit  the Federation of Malaya Government and which\r\n\r\ncan be put into effect if the Government wishes  to\r\n\r\ndo  so. We of U.M.N.O. are of the opinion that  the\r\n\r\nJudges  in  Singapore are held in high  esteem  and\r\n\r\nunbiased  in  carrying out their  duties  from  the\r\n\r\nlegal point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the circumstances, Mr Speaker, we\r\n\r\ncannot  accept but we oppose the amending  Bill  in\r\n\r\nrespect of section 5 which seeks to substitute  the\r\n\r\nAppeal Tribunal for an Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

But, Mr Speaker, Sir, they\r\n\r\nare  always looking for some sort of a screen. They\r\n\r\nmust  try  to hide behind a screen. That  was  what\r\n\r\nthe  last government did. They picked some  people\r\n\r\nup  under  these powers and took them into custody.\r\n\r\nThen  they  turned  round and  said  to  the  chap,\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, chum! We picked you up; it is  true.  But\r\n\r\nyou  know,  the  fact  that  you  are  still  under\r\n\r\ndetention  is  really  not our responsibility.  You\r\n\r\nfailed to make out a case for your release. It  was\r\n\r\nthe Judges who decided your fate.\" That is the sort\r\n\r\nof  thing  that they wanted. They always wanted  to\r\n\r\nscreen  themselves behind others. We are  not  like\r\n\r\nthat.

We do not  want\r\n\r\nto  pass  the buck to others. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nknow our responsibilities. Our responsibilities are\r\n\r\nto  the  people  who  put us  in  this  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly. We know that if we abuse those powers, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill have to face them and explain the position  at\r\n\r\nthe end of our term of office.

We have an Opposition not  only  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  but  also an  opposition  outside.\r\n\r\nThere is a former Chief Minister who appears to  be\r\n\r\nterrified   at   the  legislation   that   we   are\r\n\r\nintroducing  today. He has sent  to  all  of  us  a\r\n\r\ncircular  letter telling us that the whole  of  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  traditions is in great peril.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  our  intention to pack  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  with  P.A.P. stooges  and  with  a  very\r\n\r\nsubservient  Chairman.  I  can  assure  Mr   David\r\n\r\nMarshall   that   we  believe   in   democracy   as\r\n\r\npassionately  as  he  does, and  it  is  never  our\r\n\r\nintention  to place any P.A.P. stooge in  any  such\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee. If I could make a suggestion to\r\n\r\nMr  David  Marshall - he  need  not  really  be   so\r\n\r\nfrightened  of the position as he says  he  is.  He\r\n\r\nneed  not  fear any P.A.P. imprisonment.  We  could\r\n\r\nalways  leave it to the course of nature to operate\r\n\r\nin  his  case, and in good time he might very  well\r\n\r\nfind  himself  a  refuge in  some  other  place  of\r\n\r\ndetention, not necessarily a P.A.P. prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in discussing the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security (Amendment) Bill, I\r\n\r\nstand  here to clarify the attitude of U.M.N.O.  In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  we  agree  to  the  extension  of   the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. But what we of U.M.N.O. object to  is  the\r\n\r\nreplacing  of the Appeal Tribunal with an  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee.  In  my opinion, this replacement  would\r\n\r\nresult in a system or regulation by which those who\r\n\r\nare  detained under this Ordinance will be deprived\r\n\r\nof  their right of appeal, or of the right to  have\r\n\r\ntheir cases reconsidered, and justice done to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Labour and Law has stated\r\n\r\njust now that the Opposition  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  here  only to criticise  or  condemn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as though what has been  expressed  by\r\n\r\nthe Opposition has been done out of spite or merely\r\n\r\nto disrupt the functions of the Government. We have\r\n\r\non  numerous occasions stated here that the  object\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition is to put forward the views  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. It is therefore only right\r\n\r\nthat  our views and opinions should be put  forward\r\n\r\nhere  in this Assembly. It should never be imagined\r\n\r\nthat  all that we say or do can be accepted by each\r\n\r\nand every one. It should never be imagined that our\r\n\r\nway  of  life  can be adhered to by all.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,   we  should  give  thorough  and   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  the merits or demerits  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in exercising the powers under\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nshould also provide an opportunity to those who are\r\n\r\ndetained    to   bring   up   their    cases    for\r\n\r\nreconsideration, and to prove their  innocence.  If\r\n\r\nno  such opportunity is given to them, surely  then\r\n\r\nthere will be no justice. Certainly it will be seen\r\n\r\nfrom  the amendments put up by the Government  that\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance will be even more stringent than what\r\n\r\nwe  have today. This is clear and cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the old Ordinance looks  after  those\r\n\r\nwho have been released. With the amendments put  up\r\n\r\nby   the  Government,  this  will  mean  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can supervise these suspected  persons.\r\n\r\nThis  has been in practice since the P.A.P. formed\r\n\r\nthe Government. It is also known that meetings have\r\n\r\nbeen  curtailed,  which had never been  experienced\r\n\r\nduring  the  past Government. Is this  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to curb the freedom of an association or  an\r\n\r\ninstitution? Or is the Government always afraid  of\r\n\r\nthe  movements  and activities  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  It may well be so. We note that  people\r\n\r\nare  now  always full of fear about their fate,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that  they have no place to  voice  their\r\n\r\ngrievances    or   criticisms   concerning    their\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the newspapers, we have seen a change of\r\n\r\noutlook.  This  will be evident if we  compare  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers published during the previous regime and\r\n\r\nthose published during the present Government.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, of course, have stated that they do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree   that  the  newspapers  should  voice  their\r\n\r\nopinions  in  a  manner  which  will  lead  to  the\r\n\r\nseparation  of  Singapore and the  Federation.  But\r\n\r\nthere  is more to it than that, I think, which  has\r\n\r\nresulted in the change of attitude adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, so that it is now different  from  what\r\n\r\nit used to be in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nask your permission to allow me to read part of  my\r\n\r\nspeech on 8th October of last year:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, my Party's attitude towards the Preservation\r\n\r\nof Public Security Ordinance has always depended on\r\n\r\nthe answers to two questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is: To whom are these\r\n\r\nextraordinary powers being given? The second is: To\r\n\r\nwhat use will these powers be put?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions, in fact, are inter-related. We\r\n\r\ncan  tell  from the nature of the persons  to  whom\r\n\r\nthese  powers  are given, how they will  use  these\r\n\r\nextraordinary powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party has, in the past, attacked the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance,  or  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations as it  used  to  be  called,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know to whom these powers  were  being\r\n\r\ngiven and to what use they would be put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations, as you know. Sir, were\r\n\r\nfirst promulgated by a colonial regime. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat the supporters of this regime claimed that the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations would be  used  to  preserve\r\n\r\ndemocracy   against  armed  Communist  revolt   and\r\n\r\nsubversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it may be that the colonial forces genuinely\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the  interests of  colonialism  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy were identical. They were only  a  little\r\n\r\nless virulent in their attacks on the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nparties  than  they were in their  attacks  on  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a colonial regime and its journalistic\r\n\r\ntools  were unable to distinguish between democracy\r\n\r\nand  nationalism, it would have been folly to  have\r\n\r\nagreed to extraordinary powers to such a regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, the times have changed.

For  that\r\n\r\nreason, there should be no doubts from any quarters\r\n\r\nabout  the  Bill  which  we have  presented  today,\r\n\r\nparticularly with regard to the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.   We  have  repeatedly  said   that   only\r\n\r\nundesirable  elements who are fighting for  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries need fear this Bill. So if there are some\r\n\r\nsections  who voice their fears and doubts  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,   it   would  appear   that   they   have\r\n\r\nconnections  with  them,  and  therefore  might  be\r\n\r\naffected by the provisions under this P.P.S.O.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is ready to face anything in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of peace and prosperity of  the  island.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will not hesitate to take any  action\r\n\r\nagainst  undesirable elements when the time  comes.\r\n\r\nWe  do not wish to have the Government dubbed as an\r\n\r\nirresponsible  Government by  taking  irresponsible\r\n\r\nactions. But unfortunately, the Member who  at  one\r\n\r\ntime  used to be the Chief Minister in the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not  present  today.  We  see  that\r\n\r\npreviously there had been occasions when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople were arrested and detained and later sent up\r\n\r\nto  the Appeal Tribunal, where they were found  not\r\n\r\nguilty and released, and were rewarded with a  mere\r\n\r\napology.  Therefore, I feel that such  a  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  showed  that many people were  victimised;\r\n\r\nthey were arrested and detained first, and released\r\n\r\nlater. I feel that because of this, we should  give\r\n\r\nopportunities for the Minister first to review  and\r\n\r\ninvestigate such a case and then to refer it to the\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee. By this means a fair and  just\r\n\r\nline  of action will be taken. Thereby a case  will\r\n\r\nnot  arise,  as  it  were,  where  a  person  first\r\n\r\ndelivered  a thrust with his knife, then  threw  it\r\n\r\naway, and then appealed as to whether he was guilty\r\n\r\nor  innocent,  as to whether the thrust  was  well-delivered  or not. This, I feel, will  cause  grave\r\n\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park stated that he was\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the members who will be  nominated\r\n\r\nto  serve on the Advisory Committee. In the present\r\n\r\nstruggle,  I  would  like to emphasise,  it  seldom\r\n\r\nhappens  that  the  fight is  between  individuals.\r\n\r\nRather,  in the political climate today,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncase  of  party against party. The action  that  my\r\n\r\nParty is taking is in the name of the Party. If  my\r\n\r\nParty is not sincere, it will be left to the people\r\n\r\nto  decide.  Therefore, I say, this  Government  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  to the people. It may  be  that  among\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Advisory Committee to be  appointed\r\n\r\nlater  there are Party Members; however,  the  fact\r\n\r\nstill  remains  that  we will  be  responsible  for\r\n\r\nseeing that justice and fair play are carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has chosen to\r\n\r\nscreen an old film by saying that when the P.P.S.O.\r\n\r\ncame up for debate for the second time the youth of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. had raised their objections and opposed it\r\n\r\nvehemently, whereas their State Committee and their\r\n\r\nown representatives in the Government supported the\r\n\r\nmotion.  This is merely the showing of an old  film\r\n\r\ndepicting the dissensions in his own Party.

So,  it\r\n\r\nwas he and not I who was screening the old film.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for the Southern Islands said that this Ordinance is more stringent than the\r\n\r\nprevious  one. I wish to emphasise that it  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   more  drastic  only  to  those  undesirable\r\n\r\nelements who indulge in activities which are in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  foreign  States  and  not   in   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  State of Singapore.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhowever  sharp the knife may be, if it is not  used\r\n\r\nto  kill, I think we need not fear it. It  is  only\r\n\r\nthose  creatures for the slaughter-house  or  those\r\n\r\nwho  should be put to the dagger who need  fear.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  those who are law-abiding  and  peace-loving with an undivided loyalty need not fear this\r\n\r\nBill, however stringent or drastic it may appear to\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands also stated\r\n\r\nthat  since  the P.A.P. Government came into  power\r\n\r\nthere  were  public meetings which were disallowed,\r\n\r\nas though the Government was afraid of the people's\r\n\r\nmovements.  As  far as I know there  were  no  such\r\n\r\nmeetings which had been curbed or curtailed  except\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government  was forced  to  act  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of peace and security of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  fear  perhaps  there  are   certain\r\n\r\nquarters who are playing behind the scenes to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  such  meetings to disturb  the  peace  and\r\n\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning newspaper publications the Member said\r\n\r\nthat they had changed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude or outlook. If I remember  rightly,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, since the P.A.P. came into power,  it\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that a representative of  the  World\r\n\r\nPress Association had been in Singapore because the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  the  Press  was  in  danger.  But  the\r\n\r\nrepresentative  had since returned to  England  and\r\n\r\nhad  said  on  his return that the freedom  of  the\r\n\r\nPress was not restricted and there was no fear,  as\r\n\r\nwas  exaggerated by certain local newspapers.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that  freedom of the Press in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nreally  being  enjoyed, in the true  sense  of  the\r\n\r\nword.  Concerning  the outlook  or  the  change  of\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  newspapers,  that  is  not   the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of the Government. It is the business  of\r\n\r\nthe  publishers. It is a matter for the  publishers\r\n\r\nto  decide. I think, Mr Speaker, we therefore need\r\n\r\nnot  fear.  But as a fighter, we must  sharpen  our\r\n\r\nknife,  not necessarily for the purpose of  killing\r\n\r\nour  enemies,  but  at least for  self-defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  so that our family, and for that  matter,\r\n\r\nthe   whole  population  of  the  State,  will   be\r\n\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  from what the Members of the Opposition  have\r\n\r\nsaid two points are very clear, that we have agreed\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government that the  extension  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  necessary and that we are  glad  and\r\n\r\ngrateful  to the Prime Minister for the  assurances\r\n\r\nthat he has given us. But I feel that there are two\r\n\r\nsections which need clarification, and I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  in his  reply  would  clarify\r\n\r\nthese. In section 3 subsection (1) it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) If the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  respect to any person that, with  a  view  to\r\n\r\npreventing  that person from acting in  any  manner\r\n\r\nprejudicial  to  the  security  of  Malaya  or  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance   of  public  order  therein   or   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  therein of essential services,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  so  to do, the Minister shall  by  order\r\n\r\nunder his hand make an order -\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask who satisfies the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara? Is it the Minister or the Security Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one is section 5, subsection (3):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(3) Upon considering the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  may\r\n\r\ngive such directions, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany,  as he shall think fit regarding the order  or\r\n\r\ndirection made by the Minister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is the\r\n\r\nconstitutional head and, I believe, does  not  make\r\n\r\nhis  own decisions. He takes directives. May I  ask\r\n\r\nagain  who  will be giving him directions  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect to carry out this section? Will it again be\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  or  the Advisory  Committee  or  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it appears it will not be the Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  because  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  is\r\n\r\nfree  to treat the advice in whatever way he thinks\r\n\r\nfit.

Before  I\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  this  Bill  and  on  the  amendments\r\n\r\ncontained therein, I would like to emphasise that I\r\n\r\nstand  by what I stated in this Assembly on October\r\n\r\n1958, and which is contained in the Hansard that is\r\n\r\nin  front  of me here. It is important  for  me  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what I stated then and also what  my  Party\r\n\r\nstood  for before it went before the electorate  in\r\n\r\n1959. Before we make any speeches concerning policy\r\n\r\nor  basic  issues, whether they be in this Assembly\r\n\r\nor outside, on behalf of the People's Action Party,\r\n\r\nwe  consider  carefully what we have  to  say.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, this is what I said then. \"If our Party is\r\n\r\nvictorious in the elections on 29th May, 1959,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party  will  carry  on  with  the\r\n\r\nPreservation   of   Public  Security   Ordinance - an\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to provide for security and peace  which\r\n\r\nwe  consider vital.\" This was not said lightly.  We\r\n\r\nbelieved  then  in priority of security  and  peace\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese all are very vital things. This Government is\r\n\r\nprepared  to shoulder its responsibilities.  If  we\r\n\r\nare    not   courageous   enough   to   face    our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities then I think we will be placed  in\r\n\r\na  very  dangerous position. Not  only  members  of\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties,  but also the  people  will  be\r\n\r\nfaced with difficulties and dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather from what the Members of U.M.N.O. said\r\n\r\njust  now,  that  they are not very specific  about\r\n\r\ntheir  objections. They do not appear to understand\r\n\r\nhow  important this Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is.  They  said  that  this   Bill   was\r\n\r\ndangerous. An explanation about it has already been\r\n\r\ngiven  by my colleague, the Member for Bukit Timah.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Kampong Kembangan told a story of  a\r\n\r\ncrisis  in  his Party when the previous  Government\r\n\r\nmoved  a  motion concerning this Ordinance.  As  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  has said in his reply, this is  not  the\r\n\r\nplace to relate stories about political Parties. We\r\n\r\nare  here as elected representatives of the  people\r\n\r\nto  discuss  matters concerning  the  life  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  as  a whole. The stand adopted by  the  two\r\n\r\nMembers  of  U.M.N.O. towards  this  Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nextraordinary and strange. First they say  that  it\r\n\r\nis  drastic and undemocratic. Then they say that it\r\n\r\nis  important that we should have this Ordinance if\r\n\r\nwe  want a merger with the Federation of Malaya.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Singapore U.M.N.O. has  the  same\r\n\r\npolicy as U.M.N.O. in the Federation of Malaya.  If\r\n\r\nthe Alliance Government in the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nhad an Advisory Committee to review cases connected\r\n\r\nwith  the Emergency laws, then I am sure the Member\r\n\r\nfor the Southern Islands and the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan would argue how important it was to  have\r\n\r\nsuch an Advisory Committee here also. But I regret,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. Sir, to say that both the two Members\r\n\r\nhave  failed  to  grasp what is contained  in  this\r\n\r\nBill.  I also find that there has been a difference\r\n\r\nof  opinion  between the two Members.  They  should\r\n\r\nfind a point of agreement between themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has brought this Bill because it\r\n\r\nrealises  that it is necessary for the preservation\r\n\r\nof  peace  and security in this country. Also,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, as the Hon. the Prime Minister  said\r\n\r\nearlier, the P.A.P. had made clear its stand before\r\n\r\nit  came  into  power  four  or  five  months  ago.\r\n\r\nInternal peace and security, Mr Speaker, Sir,  are\r\n\r\nmatters  for  the  Internal Security  Council,  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  which are the British Government,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  and the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. We should be  very  careful\r\n\r\nabout  what  we  say. We cannot  pretend  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government has full powers in matters  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the British Government or the Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya have also a say. However,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  wish to hide behind a  screen.  As  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues   have  said,  we  are   a   responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment. Unlike the previous Government, we,  as\r\n\r\nthe elected representatives of the people, will not\r\n\r\nshirk our responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the amendments to the Bill, it is evident that Opposition Members agree\r\n\r\nin principle that the Ordinance should be preserved\r\n\r\nin  the interest of the people of Singapore and for\r\n\r\nthe  peace and security of this country.  But  what\r\n\r\nthey are opposed to is the amendment to replace the\r\n\r\nAppeal Tribunal with an Advisory Committee composed\r\n\r\nof  members nominated by the Government. Here,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Opposition Members need not  fear\r\n\r\nor  have  any  doubts because the  members  of  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee will not be  nominated  at  the\r\n\r\nwhim  and fancy of the Government. We will nominate\r\n\r\nmembers  with experience who understand  thoroughly\r\n\r\nthe political developments in Singapore. Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition need have no fear about the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment nominating only men belonging to its own\r\n\r\nParty to sit on the Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have more or less clarified my\r\n\r\nstand   concerning  the  Preservation   of   Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance. The Opposition Members  should\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity to reconsider their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews.  They should not have any misgivings  as  to\r\n\r\nthe aim of the Government with regard to this Bill.\r\n\r\nIn  all  sincerity, we believe that  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwill  safeguard  the  security  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole, irrespective of the colour of\r\n\r\ntheir skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all, Mr Speaker. I give my whole-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the\r\n\r\nOpposition  enthused over the rights and  liberties\r\n\r\nof    the    individual,   democratic   traditions,\r\n\r\nindependence  of  the Judiciary,  I  wondered  what\r\n\r\nwould  have happened had they won, and we lost  the\r\n\r\nelection.  I venture to suggest, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat human liberties are better preserved with this\r\n\r\nGovernment than if the position were reversed.  Can\r\n\r\none  imagine a Government with Mak Pak  Shee,  Seah\r\n\r\nPeng  Chuan, Tang Peng Yeu, Vasagar and  God  knows\r\n\r\nwho  else-S.P.A./Lib. Socs, combined?  I  say  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  would have flown out of the window,  and\r\n\r\nthe  only  people  left would be those  who  stayed\r\n\r\nunderground  and would probably fight  and  finally\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  system.  Let us not  be  hypocritical\r\n\r\nabout  these things. We know, and they  know,  what\r\n\r\nthe   power  positions  are.  Despite  the   little\r\n\r\nunhappiness  that  Members of the Opposition  feel,\r\n\r\nthat  some  of the actions of the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nmay  not be what they themselves would have  taken,\r\n\r\nlet  them  search their conscience  and  ask,  \"Has\r\n\r\nthere been a denial or a negation of the spirit  of\r\n\r\nreasonableness and tolerance which is  the  essence\r\n\r\nof a democratic system?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been castigated by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin   for  taking  this  Bill  through   on   a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Urgency. May  I  explain,  without\r\n\r\ngiving  away too much, that it would not have  made\r\n\r\nthe slightest difference to us whether we took this\r\n\r\nBill through all the three stages in one sitting or\r\n\r\nspread  it  over  three  or four  months?  We  were\r\n\r\nprovident  enough to foresee the sort of situations\r\n\r\nwhich would arise when we won the election. We took\r\n\r\na stand last year for this specific purpose and the\r\n\r\nstand has stood the test of time. Why the urgency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen?  It  is not because we feared public  debate.\r\n\r\nThe public debate started in October last year. The\r\n\r\nlast  meeting of the Internal Security Council  was\r\n\r\non 8th October. What the Deputy Prime Minister read\r\n\r\nout  is the power position of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) The competence of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nto  formulate  and implement policy  affecting\r\n\r\ninternal   security   is   subject   to    the\r\n\r\noverriding  powers  of the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In addition to consultations and decisions on\r\n\r\nquestions  of  policy, the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil   is   competent  to  make   executive\r\n\r\ndecisions  for  the  maintenance  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  in Singapore, and any such  decision\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been communicated to the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment must be given immediate effect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It goes on to (3) and (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the strict constitutional position. We\r\n\r\ncould just fold our arms, and those sections in the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  which allow for a  situation  to  be\r\n\r\novercome where the Singapore Government refuses  to\r\n\r\nmove in this Legislature, would have to be invoked.\r\n\r\nIf  our views, albeit somewhat different from those\r\n\r\nof   the  other  representatives,  were  not  given\r\n\r\nconsideration,  then  that  might  have  been   the\r\n\r\nposition we would have adopted. In other words,  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  have pushed through this Bill.  It  was\r\n\r\nbecause basically we felt that we had to honour our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities as a Government, so  long  as  our\r\n\r\nviews  are given proper weight and attention,  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  moved to put the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity (Amendment) Bill through this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition had only one point to make and\r\n\r\nthat was on the alteration of the complexion of the\r\n\r\nreview  tribunal - from an appellate tribunal  to  an\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee. They reminded me  of  rockets.\r\n\r\nOnce  set  on  a  fixed course, without  corrective\r\n\r\ndevices,   they   go   out   into   outer    space.\r\n\r\nMiscalculations are made; targets are missed;  they\r\n\r\ngo  out into outer space never to return. The  next\r\n\r\nstep  is to find a rocket with a corrective device;\r\n\r\nthen  it  might hit the moon or go round  the  moon\r\n\r\ntwice and come back to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they did not know. Putting it at its best\r\n\r\nconstruction, they were unaware  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  position.  They  were  real,   true\r\n\r\ndemocrats who have complete faith not only  in  the\r\n\r\nintegrity but also in the sagacity of the Judges as\r\n\r\nadministrators and executive officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter that I had read out is the complete\r\n\r\nand  conclusive answer to any suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nposition was otherwise. I had given some Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  did not know of the letter. After all it  was\r\n\r\naddressed  to the last government and some  Members\r\n\r\non  the  other side were not Members  of  the  last\r\n\r\ngovernment.  But having got to know of the  letter,\r\n\r\nand  then  nevertheless to go  on  and  hammer  the\r\n\r\nargument that this is a negation of democracy seems\r\n\r\nto me a travesty of a debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put the argument that they have advanced,\r\n\r\nsuccinctly  in the reverse. The Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark said that one of the more laudable features of\r\n\r\nour system is the respect with which the judges are\r\n\r\nheld.  The  fact  that they are,  not  corrupt,  or\r\n\r\nunfair  or biased, is acceptable. For what purpose?\r\n\r\nFor  the  purposes  of administering  the  law,  to\r\n\r\ninterpret facts, make findings on them, and  decide\r\n\r\non  the  law  applicable. If they are used  for  an\r\n\r\nexecutive   purpose,  and  this  is   exactly   the\r\n\r\nsituation they do not wish to find themselves in - if\r\n\r\nthey are used in an executive tribunal to say \"yes\"\r\n\r\nor  \"no\" to an executive act, the consequences that\r\n\r\nfollow  will  be  the reverse of what  the  Members\r\n\r\nopposite   have  expressed  they  would   like   to\r\n\r\nsee - public  esteem of the Judiciary.  Let  us  face\r\n\r\nfacts.  He  whose appeal is denied and rejected  is\r\n\r\nnot going to accept the independence of that Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal. The Communist Party is not going  to  sit\r\n\r\nback  and  say, \"Ah! Yes, we have been  fairly  and\r\n\r\nadequately  heard by a panel of two Judges  of  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court and one District Judge. They have found\r\n\r\nour comrade so-and-so a fit and proper person to be\r\n\r\ndetained.  So  be it.\" That is not the  case.  They\r\n\r\nsystematically set out to destroy the  prestige  of\r\n\r\nthe  Judges, to smear them as stooges and executive\r\n\r\ninstruments of the Government. Thereby  you  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusefulness in the proper office for which they were\r\n\r\nconstituted, namely, to hold a fair trial according\r\n\r\nto  the  law. It is as simple as that. That is  why\r\n\r\nthe Judges wrote in those terms. I became aware  of\r\n\r\nthis position, and so discussed the matter with the\r\n\r\npresent Chief Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case it is thought that I had read out a\r\n\r\nbogus   letter,  I  extended  the  courtesy,  which\r\n\r\nnormally are not expected of Governments, of taking\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  is  not  a  nominal  leader  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  into my confidence. I  was  willing  to\r\n\r\ndisclose  the  circumstances in which  that  letter\r\n\r\ncame to be written, and the advantage was taken of.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Farrer Park knows exactly what  the\r\n\r\nposition  is.  What his leader,  the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  wrote to the Acting Chief Justice;  what\r\n\r\nthe  Acting Chief Justice wrote back; and what  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chief  Minister wrote  back  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice. Yet he comes here like an American  rocket\r\n\r\non  a  set  course shooting out into  outer  space,\r\n\r\nunable  to  alter  course in the  face  of  altered\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me wind up the Second Reading of this Bill by\r\n\r\nharking back again to the long-term issue.  In  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  which  we  find  ourselves,  it   is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that  these extraordinary  powers  will\r\n\r\nhave  to be exercised by whoever wishes to see that\r\n\r\norder  exists  and  law is possible.  Usually  when\r\n\r\nlawyers  talk, they use the phrase \"law and  order\"\r\n\r\nbut  I think lawyers are the first to know that  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  no  order, there is no law.  You  cannot\r\n\r\nenforce the law in a state of disorder. That is  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  this  Bill  provides - that  in  exceptional\r\n\r\nsituations, in order that public order shall not be\r\n\r\nupset,   extraordinary  steps  are  taken  by   the\r\n\r\nExecutive to ensure that the security of the  State\r\n\r\nis  not  undermined. But whether you finally  bring\r\n\r\nthe  whole of your people round to believe that the\r\n\r\nsystem you are working is worth preserving, because\r\n\r\nit  works  for  the benefit of the people,  depends\r\n\r\nupon    your   economic,   social   and   political\r\n\r\nprogrammes.

In the first  instance,  if  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government acts, then it  recommends  to\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara,  i.e. the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara is satisfied on the advice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  that is the Cabinet.  If  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  in  agreement  with  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council,  the Internal  Security  Council\r\n\r\ncould  then advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  The\r\n\r\nPart of the Constitution which provides for this is\r\n\r\nPart VII of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution, \"The Internal Security Council\",\r\n\r\nsection 66:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) It shall be competent to the Council to make\r\n\r\ndecisions  for  the  maintenance  of  the  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity of Singapore or for the due performance of\r\n\r\nthe  functions  conferred on it  by  the  preceding\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every decision made under the preceding\r\n\r\nsubsection shall forthwith be communicated to the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore and it shall be the duty of\r\n\r\nthat Government to give immediate effect to that\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the Chairman of the Council is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat the Government of Singapore has failed to give\r\n\r\neffect  to any such decision as aforesaid, he  may,\r\n\r\nby  writing under his hand, so inform the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, and advise him to  make  an  Order\r\n\r\ngiving  effect to that decision; and the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara shall make an order accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Chairman, with the concurrence of the\r\n\r\nCouncil, may, from time to time, advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to make a further Order revoking  or\r\n\r\namending  any  Order made under this  section,  and\r\n\r\nupon  such  advice  being communicated  to  him  by\r\n\r\nwriting  under  the  hand of the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara shall make such\r\n\r\nfurther Order accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it means is this: Let us assume for a moment\r\n\r\nthat  in  the best liberal traditions we refuse  to\r\n\r\ndeal with a known subversive who is a member of the\r\n\r\nopposition Party, but the internal Security Council\r\n\r\nfeels, however, that in the interests of order  and\r\n\r\nprogress such a person should not be allowed to  be\r\n\r\nat   large.   Then,  theoretically  speaking,   the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council  orders  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Singapore Government advises the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara. If the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nchooses  to  be acquiescent, then these  provisions\r\n\r\nare   invoked:   the  Singapore  Government   being\r\n\r\nacquiescent,  the advice is directly given  to  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara. But I can  assure  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  that  if any Right-wing subversion  takes\r\n\r\nplace  in  Singapore, the first of those  instances\r\n\r\nwhich   I   have   mentioned   will   take   effect\r\n\r\nimmediately.

At\r\n\r\npresent,  for example, where a man is charged  with\r\n\r\nassisting  in carrying on a chap ji ki lottery,  it\r\n\r\nis necessary for a witness to give evidence to show\r\n\r\nin  detail how a chap ji ki lottery is run so as to\r\n\r\nshow  that  chap  ji ki is a public  lottery.  This\r\n\r\nwould appear to be necessary even though chap ji ki\r\n\r\nhas  been held to be a lottery in a number of cases\r\n\r\nin the High Court and in the subordinate Courts and\r\n\r\nalthough the magistrate, for example, who tries the\r\n\r\ncase  may  from his own experience of  trying  such\r\n\r\ncases know how a chap ji ki lottery is run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the Court to take judicial\r\n\r\nnotice  that  a  game, method,  device,  scheme  or\r\n\r\ncompetition is a public lottery. Power is given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to declare any game, method,  device,\r\n\r\nscheme  or  competition to be a  lottery,  and  the\r\n\r\nCourt  is  required  to accept the  evidence  of  a\r\n\r\npolice officer not below the rank of Sergeant  that\r\n\r\na  document produced before it is a lottery  ticket\r\n\r\nor  an  account, memorandum or record of stakes  or\r\n\r\nwagers  in  or  relating to a  public  lottery,  as\r\n\r\npresumptive evidence of that fact. The  reason  why\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to allow a police officer of  the\r\n\r\nrank of Sergeant to give such evidence is that  the\r\n\r\ngambling experts of tie Police Force are at present\r\n\r\nof the rank of Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to increase the\r\n\r\nterm  of  imprisonment for which a  person  can  be\r\n\r\nsentenced  under  section 4 of  the  Common  Gaming\r\n\r\nHouses  Ordinance from 12 months to 3  years.  This\r\n\r\nremoves the anomaly of a person who is sentenced to\r\n\r\npay  a  fine  of  $6,000 under  section  4  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  being liable in the event of non-payment\r\n\r\nof  the fine to imprisonment in default of only six\r\n\r\nmonths. The period for which a person can be  bound\r\n\r\nover  under  section 21 of the Ordinance  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen increased from one year to three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I read this Bill\r\n\r\nfor the first time, I had some doubts about one  of\r\n\r\nthe   subsections  of  clause  2,  that  particular\r\n\r\nsubsection which enables the Minister to gazette  a\r\n\r\ngame,  method, device, scheme or competition  as  a\r\n\r\nlottery to be an irrebuttable presumption in Court.\r\n\r\nI  felt that this would be a subsection which could\r\n\r\nbe  used to give the Minister, if I may put  it  in\r\n\r\nthis  way,  a  competitive  jurisdiction  with  the\r\n\r\nordinary Courts of the country. But after listening\r\n\r\nto  the Minister, I will not raise any objection if\r\n\r\nthe  whole  point and purpose of this amendment  is\r\n\r\nmerely  to enact in a general way that a particular\r\n\r\ngame  is  a  public lottery. This would, therefore,\r\n\r\nmean  that  some  of  the  complicated  and  rather\r\n\r\ndifficult evidence which is now required to  prove,\r\n\r\nshall  I say, a game of chap ji ki need not be  led\r\n\r\nin  evidence.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  would  like  an\r\n\r\nassurance from the Minister for Labour and Law that\r\n\r\nif  he  is  to use these powers under this proposed\r\n\r\nsubsection,  he  would  gazette  in  general  terms\r\n\r\nrather  than  in  particular ones.  May  I  explain\r\n\r\nmyself.   If  the  Minister  wishes  to  use   this\r\n\r\nsubsection, he could say that a particular kind  of\r\n\r\ngame,  say, football, in general shall be a  public\r\n\r\nlottery  but  he will not use these powers  to  say\r\n\r\nthat a game of football played on a particular day,\r\n\r\non  a  particular ground and between two particular\r\n\r\nteams  is a lottery. Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  the  subsection as it  now  stands  could\r\n\r\nenable  the  Minister to do both  these  things  or\r\n\r\neither one of them. I can appreciate the difficulty\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Labour and  Law,  and  I  can\r\n\r\nappreciate why he wants this subsection, because  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the proving of chap ji  ki  is  a  very\r\n\r\ntricky  matter  in Court and sometimes  people  get\r\n\r\naway  with it because of the difficulty of  proving\r\n\r\nit.  If  I  can have the Minister's assurance  that\r\n\r\nthis  subsection will only be used in general cases\r\n\r\nto declare a game or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition to be a lottery and will not be used in\r\n\r\nsuch  a way as to make it easy for the prosecution.\r\n\r\nLet  me explain. Supposing a case is put up to  the\r\n\r\nProsecutor's Department after investigation and the\r\n\r\nProsecutor  after  investigation says,  \"Well,  you\r\n\r\nknow, it is very difficult, this way, that way.  We\r\n\r\nmight  get  a conviction or we might not.\"  So  the\r\n\r\nmatter is put up to the State Advocate-General  who\r\n\r\nthen approaches the Minister for Labour and Law and\r\n\r\nsays,  \"Look, Mr Minister, this chap is  a  crook,\r\n\r\nyou  know.  He must be put in, but if we  take  him\r\n\r\ninto  Court, his clever lawyers might get him  out.\r\n\r\nTherefore, will you gazette this particular game or\r\n\r\nthis  particular  competition  to  be  a  lottery?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the Minister gazettes it and the man  is\r\n\r\nthen  brought in to Court. The Court is then  faced\r\n\r\nwith a Gazette order which declares it to be a game\r\n\r\nwhich   by   virtue  of  this  subsection   is   an\r\n\r\nirrebuttable   presumption   of   law.   In   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, all that the Court is left  with  is\r\n\r\nto  convict  him  and  fine  him  or  sentence  him\r\n\r\naccording  to  law. If I can have the assurance  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law that this will not\r\n\r\ntake place, I will not raise any further objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether any other\r\n\r\nMember wishes to speak.

It is well known that the\r\n\r\nactivities   of   secret  society   gangsters   are\r\n\r\nfrequently centred on the proceeds of prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe so-called protection of these loose women is  a\r\n\r\nfruitful source of revenue to gangsters, who do not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to  assault those persons  who  will  not\r\n\r\ncontribute to their own protection.

The  weakness of the present legislation  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police  can only prosecute  persons  for\r\n\r\npossession of these offensive weapons when they are\r\n\r\napprehended in a public place. The Police found  it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to prove ownership  of  caches  of\r\n\r\nsecret  society  offensive weapons  when  they  are\r\n\r\ndiscovered in houses and other premises.

The law-abiding householder  or  artisan\r\n\r\nneed  have  no fear that he will be prevented  from\r\n\r\nhaving  in  his  possession  such  implements   for\r\n\r\ngenuine  domestic purposes or for purposes  of  his\r\n\r\ntrade,  but  resolute action will be taken  against\r\n\r\nthugs whose sole aim is to terrorise or to kill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 of the Bill is a new provision designed\r\n\r\nto  outlaw  those particularly vicious  weapons - the\r\n\r\nflick  knives.  These  vicious  implements  can  be\r\n\r\neasily carried and concealed, but with no more than\r\n\r\na  flick  of the wrist they are converted  into  an\r\n\r\ninstrument of death. The effect of this section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  will  be  to make it illegal  for  these\r\n\r\nweapons  to exist on this island. Members will  see\r\n\r\nthat   penalties  for  having  or   possessing   an\r\n\r\noffensive  weapon,  which I  have  just  mentioned,\r\n\r\nincludes a heavy fine or imprisonment for the first\r\n\r\noffence;  and if the offence is repeated,  a  heavy\r\n\r\nprison sentence can be inflicted without option  of\r\n\r\nthe fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, it is the intention of\r\n\r\nthis  Government to use all means in its  power  to\r\n\r\nsmash the gangsters in our midst, and we will  take\r\n\r\nall  additional necessary measures to achieve  this\r\n\r\naim and to safeguard the law-abiding persons of the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, contrary to the previous\r\n\r\nstatement expressed by the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw that Members of the Opposition know only how to\r\n\r\ncriticise, I wish here to express my great pleasure\r\n\r\nin  supporting this Bill and promise to support any\r\n\r\nother Bill brought forth by Government to clean  up\r\n\r\nthis country from bottom to top, or top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Inside out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I believe we should go\r\n\r\neven  further.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in connection with the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  in  Singapore, I would  like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat, as we all know, the Special Constabulary Unit\r\n\r\nwas  formed in September 1945, and in the 14  years\r\n\r\nup  to  today the youths who served in the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary have rendered a great service. We know\r\n\r\nthat  on 30th April, 1959, six Inspectors and about\r\n\r\n180  members of the Special Constabulary took  part\r\n\r\nin  a parade held at the Police Training School and\r\n\r\namong them about eight were awarded Service Medals.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   it   is   clear   that   the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary,  since its formation, has  played  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in the Island of Singapore. We  know\r\n\r\nalso that there are some amongst them who have lost\r\n\r\ntheir lives in the performance of their duties.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  deny this. Mr Speaker, it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nregret to us that the Government had terminated the\r\n\r\nservices  of  about  250  members  of  the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary.  This  constitutes  a   big   problem\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government which is  responsible  for\r\n\r\nthis   has   stated  that  these  people   had   no\r\n\r\nqualifications. On this point, it is a big question\r\n\r\nmark today. We do not know whether this matter  has\r\n\r\na communal bearing or not. It is up to the Assembly\r\n\r\nto  decide. In fact, on this matter the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should decide. I do not say that it is  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  affair.  But it is strange  to  say  that\r\n\r\nalthough  our  Government today has  declared  that\r\n\r\nMalay  is  the national language, and although  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constables can be said to be qualified  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  language, yet their services  had  been\r\n\r\nterminated on the ground that they had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  qualification. Mr Speaker,  we  can  say  that\r\n\r\nthese  constables are fluent in the Malay language.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that the majority of them whose  services\r\n\r\nhad been terminated are Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, with regard to this matter why were\r\n\r\nthey  not  given  an opportunity to continue  their\r\n\r\nservices?  There  is a proverb  which,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nmeans  that it is ingratitude to discard  something\r\n\r\nafter  your purpose has been served. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink this Government will adopt this attitude, for\r\n\r\nthis is a Government which has declared that it has\r\n\r\nbeen  elected by the people and will therefore look\r\n\r\nafter the interest of the people. I am sure it will\r\n\r\nnot  follow the saying: \"After you have crossed the\r\n\r\nbridge, you throw away the walking stick.\"  I  know\r\n\r\nthat the present Government is not like a hen which\r\n\r\nlays  just  an  egg each time, but  rather  like  a\r\n\r\nturtle which lays many eggs at a time. This  is  an\r\n\r\nexample  which  has been given by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit Timah some time back in this Assembly. He has\r\n\r\nstated so and told it to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of making Malay the national\r\n\r\nlanguage,  the  Member said this: \"To  do  this  is\r\n\r\nwrong,  and  to  do  that also is  wrong.\"  I  hope\r\n\r\ntherefore  to receive some clarification  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, what is going to happen to the Malays\r\n\r\nwho  cannot afford to have further education, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  receiving  an  education  in  Malay  schools?\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Special Constables  know  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage, their services were terminated  for  want\r\n\r\nof  qualifications. Ultimately, those who only know\r\n\r\nthe Malay language will die an untimely death. This\r\n\r\nis the fate of the blind who need guidance and like\r\n\r\nthose  who depend on the fence to protect the  padi\r\n\r\nseedlings,  they find later that it  is  the  fence\r\n\r\nitself that collapses and destroys them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told of the policy concerning\r\n\r\ncitizenship. In order to obtain citizenship  today,\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain qualifications laid down  which\r\n\r\nmust  be complied with. For instance, there is  the\r\n\r\nspecific period of residence necessary to enable  a\r\n\r\nperson  to  become a citizen of Singapore.  Compare\r\n\r\nthis with Malay as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   national  language,  the  language  of  those\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Special Constabulary whose services\r\n\r\nwere terminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, why is it then that the\r\n\r\nservices of these people were terminated? Why  were\r\n\r\nthey  not  given  an opportunity  to  stay  on  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to serve as they have served for a  number\r\n\r\nof years? Why cannot we help our young men who have\r\n\r\nserved the State and have proved their worth? Where\r\n\r\nis   justice   and  fair  play  then?  An   elected\r\n\r\ngovernment of the people in a self-governing  State\r\n\r\nmust  render  all  assistance  to  those  who  were\r\n\r\nignored  by the past government. We have proclaimed\r\n\r\ndemocracy. But step-sons have always been ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to continue this matter further, there are some points to which should like to draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Government so that they  will\r\n\r\nreceive  due attention. I refer especially  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constables who comprise all the  races  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   whether   the   services   have   been\r\n\r\nterminated or whether they are still in the  Force.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the annual report of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice Force for the year 1958, there is a shortage\r\n\r\nof  personnel and yet those who had served  in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary  have  not  been  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to fill these vacant posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that this Government will not\r\n\r\nignore  the  fate  of  these constables  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies who are in need of the bare necessities of\r\n\r\nlife. Mr Speaker, it is strange that these people,\r\n\r\nwho    have   been   considered   as   having    no\r\n\r\nqualification, had received their training from the\r\n\r\nPolice Training School in Singapore. It means  that\r\n\r\nthe  training that they had received was of no  use\r\n\r\nat  all.  On the other hand, we all know  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the members of the Special Constabulary\r\n\r\nwhose services were terminated are Malays. If  this\r\n\r\nis  the  state of affairs, if this is the treatment\r\n\r\nmeted  out to the Malays, who are considered to  be\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous people of Singapore and who are  in\r\n\r\nneed of help in many aspects of life, as stated  in\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution of Singapore, then it means  that\r\n\r\nthe special position of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalays  is  being ignored. That is what  it  simply\r\n\r\nmeans  when these special constables are  dismissed\r\n\r\nfrom   their   jobs,  and  not  given   alternative\r\n\r\nemployment. I hope that this Government will not be\r\n\r\none-sided,  and that it will give an  assurance  to\r\n\r\ntreat them-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I want to\r\n\r\nask whether the hon.

Mr Speaker, as I have said\r\n\r\njust now with regard to the position of the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary, what is the policy of the  Government\r\n\r\ntowards  the  special position  of  the  Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore? If the Malay language is not suitable as\r\n\r\na  qualification - for, as has been explained in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, the services of the special  constables\r\n\r\nwere    terminated   because    they    were    not\r\n\r\nqualified - where then is the special position of the\r\n\r\nMalays?  Where then are the special rights  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  as  mentioned in a special  clause  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to criticise the Government or to\r\n\r\ncause annoyance to the Government, but I only  want\r\n\r\nsome  clarification. It may be  that  without  such\r\n\r\nclarification the position might be misconstrued by\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in  Singapore. The  Malays  are  today\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  supporting the  Government  in  its\r\n\r\ndeclared   policy  in  making  Malay  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  I  hope  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  will in turn consider why the  services\r\n\r\nof  these special constables were terminated. Today\r\n\r\nthere  exists a force called the Volunteer  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary. They are not in fact volunteers. They\r\n\r\nreceive an allowance and some other benefits.  Such\r\n\r\npeople  who  volunteer their services  are  already\r\n\r\nemployed.  Why  is  it that such people  are  still\r\n\r\nrequired?  On  the  other  hand,  those  who   have\r\n\r\nrendered their services to the State, who know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na little about administrative matters in the Police\r\n\r\nForce,  have had their services terminated  on  the\r\n\r\nground that they are not qualified, although  Malay\r\n\r\nhas  been  made the national language of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat is all, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI am taking this opportunity to speak at the end of\r\n\r\nthis    sitting   in   order   to   clarify    some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding which was expressed by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan in his adjournment speech. If\r\n\r\nsomeone is fluent in the Malay language, it  cannot\r\n\r\nbe said that he has the necessary qualification and\r\n\r\nshould  be accepted as a police officer. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthose  who are maimed can also claim that they  too\r\n\r\nare  fit  to be police officers. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of the Special Constabulary was  because\r\n\r\nof  the  Emergency which first broke out in  Malaya\r\n\r\nand then spread to Singapore. In order to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  peace  and security of both these territories,\r\n\r\nthe  Special Constabulary was formed in Malaya  and\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  too.  They were  required  to  help\r\n\r\nsafeguard  Singapore and its waters,  and  also  to\r\n\r\nguard it from undesirable elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of dismissed special constables did\r\n\r\nnot  only  exist  in  Singapore  but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation when the Emergency conditions  improved.\r\n\r\nMembers   of   the  Home  Guard  and  the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  in  the  Federation  too  had   their\r\n\r\nservices  terminated,  or  those  units  had  their\r\n\r\nstrength   reduced  when  the  Emergency  situation\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know, the former Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhad  already  made  a  decision  to  terminate  the\r\n\r\nservices of the Special Constabulary. But they  did\r\n\r\nnot  have the guts to terminate their services then\r\n\r\nbecause  they had to face the general elections  in\r\n\r\nMay.  For that reason, the \"buck\" was unfortunately\r\n\r\npassed on to us. Those who used the services of the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary are not the present Government\r\n\r\nbut  the previous Government. Thus, the analogy  of\r\n\r\nthe  fence destroying the crops could appropriately\r\n\r\nbe applied to the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the representatives of the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary had seen the Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw,  and  that  the  Minister had  given  them  an\r\n\r\nassurance that every possible assistance  would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them.  He  had  assured  them  that   if\r\n\r\ncommercial firms required the services of  watchmen\r\n\r\nor  some similar jobs, the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw  would  give  top  priority  to  these  special\r\n\r\nconstables  whose  services  had  been  terminated.\r\n\r\nThus,  although they had rendered services  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government, the P.A.P.  Government  still\r\n\r\nhas a high regard for their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   disband  the   temporary   Special\r\n\r\nConstables since the Emergency and temporary duties\r\n\r\nfor  which they had been recruited had come  to  an\r\n\r\nend. The majority of those discharged were employed\r\n\r\non  searchlight duty in the Johore Straits  control\r\n\r\nscheme, which operated until the end of last  year,\r\n\r\nto  assist the Federation during the Emergency.  In\r\n\r\nanticipation of their redundancy, the  Police  have\r\n\r\nsince  last  year absorbed a good number  or  these\r\n\r\ntemporary  Special  Constables  into  the   regular\r\n\r\nPolice   Force.  I  am  sure  that  those   Special\r\n\r\nConstables  who  the Member for  Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nmentioned  have  received  awards  for  meritorious\r\n\r\nservices, would have been absorbed into the regular\r\n\r\nPolice Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a Guard and Escort Unit was recently\r\n\r\nset   up   and  a  further  825  temporary  Special\r\n\r\nConstables were absorbed into the Unit. The balance\r\n\r\nof  250  Special Constables were considered by  the\r\n\r\npolice to have lacked the necessary qualifications.\r\n\r\nAnd  by  qualifications, I  do  not  mean  language\r\n\r\nalone. If language is considered the only criterion\r\n\r\nfor  selection, then, as my colleague,  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Timah has said, those who are  lame,  or\r\n\r\nmaimed,  or blind, can also be accepted. For  those 250 Special  Constables,  a  phased  programme  to\r\n\r\ndischarge them early this year was not accepted and\r\n\r\nimplemented by the S.P.A. Government (of which Dato\r\n\r\nAbdul  Hamid  bin Haji Jumat was the  Deputy  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister), because of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpending  general  elections, although  they  knew\r\n\r\nthat  these temporary Special Constables had to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged because the purpose for which  they  had\r\n\r\nbeen  recruited  had come to an end.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of  their posts being filled by  Chinese,\r\n\r\nbecause  all  the posts of the Special Constabulary\r\n\r\nhave  been  abolished. It is also not true  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  discharged temporary Special  Constables\r\n\r\nwere  all  Malays  or  that we  have  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  the Malays. First and foremost, these  250\r\n\r\ntemporary  Special  Constables  were  selected  for\r\n\r\ndischarge  during the time of the last  Government,\r\n\r\nand  if there had been any discrimination, then the\r\n\r\nDato,  the  Member  for Kampong  Kembangan's  Party\r\n\r\nchairman,  had condoned it. But, nevertheless,  for\r\n\r\nhis  information, I would like to mention  that  of\r\n\r\nthose  discharged  there were  eight  Chinese,  six\r\n\r\nIndians, two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFilipinos and two Eurasians. The Malays  were  the\r\n\r\nlargest  in  number because most of  the  temporary\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constables were Malays. As  my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Timah, has pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law had tried his  best  to\r\n\r\nhelp   those  Special  Constables  who   had   been\r\n\r\ndischarged.  He had asked the banks  and  firms  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to employ them. For many of those who had\r\n\r\ncome  from the Federation, he had offered to secure\r\n\r\nfor them free warrants to go back to the Federation\r\n\r\nby train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nine minutes to Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Wednesday, 11th November, 1959.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
