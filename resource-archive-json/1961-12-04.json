But the intimidatory methods and force used\r\n\r\nby  pickets during the past week have become so intense\r\n\r\nthat  the  parents  have decided to  send  in  a  joint\r\n\r\npetition  urging me to get this House to  sanction  the\r\n\r\nuse of police to protect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed any further, I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the word \"protection\".

Inflammatory  slogans  which   were\r\n\r\nentirely  unfounded, such as, \"Special Agents  Beat  up\r\n\r\nStudents\" and \"Students' Blood Does Not Flow  In  Vain\"\r\n\r\nwere  painted  in red on street walls,  cinemas,  lamp-posts  and  other strategica1ly glaring spots,  with  a\r\n\r\nview to inciting the feelings of the people against the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the weekend, with the cooperation of the\r\n\r\ndiligent  staff of the Ministry of Education,  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  a thorough check of the actual number of students\r\n\r\nwho  have  taken examinations and those that  have  not\r\n\r\ntaken.  We have facts, figures and names to prove  that\r\n\r\nof  the 3,171 candidates, only 927 have not taken their\r\n\r\nexaminations.  Of  these 927, we have  good  reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that many would have sat for the examinations,\r\n\r\nbut  for  the  intimidatory methods used by  picketers.\r\n\r\nWith  the  kind co-operation of the postal authorities,\r\n\r\nwe  have sent out urgent letters, signed personally  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Education, to parents  of  the  927\r\n\r\ncandidates,  appealing to them to bring their  children\r\n\r\nto  sit for the supplementary examinations which  began\r\n\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Sir, 240 candidates who were prevented\r\n\r\nlast  week  from taking their examinations  by  pickets\r\n\r\nhave turned up for the supplementary examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  large  number  of  parents  rang  up  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  complain again that their  children  were\r\n\r\nstill  prevented  from entering the examination  rooms.\r\n\r\nThere  are  still human chains outside the  examination\r\n\r\ncentres. Similar methods of intimidation are being used\r\n\r\nby  the  pickets. The parents have emphasised in  their\r\n\r\npetition to me that in a democratic country like  ours,\r\n\r\nthe people should have the democratic right and freedom\r\n\r\nto sit for an examination. When such freedom and rights\r\n\r\nare  interfered  with  by  uninvited  intimidation  and\r\n\r\nforce,  it  is the duty of the Government to  see  that\r\n\r\nsuch rights are upheld and the parents protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the parents are asking for, Sir, is police\r\n\r\nprotection  and not police suppression, as  twisted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. If the picketers had  from  the\r\n\r\nbeginning   adopted  peaceful  methods  of   persuasion\r\n\r\ninstead   of  the  type  of  hooliganism  as  we   have\r\n\r\nwitnessed,  then  this  motion  would  not  have   been\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Press reports, Sir, the picketers claim\r\n\r\nthat 2,000 so-called parents attended a meeting at  the\r\n\r\nChinese   High  School  yesterday  and  passed  certain\r\n\r\nresolutions  supporting  the  picketers.  One  of   the\r\n\r\nresolutions  sounds rather mysterious and no  doubt  it\r\n\r\nwas  coined in such terms as to mislead the people.  It\r\n\r\nreads:  \"Determined  to oppose using  of  military  and\r\n\r\npolice against students who use peaceful persuasion  to\r\n\r\npicket  and  determined to request  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw its motion on December the 4th to condemn  the\r\n\r\npicketers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will have seen the Straits Times of 30th\r\n\r\nNovember  with  a  picture  on  the  front  page,   and\r\n\r\neverybody  in the city knows whether this  is  peaceful\r\n\r\npersuasion or this is intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, who are these so-called parents? So far,\r\n\r\naccording to official figures, only 927 candidates have\r\n\r\nnot  taken  examinations last week, and of  these,  240\r\n\r\nhave   sat  for  the  supplementary  examinations  this\r\n\r\nmorning,  leaving barely 600 candidates  who  have  not\r\n\r\ntaken examinations. Of these 600, many have rung up to\r\n\r\nsay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  could not get into examination rooms.  Even\r\n\r\ntaking for granted that there are 600 picketers, surely\r\n\r\n600  picketers cannot have 2,000 parents. We  challenge\r\n\r\nthe  picketers to publish the names of these  so-called\r\n\r\nparents and the names of their children who they  claim\r\n\r\nare   candidates  of  the  Government   Secondary   IV\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our side, Sir, we are prepared and ready to publish\r\n\r\nthe names of candidates who have taken the examinations\r\n\r\nand  those  who have not taken them so that the  public\r\n\r\nwill not be confused and misled into believing that the\r\n\r\naction  of  the  picketers has got the support  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the resolution which I have just mentioned - that\r\n\r\nis  the  slogan by the so-called parents at the Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh School - gave the impression that the Government had\r\n\r\nused  the  military  and  the police  against  innocent\r\n\r\nstudents.  This, I say, is most mischievous. The  whole\r\n\r\ncity  knows  and, in fact, in many cases the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been blamed for not doing its duty to maintain law\r\n\r\nand  order.  Nobody, except in the imagination  of  the\r\n\r\nagitators, has seen any military truck or any police in\r\n\r\naction against the students during the last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have stressed over and over again that it is\r\n\r\nnot  the intention of the Government to use the  Police\r\n\r\nForce against students. As long as the real non-student\r\n\r\norganisers  of  this  dangerous campaign  believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  are Members of this House ready to condone  this\r\n\r\npicketing,  and,  what  is  more  important,  ready  to\r\n\r\nexploit the strong emotions that could be aroused as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  clashes between children and police,  these\r\n\r\nnon-student  organisers will egg the  picketers  on  to\r\n\r\nmore desperate acts of provocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the elected representatives of this House - both\r\n\r\nGovernment and Opposition - make it quite clear that they\r\n\r\nare  on  the side of law and order, that no Assemblyman\r\n\r\nwill  be  prepared to exploit a situation arising  when\r\n\r\nthe police give such assistance as may be necessary  to\r\n\r\nparents  and  students in the exercise of their  lawful\r\n\r\nrights, then I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  certain  that  the non-student organisers  of  this\r\n\r\npicketing and the picketers themselves will not  embark\r\n\r\non  acts  of recklessness. They will not do so  because\r\n\r\nthey will then know that behind the lawful exercise  of\r\n\r\npolice  authority there is, the sanction  of  not  only\r\n\r\nparents   and   students  but  also  of   the   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people without regard  to  party\r\n\r\nconflicts  and bribery. For in this case,  we  are  not\r\n\r\ndealing with an educational issue but with an explosive\r\n\r\nsituation  which, if badly handled, could  plunge  this\r\n\r\nwhole  city  into violence and disorder. In this  case,\r\n\r\nthe  organisers  of this boycott are working  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a clash between the police and picketing  school\r\n\r\nchildren  in the hope of sparking off violent emotions.\r\n\r\nBut  there is a clear indication, Sir, that if and when\r\n\r\npolice  protection  has to be enforced  it  would  have\r\n\r\nbehind  it the backing of the public, students, parents\r\n\r\nand  all  our Assemblymen, then the organisers of  this\r\n\r\ndangerous and cowardly campaign would know that if they\r\n\r\ndo  anything foolish they would have the full force  of\r\n\r\npublic  opinion at every level against them  and  these\r\n\r\nagitators  would themselves have to face the  anger  of\r\n\r\nthe people and take the full consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, we ask every Member of this\r\n\r\nHouse  to make it clear that where police authority  is\r\n\r\nlawfully and justly used as in this case, it would have\r\n\r\nthe endorsement o, all Members of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some\r\n\r\nthree or four days ago, I had occasion to speak in this\r\n\r\nHouse  about matters appertaining to the present motion\r\n\r\nbefore the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one cannot understand how the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  education  and  any  disagreement  in   an\r\n\r\neducational system which the State has arrived at after\r\n\r\ndue  and proper consultations with persons who are able\r\n\r\nto  advise the Government on these matters, should have\r\n\r\nnow turned out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the issue which it has. -If the issue before  the\r\n\r\ncountry  is whether Chinese students should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  take the Secondary IV examination, I personally  am\r\n\r\nnot competent to speak on that. But in such matters  on\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  not  competent to speak, naturally  I  am\r\n\r\nguided  by persons who are competent to speak  on  such\r\n\r\nmatters  and, in my view, the persons who are competent\r\n\r\nto  speak on these matters are the educational  experts\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese educational field. As far as  I  could\r\n\r\nunderstand from the Government, these people have  been\r\n\r\nconsulted  and  it  was agreed that  the  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nexamination was a good thing for Chinese education  and\r\n\r\nChinese culture. Apparently, that was the situation two\r\n\r\nor three months ago, but since then things have taken a\r\n\r\ndifferent turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was speaking to a friend of mine\r\n\r\nwho   is  also  interested  in  education.  He  is  not\r\n\r\ninterested in the Chinese education stream  but  he  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  English education  stream.  He  is\r\n\r\nattached  to the University. He has some experience  of\r\n\r\neducation  and  children  and  how  children  react  to\r\n\r\nexaminations.  He  told me that if  a  vote  was  taken\r\n\r\namongst  the  children as to whether  they  should  get\r\n\r\npromotions without sitting for examinations, more  than\r\n\r\nfifty  per  cent  of  them would  vote  for  promotions\r\n\r\nwithout  sitting for examinations. That  would  be  the\r\n\r\nposition if students were asked to express their  views\r\n\r\non it on a democratic basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not overplay this democratic basis, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,In my own home, I would like  to  think\r\n\r\nthat I treat my children fairly and well, and that  the\r\n\r\nway  I treat them is not the way my grandfather treated\r\n\r\nmy father or my father treated me. But then there comes\r\n\r\na  point of time when in every home, as in every State,\r\n\r\nauthority must be applied and the young children of the\r\n\r\ncountry must be told where they get off - if I may use a\r\n\r\ncolloquialism.  And if in the view of a parent - and  who\r\n\r\nknows better what the interest of the child is than the\r\n\r\nparent? - the child is going off the track, it is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfather and the mother to pull him up and tell him where\r\n\r\nhe  has  got  off  the track. And if he gets  difficult\r\n\r\nabout  it,  then the solution is to put him across  the\r\n\r\nlap and to administer a couple of good smacks where  it\r\n\r\nwill  hurt  most!  That is how I would  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation in my own home. The State, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  merely a translation of the various homes into one.\r\n\r\nNow  if  the children are objecting to this examination\r\n\r\nwhen all the educational authorities are agreed that it\r\n\r\nis  a good thing for Chinese education, I say that  the\r\n\r\nchildren  who are acting as picketers should  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  in  an  appropriate manner, first of all  by  the\r\n\r\nparents of those children. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhowever much these students disagree with the Secondary\r\n\r\nIV  examination, I do not think it is their business to\r\n\r\ngo  and  picket and prevent others, particularly,  when\r\n\r\nfrom  the results that we have seen, according  to  the\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the Minister for Education,  about  two-thirds of them have attended these examinations.  On  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic basis where the minority accepts the will of\r\n\r\nthe  majority,  I  suggest that  the  picketers  should\r\n\r\nsilently  take  up their tents and vanish.  If  one  is\r\n\r\ntalking  about democracy, that is the way  the  pickets\r\n\r\nshould  behave. So that from that point of view,  I  am\r\n\r\nentirely with the 66 per cent of the students  who  are\r\n\r\ngoing  into  these examinations, and I  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\npicketers  no to prevent the others from, taking  their\r\n\r\nexaminations. If they have any legitimate objections to\r\n\r\nthe Secondary IV examinations, they have their channels\r\n\r\nthrough   which  to  make  representations.  If   those\r\n\r\nrepresentations  are logical, to the  effect  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language and Chinese culture are going  to  be\r\n\r\ndestroyed, that naturally any government must take heed\r\n\r\nand   make  the  necessary  adjustments.  But  in   the\r\n\r\nmeantime, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a problem, that is,\r\n\r\nchildren who wish to take these examinations are  being\r\n\r\nprevented  from doing so. The duty of the Government - as\r\n\r\nthe  parents have rightly pointed out - in the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem,  when the people want to exercise their  lawful\r\n\r\nrights and somebody else is trying to prevent them from\r\n\r\nexercising these rights - is to come to their rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wholeheartedly in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the motion, but I think the terms  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  are  such  that  it  is  liable  to  give  some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  to people outside.  When  the  motion\r\n\r\nabout  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  came  before  the  House,  where  it  was  a\r\n\r\nquestion of violation of the rights of a Member of this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  I thought it was for the Assembly to  direct\r\n\r\nthe  police  to  take  the necessary  action.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  where  the  rights of a  citizen  are  being\r\n\r\nviolated,  it is the duty of the State to protect  that\r\n\r\ncitizen and to see that his civil rights are not  being\r\n\r\nviolated.  Therefore, the responsibility of  protecting\r\n\r\nsuch  a  citizen  falls  fairly  and  squarely  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders  of  the  Government. But  as  a  responsible\r\n\r\nlegislature which happens to be sitting at  the  moment\r\n\r\nwhen  Government is faced with a problem,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment comes to this House for an expression of its\r\n\r\nopinion on the problem before it, then, of course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is entitled to get a fair answer  from  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Therefore. Mr Speaker. Sir, I wish to move  an\r\n\r\namendment to the latter part of the motion. I have here\r\n\r\na  typewritten  copy. Mr Speaker, Sir.  The  amendment\r\n\r\nwill be,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the words \"supports any action by\" in lines\r\n\r\n6  and  7 of the motion, and insert therefor the words,\r\n\r\n\"approves  of  any  action  according  to  law  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment through\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If I may repeat it again, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the words \"supports any action by\" in lines\r\n\r\n6  and  7, and insert therefor the words. \"approves  of\r\n\r\nany action according to law by the Government through\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I will not be very long.

The amendment, Sir, is  moved  in\r\n\r\norder to clear certain doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the motion stands, it says \"... hereby resolves\r\n\r\nthat this House supports any action by the Police ...\"  Now  that  might give room for doubt, although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will naturally say that \"any action  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice\" there means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  lawful  action. But it could mean that any  action\r\n\r\ncould  be  taken by the police, and if something  turns\r\n\r\nout  to be unlawful, they might come back to the  House\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"Well,  you  have already  agreed  to  this.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pass legislation which will idemnify.\" We do\r\n\r\nnot  want all that. I think what the Government can  do\r\n\r\nand should do is to act according to law in respect  of\r\n\r\npersons acting not in accordance with the law.

There would be cries  of\r\n\r\nchauvinism  from  people  who  do  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nChinese  education  problem.

There were suggestions\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis was obstructive and did  not\r\n\r\nallow  the  Assembly  to discuss important  matters  of\r\n\r\nState.  We  have seen, Sir, how surprise  motions,  one\r\n\r\nafter  another, were introduced in the  midst  of  this\r\n\r\nmerger debate, and it is not unexpected therefore  that\r\n\r\nwe  have this motion before the House. The P.A.P. hopes\r\n\r\nthat  such  diversion will draw the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\npeople away from the ugly revelations of their sell-out\r\n\r\nmerger.

As you\r\n\r\nknow, Sir, there is a deliberate attempt on the part of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to smear all those who do not agree with\r\n\r\nthem as Communists and pro-Communists. And this motion\r\n\r\nis meant to link the Barisan Sosialis with the\r\n\r\nstudents' strike and paint everything as Communist\r\n\r\ninspired.

Such gross\r\n\r\ninefficiency of the Special Branch can only be  matched\r\n\r\nby  the  utter stupidity and inefficiency of the  whole\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  and the  whole  Lee  Kuan  Yew\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, is a delicate situation caused by the\r\n\r\nmishandling of the genuine grievances and discontent of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  fostered  and  deliberately  allowed  to   be\r\n\r\naggravated by the P.A.P.

Instead of finding\r\n\r\na  solution to the just grievances of the students  and\r\n\r\nso   preventing   the  development  of   an   explosive\r\n\r\nsituation,  we find the most inept handling of  student\r\n\r\ngrievances  in the whole history of Chinese  education.\r\n\r\nin  their  incompetence and impotence to deal with  the\r\n\r\nsituation caused entirely by their own inefficiency and\r\n\r\nineptitude,  the Government now attempts  to  pass  the\r\n\r\nbuck  to  the  Assembly. By this the  P.A.P. hopes  to\r\n\r\nsaddle all the responsibility of their misdeeds on  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Are  the Ministers, and the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nalso,  so utterly sterile in their outlook and approach\r\n\r\nthat  they must get the Assembly to be responsible  for\r\n\r\ntheir foolish mistakes? They created the mess and  they\r\n\r\nwant  us to clear it for them. If they are so incapable\r\n\r\nof  governing, why do they not resign?

I think the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown knows that he ought to follow the\r\n\r\nindications coming from the Chair. I have indicated\r\n\r\nthat the position, as far as this Assembly is\r\n\r\nconcerned, is that the Cabinet is responsible for all\r\n\r\nthe actions of each individual Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I misunderstood you, Sir.

All this can be clearly seen from a review  of\r\n\r\nhow this trouble has developed.

No. I must certainly prevent that\r\n\r\nbeing done, because if I do that, then there will be  a\r\n\r\ndebate  on the education policy. We are now debating  a\r\n\r\nmotion,  \"at  the request of parents of students  ... that  this  House supports any action by the Police  to\r\n\r\nprotect students wishing to take their examinations\"  I\r\n\r\nam  paraphrasing the motion - \"and in order that students\r\n\r\nand  their  parents who accompany them are  given  free\r\n\r\npassage  and  access  into and out of  all  examination\r\n\r\nhalls.\" That is all we are doing. I will not allow  any\r\n\r\ndebate  on the education policy to take place  on  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was hoping I could explain to\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, that there is always relevance when there  is\r\n\r\ncause and effect. One cannot discuss the effect without\r\n\r\nknowing  the  cause. And it is because of that  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  tried to give you, Sir, just a very brief outline\r\n\r\nso that we can have the proper background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly  then  would we be able to understand the  present\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction of the students. May I, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Chair is still not convinced, because\r\n\r\nthe motion, to my mind, seems to be just a request that\r\n\r\nthe  House does something in response to an appeal from\r\n\r\nparents of students who wish to take examinations. That\r\n\r\nis all. The fact that there is discontent among certain\r\n\r\nstudents  about the education policy is incidental.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  mentioned of course, in passing, as indeed  it\r\n\r\nhas   been.  But  to  go  into  details  is  completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I bow to your decision. But it\r\n\r\nis  difficult  to debate this motion, Sir,  without  at\r\n\r\nleast  touching  a  little on -the  background  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion,   because  the  Government's  trick   on   this\r\n\r\nparticular  occasion  is  purely  to  let  the   people\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the result of what they have been doing.\r\n\r\nThey want people to forget all about the causes of  the\r\n\r\npresent  dissatisfaction of the students. It is  almost\r\n\r\nimpossible, Sir, not to talk a little of the causes  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  really could understand fully why we have  to\r\n\r\ndebate  the  present  motion.  However,  Sir,  I   will\r\n\r\nendeavour to cut off as much of it as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They have  genuine\r\n\r\nfears  that  the so-called new system of the Government\r\n\r\nis  not  meant as a step towards giving equal treatment\r\n\r\nto  the  four streams of education but something  else.\r\n\r\nAnd   because  of  their  genuine  fears  the   present\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  has come about. They fear,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwith  the  present system, the end result  would  be  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  quantity as well as quality  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The difficulty is for the Chair to\r\n\r\ndraw  a line somewhere. I think all that this Assembly\r\n\r\nshould know in this particular debate is that there are\r\n\r\ngrievances - certain    students    think    they    have\r\n\r\ngrievances - and   therefore  as  a   result   of   these\r\n\r\ngrievances,  these students are taking this  action.

Of course the hon.

Anyway\r\n\r\nthere  are genuine grievances of students, parents  and\r\n\r\neducational bodies which the Government has ignored. If\r\n\r\nthere  had  been consultation and democratic  practice,\r\n\r\nthe  ugly situation today would not have arisen.  There\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  no  student  protests  today,   Sir.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the  inefficiency of Chew-Swee-Kee-like\r\n\r\nMinisters in the P.A.P. Government have caused  further\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  among all Chinese  education  circles.\r\n\r\nCoupled  with this, there is also behind the  scenes  a\r\n\r\ndeliberate  attempt on the part of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nfoment  even  more trouble. As I have  indicated,  Sir,\r\n\r\neducational  issues are emotional issues. They  can  be\r\n\r\neasily  misconstrued and mischievously  interpreted  to\r\n\r\nmean Chinese chauvinism and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all news of this impending student\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction and trouble was completely hidden  from\r\n\r\nthe  people.  There  was a complete black-out  of  news\r\n\r\nuntil recently. Many people not connected directly with\r\n\r\nChinese education did not have the slightest inkling of\r\n\r\nwhat  was  afoot  and what the present dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\ndon is all about.

It cannot be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, there is a report in the Nanyang Siang Pau\r\n\r\nof  the  2nd  of December, page 2, which  says  that  a\r\n\r\nstudent  called out, \"They are using the  handcuffs  to\r\n\r\nhit  me  on  the head.\" Only the police have handcuffs,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this little bit alone, you will see the\r\n\r\nprovocation  that has been directed at the students  by\r\n\r\n\"unidentified  men\", \"mysterious  men\"  and  \"men  with\r\n\r\nhandcuffs\".  If they are not people who have  authority\r\n\r\nbehind  them, then I am sure the Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\nshould  take  particular  note  and  get  all  of  them\r\n\r\narrested. These are only pinpricks and they were  meant\r\n\r\nto  get  the students to retaliate. If there should  be\r\n\r\nany  retaliation,  then,  of  course,  it  suits  their\r\n\r\nscheme.  Then  they could take action  and  they  hoped\r\n\r\nthat,  by  taking action, they would be  able  to  draw\r\n\r\neverybody into their so-called net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the things which the English-educated\r\n\r\nsection  of  our  population do not know,  because  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times presents only one side of the picture. It\r\n\r\nplays   up   every  little  incident  that   may   seem\r\n\r\nunfavourable  to  the  students  but - deliberately   or\r\n\r\notherwise - it   suppresses  all  factual   truths.   The\r\n\r\nAssembly  is  constantly being supplied  with  official\r\n\r\nstatements from this Ministry and that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe   have  heard  of  the  so-called  intimidation   by\r\n\r\nstudents.  But let us ask the Minister - where  does  he\r\n\r\nget  all those reports? We have known how reliable they\r\n\r\nare.  I  do not have to remind you again, Sir,  of  the\r\n\r\nTommy  Koh incident. Yet it is solely on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nsuch  information  from spies and  informers  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is trying to make us believe their  version\r\n\r\nof  the present situation. We know, Sir, that people in\r\n\r\nthe Special Branch have been trained to orientate their\r\n\r\nthinking only in one direction. They have been  trained\r\n\r\nto  see  all  children of Chinese schools as  potential\r\n\r\nCommunists  or  even criminals. How can we  ever  trust\r\n\r\nsuch reports, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present situation has arisen out of genuine\r\n\r\ngrievances  among the Chinese school students.  To  say\r\n\r\nthat  there are political agitators behind the  present\r\n\r\ndispute  is  to tell the public a deliberate falsehood.\r\n\r\nIf   there  are  any  political  agitators - as  I   have\r\n\r\nendeavoured  to  show - amongst the  Chinese  students,\r\n\r\ntoday,  they  are  the people who wear  goggles,  those\r\n\r\nmysterious   men   with  drain-pipe   trousers,   those\r\n\r\nmysterious men with handcuffs, and those mysterious men\r\n\r\nwho  throw glasses and bottles at students. The  motion\r\n\r\ntabled  by the Government is only an attempt to involve\r\n\r\nthe whole Assembly in their diabolical scheme of trying\r\n\r\nto   maintain  tension  and  strife.  The  Government's\r\n\r\ndetermination to prolong this tension can  be  seen  by\r\n\r\ntheir    deliberate   institution   of    supplementary\r\n\r\nexaminations  as announced. On the one hand,  they  say\r\n\r\nthat they do not want to use force on the students. Yet\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, the Government are advocating  or\r\n\r\nhoping  that  the  Assembly will support  their  police\r\n\r\naction  whenever  they  find it necessary.  We  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis will never give a blank cheque to  the\r\n\r\ndesperate  men  who  have  to  use  force  against  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  The  students have shown  themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nrestrained and orderly in their picketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They respond to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need point to you\r\n\r\npictures  of  students sitting around in circles.

In fact, I would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  should  be congratulated on  their  calm  and\r\n\r\nrestraint in the face of such grave provocation by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government - and the Special  Branch  too,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure.  We  trust and we hope the students will maintain\r\n\r\nand  remain calm and restrained and not fall  into  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trap of violence and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We urge the Government not to use the police on\r\n\r\ndefenceless  students. Students  have  suffered  enough\r\n\r\nviolence  and brutalities at the hands of the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock Government. We have complete sympathy with them in\r\n\r\ntheir  fear of the police and in their wanting to cover\r\n\r\nup  part of their faces.

We know, for example, Sir, that good citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have been denied their citizenship  or  their\r\n\r\njobs  because they had taken part in the 1955 and 1956\r\n\r\nstudent demonstrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> 1954!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So, Sir, I think the students are\r\n\r\nvery  wise.

That\r\n\r\nis the only cowardice. Take note of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we resolutely oppose the motion. We oppose\r\n\r\neverything that smacks of Chew Swee Kee. If the name of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education is to be linked up with the\r\n\r\nname of Chew Swee Kee, then let us hope it is not going\r\n\r\nto  be in the use of oppressive action against defence-less  students, but rather that it is in the  ownership\r\n\r\nof iron mines. We urge the Government, if it is sincere\r\n\r\nin its desire to solve the present problem, to adopt  a\r\n\r\nrealistic approach. First, there must be calm and quiet\r\n\r\nin  the schools. We urge the Government that instead of\r\n\r\nprolonging the affair and so creating further  tension,\r\n\r\nto   reduce   immediately  this  tension  by   allowing\r\n\r\nconditions  to return to normal. Let all anger,  temper\r\n\r\nand  emotions settle down first, before the  Government\r\n\r\ntries to do anything drastic. Using the police at  this\r\n\r\njuncture  is  not  going  to contribute  to  peace  and\r\n\r\ntranquillity. It is not going to solve any problem.  It\r\n\r\nis  no  use the Government trying to bull-doze its  way\r\n\r\nthrough. We know the Government has enough police,  and\r\n\r\nmilitary  strength too, to manhandle  the  students  if\r\n\r\nthey   want  to.  This  is  nothing  that  an   elected\r\n\r\nGovernment need be proud of. We know the Government can\r\n\r\neasily choose to ignore the grievances of the students.\r\n\r\nBut  this  will not solve the problem..  It  will  only\r\n\r\npostpone the solution. Let the Government not  put  its\r\n\r\npride and arrogance above the interests of students. It\r\n\r\nis sheer irresponsibility on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nto   insist   on  conducting  supplementary  Government\r\n\r\nexaminations this week. This is a deliberate attempt, I\r\n\r\nsay, to prolong the present trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chinese School Secondary IV examinations are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, over. But the Government intends to carry  on\r\n\r\nsupplementary  examinations.  Already   it   has   been\r\n\r\nadmitted   by   the   Minister   himself   that   these\r\n\r\nexaminations,  having  been  conducted  under  abnormal\r\n\r\npsychological  stress and strain,  did  not  allow  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to give of their best performances.  And  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has indicated that it is going to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the students' normal school  records  in\r\n\r\nthe   assessment  of  their  academic  standards.  This\r\n\r\nexamination  has obviously lost its educational  value.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot  be regarded as a proper assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nstudent's academic abilities anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  why carry on this fiasco?  Already  it  is\r\n\r\nrightly believed, Sir, that the Government is going  to\r\n\r\npass  everyone  who  took  the  examinations.  This  is\r\n\r\nobviously an attempt to encourage more students to take\r\n\r\nthe examinations. But what is more ridiculous, Sir,  if\r\n\r\ntrue,  is  that  the Government intends  to  pass  even\r\n\r\nstudents  who  did not take the examination.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  will boost up the official figures of students\r\n\r\nwho were supposed to have taken the examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday thousands of genuine parents, I stress\r\n\r\nthe  word \"genuine\", Sir, assembled in the Chinese High\r\n\r\nSchool Hall and collectively condemned the Government's\r\n\r\neducational  policy and its mishandling of the  present\r\n\r\nsituation.

But the motion has come before this House  at\r\n\r\nthe  request  of  parents whose children  are  students\r\n\r\ntaking  the examination under very difficult conditions\r\n\r\nat great cost of time and energy, just in order to have\r\n\r\nthe right to take the public examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that after my ministerial\r\n\r\nstatement on Monday last, announcing to Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  the  position as known to me then of  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  existed  as a result of the boycott,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  challenged  Members opposite,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Assemblymen, to indicate whether  they\r\n\r\nwere  in favour or otherwise of the boycott. This  call\r\n\r\nalso  came from Members of the Opposition, namely,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park, who himself was very agitated.\r\n\r\nWhere was the stand of the Barisan Sosialis? We got  no\r\n\r\nanswer - which  is very clear indeed that  silence  means\r\n\r\nconsent  and  that, in fact, the Barisan  Sosialis  was\r\n\r\negging  on  and encouraging the students to persist  in\r\n\r\nthis  foolish boycott, that they were all part  of  the\r\n\r\ngrand  design  to bring chaos out or order.  Therefore.\r\n\r\nSir, in those circumstances, had Government brought  in\r\n\r\nthe police to protect the poor students and the parents\r\n\r\nwho  wanted to carry on with the examinations,  the  13\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Barisan Sosialis would have  been  the\r\n\r\nvery first to exploit the situation and say, \"There you\r\n\r\nare.

This  was\r\n\r\nimmediately accepted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Government has already indicated that supplementary\r\n\r\npapers  would  be  set this week, the  Students-Parents\r\n\r\nCommittee,  noting the continued forceful  intimidation\r\n\r\nof  pickets on both students and parents who wish their\r\n\r\nchildren  to take the examination and wishing to  avoid\r\n\r\nfurther  incidents,  have asked for police  protection.\r\n\r\nHence the motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the pickets conducted their picketing peacefully,\r\n\r\nwhich  they should have but did not; had they left  the\r\n\r\nentrances  to  examination centres open for  people  to\r\n\r\nmove  in and out freely and without forming human  wall\r\n\r\nand  human  chain barricades and even  locking  up  the\r\n\r\ngates  of  schools in the dark of night, the  Students-Parents Committee themselves would not have called  for\r\n\r\npolice protection. It would have been unnecessary. This\r\n\r\nis   purely  a  move  in  self-defence.  They  are  the\r\n\r\naggrieved  party, not the picketers. They  want  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to exercise their democratic right and freedom\r\n\r\nto  take a public examination. Those who do not want to\r\n\r\ntake the examination are not being compelled to do  so.\r\n\r\nThey can stay at home and it is their own business.  If\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  boycott  it, no one  is  stopping  them\r\n\r\neither.  But  they  should not impose  their  views  on\r\n\r\nothers.  Worse still, trying forcefully,  stopping  and\r\n\r\npreventing others from taking this examination. This is\r\n\r\nnot  the  way  to behave in a democratic  society  like\r\n\r\nours.  This  is  the  way  of force,  intimidation  and\r\n\r\nthuggery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at 10.55 this morning, I arrived at\r\n\r\nthe junction of Tanglin and Kay Siang Roads. There were\r\n\r\nabout 15 to 20 pickets, and my car\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas stopped by one of them. He asked my driver where he\r\n\r\nwas  heading  for. I answered in reply that  I  am  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education. At this the leader said,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is here.\" When I asked, \"May I be allowed\r\n\r\nto proceed to do my work?\", they instinctively formed a\r\n\r\nhuman  chain  first before coming to a decision,  which\r\n\r\nwas  that  my car would not be permitted to go  in  but\r\n\r\nthat  I  might proceed on foot, which I did. Then  they\r\n\r\nburst   into  song.  Of  course,  the  song  was   very\r\n\r\nderogatory to me. Twenty yards ahead was another  human\r\n\r\nwall  of  about 50 to 60 student picketers  singing  in\r\n\r\nunison and awaiting my arrival. When I was a foot  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the singing human wall, one leader ordered, \"Let\r\n\r\nhim  pass.\" And the middle link of each human chain was\r\n\r\nloosened. I walked into the human mass and came out  of\r\n\r\nit  again amidst their chorus which ended after  I  had\r\n\r\nwalked another ten yards away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were in all 240 candidates, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary earlier on, who took the  first\r\n\r\nsupplementary  paper on Chinese Language this  morning.\r\n\r\nBut  for  the picketing which blocked all entrances  to\r\n\r\nthe  three  centres for the supplementary  examination,\r\n\r\nthere  could  have  been  a  larger  attendance  today.\r\n\r\nHowever,  since 1,859 candidates took this  paper  last\r\n\r\nweek (the earlier report made last week did not include\r\n\r\ntwo  candidates at the Trafalgar Home) the total number\r\n\r\nof  candidates  who  have taken  the  Chinese  Language\r\n\r\npaper,  which is a compulsory paper, is now  2,099,  or\r\n\r\n2,100 approximately. This represents, Sir, two-thirds\r\n\r\nof the possible candidates of 3,171.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on the Member for Farrer Park did say that if\r\n\r\nwe  are  to follow democratic procedure, the fact  that\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds   of  the  candidates  want  to   take   the\r\n\r\nexamination is clear evidence that the majority support\r\n\r\nthe  examination and that the picketers  should  accept\r\n\r\nthis  verdict and leave the others alone. May I mention\r\n\r\nthat this point was also stated by the Students-Parents\r\n\r\nCommittee after the first day of the examination?  They\r\n\r\nhave said that more than half have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided  to take the examination. So will the picketers\r\n\r\ntry  to stop the boycott and let others carry on?  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,   there  are  forces  who   talk   about\r\n\r\ndemocratic  procedure but who avail themselves  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of democracy just to make a  mockery  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us not belittle the effect of tabling a\r\n\r\nmotion  for  debate  in this Legislative  Assembly.  On\r\n\r\nWednesday,  the  29th  of  November,  1961,   when   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary was prevented from  coming  to\r\n\r\nthis Assembly by the pickets -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Beleaguered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> He was prevented, and naturally he\r\n\r\nwas  beleaguered together with me had  I  attempted  to\r\n\r\ncome  out  earlier; but I was prevented from  doing  so\r\n\r\nbecause  of  work, and I would have come forward  after\r\n\r\nthe work was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pickets were immediately dispersed as soon as the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the motion regarding the freedom of movement\r\n\r\nof  a  representative of the people was in progress  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my way to this Assembly, I noticed that the\r\n\r\npickets  who were being dispersed on instructions  were\r\n\r\nlooking very confused. They were having a grand  time\r\n\r\nplaying  games and singing songs. It was  all  in  good\r\n\r\nfun. Because it was after all during the vacation.  But\r\n\r\nthere  was another group of pickets still on duty along\r\n\r\nTanglin  Road  at the examination centre,  still  under\r\n\r\ncontrol,  picketing. And this other group  in  the  Kay\r\n\r\nSiang  Road were asked to disperse. So they had a  very\r\n\r\nconfused look. \"What is all this? How come? Why are  we\r\n\r\ncalled off?\", and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Sir, today, four hours before now, at 12.30\r\n\r\np.m.,  about  400  to  500  pickets  at  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College  and  at the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nmysteriously melted away. Sir, had the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  not objected to the present  motion  being\r\n\r\ndebated  on Thursday, the pickets would not  have  been\r\n\r\ncalled  out  for last Friday and today's  supplementary\r\n\r\nexamination. Students and parents of those students who\r\n\r\nwant to take the examination would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been spared the annoyance, the irritation brought\r\n\r\nabout by the pickets and the people behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to\r\n\r\npay  once again my tribute to the students, the parents\r\n\r\nand  the  guardians of those students who  stuck  their\r\n\r\nnecks  out  in defence of democracy; to the  staff  and\r\n\r\nofficials  of my Ministry, to the postmen and officials\r\n\r\nof  the Post Office for their loyalty and dedication to\r\n\r\nduty during a very difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be known that at this very moment more than\r\n\r\n9,000   candidates  are  taking  the  Cambridge  School\r\n\r\nCertificate and the Cambridge Higher School Certificate\r\n\r\nExaminations.  So  I  wish  today  to  acknowledge  how\r\n\r\ncreditably  my staff and the officials of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  have, with great patience, handled  this\r\n\r\nsituation  over  the  boycott of the  first  Government\r\n\r\nChinese Secondary IV Examination and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nlooked  after 9,000 other candidates who  are  doing their  examinations. This is not the work of an inept\r\n\r\nGovernment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A good civil service!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is.

I\r\n\r\ntherefore,  Sir, wish to say that I fully  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion   before   the  House  and  would   urge   every\r\n\r\nAssemblyman, if he has a conscience, to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education has charged that Communists  and\r\n\r\npro-Communists  are  using  the  Chinese  students  for\r\n\r\npolitical  purposes.  His Parliamentary  Secretary  has\r\n\r\ncharged That sinister men are using the Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents for political purposes. When I asked who  they\r\n\r\nare, we got no precision. Sir, I am not so naive as not\r\n\r\nto recognise that the charges are probably true. I find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to  believe that these students  without\r\n\r\nadult  instigation would carry on the  strike  in  this\r\n\r\nmanner.  But who are the men who are instigating  them?\r\n\r\nWe  do  not know or we have not been told. But I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  one thing, Sir, though I am prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  that  there are adults who are responsible  for\r\n\r\nperverting  our youth and utilising them for  political\r\n\r\npurposes, I say this Government and this Front Bench is\r\n\r\nusing  our Chinese students for political purposes  and\r\n\r\nusing  their  boycott of the examination for  political\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very midst of this unhappy debate, where the\r\n\r\nvital  issue  of  the  future of the  whole  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  involved, we have  had  manoeuvre  after\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre  on  the Government side.  We  have  had  the\r\n\r\nspectacle  of the Minister for Education utilising  his\r\n\r\nright  to  make  a  ministerial statement -  instead  of\r\n\r\nmaking  it  as  he should have, factually,  it  was  an\r\n\r\nimportant   statement  to  make  if  the   facts   were\r\n\r\naccurate - by   indulging  in  an  abuse   of   political\r\n\r\nopponents  and  making remarks which ultimately  called\r\n\r\nfor a ruling from you, Sir, that there must be a debate\r\n\r\nif  it  was to be proceeded with. Subsequently we  have\r\n\r\nthe  spectacle of the Minister for Culture standing  up\r\n\r\nas  the  Leader of the House and telling  us  that  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nwas beleaguered by 300 hooligans, and, Sir, I once more\r\n\r\nfell into the error of believing the Government. Though\r\n\r\nI  have  no love for the gentleman concerned,  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  if  it  must be known, I have a strong  personal\r\n\r\nantipathy to him, nevertheless the thought that he  was\r\n\r\nbeleaguered  by  300 hooligans was so repugnant  to  my\r\n\r\nfeeling  of justice that I offered to go [Laughter]  - Ah, yes, they laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

That is simple.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nintimidatory.  If  they have not got that  information,\r\n\r\nthey should not make those allegations in this House. I\r\n\r\nhave not heard of a single person being charged in  the\r\n\r\ncourts  or  being arrested for poisoning and subverting\r\n\r\nthe-minds    of    the    Chinese   school    children.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] in connection with the, organisation  of\r\n\r\nthis  boycott  of the examinations. I think  the  House\r\n\r\nshould  know - not vague allegations by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Education  and  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister:  Communists  and pro-Communists,  or  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  backseat drivers -  since they seek to  make  a\r\n\r\nserious  debate on  it, who are the adults  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  what,  to  my  mind,  is  unquestionably  criminal\r\n\r\nconduct of a grave character affecting the welfare of a\r\n\r\nmaterial, segment of our population and the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore as a whole? It is those people\r\n\r\nI  should  like  to see aimed at. It  is  those  people\r\n\r\nagainst whom I would like to use the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

If that is so, Sir,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  wrong to use the police against them.  You  are\r\n\r\npunishing  the  victim.  You  are  not  punishing   the\r\n\r\ncriminal.  If  it is admitted that they  are  misguided\r\n\r\nvictims of adult political intriguers, then it  is  not\r\n\r\nthey  whom  we  ought to punish. When  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  spoke about an ineffective and  ineffectual\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  say that to this extent this  has  been\r\n\r\nproved  true. The Government cannot find the criminals.\r\n\r\nSo  they  want to punish the victims. That is  what  it\r\n\r\nlooks like on this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the conduct of the students may be - it is very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to get at the truth with all the smokescreen\r\n\r\nand  exaggeration put up by the Government  - I say  that\r\n\r\nto   date   the   maximum   possible,   Sir,   indicate\r\n\r\nreprehensible  conduct,  but not  conduct  of  a  grave\r\n\r\ncharacter  seriously  prejudicing  the  peace  or   the\r\n\r\nwelfare of this country in any way. I would remind hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite that this is not the  first  time  we\r\n\r\nhave  had student trouble. In fact, they have  been  so\r\n\r\nreminded.  I would remind them that when I  was  seated\r\n\r\nwhere they are seated today [Laughter] - a curious sense\r\n\r\nof  humour,  Sir! - we had sit-down  strikes  of  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  character affecting several  schools  over  an\r\n\r\nextended  period.  The English Press  and  my  English-speaking  friends  and those who were  not  my  friends\r\n\r\ncalled  me a coward for not using the police  to  flush\r\n\r\nout  the students from the schools. At that time,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  leader of the S.P.A. was my colleague and he found\r\n\r\nhimself  in  full conformity with my views.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister from the Opposite Bench could find nothing  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  in  my not using the police.  In  fact,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I draw your attention - because  the\r\n\r\nparallel is very real - to a very short passage  made  in\r\n\r\nthis  very  House on 25th May, 1955 (6\ufffd years  ago)  at\r\n\r\ncolumn 258:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Government has been told - we have been accused - that\r\n\r\nour action, and our inaction,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  undermined authority.

He lies stricken\r\n\r\nwith the chicken-pox, his body a mass of red spots, and\r\n\r\nthe  more  we  forbid  him  to  scratch,  the  more  he\r\n\r\nstubbornly   scratches,  and  the  more   those   spots\r\n\r\nsuppurate.

I do  not\r\n\r\nregret even after 6\ufffd years the patience not only under\r\n\r\nstress but under insults from the English Press and the\r\n\r\nEnglish  speaking  world - the  terms  of  abuse  and  of\r\n\r\ncowardice that were flung at us for the strength of our\r\n\r\npatience which they could not recognise.

This means  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of 10 per cent is provided in 1963 over  1962\r\n\r\nestimated   expenditure   as   allowance   for   normal\r\n\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Estimates containing a Vote on Account were\r\n\r\npresented  to the Assembly in accordance with  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder 89.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 98 (3) of the Constitution to which I\r\n\r\nreferred  earlier  does not apply  to  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  For  the  Development Estimates  for  1963,\r\n\r\ncontained  in this Paper, it is necessary therefore  to\r\n\r\nfollow  section  4 of the Development  Fund  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1959.  Under  section 4 (1) of this  Ordinance,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the estimates for the full  year  to  be\r\n\r\nshown.  Also the sums necessary to meet each  head  and\r\n\r\nsub-head of expenditure have to be shown. This explains\r\n\r\nwhy the Development Estimates for 1963 show expenditure\r\n\r\nfor   12   months  as  compared  with  the   estimates\r\n\r\ncontaining a Vote on Account which show expenditure for\r\n\r\nsix  months  only. It also explains why the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  1963 show both heads and  sub-heads  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure, whereas the Estimates containing a Vote on\r\n\r\nAccount show only heads of expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must explain why the Government\r\n\r\nhad  decided upon these steps. In recent months, it had\r\n\r\nbecome  obvious that progress towards merger  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved at a rate which has exceeded all expectations.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the vast majority of the peoples of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, Singapore and the Borneo  territories,\r\n\r\nthe movement towards reunification of these territories\r\n\r\nhas  gathered  momentum and has be-come an irresistible\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nWe  have  given  permission for  him  to  make  factual\r\n\r\nstatement.  Is  it  appropriate for  him  to  introduce\r\n\r\nmatters   of   political   inferences   and   political\r\n\r\npropaganda?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated in the past, of course,\r\n\r\nthat  a  ministerial statement should  be  factual  and\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  such as to invite  a  debate.  If  the\r\n\r\nministerial statement is such as to invite a debate,  I\r\n\r\ndid indicate that the proper procedure would be for the\r\n\r\nMinister,  after  making  his statement,  to  move  the\r\n\r\nadjournment of the House to enable the House to debate\r\n\r\nthe statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am quite happy for this\r\n\r\nstatement  to be debated. But if the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nwill  bear  with me for a while and reflect on  what  I\r\n\r\nactually said, there is absolutely nothing here that is\r\n\r\ncontroversial,  because  all sides  of  the  House  are\r\n\r\nagreed that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger  is  desirable. It is nothing  controversial  at\r\n\r\nall, as I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well, to continue, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is\r\n\r\nimportant that we in Singapore must not allow  lack  of\r\n\r\npreparation  to  hold up the implementation  of  merger\r\n\r\nplans    because   of   possible   hold-ups   in    the\r\n\r\nadministrative machinery. We must not only look at what\r\n\r\nis  likely  to  happen in 1962, we  must  also  try  to\r\n\r\nvisualise  events in 1963. The Prime Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore, in a joint statement made  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year, have set  the  target  date  for\r\n\r\nmerger  in  or  before June 1963. The  way  events  are\r\n\r\nmoving, there is little reason for doubt that it  would\r\n\r\nbe   realised.  The  Government  anticipates  that  the\r\n\r\npreparation  of a  budget  for  1963  will  encounter\r\n\r\nnumerous technical problems of details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget of any government is not something that is\r\n\r\nprepared just before Budget Day. As I have mentioned in\r\n\r\na  previous  budget  statement, the  preparation  of  a\r\n\r\nbudget  is  a  continuing and a continuous process.  No\r\n\r\nsooner  has  one budget been approved in  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nthan  the  Treasury gets down to the task of  preparing\r\n\r\nfor the next one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation for the budget for 1963 must normally\r\n\r\ntherefore begin in a month or two. At the same time  we\r\n\r\nexpect that all Ministries of the Singapore Govermnent,\r\n\r\nespecially the Ministry of Finance, will have  to  bend\r\n\r\ntheir   minds   to  the  many  intricate   details   of\r\n\r\nimplementing the White Paper proposals on  merger.  The\r\n\r\nstrain on the Treasury Division of my Ministry will  be\r\n\r\nparticularly  heavy.  We have  had  experience  of  one\r\n\r\nexercise in the preparation of a budget when the  whole\r\n\r\nbasis  of  the administration is radically  changed.  I\r\n\r\nrefer,  of  course, to the current year's budget  which\r\n\r\nintegrated  certain City Council departments  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government both in respect of its revenue  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the budget for the new State of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as a constituent member of the  Federation,\r\n\r\nwill  be even more complicated and onerous. It is well,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that the situation should be explained  now\r\n\r\nand  that  both the Assembly and the general public  be\r\n\r\nmade aware of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle the details of allocation of votes and\r\n\r\nrevenue between State and Central Government,\r\n\r\nadditional work will devolve on Treasury officials and\r\n\r\nthose Ministries affected by transfers of\r\n\r\nresponsibility, and it is not likely that the 1963\r\n\r\nBudget will be ready in time. This may well expose the\r\n\r\nGovernment to criticism. There might even be a loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence in the administration. For this reason and\r\n\r\nin fairness to the administration, I will be asking the\r\n\r\nHouse to approve a vote on account for the first six\r\n\r\nmonths of 1963. I also intend to ask approval for the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates for the whole of 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requests are only in accordance with the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council, and with the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund Ordinance. The Development Fund\r\n\r\nOrdinance, as I said a moment ago, requires that\r\n\r\napproval for development expenditure should be passed\r\n\r\nby the Assembly in respect of a full year while the\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council allows a vote on ac-count for part of the year. This provision of the law\r\n\r\nis quite reasonable. The vote on account is asked in\r\n\r\nrespect of annually recurrent expenditure. Such\r\n\r\nexpenditure is incurred in regular amounts each month\r\n\r\nbeing payments for salaries of staff, regular services\r\n\r\nused by the Government such as water, light,\r\n\r\nelectricity, stationery, telephone, rents of offices\r\n\r\nand so forth. Development expenditures on the other\r\n\r\nhand is paid for in block amounts as and when a project\r\n\r\nis completed. Payments are therefore not regular\r\n\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote on account, as I said earlier, provides for\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the first six months of 1963 at 55 per\r\n\r\ncent of the expenditure appearing in the 1962 Estimates\r\n\r\nnow before the House. As regards the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, no new items have been introduced. They were\r\n\r\nall projects entered in the Four-Year Development Plan\r\n\r\nwhich had been approved by this Assembly earlier this\r\n\r\nyear as well as a few new projects which I have\r\n\r\ndiscussed in my Budget Statement last week. I should\r\n\r\nperhaps refer to one difficulty in the preparation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates for 1963. This is the problem\r\n\r\nof forecasting the date of completion of projects. Some\r\n\r\nprojects which are scheduled to be completed in 1962\r\n\r\nand therefore paid for from the funds to be voted for\r\n\r\nthat year, may incur some delay owing to circumstances\r\n\r\nbeyond the control of the Government. In such cases,\r\n\r\nfinancial provisions must be made in 1963 to pay for\r\n\r\nthe completion of such projects. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me add that\r\n\r\nthe Treasury will, in spite of the heavy duties which\r\n\r\nthe administration would have to undertake in the\r\n\r\ncoming months, try to prepare the estimates in time. If\r\n\r\nit can be done, the Government would then present these\r\n\r\nestimates to the Assembly in the normal way. But ex\r\n\r\nabundantae cautela we consider it prudent to ask the\r\n\r\nAssembly's approval for expenditure in the first six\r\n\r\nmonths of 1963. Everyone will agree that in matters of\r\n\r\nState finance, the cautious approach has much to\r\n\r\ncommend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to allow a debate\r\n\r\non the statement that has been made, particularly in\r\n\r\nview of the remarks by the Member for Anson, may I now\r\n\r\nmove the motion for the adjournment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would suggest that perhaps the more\r\n\r\nopportune moment will be 2.30 p.m. tomorrow when hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will have had an opportunity to study that\r\n\r\nstatement.

I have not, Sir,I\r\n\r\nhave    received   letters   about   the   Government's\r\n\r\neducational  policy,  but not  a  word  asking  me  for\r\n\r\nprotection   of   students  who  are   going   to   the\r\n\r\nexamination. But it seems that the Political  Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for Education has  received  such  a\r\n\r\npetition.  It  is  signed, I  am  told,  by  about  100\r\n\r\npersons.   Who  are  these  100  persons?  Were   they\r\n\r\npolitically motivated? Who organised the petition?  How\r\n\r\nis  it that none of the rest of us have heard from  any\r\n\r\nparents to like effect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will appreciate, Sir, why I take this allegation\r\n\r\nof  a  petition - no, the statement of the receipt  of  a\r\n\r\npetition - with a pinch of salt. Not that I deny that  a\r\n\r\npetition  was  received.  But the  genuineness  of  the\r\n\r\nalleged  representation and the freedom from  political\r\n\r\nmotivation of these persons who signed those petitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told by the Political Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education that there are only 600 students\r\n\r\nwho  have  not  taken  the examinations.  I  think  his\r\n\r\narithmetic is wrong. But that is what he has said to us\r\n\r\nthis   afternoon.  If  there  are  600  students - school\r\n\r\nchildren - and there are only 100 parents petitioning, it\r\n\r\ndoes  suggest  that  600 children have  more  than  100\r\n\r\nparents.  I trust he will accept that. In fact,  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  than 200 parents for 600 school children. In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, are we to understand that  the  majority\r\n\r\nof  the  parents do not want police protection? And  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of what the Minister has said, in a democracy\r\n\r\nthe majority will must rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at it in a different way. The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary says that there 600 pupils  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  taken  the  examination.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  told  us  this afternoon  that  400  to  500\r\n\r\npickets this morning were gathered at one centre. So it\r\n\r\nmeans that there are only 100 students left - if we  take\r\n\r\n400  to  500 who are picketing - who might want to  enter\r\n\r\nfor  the examination. If 240 could take the examination\r\n\r\nthis  morning,  why could not this extra  100?  Wherein\r\n\r\nlies  the  urgency or validity of this motion on  their\r\n\r\nown  arithmetic?

The Minister himself said that there  was.\r\n\r\nSo  far as I can remember, in answer to a supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion (I think it was on Thursday afternoon),  there\r\n\r\nwas  not  one  single instance of violence or  physical\r\n\r\ninjury.  Are  there  any instances  today  of  physical\r\n\r\ninjury to anybody?

Yet we are being asked not\r\n\r\nmerely  to interrupt a serious, a grave debate, but  to\r\n\r\nask  the  police to take action against student pickets\r\n\r\nwho are obstructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it must be obvious that the Government has, for reasons best known to itself, some of which I might guess at, seriously exaggerated the gravity of\r\n\r\nwhat is taking place. I say we must not throw away  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of patience with school children in order  to\r\n\r\ncope  with minor incidents. I will not use the  police,\r\n\r\nand  I  will not support the use of the police, against\r\n\r\ngroups  of  school  children.  I  ask  this  House   to\r\n\r\nrecognise   that  the  Government  has   inflated   and\r\n\r\nexaggerated the facts. And I ask the House to  be  wary\r\n\r\nof  supporting  any  action by the police  against  our\r\n\r\nschool children. Let us not be so foolish as to  use  a\r\n\r\nsword to cut a pound of butter. We might find ourselves\r\n\r\ncutting ourselves. We might find that we are destroying\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  built  up over several  long  suffering\r\n\r\nyears,  and  that  is  the tradition  of  patience  and\r\n\r\nreasonableness with our school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I sit down, Mr Speaker, I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  my  own  stand  clear on  the  subject  of  their\r\n\r\nconduct.  I would not like, by implication  and  in  my\r\n\r\nrefusal  to Support police action, to let it be implied\r\n\r\nthat   I  am  sitting  on  the  fence  in  so  far   as\r\n\r\ncondemnation  of  improper  obstructive   or   forceful\r\n\r\nconduct  on  the  part  of pickets  is  involved.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwithout  hesitation, I do condemn political  activities\r\n\r\non  the part of school children. I consider it inimical\r\n\r\nto the healthy development of a parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nwhen  those  who  can know nothing by virtue  of  their\r\n\r\ntender  years of the issues which are involved, permit\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  be  manipulated, to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nsituations,  where  our sympathies  are  involved,  for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes. I want to go further. If, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  students  have used violence, as  alleged  by  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times cameraman, even once against any pupil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeking  lawfully to go in to his examination,  then  I\r\n\r\nsay  such action is improper.

I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  my impression that the vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nthese pickets have acted with propriety, restraint  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  But that they have so acted  is  only  how\r\n\r\nthey  should  act. It does not in any  way  excuse  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of those few who are guilty or may  have  been\r\n\r\nguilty of acts of violent obstruction to those students\r\n\r\nwho  sought to take their examinations. I believe  they\r\n\r\nare  very  few, Mr Speaker, Sir. But few  though  they\r\n\r\nare,  I  would  not  like  to be  misunderstood  in  my\r\n\r\ncondemnation of such conduct, particularly if they  are\r\n\r\nconscious   that  it  is  not  in  pursuance   of   any\r\n\r\neducational   aims,  but  in  pursuance   of   improper\r\n\r\npolitical activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is no room for the second part of this motion. No cause has been shown for the second part of the motion which calls upon this House to\r\n\r\nrequest  the  police and support police action  against\r\n\r\nstudents.  I  would  like to say, quite  categorically,\r\n\r\nthat  if the first part of this motion had stood alone,\r\n\r\nand had I thought that it would have been of any value,\r\n\r\nI would have moved for the deletion of the second part,\r\n\r\nbut  I  can  see that I will get nowhere with  it  anti\r\n\r\nmerely  lengthen the debate. But in case Government  is\r\n\r\nin  any way prepared to withdraw the second part of the\r\n\r\nmotion  seeking for police action, I would be  content,\r\n\r\nSir, to support the first part of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncondemnation. I repeat, Sir, I will not be prepared, in\r\n\r\nthe circumstances of today, and in the minor incidents\r\n\r\nof today, to call upon the police to take action\r\n\r\nagainst school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with\r\n\r\ngreat interest to the dexterity and skill with which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson supported all sides that were\r\n\r\nright. I say it is no mean achievement to be able to\r\n\r\nsay, on the one hand, \"I condemn intimidation\"; and on\r\n\r\nthe other, \"Look at this picture which shows how\r\n\r\npeaceful they are in the face of intimidation\". At the\r\n\r\nend of it all, I am left in doubt as to whether, in\r\n\r\nfact, the Member for Anson is quite sincere when he\r\n\r\nsays that he will vote for the first half of the\r\n\r\nmotion, but not for the second half, for the reasons he\r\n\r\nhas stated. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, because I am\r\n\r\nin some doubt as to that, I would suggest that at a\r\n\r\nlater stage perhaps the vote can be taken in two parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, the condemnation, and then\r\n\r\nthe request which I think spells out logically from the\r\n\r\ncondemnation, for police protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Thursday evening, the 30th of November, a\r\n\r\nstatement was issued by the Barisan Sosialis in the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Queenstown. The contents of that\r\n\r\nstatement showed how important it was for the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to have provided the open police\r\n\r\nprotection asked for by the parents of the students\r\n\r\ntaking their examinations without having first debated\r\n\r\nthe matter in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in his right mind, Sir, can doubt that it is the\r\n\r\npicketers who are out to make mischief, because if\r\n\r\nthere are no pickets, there will not be any trouble. It\r\n\r\nis not the students and the parents who accompany these\r\n\r\nstudents into the examination hail who bring trouble.\r\n\r\nAll that the parents want to do with their sons is to\r\n\r\nsee that they enter the examination hall in peace and\r\n\r\nsafety and leave in one piece, equally safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read to you, Sir, certain extracts from the\r\n\r\nstatement - and we can congratulate ourselves on the\r\n\r\nwisdom of having first tabled this motion for debate in\r\n\r\nthis House. This was in the Straits Times of 1st\r\n\r\nDecember:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Late tonight [meaning Thursday night] Dr Lee Siew\r\n\r\nChoh, Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis, declared his\r\n\r\nparty's strong opposition to the use of police against\r\n\r\nChinese school students who had \"genuine grievances\"\r\n\r\nagainst the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: \"The P.A.P. Government today tried to\r\n\r\nintroduce a motion to sanction police action against\r\n\r\nstudents...\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never asked for any police action against students.\r\n\r\nWe asked for police protection - to sanction police\r\n\r\nprotection for parents and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"It has smuggled into the Assembly a so-called\r\n\r\npetition alleged to have been sent by parents of\r\n\r\nChinese students...\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The \"so-called petition\". Sir, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, the Member for Bukit Panjang, had\r\n\r\nanticipated all these reckless allegations being made,\r\n\r\nand when he handed out copies to the Press, he was\r\n\r\ncareful enough to hand out photostat copies, in the\r\n\r\ngenuine handwriting of the parents, and signatures. He\r\n\r\ninformed me that he had made quite sure that the\r\n\r\nparents who signed those documents were parents who had\r\n\r\ntaken their children to the examination centre at the\r\n\r\nT.T.C. These things are on the record. We can table the\r\n\r\npetition. It can be checked at a subsequent date, and\r\n\r\nhe who lies can be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Nanyang Siang Pau, these same parents have\r\n\r\ncome out with a trenchant letter against the President\r\n\r\nof the Chinese School Teachers Association for his\r\n\r\nstatement suggesting that this whole examination should\r\n\r\nbe abandoned and that the Government give in to\r\n\r\nintimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement is in Chinese and I do not wish to\r\n\r\ndo a running translation in English. I think one of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues will probably be speaking in Chinese and the\r\n\r\nstatement can then be translated by the official\r\n\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lee, according to this statement, said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...it was clear that this was part of the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nscheme to divert public attention from the current\r\n\r\nimportant debate on merger in which the Government was\r\n\r\nfully aware it was not faring well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are categorical assertions.\r\n\r\nThat something is what one wishes to believe it is,\r\n\r\ndoes not make it so.

One cannot\r\n\r\nsay something in private and go into the public chamber\r\n\r\nand say something quite different. We are accustomed to\r\n\r\nsaying privately what we think publicly and say\r\n\r\npublicly. I am entitled to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, I had\r\n\r\nprior conversation and discussions with the Acting\r\n\r\nLeader of the House - he agreed to tell Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition and you that we considered it, a matter of\r\n\r\nthe utmost importance that everybody in this Chamber,\r\n\r\nall Members, should have all the time and all the\r\n\r\nopportunity in the world to say whatever they wish to\r\n\r\nsay on this merger debate without any restriction\r\n\r\neither by way of time or by way of guillotine. We said\r\n\r\nthat to you privately. We say that publicly. We wanted\r\n\r\nto give Opposition Members more time and, for that\r\n\r\nreason, we moved that the House sit on a Saturday and\r\n\r\non a Sunday, and we are still prepared to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is likely if we go on in this dreary fashion,\r\n\r\nthat we might sit through Christmas, which I think is\r\n\r\nsomething which the Member for Anson, as a man of the\r\n\r\nworld, would find very unpleasant and so would I -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

On one last occasion when\r\n\r\nsuch a student was injured, his body was taken aloft,\r\n\r\nstill alive, paraded round the town to arouse the\r\n\r\nfeelings of the multitude - which it did - and he, the\r\n\r\npoor, injured student, died in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleague, the Minister for Culture, will be\r\n\r\nquoting to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the words of the then\r\n\r\nChief Minister on this matter. The then Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas quoted words from that same speech he made. He has\r\n\r\nbeen through the mill and he knows what this is all\r\n\r\nabout, Mr Speaker, Sir. That is why he says he has\r\n\r\nmore than a shrewd suspicion that there are adults\r\n\r\nbehind it. And he finds it difficult to believe that\r\n\r\nyoung students, for no rhyme or reason, can suddenly\r\n\r\nmisbehave for the purpose of disrupting an examination\r\n\r\nwhich is purely voluntary and which is, in fact,\r\n\r\nintended to be an embellishment and a suitable\r\n\r\nconclusion to their academic career. Be that as it may,\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - and, more important. I would like to suggest\r\n\r\nto those who are charting the destiny of the Red Star\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis - that they are not going to\r\n\r\nfind in the P.A.P. Government the same hamhanded.\r\n\r\nunwitting opponent that they found in former colonial\r\n\r\ngovernments and in the Government of the first Chief\r\n\r\nMinister - the Member for Anson - for the, Government of\r\n\r\nthe second Chief Minister-the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nEvery time he mentions Chew Swee Kee, every time he\r\n\r\nlikens me to the Member for Cairnhill, and every time\r\n\r\nhe says that P.A.P. is like the Labour Front,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  his ghost writers are doing is crying in  anguish\r\n\r\nwishing that that were so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had the singular privilege of having worked\r\n\r\ntogether with the Communists in a united front  against\r\n\r\nthe colonialists - a genuine classic anti-colonial united\r\n\r\nfront.  We  knew that they were Communists.  They  knew\r\n\r\nthat  we  were not Communists. We gave them  cover  and\r\n\r\nthey  gave us cover. We wanted to beat up the  British.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  not  unnaturally  we  learned  how  the\r\n\r\noperations  are done. We take up the top hat - they  have\r\n\r\nfirst put in the rabbit. We pull it out to the applause\r\n\r\nof  the multitude. They allowed themselves to be  bound\r\n\r\nup  and  put  in a box, and after a decent interval  of\r\n\r\ntime,  we  opened it and lo and behold  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwere free again, to the applause of the multitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gentleman opposite said it grieved him to see\r\n\r\nthese empty Benches at the back - if he were honest  with\r\n\r\nhimself, he would subconsciously wish he was back  here\r\n\r\ninstead  of  being windy across the way. The Communists\r\n\r\nhave embarked on a different kind of united front. This\r\n\r\nis  not the classical anti-colonial united front.  This\r\n\r\nis  the hazardous occupation of forming a united  front\r\n\r\nagainst  the  nationalists. This is  not  fighting  the\r\n\r\ndying  British.  This is fighting the very  much  alive\r\n\r\nnationalists.  It is a very different proposition.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  if  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  allowed himself to be tied up and  put  in  a\r\n\r\ntrussed luggage, after 12 years, when it is opened,  he\r\n\r\nwould still be there bound and gagged - not like the last\r\n\r\ntime. It is a different proposition. One of these days,\r\n\r\nthrough sheer lack of expertise, instead of pulling out\r\n\r\nthe rabbit from the top hat, the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nmight  be  pulling out a serpent which might  bite  him\r\n\r\nmortally.  So  you  see,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  kettle of fish. It is not Lim  Yew  Hock  or\r\n\r\nChew  Swee  Kee  that you are meeting.  We  do  not  do\r\n\r\nfoolish things. We have seen the props and we make sure\r\n\r\nthat  before  the  magician performs, we  first  remove\r\n\r\nthem. Then we ask him to pull\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  the  white  rabbit, but there is no  assistant  to\r\n\r\nfirst put in the rabbit. So the magician is left on the\r\n\r\nstage  with  the spotlight on him, but no white  rabbit\r\n\r\ncomes out, and the audience want their money back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the trouble with the Barisan Sosialis now. We\r\n\r\nhave  been  through the whole gamut  for  a  long  time - 1953,  1954, Fajar, national service. King  George  V\r\n\r\nPark, and students beaten up. I have been through  all\r\n\r\nthis, Sir. Once in the middle of camping in the Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh  School, they turned up in the early hours of  the\r\n\r\nmorning - one  boy  had been scalded and  he  fainted - and\r\n\r\nasked me what to do. I was their legal adviser and  not\r\n\r\ntheir  medical adviser. So I told them it  was  a  very\r\n\r\nrisky  business. They did not want to take him  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, because  other  parents  would  get\r\n\r\nexcited  and  take  their  kids  home.  But  they  were\r\n\r\nresourceful  people and undoubtedly children  of  great\r\n\r\npromise. So they took him to Youngberg Hospital to keep\r\n\r\nthe whole matter quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, we do know how these things are run and we\r\n\r\ndo  know  how these things are done. I can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that the last thing we will allow  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  do  is  to interfere with young  kids  with\r\n\r\nbatons, bullets or fire hoses. But I will tell you what\r\n\r\nwe  will do to them if they keep on doing nasty  things\r\n\r\nlike throwing bottles into examination halls - which I am\r\n\r\ntold  happened on Thursday last week. They  might  know\r\n\r\nthat  in  Italy they have discovered a form  of  powder\r\n\r\ncalled  itching  powder which is very effective,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold, against Communist demonstrators when they pose in\r\n\r\nrevolutionary postures and clench their fists. A  cloud\r\n\r\nopens  over  them  and then they disperse  to  riotous\r\n\r\nlaughter.  Instead  of  being  figures  to  be  pitied,\r\n\r\nmartyred   and  pilloried  because  they  are   broken,\r\n\r\ndrenched, beaten and carried to hospital, they  scratch\r\n\r\nfuriously and run for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Government seems to be suffering from\r\n\r\nlaughing here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would tell the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  that I am grateful to him - and to his successor - because  he  opened Pandora's Box and  I  watched  with\r\n\r\ngreat  amazement at what came out of it. Therefore  for\r\n\r\nme,  Sir,  there are no more surprises. He had  charted\r\n\r\nthe  course  and  all the landmines  blew  up.  I  knew\r\n\r\nexactly  where they were and I knew who put them  there\r\n\r\nand  how  they blew up. It is not my intention  to  let\r\n\r\nthis  Government go and trigger off any  landmine.  For\r\n\r\nthat  reason,  I  told the Member for  Anson  just  now\r\n\r\nduring  the  adjournment - to salve his  conscience - that\r\n\r\nwhichever way this House voted, it is our duty  to  the\r\n\r\npolice  and to the people of Singapore to see that  the\r\n\r\npolice  are  not  drawn  into  an  incident  in   which\r\n\r\nsympathies must naturally go to young students. And  so\r\n\r\ntry  what  they will, do what they want, they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to find this Government a lame and sitting duck.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that they have learnt nothing\r\n\r\nnew.  They are performing the same old turns with  this\r\n\r\none difference, that every time the prop is supposed to\r\n\r\nbe  there to pass something, the spotlight, instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing on the juggler, is on the prop, so that everybody\r\n\r\ncan  see  that he is passing something over. Hence  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of the Member for Queenstown, and  more  so\r\n\r\nthe difficulty of the chaps really advising the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me add, Mr Speaker, Sir - I do not know what\r\n\r\nprompted  the  parents  - but I  was  informed  by  the\r\n\r\nnewspapermen  that as a result of the almost  unanimous\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Assembly to protect the free  right  of\r\n\r\negress and ingress of the Member for Bukit Panjang, the\r\n\r\nparents  were  annoyed that the Assembly had  acted  so\r\n\r\npromptly  in  defence of the rights of its own  Members\r\n\r\nand  left  the parents, who were ordinary  people,  not\r\n\r\nleaders  and  representatives, to fend for  themselves.\r\n\r\nFor  that  reason,  they sought out  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  because  he  was  the  man  who   drew   the\r\n\r\npublicity.  This House came to his rescue and  we  were\r\n\r\nsufficiently encouraged by the way in which the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  voted  on  that  occasion  to  believe   that\r\n\r\nsuddenly they had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecome supporters of righteous, orderly behaviour and\r\n\r\nproper conduct. But I do not know whether it was really\r\n\r\nintended, because from the tener of the speeches that\r\n\r\nday, I think we were all most delightfully surprised\r\n\r\nwhen the Division came, because having strenuously\r\n\r\nfought against the motion, they then voted for it. Sir,\r\n\r\nimagine our disappointment when, in defence of the\r\n\r\nrights of parents, we asked the motion to be debated,\r\n\r\nthey refused permission. I am told, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat when they voted for the motion, they incurred the\r\n\r\ndispleasure of quite a number of their important people\r\n\r\nwho decide these matters. First, the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim, who is an extremely experienced person in these\r\n\r\nmatters, by his wise act became the only defender of\r\n\r\nthe Chinese students against the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, and the Barisan Sosialis joined the wicked\r\n\r\ncolonial forces in wishing to lock up the Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents. I think that must have been a factor which\r\n\r\nweighed in the minds of those who decide in the Barisan\r\n\r\nStar. And so when it comes to the second motion which\r\n\r\nis more important - not the right of access for a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang, but for ordinary men and women, parents with\r\n\r\nkids who want to go in and sit for examinations - they\r\n\r\nwho are supposed to champion the rights of the people\r\n\r\nare extremely reluctant to provide police protection.\r\n\r\nThe last time it was not police protection. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. The motion called for the police to take\r\n\r\naction against the culprits according to the law as\r\n\r\nlaid down by the Legislative Assembly (Powers and\r\n\r\nPrivileges) Ordinance and 11 ayes - two were discreetly\r\n\r\nabsent; they were talking in the Chamber but when the\r\n\r\nDivision was taken, they were absent -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But it would appear that they were wrong in\r\n\r\nassuming that the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are as\r\n\r\njealous of the rights of parents and students as they\r\n\r\nare of their own rights as Assemblymen. However, be\r\n\r\nthat as it may. I hate to believe that anyone in\r\n\r\nSingapore would take seriously the allegation made by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown - that the Government wants to\r\n\r\nmaintain tension, and wants a bloodbath and a riot, and\r\n\r\nin the course of the riot, political opponents can\r\n\r\ndisappear. Sir, I can give them no such comfort\r\n\r\nwhatsoever. I have explained this to my former\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary at great length in the days\r\n\r\nbefore he took such a precipitate step. In the compound\r\n\r\nof Singapore there is a lion, albeit a bit old and\r\n\r\nageing, and there is a tiger that is young and virile,\r\n\r\nand there is an Alsation dog, i.e. the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. And there is a fox running around -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister just now mentioned that I  had  several\r\n\r\ntalks  with  him  before I parted with  him.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nrecall saying anything about a lion or an Alsation  dog\r\n\r\nin our conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a point of elucidation,\r\n\r\nbut  never mind. Obviously at that time, because of the\r\n\r\nlate night sittings and so on on 20th July, he may  not\r\n\r\nhave been compos mentis. But I distinctly remember, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that when analysing the situation,  there\r\n\r\nwas the Internal Security Council. There was a lion,  a\r\n\r\ntiger,  and  an  Alsation dog. But in  the  compound  a\r\n\r\ncunning fox had been spotted. And the lion said to the\r\n\r\nAlsatian  dog, \"Go chase it and bite it.\" The  Alsation\r\n\r\ndog looked at the lion and said, \"Well, I don't like to\r\n\r\neat foxes. You like it. You had better chase it and eat\r\n\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, Mr Speaker, Sir, the wishful thinking of\r\n\r\nthose   who  compose  the  line  for  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  just  would not come  through.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible,  because the P.A.P. is not that  foolish.  He\r\n\r\nought  to  read  what  his own member  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee, Mr Fong Swee Suan, said. Whatever\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  may be the faults and deficiencies  of  the\r\n\r\nrevisionists  in  the P.A.P., and  whatever  Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair's  shortcomings  or my shortcomings,  we  do  know\r\n\r\nsomething  about these matters. We do spend  some  time\r\n\r\nanalysing and thinking things out. We do know what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the past and why they have happened.  So,\r\n\r\nwhen  confronted  with  the  situation,  we  sum  up  a\r\n\r\nreality, not a fantasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fox cannot run, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is a\r\n\r\nclosed  compound, as I have said, with  three  powerful\r\n\r\nforces  contained  in  it.  Of  course,  all  want  the\r\n\r\nAlsatian dog to go and run for the fox, but foxes  have\r\n\r\na  nasty  way of biting back, and Alsatian dogs usually\r\n\r\nare brought up domesticated. We are men of peace, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. We like to talk and argue. We do not like\r\n\r\nall  this bloodbath and violence. And I can explain  to\r\n\r\nthem  that  if a bloodbath and a riot takes place - as  I\r\n\r\nhave   explained   in  my  attempts  to   clarify   the\r\n\r\nsituation - then  they  meet in a collision  with  final\r\n\r\nauthority.  As  far as I am concerned, I  am  only  the\r\n\r\npenultimate authority, Mr Speaker, Sir, I can give the\r\n\r\norder. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, can\r\n\r\ngive  the  order for the police to act. It is  doubtful\r\n\r\nwhither  he  can even give the order to 817 members  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Infantry Regiment, because there is joint\r\n\r\ncontrol. The British pay half for it. And so there will\r\n\r\nbe  an argument. Supposing the British do not like  the\r\n\r\ntroops to be used, then there will be an order,  and  a\r\n\r\ncounter   order,  and  it  is  doubtful  who  has   the\r\n\r\nauthority. But I can assure them that there are  25,000\r\n\r\ntroops in and around Singapore under the command of the\r\n\r\nG.O.C.,  Singapore, and the G.O.C., Malaya. And  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  them,  too, that some of these  men  have  been\r\n\r\nreceiving proper training in the Congo, ft you can deal\r\n\r\nwith the Congolese situation, I say there is no trouble\r\n\r\nat  all - I mean in 1955-56 there was no trouble at  all.\r\n\r\nSo I urge them to pass this to the chaps who settle the\r\n\r\nBarisan  line - \"Don't do foolish things in anticipation\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. doing foolish things.\" The P.A.P. never\r\n\r\ndoes  a  foolish  thing.  [Interruption]  We  hope  so.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we spend our time calculating. If we do make  a\r\n\r\nfoolish miscalculation, then we have to pay for it,  as\r\n\r\nno  doubt others have made miscalculations and will  in\r\n\r\ngood  time,  when the day of reckoning comes,  have  to\r\n\r\nsettle.  But  that is their problem.  We  give  advice,\r\n\r\ngenerally well meaning and well intended. If it is  not\r\n\r\naccepted,  what can we do? But I will say this:  forget\r\n\r\nthis bloodbath. Our line is the line of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among the nursery rhymes that they have coined,\r\n\r\nnot those that the kids have coined, Sir, these jingles\r\n\r\nare  quite  cunning.  It  is  not  as  simply  as  that\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Anson - \"Khoon choy\"  means\r\n\r\n\"entering  the  coffin\", no. There is quite  a  cunning\r\n\r\nplay  on  words - alliteration. They  have  little  words\r\n\r\njingled. Like the Member for Bukit Panjang, his name is\r\n\r\nLee Khoon Choy, which means something good. So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  change  it to \"Chun Ch'ai\", which means a  fool.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  say, \"Chin Kwan Ch'ai\" which means \"enter the coffin\".\r\n\r\nAnd so the jingle goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I figured in these jingles too. I have been accused of\r\n\r\nselling  out  peace, Mr Speaker, Sir. I  was  reading  the\r\n\r\njingle.  This  is all properly recorded and documented.  And\r\n\r\npart  of  the honour that I have received of being mentioned\r\n\r\nin  their despatches is having sold out peace. Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nknow how I could have sold out peace that did not belong  to\r\n\r\nme  in the first place. It belongs to all mankind. Sir, when\r\n\r\nthe  Commission of Inquiry sits, one of the things  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the student leaders who have got these  songs\r\n\r\ncirculated is this: \"How is it that I owned peace? How did I\r\n\r\nsell  it out? To whom did I sell it?\", and so on. And I will\r\n\r\nsay  this:  the  cards  have already been  distributed.  The\r\n\r\nstakes have been called, the chips are down. And the way  we\r\n\r\ncalculated  those cards. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  have  played\r\n\r\npeacefully  from  beginning to end. If we do  not,  we  must\r\n\r\nperish.  We know that. If we bring the police into this,  we\r\n\r\nlose.  Why should we beat up our own children, kill Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and culture? Why should we? On whose behalf?  What\r\n\r\nfor?  The  Minister  for  Education  asked  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, where did his kids go to school, and  he  wanted\r\n\r\nto explain but he never had a chance. But never mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My children speak better Mandarin than\r\n\r\neven you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, that is my misfortune, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.

He was defending 4-2  when  my former Parliamentary Secretary, at a meeting  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries in which the Member  for  Queens-town  was present, attacked him for his lack of explanation.\r\n\r\nLet  us  be honest. Let us not hide behind - say one thing  in\r\n\r\nprivate  and another in public. Who decided 4-2? The P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nNo. It was decided when the motion was already launched.

After a  while,  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  said on the posters and what they  know  in\r\n\r\ntheir  minds  do  not  reconcile themselves.  They  are\r\n\r\nfierce  slogans,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  all  these  little\r\n\r\nstrips  of coloured paper which you see but perhaps  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand.  They are fierce words - destruction  of\r\n\r\nChinese  culture,  education, unreasonableness  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - fierce  traditional  slogans,  a   rallying\r\n\r\ncause, battle cries for Chinese students since 1945.  I\r\n\r\nknew  it. The Member for Anson knew it. The Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  went through it. And you will remember  the\r\n\r\ngreat  trials and tribulations he had. He had to excuse\r\n\r\nhimself every few minutes from this Chamber. But let us\r\n\r\nnot  pretend that these things do not exist.  they  do\r\n\r\nexist.  The Member for Cairnhill knows that. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson does know. And what we say is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis:  we  learned  from him at  his  expense.  We  are\r\n\r\ngrateful.  If  we  had not learnt, we would  have  made\r\n\r\nsimilar stupid mistakes. The reason why we are debating\r\n\r\nand  not rioting is that we have not allowed the police\r\n\r\nto  be  an excuse for an incident. Whatever happens  to\r\n\r\nthis  motion, be it accepted unanimously by this House,\r\n\r\nby  the Opposition, we will not allow the police to  be\r\n\r\nthe  cause  for  an incident.

We\r\n\r\nhave  been  through  all that and we  do  not  want  it\r\n\r\nanymore. Let me say to those adults to whom the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson has referred - as I have said, there is a lion\r\n\r\nand  there  is a tiger. The lion may be old. His  claws\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  bit hard and corny, and his teeth may  have\r\n\r\nlost their bite. The tiger is young and virile, but  is\r\n\r\nnot  a man-eater, Mr Speaker, Sir. The lion is a  man-eater.

Especially, Mr Speaker, when this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  something which has happened  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbefore,  as  has  been explained by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself.  We  have  all witnessed  this  previously.  A\r\n\r\nproblem  has arisen now, and in the minds of the  great\r\n\r\nmajority of the people who do not wish to see  all  the\r\n\r\npast  incidents  being repeated, they  are  asking  why\r\n\r\nthere have been no steps or action taken to prevent  a\r\n\r\nrecurrence. From the public point of view, this  matter\r\n\r\nis  no  longer a matter of educational policy  but  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped   into   a  political  issue.   Many   people\r\n\r\nappreciate the difficulties that would be faced by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in consequence of any action taken with  all\r\n\r\nits reactions and repercussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, Mr Speaker, from past experience of the\r\n\r\nquestion  of security, the members performing the  task\r\n\r\nof  maintaining law and order in this country  comprise\r\n\r\nmainly Malays. So a clash between the student examinees\r\n\r\nand the picketers, if the police were to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresort  to any action without taking into consideration\r\n\r\nits  reaction, would cause a further clash and  become\r\n\r\nmore  dangerous.  So I rise here, Mr  Speaker,  hoping\r\n\r\nthat  this  House will consider this matter  carefully.\r\n\r\nAll  elected  Members especially should  consider  this\r\n\r\nmatter seriously without any consideration of political\r\n\r\nrivalry, and think in terms of peace and good order  of\r\n\r\nthe State, so as to prevent any unpleasant incidents as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  we  could.  I, therefore, fully  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion  moved  by  the Government, as  amended  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park, so that  this  House  could\r\n\r\nafford protection to those who voluntarily wish to take\r\n\r\nthe  examinations conducted by the Govermnent. This  is\r\n\r\nour  responsibility  in the face  of  the  difficulties\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  facing. I believe. Mr  Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nevery elected representative of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nmust realise his or her responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to speak at length. Originally I was\r\n\r\nreluctant  to participate in this debate,  but  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Singapore, we must oppose  anything  that\r\n\r\nwould lead to the destruction of democratic practice in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Therefore,  Mr  Speaker.   I   speak   in\r\n\r\nwholehearted  support of the motion and  the  amendment\r\n\r\nmoved to it by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  were told that our youths have been manipulated  by\r\n\r\nevil men - by Communists. I was very disappointed, in fact disgusted, Sir, to see the Government, especially\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister, treat this question and this motion\r\n\r\nwith  such levity. You yourself have remarked on  that,\r\n\r\nSir,I have never seen the Prime Minister so happy  and\r\n\r\nso  joyful.

On its own, it is an important question.  But\r\n\r\nit  has  become more important by the added information\r\n\r\nwe have had from the Government that there are evil men\r\n\r\nand  Communists manipulating them. If this is the case,\r\n\r\nSir,  then  why has the Government allowed  nearly  one\r\n\r\nweek,  I  think, to go by before it thought  of  doing\r\n\r\nanything seriously? It has not done anything at all  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  put  a  stop  to  it immediately.  I  say  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not done anything. Look at it, Sir. What\r\n\r\ndifference  was  there between  the  last  day  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination  and  the  first day? Children  were  still\r\n\r\nprevented from going into the examination centres. Just\r\n\r\nas  many  picketers were still there.  Everything  that\r\n\r\ntook place on the first day took place on the last day.\r\n\r\nWhat has the Government done, Sir, during that week  to\r\n\r\nput  a  stop  to it, knowing that these picketers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  influenced  and  have been manipulated  by  these\r\n\r\nso-called  Communists or evil men? What has been  done\r\n\r\nto  stop it? Sir, it looks like the Government was  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take  any definite  or  serious  step  to\r\n\r\nprotect children and parents until this House gives its\r\n\r\nsupport. Is this delay really necessary, Sir? As far as\r\n\r\nI  can remember, the Prime Minister in July 1959,  said\r\n\r\nin Hansard, Vol. 11. No. 6, col. 373:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the business of a government is to govern and we\r\n\r\nhave  the mandate to govern. What is more, we  had  the\r\n\r\ncourage  to pm down what we intended to do  and  had  a\r\n\r\nclear  mandate  on it, unlike Members on  the  opposite\r\n\r\nside.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  what  is  happening today, Sir? Why  do  they  not\r\n\r\ngovern?  A  mandate  has been given  to  them.  Is  the\r\n\r\nmandate no longer sufficient now? I am sure. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnot  the  Alliance Opposition that they are  frightened\r\n\r\nof, because they know that we always support any proper\r\n\r\nmove  that aims at maintaining law and order. I am sure\r\n\r\nthey  can  be assured of that. Could it be the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  are so afraid of? They are so  afraid  that\r\n\r\nthey  dare not take action to protect the students  and\r\n\r\nthe  parents  from being manipulated by the  Communists\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent of the Barisan Sosialis?  Had  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. handled the matter efficiently right  from  the\r\n\r\nvery  beginning,  it would not have  developed  into  a\r\n\r\nserious national crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although experts of parliamentary democracy have\r\n\r\nstated  that  it is the job of the Opposition  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  they can do better than the Government, they have\r\n\r\nnever  failed to stress that the interests of the State\r\n\r\nshould  always be the first concern of both parties - the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Opposition. But we have seen,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have  not\r\n\r\nonly  disregarded,  but  have actually  sacrificed  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  students and their  parents  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt to show that one is better than the other. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  question where the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  concerned is not which is the better Party. Today,\r\n\r\nif you go out on the streets, Sir, the popular question\r\n\r\nis:  which is the worse Party? The Barisan Sosialis  or\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.?  The  answer  is obvious,  Sir.  Both  are\r\n\r\nequally  destructive, as is clearly manifested  by  the\r\n\r\nway  a  matter of utmost urgency and importance,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nthe safety of our youth, is being exploited by both the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the P.A.P. to promote  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical  interests. Both are unashamedly using  young\r\n\r\ninnocent  students  to fight out the  political  battle\r\n\r\nbetween the two political Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government has become so weak that they\r\n\r\ndare  not take steps to protect the youth of our  State\r\n\r\nwithout the Opposition sharing the responsibility, then\r\n\r\nwhy  did  they  not  bring  the  motion  to  the  House\r\n\r\nimmediately  the trouble started so that  the  children\r\n\r\nwould   have   been   spared   one   week   of   agony?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,   why   did  they   not   postpone   the\r\n\r\nexamination?  They refused to postpone the examination.\r\n\r\nSir, you remember I asked whether it could be done, and\r\n\r\nthey   refused   to  do  it  because   postponing   the\r\n\r\nexamination means admitting defeat. So to keep  up  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. prestige, pride and probably complex,  children\r\n\r\nand parents have to be subjected to one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek  of  physical  and  mental  agony.  Sir,  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  claims  that there are Communists,  and  if\r\n\r\nthis is true, then it is their duty to fight and arrest\r\n\r\nthem as soon as possible and not leave the students and\r\n\r\nparents   to  do  the  fighting  for  them.  Why   must\r\n\r\nGovernment  knowingly allow the Communists to  continue\r\n\r\nusing  the  students instead of putting a  stop  to  it\r\n\r\nimmediately, even if it means temporarily  halting  the\r\n\r\nexamination and probably also hurting the pride of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our youth must not be used to pay the price for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  P.A.P. prestige  with  their  poor  young\r\n\r\ninnocent bodies and one year of their life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have on many occasions ridiculed the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill and have always hinted,  directly\r\n\r\nor  indirectly, at his so-called folly  of  - I  do  not\r\n\r\nquite  remember  the  words,  but  they  are  to   this\r\n\r\neffect - putting the subversive Communists  in  gaol  and\r\n\r\nusing  the police to stop student riots at the cost  of\r\n\r\nhis  Party suffering a defeat at the last election. But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. forgets, Sir, that the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwill  forever  be remembered as the man who  sacrificed\r\n\r\nhis  personal and his party interests for the  good  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Can the P.A.P. claim this? What  have  they\r\n\r\ndone? They have sacrificed the safety and the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  youth of this country to promote the interests\r\n\r\nof  their  Party. The Government is now  hiding  behind\r\n\r\nangry  parents  of  candidates to fight  against  these\r\n\r\nstudent pickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not trying to talk about the blood-bath and\r\n\r\nall that, as what other people have been talking about,\r\n\r\ntrying  to threaten or trying to bring about commotion;\r\n\r\nbut  I do want to ask the Government whether they  have\r\n\r\never given this matter serious consideration. Have they\r\n\r\never  given  thought to the horrible scenes that  could\r\n\r\nhave  taken  place  if parents of the student  pickets,\r\n\r\nangered  by  the treatment dealt to their  children  by\r\n\r\nparents  of  the candidates, had decided  to  retaliate\r\n\r\neven  if  the  pickets were at fault?  You  know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nparents  are  inclined  always  to  think  that   their\r\n\r\nchildren are right. If they had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided  to  retaliate,  had Government  ever  given  a\r\n\r\nthought  to what ugly scenes might have arisen? Because\r\n\r\nwhich parent would stand by and watch their teenage son\r\n\r\nbeing  attacked, probably by a big hefty adult, without\r\n\r\nbecoming  emotionally  aroused?  Could  the  Government\r\n\r\nguarantee  that none of the angry parents of the  1,900\r\n\r\ncandidates would ever be so angry as to attack  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  student  pickets in fighting for entry  for  their\r\n\r\ncandidate  sons?  Could the Government  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nthis  would not happen? And should a few angry  parents\r\n\r\nof  candidates be so tactless as to attack some of  the\r\n\r\npickets before the eyes of their parents, would it  not\r\n\r\nbe possible that this might end up with a clash between\r\n\r\nthe  parents of candidates and the parents  o  students\r\n\r\npickets? Sir, the P.A.P. Government should go  down  on\r\n\r\ntheir  bended knees and thank their gods - if  they  have\r\n\r\nany  - that there has been no clash between the  parents\r\n\r\nof  candidates and the parents of student pickets.  And\r\n\r\nGod forbid that it should ever happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not trying to advocate using police force on\r\n\r\nstudents, but as this motion before the House is asking\r\n\r\nfor  police  protection for students, Sir, I  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion: Right from the very beginning, would  it  not\r\n\r\nhave been safer to use cool-headed, unbiased, and well-trained  police officers, over whom the Government  has\r\n\r\nfull control, to protect the students and their parents\r\n\r\nrather   than   use  angry  parents, who   have   been\r\n\r\nemotionally roused and over whose temper and  behaviour\r\n\r\nthe Government has no control whatsoever, into fighting\r\n\r\nthe  pickets?  What guarantee has the  Government  that\r\n\r\nthese parents would not lose their heads and get beyond\r\n\r\ncontrol, especially if they should come to a clash with\r\n\r\nparents of the student pickets? Could this not lead  to\r\n\r\nscenes of unprecedented ugliness? Why should the  whole\r\n\r\nState  be open to this risk just to maintain the  pride\r\n\r\nand  the  popularity  of  the  P.A.P.  Government?  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  argument, Sir, that had they used the  police\r\n\r\nto protect the students, there would have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  riot  does not hold water any more, Sir. Because  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  case,  then  why  are  we  sitting  here\r\n\r\nconsidering  whether we should give the Government  the\r\n\r\ngreen  light  to use the police force to  provide  this\r\n\r\nprotection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, may I ask, it the purpose of bringing this\r\n\r\nmotion  into  this House? Let us not give  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  more  credit  than they  deserve.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve that it is Only when the Barisan Sosialis  give\r\n\r\ntheir  consent  to  the Government to  use  the  police\r\n\r\nforce,  can the police be used without causing a  riot.\r\n\r\nThey are not as important as all that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this trouble is the result of Government's\r\n\r\nfailure  to  get  the education policy through  to  the\r\n\r\nChinese  school  students is  undeniable,  Sir. In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  had  the  Prime Minister  taken  the  trouble\r\n\r\nduring his two months' leave (I stand corrected  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  months)  to  explain  to  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents Government's education policy, he might,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  his  intelligence and his eloquence and power  of\r\n\r\nspeech,  have succeeded in persuading all the  students\r\n\r\nto  accept  the policy, and the Communists  would  then\r\n\r\nhave  been deprived of this opportunity of manipulating\r\n\r\nour  students, and our students would have  been  saved\r\n\r\nall the trouble that is taking place today, it is still\r\n\r\nnot  too  late, Sir, if the Government would  agree  to\r\n\r\npostpone  the  examination, and in the  meanwhile  make\r\n\r\nanother effort to explain the education policy  to  the\r\n\r\nmisguided students and to expose the aims of  the  evil\r\n\r\nmanipulators.

If\r\n\r\nthat misapprehension could be cleared, probably the air\r\n\r\nwould  be  cleared. Moreover, Sir,  it  is  fairer  to\r\n\r\nstudents  to  take  the examination under  more  normal\r\n\r\nconditions. The onus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis on the Government to provide a quiet and peaceful\r\n\r\natmosphere and environment for students to take the\r\n\r\nexamination.

I agree, Sir, that no effort must\r\n\r\nbe spared to bring the real culprits to book. But the\r\n\r\npoor misguided children must not be used to catch these\r\n\r\nculprits or to pay for the sins of the Government.\r\n\r\nSomething must be done at once to save the children\r\n\r\nfrom the evil manipulators. Sir, every single day that\r\n\r\nthese children are allowed to be used by these evil\r\n\r\nmanipulators, be they Communists or otherwise, is\r\n\r\nanother day of P.A.P. failure. The sooner it is\r\n\r\nstopped, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Minister for Education, there has\r\n\r\nbeen a victory for\r\n\r\nthe Government over the evil men (to quote him) who\r\n\r\ntried to use misguided students to cover their sinister\r\n\r\noperations. He said, Sir, that the evil mainpulators\r\n\r\nhad been reduced to a state of impotence\r\n\r\nand frustration. Let us face the naked truth. Sir, no\r\n\r\nmatter how unpleasant and humiliating it may be to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. The public must know the truth. Has\r\n\r\nthere been a victory for the Government and a defeat\r\n\r\nfor the manipulators? Let us analyse the situation. I\r\n\r\nsuppose the Government will agree with me that it was\r\n\r\nthe Government's intention that all the students should\r\n\r\nbenefit by the 4-2 system of Chinese secondary schools,\r\n\r\nand that it was the intention of the evil manipulators\r\n\r\nthat they should not.

Hundreds of\r\n\r\nstudents who have picketed have lost one year of their\r\n\r\nlife. They are now bitter against the Government. The\r\n\r\nState has lost one year's expenditure on the students\r\n\r\nwho have wasted their one year's education. Those who\r\n\r\nare young enough to take the 4-2 examination next year\r\n\r\nand could have taken it this year, but did not, will\r\n\r\ncost the State one year more of expenditure. The\r\n\r\ncandidates who had to do their examinations amidst\r\n\r\nnoise, confusion, fear, worry and fights probably have\r\n\r\nsuffered. Have any of the Chinese children benefited?\r\n\r\nHave the picketers benefited? Who has benefited? Whose\r\n\r\nintention was it that they should suffer - the\r\n\r\nGovernment's or the evil manipulators'? Who has won the\r\n\r\nbattle, Sir? Who have been reduced to a state of\r\n\r\nimportance and frustration? It looks as if the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been, Sir - so frustrated and so impotent\r\n\r\nthat they need the moral support of the Opposition\r\n\r\nbefore they would dare exercise the power vested in\r\n\r\nthem to carry out their duty. Although the pickets\r\n\r\nmight have melted away, Sir, the Government need not\r\n\r\nrun away with the idea that they have won the fight,\r\n\r\nfor I say that a man convinced against his will is of\r\n\r\nthe same opinion still.

All we can  do  in\r\n\r\nthis particular motion is to say that the students  are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  the  education  policy,  and   that\r\n\r\nbecause   they   are  dissatisfied,  there   has   been\r\n\r\npicketing.

But  if\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member goes into details and tries to  start\r\n\r\ndebating what that policy is and how it is alleged that\r\n\r\nit  is wrong, then that is completely irrelevant.

First of\r\n\r\nall,  it  asks the House to condemn the action  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents, and secondly it asks support of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  for police action against the students. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a Government here, and there is no better example\r\n\r\nof a government which is shirking its responsibility, a\r\n\r\ngovernment  which refuses to govern. We are now  seeing\r\n\r\nin front of us a Government which wants the Assembly to\r\n\r\ngive it cover for a certain action which it intends  to\r\n\r\ntake but dare not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir the motion, if accepted, would reduce the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  to just an  escape  body  taking\r\n\r\ninstructions from this Assembly. This Assembly would be\r\n\r\nlike  the  32  men  in  the City Council  with  you  as\r\n\r\nPresident.   And  we  would  have  Standing   Committee\r\n\r\ncomprising members of all political Parties running the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of Singapore, just as a Standing  Committee\r\n\r\nof  32 men in the City Council ran the local government\r\n\r\na  few  years  ago. Sir, when the Government  used  the\r\n\r\npolice  and military personnel against the strikers  or\r\n\r\nused   the  police  and  military  personnel  for   the\r\n\r\nprotection of new workers when the City Council went on\r\n\r\nstrike, they did not co-me to this House to ask  for  a\r\n\r\nvote.  They went under their own steam, and  they  took\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of government. I cannot  understand\r\n\r\nwhy,  on this occasion, the Government should come here\r\n\r\nand  ask  us for a vote. And that is why, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  they  should  not  use  police  when  there   are\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last week we have almost a similar\r\n\r\nmotion which also called for police protection against\r\n\r\nthe students, so that we could defend the privilege of\r\n\r\nan Assemblyman. What happened in that motion is that we\r\n\r\nwould be getting the police to bring the students - or\r\n\r\narrest them if necessary - before the Committee of\r\n\r\nPrivileges. And if they are guilty -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is what the\r\n\r\nmotion means.

By\r\n\r\ncalling  students  hooligans and by  using  the  police\r\n\r\nagainst  students  would  not  be, conducive  to   the\r\n\r\ncreation of peace, as what the Prime Minister said just\r\n\r\nnow.  The  threat of violence or the threat  of  police\r\n\r\naction  would  not  reduce tension, but  would  instead\r\n\r\naggravate  the situation and create bitterness  on  all\r\n\r\nsides.

I  really\r\n\r\ncannot understand why the Government did not defer its\r\n\r\nsupplementary  examinations until a  calmer  atmosphere\r\n\r\nprevails.  And  why  it should insist  on  having  the\r\n\r\nsupplementary examinations immediately after the Middle\r\n\r\nN  examinations are completed, and coming to this House\r\n\r\nasking  it  to  give protective cover  for  any  police\r\n\r\naction  it  might intend to take, not on this  occasion\r\n\r\nbut on future occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has said that between two-thirds\r\n\r\nand  three-quarters of the students  have  taken  their\r\n\r\nexaminations. Only a fraction is left. A few hundred of\r\n\r\nthe  students have not taken the examination.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  cannot understand why this motion is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen  three-quarters of the students have  taken  their\r\n\r\nexaminations  without  police protection  and  without\r\n\r\npolice action, why should the Government ask for police\r\n\r\nprotection when a small fraction is left?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we oppose this motion, as we opposed the\r\n\r\nmotion  last Friday, we are confident that the  parents\r\n\r\nof  the  students will understand that if there is  any\r\n\r\npolice  intervention in the supplementary  examinations\r\n\r\nor  in the Senior Middle III examinations which are  to\r\n\r\ncome,  their children might be hurt during any  scuffle\r\n\r\nwhich might ensue.

May I suggest to him that in trying to be\r\n\r\nfriends to all and be the champion of Chinese school\r\n\r\nstudents and Chinese education, his efforts will not\r\n\r\nbe appreciated by the Communists? In fact, they would\r\n\r\nonly hate him more for trying to pose as a champion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, serious allegations have been made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Queenstown that police  have  been\r\n\r\ndisguised  as  students and parents to assault  student\r\n\r\npicketers. I do not wish at this stage to be drawn into\r\n\r\na  lengthy  argument  with the Member  for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nsince  there  will be a Commission of Inquiry  and  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Queenstown  no  doubt   will   have   to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate his allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should like the Members of this House to\r\n\r\nnote that none of the parents and the students who want\r\n\r\nto  sit for the examination mask their faces, for  they\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. And it seems\r\n\r\nto  be  utterly  foolish  for  the  police  to  assault\r\n\r\nstudents - if such an allegation is true - by going  about\r\n\r\nit  openly, to invite identification without taking the\r\n\r\nnecessary elementary  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprecaution of disguising themselves  like  the\r\n\r\nstudent picketers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion flows logically from the\r\n\r\nmotion  that was approved by this House, including  Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis, on 29th November.  That\r\n\r\nmotion read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, taking cognisance of the complaint\r\n\r\non  a  matter of privilege reported to it by the Leader\r\n\r\nof  the House, condemns the conduct of the hooligans if\r\n\r\nin   fact   such  hooligans  illegally  prevented   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nwho  is  the  Member for Bukit Panjang, from  attending\r\n\r\nthis   meeting  and  discharging  his   duties   as   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, and calls upon the police\r\n\r\nto ensure that the culprits are dealt with according to\r\n\r\nthe  law  as  laid  down  in the  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\n(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  those  who approved that  motion  cannot logically  disapprove  of the  motion  now  before  the House.  In  fact,  there is more  reason  for  them  to\r\n\r\nendorse this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of 29th November related only to the\r\n\r\nprotection   of  the  rights  and  privileges   of   an\r\n\r\nindividual Assemblyman.

I refer, Sir, to a statement  issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Preparatory Committee of the Parents Association in\r\n\r\nreply  to the President of the Singapore Chinese School\r\n\r\nTeachers Union who accused them of asking the police to\r\n\r\nbe brutal against the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> This statement appears in today's\r\n\r\nNanyang Siang Pau.\r\n\r\nThe  parents  asked these questions  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese School Teachers Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Have the parents no right to enjoy the fundamental\r\n\r\nright  of  personal safety which every  citizen  should\r\n\r\nhave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the parents committing an offence in bringing\r\n\r\ntheir children to examination centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the parents to be deprived of even the right to\r\n\r\nappeal  for  police  protection  when  they  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren are subject to obstruction by pickets  and  be\r\n\r\nthe  targets of brutal assault by stones, mud  and  bad\r\n\r\neggs?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.

The parents\r\n\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We believe that the police is a department for the\r\n\r\npreservation of peace and good order in a democratic\r\n\r\nState. The pickets are not armed. The students who want\r\n\r\nto sit for the examination and their parents are also\r\n\r\nunarmed. Can anyone deny this fact?'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  the parents go on to enumerate four instances  of\r\n\r\ninjury  and assaults by the picketers. In one  case,  a\r\n\r\nparent took two parcels of food to his children at  the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College. He threw the food over  the\r\n\r\nfence  to his children. The pickets rushed and  grabbed\r\n\r\nthe  food  and assaulted the students, with the  result\r\n\r\nthat  there was a scuffle between the pickets  and  the\r\n\r\nparents  who  want  to  the victims'  aid.  Stones  and\r\n\r\nbottles, according to the parents, were thrown  by  the\r\n\r\npicketers.  Then  the parents also quoted  an  instance\r\n\r\nwhere a 70 years old woman who took her grandson to the\r\n\r\nexamination centre, had to brave abuses and the pickets\r\n\r\nin order to go into the examination centre. She fell as\r\n\r\na result and her leg was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what this motion asks is that\r\n\r\nno  one should forcefully prevent students who wish  to\r\n\r\ntake  examinations from doing so. This motion does  not\r\n\r\nforce those who do not want to take the examinations to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  All it seeks to do is to protect the right  of\r\n\r\nstudents who want to sit for the examinations  and  the\r\n\r\nright  of  parents and guardians to see  that  no  one\r\n\r\nprevents their children from taking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch examinations. In fact, if the boycott is a popular\r\n\r\nmove  and  has  the  support of  the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  and the parents there is no need of picketing\r\n\r\nand  human  chains, and the presence of the  police  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  Or if the picketers indulge  in  genuine,\r\n\r\npeaceful picketing, instead of linking arms to  prevent\r\n\r\nby  force  students from taking the examinations,  then\r\n\r\nthe  need of parents to ask for police protection  does\r\n\r\nnot arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is therefore surprising that allegedly responsible political leaders of the Barisan Sosialis should try to confuse this simple issue by\r\n\r\nraising  a  hue  and cry about police  brutalities  and\r\n\r\nviolence  and presenting it as an attempt  to  use  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force against school children. And I regret, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, that even the Chairman of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce, who should have more  sense  and\r\n\r\nshould have been more clear-minded, should have allowed\r\n\r\nhimself  to  be  fooled  and confused  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the falsity of this charge can  be  seen\r\n\r\nfrom  the fact that throughout the past week,  we  have\r\n\r\ndeliberately  refrained from using the  police  against\r\n\r\npicketing  students simply because we do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nfall  into  the  Communist trap of  trying  to  provoke\r\n\r\nclashes  between  school children and the  parents.  We\r\n\r\nresisted   doing  this  even  when  picketing  students\r\n\r\nillegally  and forcibly assaulted students (who  wanted\r\n\r\nto  take  the examination) and their parents.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, who on 29th November were  ready\r\n\r\nto  condemn acts of hooliganism by picketers against  a\r\n\r\nfellow  Assemblyman, and call upon the police to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   an  Assemblyman's  rights  are  protected,   are\r\n\r\nobviously  not  prepared to extend the same  protection\r\n\r\nagainst   hooliganism   to  law-abiding   parents   and\r\n\r\nstudents. Though I fully agree that an Assemblyman must\r\n\r\nbe   protected  in  the  exercise  of  his  rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges,  I think this Assembly should  be  just  as\r\n\r\nready  to  protect the rights of ordinary students  and\r\n\r\ncitizens  as  well,  otherwise  this  House  would   be\r\n\r\ntreating Assemblymen as privileged people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, in particular, would, if they\r\n\r\noppose  this motion, be saying we are ready to  protect\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of Assemblymen because that  involves  our\r\n\r\npersonal  welfare, but who cares about the rights  and\r\n\r\nwelfare   of  students  and  parents?  In  a  statement\r\n\r\npublished  on  1st December in the Straits  Times,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Barisan Sosialis declared  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  motion is a motion to sanction  police  action\r\n\r\nagainst students. The statement went on to say,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. is now anxious to use the police to\r\n\r\nsuppress mounting dissatisfaction.

Let me now show, Sir, how  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have distorted  the  spirit  and\r\n\r\nintent  of this motion.

Not\r\n\r\neven  the Barisan Sosialis can deny that students  have\r\n\r\nbeen  and are being prevented from taking examinations.\r\n\r\nStudents have not only been obstructed and intimidated,\r\n\r\nbut force has been used by picketers against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis are not themselves\r\n\r\ndirectly involved in the boycott, they should surely be\r\n\r\nready   to   condemn  the  actions  of   picketers   in\r\n\r\nobstructing and intimidating students who want to  take\r\n\r\nexaminations.  The  students who  wanted  to  take  the\r\n\r\nexaminations  were not doing anything wrong.  They  did\r\n\r\nnot even query the right of picketers to stay away from\r\n\r\nthe  examination. All that the students asked was  that\r\n\r\nthey should be allowed to take these examinations.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, unless they are up to their necks  in\r\n\r\nthis  Communist  plot to create a clash between  police\r\n\r\nand   picketing   school  children,  should   have   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  condemning  those  who   obstruct   or\r\n\r\nintimidate or use force on those who want to take their\r\n\r\nexaminations. As responsible political leaders, the Barisan  Sosialis  cannot maintain that  those  people  who\r\n\r\nintimidate  and  obstruct  students  should   not   be\r\n\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the next part of the motion refers to an appeal from parents of students who wish to take these examinations that they and their children should\r\n\r\nbe afforded police protection -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Count them P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, it is true that parents have\r\n\r\nasked  for  police protection for themselves and  their\r\n\r\nchildren.

There is, therefore, no question of\r\n\r\ntaking  action  against picketers or  breaking  up  the\r\n\r\npickets.  To do so would be to fall into the  Communist\r\n\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Oh, Communist semua-yah?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> So long as the pickets do not\r\n\r\ninterfere   with  the  rights  of  students   to   take\r\n\r\nexaminations,  so  long  as  they  do  not   intimidate\r\n\r\nexaminees  or use force against them, and so  long  as\r\n\r\nthe picketers do not do things to endanger the life and\r\n\r\nlimb  of people, there can be no question of using  the\r\n\r\npolice  against  them.  This  motion  merely  seeks  to\r\n\r\nprevent  picketers from intimidating or obstructing  or\r\n\r\nusing violence against examinees and their parents.  If\r\n\r\na hooligan starts beating up an innocent hawker and the\r\n\r\nhawker appeals to a policeman for assistance, would the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  claim that the policeman  was  being\r\n\r\nbrutal  in not allowing the hooligan to beat the hawker\r\n\r\nto  pulp? Yet, that seems to be the stand taken by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  leaders. Any  action  taken  by  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  see  that  students and  parents  are  not\r\n\r\nmolested or intimidated by student picketers who are  being manipulated by pro-Communists is, in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, an act of brutality, if I  read\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis'  stand correctly,  it  is  that\r\n\r\npicketers  should be allowed a free hand to intimidate\r\n\r\nand  use  force against students and parents.

They grew bolder until they decided that they\r\n\r\nwould  prevent  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education from coming to this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut within a few minutes of a motion of privilege being\r\n\r\nraised  in this House, the students dispersed, and  not\r\n\r\nonly that, but the day after the motion was passed with\r\n\r\nthe approval of the Barisan Sosialis, the picketers not\r\n\r\nonly   did   not  try  to  obstruct  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for  Education,  but  were\r\n\r\nextremely polite to the Minister for Education and  his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary.  In  other  words,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nmotion  of 29th November, had a salutary effect on  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  There was no need to give police  protection\r\n\r\nto  the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation,  because  the  fact  that  this  motion  was\r\n\r\nendorsed   by  art  overwhelming  majority   vote   was\r\n\r\nsufficient  deterrent.

When the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis voted for a motion in all  sincerity,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister himself could just laugh  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Ha!

Having been a Member of this  Assembly  for\r\n\r\nmany  years, and having been the, shall we say foolish\r\n\r\nChief  Minister in the last Government, I  cannot  help\r\n\r\nbut feel that the debate which is taking place today is\r\n\r\nactually  just a replay of what took place in 1956.  At\r\n\r\nthat time, I was on the other side of the House and our\r\n\r\ngreat  Prime Minister was sitting on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  as  an  elected representative of the  P.A.P.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to say this - and there is the  Hansard  to\r\n\r\nprove it - that the words he uttered are almost the  same\r\n\r\nas  those  uttered  by the Member for Queenstown  today\r\n\r\nagainst  his  Government.  If  one  were  to  draw  any\r\n\r\nconclusion, one would just say that perhaps the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  (ex-P.A.P.) have learnt very, very well  from\r\n\r\ntheir masters. Now they come out and give back a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  the medicine which the P.A.P. when in  the  Op\r\n\r\nposition gave to the previous Government. But what  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government did - according to the P.A.P. -  was  a\r\n\r\nfoolish thing. \"The Government fell into a trap.\" So it\r\n\r\nis  now admitted in this Assembly that there was a trap\r\n\r\nlaid by the P.A.P. for the previous Government. At that\r\n\r\ntime,  Sir, I was the Chief Minister. I knew that there\r\n\r\nwere  such political moves being made, but I felt  that\r\n\r\nif  a  government wants to govern, it must  govern.  It\r\n\r\nmust  not take into consideration, in carrying out  its\r\n\r\nsacred  duty  of  looking after  the  welfare  and  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the people of Singapore, whether the  Party\r\n\r\nwill  survive.  The  security and the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore are above the continued existence\r\n\r\nof any Party in Singapore and anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  I  say to them that if they want to claim that they\r\n\r\nare  a  good,  strong and responsible  Government  they\r\n\r\nshould behave like one. Do not come to this Assembly on\r\n\r\na  motion telling us in advance, \"We do not want to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  Last  time the previous Government fell  into  a\r\n\r\ntrap.

It is definitely not the duty of the Government\r\n\r\nto  place  the  interests of the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsecond  to the interests of their own political  Party.\r\n\r\nThat  will  not give them the right to claim that  they\r\n\r\nare a good, clean and honest Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where is the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I remember, Sir, that even in the\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Minister for Home Affairs just  now,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Look at the Barisan Sosialis playing  with  the\r\n\r\nstudents.\" I have no sympathy for the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nin  all  its  attempts to, shall we say, overthrow  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but what I would like to point out in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly is this: what they are accused of doing  today\r\n\r\nis  actually what the P.A.P. did when they were in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.

Well, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  made it clear just now - he spent most  of  his\r\n\r\ntime laughing it off; I do not know why he should treat\r\n\r\na very serious subject as a laughing matter - that he was\r\n\r\nout  to trap the Barisan Sosialis, and he charged  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis were out to trap him.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  who is trapping whom. If this is going to be  the\r\n\r\ntrend  of  debate on every motion in this  House,  then\r\n\r\nthis  sitting  is  going to be a very,  very  long  and\r\n\r\nprotracted  affair.  I hope that  the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  either present or past, should try to  refrain\r\n\r\nfrom bringing their political war into this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to come to the defence of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, but I must say this, that having been\r\n\r\nin  the government myself, I know it is wrong to  start\r\n\r\naccusing  people  of being involved in activities  that\r\n\r\nare detrimental to the security of the State and not do\r\n\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If it is true that today there are\r\n\r\npeople  in  the Barisan Sosialis who are involved - as  I\r\n\r\npointed  out that during my time there were  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. who were involved in subversive activities,\r\n\r\nand  we arrested them - then the Government should arrest\r\n\r\nthese  people, and I am sure that they themselves would\r\n\r\nbe  only too pleased. \"If we are really guilty, pull us\r\n\r\nin.  We don't mind going to gaol. But don't just simply\r\n\r\nblack-list in that way and call us all sorts of names.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the previous Govern\r\n\r\nment  took  action against subversives in  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwhat  did  the  Prime  Minister who  was  then  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition - in fact, sitting almost in the same seat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  I  am sitting now - do? He stood up and defended them,\r\n\r\nand  called the Government all sorts of names. He said,\r\n\r\n\"These  are  good people. These are comrades  of  mine.\"\r\n\r\nAbove  all  that,  he even shed tears trying  to  defend\r\n\r\nthem.  And  today, out of his own mouth he  called  them\r\n\r\nworse names than I ever dared to call them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed a pity that politics in Singapore has\r\n\r\ncome to such a stage whereby a government would not dare\r\n\r\nto move in the interests of law and order without trying\r\n\r\nto get the Barisan Sosialis involved. According to their\r\n\r\nlogic,  if  the Barisan Sosialis votes with  them,  then\r\n\r\neverything  is honky-tonky. And if the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsay,  \"No\",  then everything is going to be  difficult.\r\n\r\nHow could it be? If they like the Barisan Sosialis, then\r\n\r\ninvite them to go back and work with the Government.  Do\r\n\r\nnot let them sit on this side of the House and give us a\r\n\r\nlot  of unnecessary noise from their sides. We are quite\r\n\r\nable to look after the interests of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, has\r\n\r\ntabled  an amendment. The amendment is to make it  clear\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  the  duty of a government  to  govern,  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  law and order. And if it is of any  assistance\r\n\r\nto the Government in the proper discharge of its duty to\r\n\r\nmaintain  law and order, then we are prepared  to  give\r\n\r\nthem  our vote. But we want to say this to them - and  the\r\n\r\namendment  seeks to focus attention on this - that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  duty of a government to govern. I do hope  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture  the Government will not come running  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  asking  for  the views of this  Assembly  in\r\n\r\nmatters which directly concern the duties of government.\r\n\r\nThey either govern or they do not govern. If they do not\r\n\r\nwish to govern, the answer is simple. They get out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T.

He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstarts off by criticising the Government for having cast\r\n\r\ndoubts  on  the  sincerity of the Barisan Sosialis.  And\r\n\r\nthen  he ends up by criticising the Government,  yet  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time agreeing to the sentiments expressed  in\r\n\r\nthe  motion. I can only say, Sir, that I find the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill a very slippery customer. But I would like\r\n\r\nto   tell   him  this - he  has  left  the  Chamber,   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  I would like to tell him this - there  is  a\r\n\r\nstrong  rumour  in  town  that there  is,  in  fact,  an\r\n\r\nalliance between the Singapore People's Alliance and the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government. And it could be,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat in the anxiety of the Member for Cairnhill to cover\r\n\r\nup  this  alliance,  he wants to criticise  us  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but nevertheless, when it comes  to  the basic  situation, he makes sure all the time  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment gets more than 26 votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that in a debate on a motion of such a\r\n\r\nserious  nature  as we have today, we  saw  a  clowning\r\n\r\nperformance of the Prime Minister. Sir, either the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister thinks that the motion before the House is  one\r\n\r\nthat  makes him laugh, because he thinks that after  the\r\n\r\npassing of this motion what is going to happen is  going\r\n\r\nto  be amusing to him; or because he finds that What the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has said is the truth, and  as  it\r\n\r\nis  the truth, it hurts him and he wants to cover it  up\r\n\r\nby  just  laughing it off. Sir, since the debate started\r\n\r\nat  2.30  p.m. today, every Government speaker has  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  avoid the issues projected  by  this  motion\r\n\r\nbefore  us.  Sir, nobody in the Barisan Sosialis  doubts\r\n\r\nthat,  on the face of it, the motion purports to  uphold\r\n\r\nand defend the right of every student to his freedom  to\r\n\r\npursue his studies and sit for an examination. But, Sir,\r\n\r\nis this all there is to this motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House seeks to obtain for\r\n\r\nthe  Government a blank cheque from this Assembly. But,\r\n\r\nSir, before we decide to put such a blank cheque in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Government, it is our bounden  duty  to\r\n\r\nensure  that there is, in fact, no foul play  intended.\r\n\r\nSir, Singapore today is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforced to witness and tolerate the pathetic picture  of\r\n\r\npoor  vain  threats, plots and  plans  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment in its last days. And, Sir, we would fail in\r\n\r\nour  duty  to  our  people if we  did  not  expose  the\r\n\r\ndesperate move of this discredited Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion calls on this Assembly to condemn the\r\n\r\nstudent pickets and to sanction the use of police force\r\n\r\nagainst school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Of course, the hon. Member is\r\n\r\nquite entitled to interpret it that way.

Sir,  this\r\n\r\npicketing   is   the   logical   consequence   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  determination to hold  the  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nExamination in the face of genuine grievances and fears\r\n\r\non the part of Chinese educationists and students. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s education policy - I assure you, Sir, that\r\n\r\nI  do  not  intend to start a debate on  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy,  but  all  I want to say is that  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\neducation  policy, particularly in respect  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation,  should be understood. For it is  this  that\r\n\r\nhas  brought about the boycott and sufferings  to  both\r\n\r\nparents   and  children,  whether  they   be   in   the\r\n\r\nexamination ball on in the picket line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, all teachers from all streams of\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore know about the efficiency of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. The public, because of this  sad\r\n\r\nsituation in the Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools,  is also made aware of this fact.  Sir,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave said once before, I have respect for the trust and\r\n\r\nprivacy  of  private conversations,  unlike  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. Hence, I do not think I should reveal to this\r\n\r\nHouse  what  Mr C. V. Devan Nair told me  many  times,\r\n\r\nwhen he was the Political Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation, of his estimation of the competence  of  the\r\n\r\nHon, the  Minister for Education, who incidentally  is\r\n\r\nthe  ex-General Manager of an insurance  company.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  want to make this point: running an  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry is not like running an insurance company. Even\r\n\r\nin the insurance company and in the insurance business,\r\n\r\nhe is known as an Asian expatriate by the local staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is all this really necessary in\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on  the motion? Let us  get  on  with  the\r\n\r\nmotion. Time is getting on. It is a quarter to nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The point that I really want to make is this\r\n\r\nexpatriate attitude, this contempt for the view of the\r\n\r\npoor  native, be he an educationist or a student, which\r\n\r\nhas  helped  to result in the boycott. The question  of\r\n\r\nhaving to sit for an examination was never disputed. In\r\n\r\nthis   respect,  Sir,  we  must  condemn  the  P.A.P\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  not telling this Assembly  the  facts.\r\n\r\nThey tried to confuse the issue by distorting the facts\r\n\r\nand  stating  that  the students do not  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversally recognised principle that one must  pass  a\r\n\r\nlower  examination before going for a higher one.  This\r\n\r\nprinciple, Sir, as I have said, was never an issue.  It\r\n\r\nprobably remained an issue in the mind of the Minister,\r\n\r\nand  I  would suggest that the sooner he sorts out  his\r\n\r\nthoughts  and facts clearly, the better it is  for  him\r\n\r\nand everybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how the Government examination, at the end of\r\n\r\nPrimary VI in the English education stream, serves as a\r\n\r\nbottleneck, as a valve to limit the number of  children\r\n\r\ngoing into the Secondary English schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry I have to interrupt\r\n\r\nagain.

But what I do want to say is that it  is  the\r\n\r\nsubconscious  fear  of many Chinese educationists  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government may use their Secondary IV  Examination\r\n\r\nlike   nets.  Sir,  the  Government's  insistence   and\r\n\r\nadventurous attitude on its effort to hold examinations\r\n\r\nin  one  way or another have all helped to enhance  the\r\n\r\nfears.  Whether these fears are groundless  or  whether\r\n\r\nthey  do in fact, reflect Government's intention is  of\r\n\r\nno  consequence to us today. But what is of importance,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  that  these  fears are genuine.  They  are  a\r\n\r\nreality and we must take cognisance of them. Sir, if we\r\n\r\nbehave  like expatriates then we will end  up  in  this\r\n\r\npresent mess. The P.A.P. has deliberately ignored these\r\n\r\nobjective  factors. It ignores them, Sir,  at  its  own\r\n\r\nperil.  But  this  Assembly  shall  not  share  in  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility due to the consequences of the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nfollies. It is the height of impertinence, Sir, and  an\r\n\r\ninsult to this Assembly that this House should be asked\r\n\r\nto sanction police action so that the P.A.P. may pursue\r\n\r\na  course  pregnant with threats to the peace  of  the\r\n\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the pretext of maintaining law and order,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. wants us to give it the green light so that\r\n\r\nits  action might create more disorder and violence and\r\n\r\nenhance  the  atmosphere of tension the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  tried  to create in his radio talks. Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government does not want violence, does not wish\r\n\r\nto  create an artificial tension in Singapore, and does\r\n\r\nnot  wish to turn this sad issue, which is a result  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  folly, into a weapon to suppress  political\r\n\r\nopponents,  then  they  should  not  have  handled  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  the  way they in fact did.  The  present\r\n\r\nstudent  unrest appears to be the result of a  plan  by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to cause violence and an air of tension. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  seems to be out to justify what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  warned of in his radio  talks.  We  have\r\n\r\nseen,  Sir,  how the Government tried to  justify  such\r\n\r\nforecasts,  as the Prime Minister said in  relation  to\r\n\r\nthe industrial front, by indulging in acts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich would have provoked violence amongst strikers and\r\n\r\npolice. We have even seen the case of the strike by the\r\n\r\nPublic Daily-Rated Employees, when the Government tried\r\n\r\nto  make  the issue a political one, when in  fact  the\r\n\r\nstrike was precipitated by Government's sponsorship  of\r\n\r\na  yellow  union, the A.U.P.E. The Prime  Minister  had\r\n\r\nforecast   that  his  political  opponents  would   use\r\n\r\nstudents. He now appears to create a situation to  make\r\n\r\nhis  forecast appear true. Sir, it is important for  us\r\n\r\nall to realise how the present situation was created by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and how it could have been avoided  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had not been bent on creating trouble so  as  to\r\n\r\npush  through  their  phoney merger  in  the  resulting\r\n\r\nconfusion  and unrest. History has shown us  many  such\r\n\r\nexamples. In Singapore's recent history, Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  how  the Member for Cairnhill and Chew  Swee  Kee\r\n\r\nsparked  off trouble in the students section so  as  to\r\n\r\nclamp  down  on militant trade unionists and  political\r\n\r\nopponents.  We  see,  Sir,  in  the  P.A.P. manoeuvres\r\n\r\ndesigned  to create unrest so as to eliminate effective\r\n\r\nopposition and keep themselves in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as early as 1960, the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nmentioned the P.A.P.'s plans to revise and shorten  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  education in the Chinese secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nBut  nothing was done until mid 1961, when the Minister\r\n\r\nrestated  his  intention  once  again.  Sir,  all  news\r\n\r\nregarding  criticism of this policy was  systematically\r\n\r\nsuppressed. There were grievances and fears. But  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  means  for  all to have open discussions.  The\r\n\r\npublic  was  completely  kept  in  the  dark.  Then  in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  the  P.A.P. decided to announce  officially\r\n\r\nthe  conversion plan. They decided to push through  the\r\n\r\nexaminations  even  when  the syllabus  for  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary classes plan was not available. They  started\r\n\r\non  this  course  knowing full well the resentment  and\r\n\r\nfears of the Chinese educationists and the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they were fools and half-wits, then we would\r\n\r\nhave  forgiven them. But they are men who claim  to  be\r\n\r\nintelligent, Sir, and as such, they know full well that\r\n\r\npushing  through  this  delicate  and  emotional  issue\r\n\r\nagainst suppressed grievances\r\n\r\nand fears will only result in a blow-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  their  censorship of grievances and fears  failed\r\n\r\nwhen the \"Barisan\", the organ of my Party, published in\r\n\r\nfull the grievances of the students. The \"Barisan\"  was\r\n\r\ncareful  just  to report the news of the grievances  of\r\n\r\nthe  students without any comment whatsoever. Our  aim,\r\n\r\nSir,  was that unless all are made fully aware  of  the\r\n\r\ngrievances and the fears of the educationists  and  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  they  would not be able  to  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nmischievous designs of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a showdown was obvious and inevitable with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  determined to teach the students  a  lesson\r\n\r\nand thus achieve their desire. It is our responsibility\r\n\r\nto  lay facts for the parents and others to see. We did\r\n\r\nnot  comment, Sir, for we did not want to stir  up  any\r\n\r\nfeelings and fall into the P.A.P. scheme of things. Our\r\n\r\npublishing of the genuine grievances had ultimately let\r\n\r\nthe  cat out of the bag for the P.A.P. Despite the fact\r\n\r\nthat  we passed no comments, the P.A.P. thought fit  to\r\n\r\nunleash  a  campaign directed at us for  agitating  and\r\n\r\ninstigating the students. Sir, we see the same  process\r\n\r\nbeing  repeated. Sir, Chew Swee Kee in 1956 blamed  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. for  instigating  the  students.  The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  then  knew  that  those  allegations   were\r\n\r\nfictitious. Now they have resorted to the Chew Swee Kee\r\n\r\ntactics, and it is the Barisan Sosialis this time which\r\n\r\nis the scapegoat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Education mentioned three\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members and Mr Tommy Koh Thong Bee as\r\n\r\nhaving gone to the schools to instigate and give  moral\r\n\r\nsupport  to the students. We are glad that in the  case\r\n\r\nof  Tommy  Koh the Minister had to eat his  own  words.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir, what is more important is the logic  of  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch and the Minister.

But I just want to  expound  on\r\n\r\nthe  logic of the P.A.P. Ministers and the Intelligence\r\n\r\nService  that they are using to base their  allegations\r\n\r\nupon. I was saying that Tommy Koh's car was there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It was not!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Exactly. There you are, when one\r\n\r\ngoes  into detail, one makes mistake. The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nnow  says  that  Tommy Koh's car  was  there, but  the\r\n\r\ninformation  is that his car was not there.  Anyway,  I\r\n\r\nthink I must stop details of that nature. The point has\r\n\r\nbeen made. Let us come back to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would like to ask the Minister whether,\r\n\r\napart from the students, there were others that morning\r\n\r\nat the schools, and whether they also were giving moral\r\n\r\nsupport.  Were  they, Sir, to use  the  Special  Branch\r\n\r\nlogic,  instigating the children? The Minister and  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch  ventured to carry  their  logic  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher  stage.  Because three Barisan Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nwere  there that morning - three out of numerous  parents\r\n\r\nand onlookers - the Barisan Sosialis was therefore behind\r\n\r\nthe  disturbances. And again, as two of the three there\r\n\r\nhappened to be at the same time bus workers, Fong  Swee\r\n\r\nSuan  was behind the show. Sir, such logic is the  same\r\n\r\nas  saying, if a P.A.P. Member commits murder, then the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninstigated  him. This is the very logic  that  composed\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  theme of all the radio  talks  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  all  been\r\n\r\nthrilled by the rhythm of the Harry Lime theme, but our\r\n\r\npeople are now being subjected to the sickening refrain\r\n\r\nof  the Harry Lee theme. How desperate can this man be,\r\n\r\nSir? And how low can the P.A.P. leadership sink?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having found somebody to blame for their follies,\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. was  determined  to  push  through   the\r\n\r\nexamination in the Chinese schools. Mind you, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  urgency  for this  plan.  It  could  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  even  next  year. Having  failed  in  their\r\n\r\nefforts, Sir, they now persist and want to hold and, in\r\n\r\nfact,  are holding supplementary examinations.  Why  do\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to  perpetuate tension? Why is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment determined to force students to sit for  the\r\n\r\nexamination  when  everybody  knows  and  feels   that,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  atmosphere,  which  is  and  was  not\r\n\r\nconducive  to  getting the best out of the  candidates,\r\n\r\nthe examination results cannot be of any significance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy to fight school boys and school girls.\r\n\r\nBut to ask Gurkha mercenaries to beat up our children\r\n\r\nis no way to solve educational problems -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, these are effects which I am sure even\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education is not unaware of. Sir, I am\r\n\r\ninclined  to believe that the Prime Minister  does  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  solve this problem peacefully. He might  want\r\n\r\ntension   and  violence  so  that  under  an  emergency\r\n\r\natmosphere, he can oppress his political opponents. But\r\n\r\nby  his own admission, he has learnt a lesson from Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee's  mistakes. He does not  want  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  police  action.  He   wants   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to sanction such action. He wants  to  commit\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly to an act which he himself dare  not  do\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, except for slight modifications, we see Chew Swee\r\n\r\nKee's  actions all over again.

Today we witness in  this  House  the\r\n\r\njoining up of forces of the Member for Cairnhill,  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee Kee's cronies, and the P.A.P. desperadoes.

In the last few days, Sir, we have seen  well-trained  and  co-ordinated \"parents\"  manning  gateways\r\n\r\nthrough picket lines. Sir, we have seen students  being\r\n\r\nassaulted by these so-called parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here, for your information, a picture\r\n\r\npublished in the Free Press of Friday, 1st December, of\r\n\r\nthese   people   whom  the  P.A.P.  Government   called\r\n\r\n\"parents\".  And  the  note  under  the  picture  reads,\r\n\r\n\"Parents  and supporters stand by outside the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education.\"  They all appear to  me  to  be  people\r\n\r\nranging from the age of nine to not more than 20.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  can assure the Minister for Education, who seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  amused,  that this is not a picture  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  cameraman. This is  a  part  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  outfit, and if at all anybody  supplies\r\n\r\nphotographs, it  should  be  the  Government,  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  fact, supplied the  photograph  to  be\r\n\r\npublished  in the Straits Times. I cannot remember  the\r\n\r\ndate,  Sir,  but the Straits Times carried a photograph\r\n\r\nand  underneath  it  is a note saying,  \"Photograph  by\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What about the Chinese Press?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, anyway, that is something that we are\r\n\r\nnot  in  the habit of doing.

Definitely\r\n\r\nthere  have  been more casualties amongst the  students\r\n\r\nthan  among the \"parents\". Now we are asked to  protect\r\n\r\nthese  \"parents\".  We  are  asked  to  sanction  police\r\n\r\naction - that   is  my  interpretation  - against   school\r\n\r\nchildren.

We appeal to them once again not to place their\r\n\r\npolitical  future above the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Their actions might have provoked  violence,\r\n\r\nbut  thanks to the restraint shown by the strikers  and\r\n\r\nthe  pickets and recently by the school students, there\r\n\r\nwas none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point that I wish to answer is something raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nSir, the charge against the Barisan Sosialis is that we\r\n\r\nwant  to create violence to topple the Government.  Let\r\n\r\nme  assure the Members opposite that we do not have  to\r\n\r\nhave   violence  to  topple  the  Government.

I did not talk of fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am glad of the correction. But I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to point out that the use of  students  to\r\n\r\nboycott  the examinations is not purely for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  embarrassing  the  Government  but  of  creating  a\r\n\r\nsituation in which the lives and limbs of students  and\r\n\r\nyoung people could be jeopardised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote from Hansard, 16th May, 1955, column 241.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  Hock Lee strike, school students  went  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  strikers.  There were clashes  between  the\r\n\r\npolice and the students. I remember, Sir, there was one\r\n\r\nstudent who was badly injured and the students, instead\r\n\r\nof  ensuring  that this boy was sent to  the  hospital,\r\n\r\ncarried  the  body of a dying schoolboy  all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace  including, I think, the office of  a  newspaper,\r\n\r\nbecause  they were quite determined to have a  martyr - a\r\n\r\ndead  schoolboy.  Had the boy been  taken  to  hospital\r\n\r\nstraight-away, he would have been saved.  But  the  men\r\n\r\nwho  organised this demonstration were quite determined\r\n\r\nto  have a dead schoolboy as a martyr. When the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson was the Chief Minister, he had this to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Government believes in the decency and the\r\n\r\nworth  of  the  great  mass  of  our  youth  and  their\r\n\r\npotential; that we believe a tiny group, which does not\r\n\r\nstop at murder...',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>because I am sure the Chief Minister then knew that the\r\n\r\nmen  who  manipulated the school children were prepared\r\n\r\neven to incite innocent boys who were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmisinformed to do something which amounted to murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...has given Singapore and the Chinese schools of\r\n\r\nSingapore a bad name.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he went to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Students have been driven from class-rooms to the\r\n\r\nstreets.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He then pinpointed the responsibility indirectly - he had\r\n\r\nno  proof  then - on a Member who is now  the  organising\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Barisan Sosialis - Mr Lim Ching  Siong.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am not an expert on Chinese culture, I admit to the\r\n\r\nhon.  Gentleman for Bukit Timah, but I know  this  much\r\n\r\nabout Chinese culture;...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He   went  on  to  say  that  in  so  far  as  he   was\r\n\r\nconcerned - quite rightly - that Chinese culture  indicated\r\n\r\nan  exquisite courtesy and reasonableness. So we  know,\r\n\r\nSir, that if a situation like this were mishandled,  it\r\n\r\ncould  result  in  the  Communist  elements,  who   are\r\n\r\nmanipulating  the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis  and'\r\n\r\nputting things into their mouths, being ready to  climb\r\n\r\nto  power to get at their political objectives  on  the\r\n\r\nmaimed  bodies  of children. This has happened  in  the\r\n\r\npast and it will happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us not discuss this debate and say\r\n\r\n\"aye\"  or  \"no\". Because we know, Sir, as  one  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Assemblymen indicated to me in the  course  of\r\n\r\nthe  discussion,  the  fight for merger  has  now  gone\r\n\r\noutside this Assembly, and we are just talking, and  as\r\n\r\na result it is quite meaningless. We knew long ago that\r\n\r\nthe  battle  for  merger would be  fought  outside  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  As I said earlier, Sir, in the  opening  of\r\n\r\nthe  debate on merger, sooner or later merger  must  be\r\n\r\nstopped,  not by words but by deeds. And this  incident\r\n\r\nof boycott and agitation over the 4 : 2 and 3 : 3 systems  is  one part in a long struggle since last  June  to\r\n\r\nhalt merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what I have said before on the\r\n\r\nindustrial front, the Peoples Association, and  so  on,\r\n\r\nbut  only this: this is one more attempt to provide  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  spark off violence  and  disorder.  In\r\n\r\nfact, Sir, I have noticed very recently that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have taken an interesting  line.  We\r\n\r\ncharge them with playing at communalism or doing things\r\n\r\nwhich  incite communalism. They now take the line  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  the  communalists. We say that  they  want  to\r\n\r\nincite.  When  I  say  \"Barisan  Sosialis\",  I  am  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily referring to the 13 gentlemen, as I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  many of them really know where they are  heading\r\n\r\nfor,  but  to the men who are manipulating  them.  They\r\n\r\nknow  what  they are doing. So we say those people,  as\r\n\r\nCommunist   elements,   have   always   believed   that\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy is a facade. They  have  always\r\n\r\nmaintained the theory and practice that revolution must\r\n\r\ncome  from outside the talking chamber. I will  believe\r\n\r\nin parliamentary democracy if you can do it by debating\r\n\r\nand voting. They know that. The parliamentrian wing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis may think that that is what  they\r\n\r\nare  doing - that they are really deciding the fate of  -history  in  this  Assembly. But the manipulators  know\r\n\r\nthat  sooner or later they must give the red light  for\r\n\r\nviolence. When that happens, the 13 Barisan Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwill  have to toe the line and join them in the streets\r\n\r\nwhen the battle starts. If they do that, I will take my\r\n\r\nhat  off to them. At least we will know that these  are\r\n\r\nreal  revolutionaries. But for people to come here  and\r\n\r\ntalk   about   revolution,   about   overthrowing   the\r\n\r\nGovernment by parliamentary means, when, in fact -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nPlease,  Sir,  it  is  9.35 p.m. Could  we  debate  the\r\n\r\nmotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was about to rise and inquire of the\r\n\r\nMinister how all that he has said has any relevance  to\r\n\r\nthe motion; there may be some relevance but not all  of\r\n\r\nit is relevant. Mr Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point that I want to make is\r\n\r\nthat this boycott of examinations is part and parcel of\r\n\r\nan  attempt to create violence and disorder which  they\r\n\r\nhave   tried   to  do  in  other  fields - the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the unions, and so on. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  to  know  that this  boycott  by  itself  is\r\n\r\nnothing. If there had been picketing,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshouting slogans, putting up banners, then,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as the Government is concerned, we would not  have\r\n\r\nbothered. But if they attempt to create a fracas, or to\r\n\r\nstop  students from taking their examinations, or  hold\r\n\r\nmeetings, victory parades or victory marches, then  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  there  is  something  more  than  that.  It\r\n\r\nhappened before - a little strike, students went out  to\r\n\r\nparade, a fracas, and students got killed, and even the\r\n\r\nChief Minister had to give way. So it is our submission\r\n\r\nthat if the Barisan Sosialis are genuine about settling\r\n\r\nthis  dispute  over  the examinations,  they  can  very\r\n\r\nsimply  do  so  by  condemning the  students,  not  for\r\n\r\npicketing  but  for  preventing others  from  taking  examinations  which they have a right to  do,  and  for\r\n\r\nintimidating parents who want to take their children to\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other motion, as I have indicated earlier - the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis itself has agreed to it - is that when\r\n\r\na  Member  of the Assembly is barricaded and  prevented\r\n\r\nfrom coming here, we pass a resolution. That was enough\r\n\r\nto  persuade the students that it would be very foolish\r\n\r\nto  do  so when practically all Members of the Assembly\r\n\r\nwere quite determined to provide police protection  and\r\n\r\neven  to  punish schoolboys. The Barisan Sosialis  then\r\n\r\nwere  not  talking about police action.  It  was  quite\r\n\r\nclear,  Sir, that they were quite prepared  because  of\r\n\r\nself-interest. It was self-interest. And  that  is  why\r\n\r\nthey  passed the motion. Because - I think  it  was  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park who indicated it - if you did  not\r\n\r\npass   a  motion  like  this,  perhaps  one  day   they\r\n\r\nthemselves  might  be in the same position.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey passed the motion saying that this Assembly should\r\n\r\nextend  police  protection to an Assemblyman  and  even\r\n\r\npunish  the  people concerned. But when we asked  them,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  here are the parents and the students who  want\r\n\r\nto take their examinations. Would you be prepared to do\r\n\r\nso?\"  They  were  not  so certain  about  that.  May  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  tell the Barisan Sosialis: let  us  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans  play  politics. Let them by all means  challenge\r\n\r\nthe Government in the Assembly or outside the Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be ready to meet them. But for God's sake, do  not\r\n\r\nplay  with the lives of school children, which, as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  will tell you,  the  last  time  it\r\n\r\nhappened, it resulted in what he called the murder of a\r\n\r\nschool  boy. Therefore, I say to the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\n\"We  are  adults.

And\r\n\r\nnow  the Members in the Barisan Sosialis say, \"No,  no.\r\n\r\nYou  must discuss with the school kids.\" Some  of  them\r\n\r\nare  six or seven years old. And they also say that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education should probably sit  down  with\r\n\r\nthem  and discuss, \"Well, what do you think of the  4:2\r\n\r\nsystem? What do you think of 3:3?\" Even if you conceded\r\n\r\nthat point of democracy, I am quite sure, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, or its leaders, would want to pick  a\r\n\r\nquarrel  with the P.A.P.

The S.P.A. condemns\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. for the trouble and misery it has caused the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. What we mean by the P.A.P. are not\r\n\r\nonly those sitting on the other side of the House,  but\r\n\r\nalso  those who now describe themselves as the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Sir, we have made our stand clear.  We  as  a\r\n\r\nParty  stand for the interest and welfare of the people\r\n\r\nfirst   and  foremost  regardless  of  our  own   party\r\n\r\ninterest.  We are not prepared to and will  not  ensure\r\n\r\nour success by riding on a tiger, as the P.A.P. did and\r\n\r\nas the Barisan Sosialis Members are now trying to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before the House is becoming confused\r\n\r\nin  the  eyes  of  the  public,  because  it  is  being\r\n\r\nrepresented to them that the parties here are  debating\r\n\r\nthe issue whether we are for school children or against\r\n\r\nschool  children, whether we are for or against Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and culture. Sir, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  see it, we are being asked to vote on whether we are\r\n\r\nfor  or  against intimidation, instigated and organised\r\n\r\nfrom  behind. And whether we are for or against  giving\r\n\r\nprotection  to the parents and students who  are  being\r\n\r\nintimidated and who seek protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an educationist, I believe students all over\r\n\r\nthe  world  are  by nature the same. In whatever  media\r\n\r\nthey   study,  their  thoughts  and  emotions  run   on\r\n\r\npractically the same lines. As students they know  they\r\n\r\nhave to study. But, at the same time, they are fond  of\r\n\r\ngood fun, excitement and adventure. They are also fond\r\n\r\nof  group activity, of group leaders and of working for\r\n\r\nsome good cause. Sir, under wise guidance, students  in\r\n\r\nany  school can be developed into good citizens with  a\r\n\r\nhigh sense of responsibility. But if they get into  the\r\n\r\nclutches of people who have wrong motives, their energy\r\n\r\nand   enthusiasm  can  be  exploited,  disciplined  and\r\n\r\nexpressed  in wrong and sometimes very dangerous  ways.\r\n\r\nSir,  their  main  protection  has  always  been  their\r\n\r\nprincipals,   their   teachers   and   the    education\r\n\r\nauthorities.  If  this  line is  broken,  then  trouble\r\n\r\nbegins. This motion shows that this line of defence in\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  broken  down.  Apparently  principals,\r\n\r\nteachers and the educational authorities have tried  to\r\n\r\ndo  their best and, because they are not able  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir defences intact, the motion is moved before  this\r\n\r\nHouse   asking  for  approval  to  give  the  necessary\r\n\r\nprotection to the parents and children who want to take\r\n\r\nthe examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not asked to approve aggressive police action\r\n\r\nagainst  school children. We are being  asked  to  give\r\n\r\nprotection to the law-abiding parents and students  who\r\n\r\nwant  to do the right thing. Of course, Sir, we  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  an  educational  issue  like  this  has  become  a\r\n\r\npolitical   issue  of  great  importance.  Why   should\r\n\r\nstudents  be organised against students,  and  parents\r\n\r\nand  students be organised again also against  parents\r\n\r\nand students on the other side?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reference to a chichak dance has made many\r\n\r\npeople think of the snake dance which took place in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstreets   of   Tokyo,  and  threatened  the   Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  suppose, Sir, the  present  Government\r\n\r\nthinks  that  there  must be some kind  of  similarity\r\n\r\nhere,  and  having known the strategy of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members,  as  they  themselves  were   their\r\n\r\ntutors, they have made the necessary moves. Well, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is  their game. But as for us, we are interested\r\n\r\nin  the welfare of education in Singapore and law  and\r\n\r\norder in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to clarify at this time\r\n\r\ntheir policy as regards the participation of secondary\r\n\r\nschool students in politics. As far back as 1957 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Does that arise on this motion? If\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member wishes to debate that point, let him\r\n\r\ngive notice of a motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I have a suggestion to make - that if on any controversial matter involving students\r\n\r\nand  that matter is likely to give rise to a situation\r\n\r\nlike  this,  the Government should refer it completely\r\n\r\nto an independent educational body and let them decide\r\n\r\non  it. Otherwise, because of party politics, Sir, the\r\n\r\nthing can be developed again into a situation like the\r\n\r\none we are now facing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this issue of the 4:2 and 3:3 systems, at\r\n\r\nthis  point, if it could be referred to such  a  body,\r\n\r\nthose  students who have been misguided  can;  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the  matter  will  be taken  up  in  the  proper\r\n\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hurly-burly, Sir, people are saying that\r\n\r\nparents  in Singapore are showing their proper  mettle\r\n\r\nby  coming out to defend the rights of their children.\r\n\r\nThey are not interested in the political struggle and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they  have  had to  do  that  because  the\r\n\r\npresent Government, knowing what had happened  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government,  is  wary  about   taking   the\r\n\r\nnecessary measures to enforce law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that Members of this House, if they\r\n\r\nare really interested in the welfare of our children,\r\n\r\nwould  be  against those who try to manipulate  things\r\n\r\nfrom behind and exploit the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  from  behind:  We should  grant  protection\r\n\r\nwhere  parents  and children need such protection  to\r\n\r\npreserve their freedom to do what is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nyou  will remember that last Friday, when the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education was making his ministerial statement on\r\n\r\nthis  matter,  he  did show you a photo  in  the  Free\r\n\r\nPress. He said in a very proud manner that the parents\r\n\r\nwere  supporting the government. Sir, I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether you have seen the photo or not. But if you  or\r\n\r\nanyone  else  had  seen it, I believe  he  would  have\r\n\r\nlaughed.  He would have laughed because the  so-called\r\n\r\nparents in the picture in the Free Press are so young.\r\n\r\nThese  so-called parents are too young to  be  parents\r\n\r\nand  too old to be students. The Government would feel\r\n\r\nashamed   if  it  compares  the  picture  of  would-be\r\n\r\nparents, about 20 in number, to the thousands  of  old\r\n\r\nparents  who attended the meeting at the Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool yesterday afternoon. The joint meeting of these\r\n\r\nparents and students proves that the so-called 62 per\r\n\r\ncent  who  sat  for the examination is  inaccurate.  I\r\n\r\ndeeply believe that all the parents do not like to see\r\n\r\nthe  Government  using the Police  Force  against  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  I  know  the feeling  of  the  peace-loving\r\n\r\nparents.  I therefore believe that it is not the  real\r\n\r\nintention  of  a  few  parents  who  called  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  use  the police against  the  peaceful\r\n\r\nstrikers.  No one would use force of arms against  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  who are under 17 years of age,  except  the\r\n\r\nreactionary forces. The main purpose of this motion is\r\n\r\nto  condemn the peaceful strikers, and the Government\r\n\r\nseeks  to use the Police Force against them so  as  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  P.A.P.'s sordid political  aim  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  a  few. I would like to  ask  all  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, Parliamentary Secretaries and  Ministers,\r\n\r\nif  they are not in the Government and their sons  and\r\n\r\ndaughters are involved in any form of strike  and  are\r\n\r\nbeaten up by the police,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat would they feel? Are they going to keep quiet  and\r\n\r\nignore  the  brutality of the Government? Or  are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to  suggest that the freedom of action  must  be\r\n\r\nsuppressed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leaders, by moving this motion, clearly\r\n\r\nshow   their   insincerity  to  settle  the   four-year\r\n\r\nexamination  problem. Instead of postponing  the  four-year examination, the P.A.P. Government extends it  for\r\n\r\nanother  week.  By extending it for another  week,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing incidents may occur - I quote one by one,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe incidents which may occur:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To make the students continue their strike and\r\n\r\npicket at various examination centres for another week,\r\n\r\nso  that the policeman and the C.I.D. can lay hands  on\r\n\r\nthe students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Once the students continue to picket at the\r\n\r\nvarious examination centres, the Government may use its\r\n\r\nmachinery  and  mobilise its stooges  to  threaten  the\r\n\r\npeaceful  student strikers in an attempt to worsen  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  thereby  forcing  the  Senior  Middle   III\r\n\r\nstudents to go on strike again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To extend the examinations means to extend the\r\n\r\nstrike  for  another week. In this way, the  Government\r\n\r\nwould   have  more  chance  to  blame  their  political\r\n\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) As the merger issue has become so widely known and\r\n\r\nall  the people know the importance of citizenship, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now in a very precarious  position.  It\r\n\r\ntherefore adopts the tactic of putting the strike issue\r\n\r\nover the merger issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The P.A.P. leaders, seeing that they are in a\r\n\r\nstate  of utmost confusion over the question of merger,\r\n\r\nare  therefore  trying to direct the attention  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  from  the  merger issue to the  student  strike\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. Government, by blaming its political\r\n\r\nopponents   for  creating  the  strike,  has   made   a\r\n\r\ndespicable  attempt to camouflage its attempt  to  sell\r\n\r\nthe rights of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Due to their inefficiency and lack\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  knowledge  of  the educational  problem  and  their\r\n\r\narrogant attitude, the whole educational problem is now\r\n\r\nin  a  mass.  They,  therefore, dare not  shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility which they are paid to do. They want  to\r\n\r\npush their responsibility away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The police may use batons against the little\r\n\r\nchildren  who  put  up banners, posters  and  cartoons\r\n\r\ncriticizing the P.A.P. Government's educational policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Having seen the banners, posters and cartoons\r\n\r\nposted  on  the streets, in buses and in  schools,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. ruling  clique go mad and become desperate  and\r\n\r\nshameful.  Because  of  their  narrow-mindedness,  they\r\n\r\ncannot   stand   criticism  from  the   people.   They,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  find  a way out by taking  the  blame  from\r\n\r\ntheir   shoulders  and  putting  it  on  the  so-called\r\n\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The Government in moving this motion is not going\r\n\r\nto  protect  the  students, but to use a  baton  charge\r\n\r\nagainst  the  peaceful  and empty-handed  students  who\r\n\r\npicket  outside  the gates of all examination  centres.\r\n\r\nThe Government in moving this motion is threatening the\r\n\r\npeace-loving parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government might have thought that since\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  could approve a motion to  protect  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit  Panjang, who is  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education, therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  quite  appropriate  for this  Assembly  to  approve\r\n\r\nanother motion to protect the students. The purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis motion is not to protect the students, but to  use\r\n\r\nthe police force to suppress the students who are young\r\n\r\nand  innocent. We supported the motion to  protect  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit  Panjang  from  being  hindered   by\r\n\r\nhooligans.  These hooligans were not and could  not  be\r\n\r\nstudents.  As representatives of the people  and  above\r\n\r\nthe policemen, it is up to this Assembly to protect any\r\n\r\nMember of the Legislative Assembly, because there is no\r\n\r\none  who  has the power to protect him. The Government,\r\n\r\nin  moving  this motion, would make it appear, in  the\r\n\r\neyes  of the public, that the police force is not under\r\n\r\nthe control of the Government, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  control  of this Assembly.  It  would  also\r\n\r\nappear, in the eyes of the public, that the police have\r\n\r\nno power to maintain law and order which they, in fact,\r\n\r\nhave. In actual fact, the P.A.P. Government intends  to\r\n\r\nuse the police force to suppress the innocent students,\r\n\r\nbut  dare not do it on its own. It therefore asks  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to give power to the Government  to  use  the\r\n\r\npolice force against the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to advise the P.A.P. Government that the\r\n\r\nonly  way  to settle the student strike problem  is  by\r\n\r\npeaceful  means and negotiation and not by  force.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, or even the police itself, has the power to\r\n\r\ndeal with this matter. Why does the Government want  to\r\n\r\nbring  this  matter into the Assembly  and  ask  it  to\r\n\r\nauthorise the police to \"protect\" the students? What is\r\n\r\nthe  power  of the police and what is the duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment? Their duty is to maintain law and order. If\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government is unable to govern,  then  the\r\n\r\nonly way for them is to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention to bring this matter to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly is to turn this controversial  education\r\n\r\nissue  into  a political issue. The P.A.P. leaders  and\r\n\r\nall Members of this House must realise that it is safer\r\n\r\nto  look before they leap. The Government must not  use\r\n\r\nits  political  power to suppress the  known  political\r\n\r\nresentment of the students. These political powers  are\r\n\r\nnothing  but batons and tear gas. The P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis  trying  to  use  the  police against  the  peaceful\r\n\r\nstudent  strikers. The P.A.P. Government's proposal  to\r\n\r\nuse  the police against the empty-handed students  will\r\n\r\nnot help -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Yet\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  see anyone who has sat for the examination\r\n\r\nhaving  been  injured. But we can  see  young  men  who\r\n\r\nbehave  like  gangsters  trying  to  fight  the  little\r\n\r\nstudents.  These young men, all unidentified,  are  not\r\n\r\nstudents  or  parents. They break and force  their  way\r\n\r\nthrough in order to disperse the students. Sir, I  have\r\n\r\ntwo photos in the Mm Pao, dated 2nd December this year.\r\n\r\nThese  two  photos  show a few unidentified  young  men\r\n\r\ntrying  to  fight a group of little children  picketing\r\n\r\nnear the Ministry of Education. I ask the Government to\r\n\r\ninform this House who are those unidentified young men.\r\n\r\nThe Government should have no difficulty in identifying\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to advise the P.A.P. leaders that the\r\n\r\nsons  and  daughters of other people are the  sons  and\r\n\r\ndaughters of the State. They are innocent. The duty  of\r\n\r\nthe  government is to bring them up to serve the  State\r\n\r\nand not to crush them.

The duty  of\r\n\r\nthe Government is to govern the country. The Government\r\n\r\nmust  see  that  the rights and interests  of  all  the\r\n\r\npeople are protected. It must not rule the country  for\r\n\r\nsectional interests and in order to protect the  rights\r\n\r\nof the minority. The P.A.P.

Is it  not  clearly\r\n\r\nshown  that  what the P.A.P. claims to be  is  entirely\r\n\r\nfalse?  The  P.A.P.

This is especially important when marking their\r\n\r\nexamination papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Any proposal to change the educational system must\r\n\r\nbe  based  on equal treatment for the four  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Government should study and consider all\r\n\r\nreasonable requests stated in the memoranda sent to all\r\n\r\nAssemblymen by the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Government must accept the views and proposals\r\n\r\nsuggested by the various educational bodies which  know\r\n\r\nthe cause of the strike and know what is the meaning of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we fully understand the true motive of this motion\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. From the debate on the motion, we  have\r\n\r\nthe impression that the whole world is becoming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchaotic.   You  have  people  outside  the  examination\r\n\r\ncentres shouting and asking for a fight. The safety  of\r\n\r\nthose  students who are taking the examination is being\r\n\r\njeopardized. Therefore, the Government has to resort to\r\n\r\nthe  use of police to suppress such actions. But, as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  we  do not see such  incidents.  The\r\n\r\nactivities of the students, whether they are correct or\r\n\r\nnot, is another matter. But from any angle, we can  say\r\n\r\nthat  the use of police against students should not  be\r\n\r\nsupported.  We support the police in their  maintenance\r\n\r\nof   law  and  order.  But  we  resolutely  oppose  the\r\n\r\ninstruction to be given to the police against  students\r\n\r\nwho are helpless and unarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we can see from the newspapers today that the Minister for Education has announced that in the present situation, those who have not taken the\r\n\r\nexamination are only 927 in number. This only  goes  to\r\n\r\nshow  the  motive behind the motion of the  Government.\r\n\r\nAmong these 3,000 students, if there are only some  927\r\n\r\nwho  have not taken the examination, then they will not\r\n\r\nbe  prevented  at all. This goes to show  further  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no need to make use of the police to suppress\r\n\r\nthe so-called activities of the students. In short, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we feel that this motion is redundant. In\r\n\r\nthe  first  place, as seen from any angle,  the  motion\r\n\r\nshould  not  have been brought up by the Government  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  police  will be used against  the  students.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the safeguard for the people is  already  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of the police, and the Government  is  just\r\n\r\ntrying to shirk their duty and pass it on to the  other\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we resolutely oppose this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I  fully  support  the  motion  tabled  by   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nand amended by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that the Opposition - especially\r\n\r\nthe 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis - will allege that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. espouses the same policy as that of the\r\n\r\nS.P.A., because we know that they have double-edged\r\n\r\nprongs. They change the truth to something that is\r\n\r\nuntrue. However that may be, Sir, we have been taught a\r\n\r\nlesson that from childhood we should listen to what is\r\n\r\nbeing spoken but we should not pay attention to who is\r\n\r\nspeaking. In the interest 01 safeguarding democratic\r\n\r\npractice which we have here in our country, it is right\r\n\r\nthat every fighter of democracy should accept\r\n\r\nsuggestions and views of parents who do not want the\r\n\r\neducation of their children to be hindered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the boycott by the students, it is\r\n\r\nclear that it has nothing to do with the weakness of\r\n\r\nthe education policy. If it is viewed from the result\r\n\r\nthat two-thirds of the students have sat for the\r\n\r\nexaminations, it shows that the present education\r\n\r\npolicy is accepted by the majority of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nonsensical allegations have been made by the 13\r\n\r\nMembers of the Barisan Sosialis to the effect that the\r\n\r\nboycott was the result of our failure of our education\r\n\r\npolicy and its non-acceptance by the people. We wish to\r\n\r\nknow why, when they were with us in the Government,\r\n\r\nthey merely folded their arms and kept quiet? We also\r\n\r\nwish to know further the stand and attitude of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis towards Chinese education. It is the\r\n\r\ncustom and habit of undesirable elements to distort\r\n\r\nfacts. For instance, the Member for Thomson just now\r\n\r\ntried to make out that the Government would use the\r\n\r\npolice to suppress strikers. We should distinguish\r\n\r\nworkers from children. Our responsibility now should be\r\n\r\ncentred on those who are manipulating the misguided\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not forget the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the subversive elements who have\r\n\r\nsucceeded in influencing these young innocent children\r\n\r\nfor their own- political ends. They would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprefer to see the destruction of these children with a\r\n\r\nsmile, because, on their dead bodies, they can organise\r\n\r\nand achieve their aims. Nobody in his right senses\r\n\r\nwill believe that there are no evil men behind this\r\n\r\nboycott. I can bring up two incidents for this House to\r\n\r\nponder over very carefully. I am impressed by an\r\n\r\narticle written by Inche Gazali Bin Ismail, the ex-Secretary General of the Malay Students Union, which\r\n\r\nappeared in the Utusan Melayu of 1st September, 1961,\r\n\r\nunder the heading of how these pro-Communist elements\r\n\r\ntried to control or influence Malay students in 1955.\r\n\r\nThis article presented two special features\r\n\r\nconsecutively, but I am merely touching on the excerpts\r\n\r\nto show how these pro-Communist elements infiltrate not\r\n\r\nonly into Chinese middle schools but also in the Malay\r\n\r\nStudents Union. One of the excerpts exposes one of the\r\n\r\nmethods adopted by the Communist cadres to influence\r\n\r\nthe students, and that is by organising picnics and tea\r\n\r\nparties. Normally these functions are paid for by the\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements themselves through devious\r\n\r\nchannels. I will refer to another passage. A leader\r\n\r\nfrom the University Union - I wish to call him J - played\r\n\r\nan important part in the birth of a new movement\r\n\r\namongst Malay students. He helped to organise picnics\r\n\r\nfor Malay students. The cost was met from contributions\r\n\r\nby the Pan-Malayan Students Federation. In one of these\r\n\r\npicnics, students from Chinese middle schools\r\n\r\nparticipated. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these\r\n\r\nactivities by undesirable elements could only go on for\r\n\r\none year, and then in 1956 their attempts failed. This\r\n\r\nclearly goes to prove that these destructive elements\r\n\r\ncan influence not only the minds of Chinese school\r\n\r\nstudents but they also attempted to infiltrate into the\r\n\r\nMalay Students Union. Fortunately, their efforts failed\r\n\r\nmiserably. Subsequently I sincerely believe that these\r\n\r\nsame people tried to whip up communal sentiments among\r\n\r\nthe Chinese students who. I am quite sure, were pure in\r\n\r\ntheir minds and healthy in their thinking. I received\r\n\r\ntwo circulars issued by the Chinese middle school\r\n\r\nstudents throughout Singapore, one of which reads\r\n\r\n\"Students on strike\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten in the national language, with the intention of\r\n\r\nsparking off communal emotion. If there had been no\r\n\r\nevil men behind them, I am quite sure the students\r\n\r\nwould not have resorted to such tactics. I will read a\r\n\r\npassage from the contents:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are youths who love the national culture and\r\n\r\nnational language. We are the sons and soil of Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am merely reading short passages at random and these\r\n\r\ngo to show that they are fanning communal sentiments:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In order that the wishes of teachers and students be\r\n\r\nnot  subverted,  we swear on oath that we  will  become\r\n\r\nfighters to defend our national or racial education.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  ends  with \"Long live national education  and  long\r\n\r\nlive  Chinese  education!\",  thus  implying  that   the\r\n\r\npresent Government wants to kill Chinese education.  In\r\n\r\npoint of fact, our aim is to unify all the main streams\r\n\r\nof  education into one national education in  order  to\r\n\r\nbuild  one  united  Malayan nation.  These  people  who\r\n\r\nintentionally   and  deliberately  whip   up   communal\r\n\r\nfeelings  are very dangerous. We will oppose them  from\r\n\r\nwhatever quarter they come because, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we are in the process of building a united Malayan\r\n\r\nnation.  The contents of this circular are lengthy  and\r\n\r\nif   I   were   to   read  them,  it  might   lead   to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding among the various races. What is  even\r\n\r\nmore  strange  is that the circular on the  boycott  in\r\n\r\nChinese  schools is written -in Malay and it  is  being\r\n\r\ncirculated  among Malay students with  the  object,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   of  making  the  parents  adopt  a   communal\r\n\r\nattitude.  This  is  typical of the measures  taken  by\r\n\r\nthese  dangerous  elements.  The  object  is  to  cause\r\n\r\ncommunal  clashes which are very dangerous  indeed.  We\r\n\r\nmust  condemn these destructive elements who are trying\r\n\r\nto  get the various sections of the community to  fight\r\n\r\namongst themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must realise that the\r\n\r\nstudents  can  be  likened  to  white  cloth - clean  and\r\n\r\npure - and  it is up to us to change this cloth into  any\r\n\r\ncolour   we   like.  Therefore,  it   is   our   common\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to use the proper colour  to  suit  our\r\n\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard Members of this Assembly putting forward\r\n\r\ntheir views\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  opinions.  There are some who support  the  motion\r\n\r\nwhilst others oppose it. It is evident where they stand\r\n\r\nin  this  matter  and we know why they  adopt  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude. They cannot hide the facts. If some  of  them\r\n\r\ntry  to  hide  behind the skirts of school children,  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  13 Members in the Barisan  Sosialis  to\r\n\r\ndeclare their stand openly and in all sincerity. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough  for  them to challenge the  Government  by\r\n\r\nasking  them -to resign when they themselves  have  not\r\n\r\ngot the guts to go back to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us, this motion is one which seeks to reconcile\r\n\r\ndifferences and bring about happiness and prosperity in\r\n\r\nour community. It also seeks to uphold the principle of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  so  that democracy can be practised  in  the\r\n\r\ntrue  sense of the word. I wholeheartedly support  the\r\n\r\nmotion  moved  by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  I  think the  motion  tabled  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  absolutely  unnecessary.  In   today's\r\n\r\nChinese newspapers, including the Sin Chew Jit Poh  and\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang  Siang Pau, we can clearly see  that  many\r\n\r\neducational bodies have given their views on the motion\r\n\r\nwhich   we  are  debating  now.  The  newspapers   also\r\n\r\npublished  the views of the Singapore Teachers'  Union,\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang  Graduates' Association and its  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion,  and  the opinions of other educational  bodies.\r\n\r\nAll these organisations feel that it is unnecessary for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to use the police against the students,\r\n\r\nbut to handle the dispute peacefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these educational bodies, it was also\r\n\r\nreported in today's paper that yesterday 2,000  parents\r\n\r\nmet  in  the  Singapore Chinese High School Auditorium.\r\n\r\nThey also felt that the Government should not make  use\r\n\r\nof the police. The people in these organisations have a\r\n\r\nvery  close association with Chinese education But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not seem to hear their  opinions  and\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion that we are debating today, it is stated\r\n\r\nthat it is made in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponse to an appeal from parents of students who wish\r\n\r\nto  sit  for  the  examinations. We  want  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education this: if he is paying attention\r\n\r\nto  the demand of only a minority of the parents,  then\r\n\r\nwhy  should  he  not pay attention to the  opinions  of\r\n\r\n2,000  parents? Does it mean that the opinions of  some\r\n\r\n2,000  parents should be disregarded? The Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe   School   Teachers'   Association,   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Graduates' Association, and  the  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  of  Nanyang  University  were  established  long\r\n\r\nbefore the Barisan Sosialis was formed. I believe  they\r\n\r\nare  unwilling to allow any political Party to make use\r\n\r\nof  them  or  to embroil them in a political  war-pool.\r\n\r\nFrom  all this we can see that the Government  is  only\r\n\r\npaying attention to those opinions which are useful  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  and not to those views  and  opinions\r\n\r\nwhich  do  not  express agreement with the  Government.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, we have no reason whatsoever\r\n\r\nto  believe that the P.A.P. is a Party which values the\r\n\r\nopinions of the people in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have pointed out in :their speeches made\r\n\r\njust  now  the various reasons for opposing the  motion\r\n\r\ntabled by the Government. I do not wish to repeat  what\r\n\r\nthey have said, but I would like to point out here that\r\n\r\nthe students' boycott has come about as a result of the\r\n\r\neducation  policy of the Government. The  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to  use  the  police  against  students  and\r\n\r\nparents cannot solve the problem of the mishandling  by\r\n\r\nthe Government of its education policy. I would like to\r\n\r\nstress  again  that  all  the  educational  bodies  and\r\n\r\norganisations  have suggested to the  Government  many practical methods of how the present situation could be\r\n\r\nhandled.  In  today's  papers,  as  I  have  said,  the\r\n\r\norganisations I have mentioned have sincerely suggested\r\n\r\nhow the Government should handle the situation and what\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should do about it. I believe  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  accept  the  opinions   and   act\r\n\r\naccording to the suggestions, then that would  be  much\r\n\r\nbetter   than   resorting  to  the  police.   But   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, instead of acting on the opinions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  educational organisations, has  come  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and brought up this motion. This shows that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention  is  to  try  and  change  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  education into a political one.  We  feel\r\n\r\nthat  since  the  Government's  education  policy   has\r\n\r\nbrought  about  these incidents, we in  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  no  reason  whatsoever why  we  should  bear  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organisations I have mentioned just now have been\r\n\r\nin  existence for a long time. Some have existed for  a\r\n\r\nyear,  and others for seven or eight years. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, if it is sincere in valuing the opinions of\r\n\r\nthe people, should have won these organisations over to\r\n\r\nits  side. So to say that these organisations have been\r\n\r\nwon over by the Barisan Sosialis and are being made use\r\n\r\nof by them would be wrong, because the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ncame into existence only three months ago. And it would\r\n\r\nbe  nonsensical  to say that it is impossible  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in the course of two years,  to  win  over\r\n\r\nthese  organisations. If it is correct to say  that  we\r\n\r\ncan win over these organisations in the course of three\r\n\r\nmonths, then we can see clearly that the government has\r\n\r\nmade a mistake in its education policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon has\r\n\r\nbeen  saying that the Government's education policy  is\r\n\r\nmistaken.

They  say  that the motion  approved  last\r\n\r\nFriday is aimed at protecting a Member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nRegarding  this,  we must clearly point  out  that  the\r\n\r\nmotion  passed by this House last Friday  is  basically\r\n\r\ndifferent from the present motion we are debating  now.\r\n\r\nThe  motion  passed  last Friday  in  this  House  only\r\n\r\nallowed  the police to protect Members of the Assembly,\r\n\r\nbut did not allow the police to take action against the\r\n\r\nstudents.   What   we  contended  was   that   if   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary concerned had been  obstructed\r\n\r\nby the hooligans, then we should condemn the hooligans.\r\n\r\nWe  never  contended  that  young  students  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  hooligans. This  is  a  very  important\r\n\r\ndifference.  The  motion we are debating  now  is  very\r\n\r\nclear,  that is, the police must be made use of against\r\n\r\nstudent  picketers who are doing their duty peacefully.\r\n\r\nI   feel  that  the  Government  and  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should not consider students as hooligans. If\r\n\r\nit does, and if the Minister should do so, then he will\r\n\r\nnot be fit to administer our education system, and this\r\n\r\nGovernment will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe able to handle the education problem properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question I would like to ask is this: cannot\r\n\r\nthe  present situation be avoided? In other  words,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education has handled  this  question\r\n\r\nproperly,  could  this situation  be  avoided?  I  have\r\n\r\nalready pointed out that if the Government had accepted\r\n\r\nthe  opinions  given by the educational bodies,  then\r\n\r\nthe  unpleasant events and the question  of  using  the\r\n\r\npolice could have been easily avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  motion  today is basically clear in this  respect.\r\n\r\nThere   is   a  minority  of  opportunistic   political\r\n\r\nadventurers,  especially  my  friends  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.

They have exaggerated the number\r\n\r\nof the so-called parents in the Chinese High School. At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, they have deliberately  neglected  the\r\n\r\nfact that there were 2,000 parents of students who took\r\n\r\npart in the examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, they wanted to put the blame on the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education and on the Government.

With regard to the second part of  the\r\n\r\nmotion,  he  was  in doubt. He said he doubted  whether\r\n\r\nthere should be such a motion, that is, the second part\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said that we, the Government,\r\n\r\ntried   to   shirk   our  responsibility.   The   Party\r\n\r\nrepresented by the Member for Cairnhill asked: why  did the  Government make use of its authority  to  use  the police  to  protect  the students?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, before  I  make any reply to their criticisms,  I  must point  out  the fact that this was before the  13  ex-P.A.P. colleagues left the P.A.P. The ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education said, \"When  I\r\n\r\nwas  in  the Party, there was no trouble. When I  left,\r\n\r\nthere  was  trouble.\" This goes to show that all  these\r\n\r\ntroubles  have been created after they left the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWe  can all learn from the newspapers that before  the 13  Members  left  the P.A.P., we had  a  Party  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  which the Member for Queenstown  and  I\r\n\r\nwere   the   Secretaries.  We  received  a   memorandum\r\n\r\nsubmitted by the 51 Branches. We also received  a  very\r\n\r\nlong  memorandum submitted by the Member for Serangoon.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can remember, in all these memoranda, there\r\n\r\nwas  not a word mentioned that the education policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was wrong. If the P.A.P. education  policy\r\n\r\nwas  wrong,  then  the 13 Members, especially  the  ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education,\r\n\r\nshould  have pointed this out to the Committee at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  He  should have pointed out that  the  education\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government was wrong, so as to avoid the\r\n\r\nunpleasant  incident that we have today. However,  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  mention a word about this matter.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nfrom  all the designs we can get from the organ of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, and from the attitude of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis Members, we  know  who  are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  manipulated the boycott of  the  students.\r\n\r\nEveryone  knows  that the eyes of the people  are  very\r\n\r\nclear.  They  will  not  be  deceived  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members who pass off the eyes of the  fish  as\r\n\r\npearls.  Why  did  they  not  point  this  out  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee? When they left the P.A.P., they created  all\r\n\r\nthis trouble to embarrass the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see from the newspapers that those who\r\n\r\ntook part in the examinations were in the majority.  We\r\n\r\nhave  also  seen  that parents were  insulted  by  the\r\n\r\nstudent  picketers. If any Member in this House  is  in\r\n\r\ndoubt as to whether these parents have been instigated\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P., or that they are nonexistent, we have  a\r\n\r\nsigned  document to prove this.

I\r\n\r\nwant  to ask them whether they can submit the names  of\r\n\r\nthese  2,000  parents. On our part, we are  willing  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  the names of the parents as well as the pupils\r\n\r\nwho  sat  for the examinations. We do not want to  drag\r\n\r\nall  the  people together and brand them as parents  of\r\n\r\nthe  students. The facts have proved that the  majority\r\n\r\nof the pupils sat for examinations and there was only a\r\n\r\nminority  of  students who have prevented  pupils  from\r\n\r\ntaking   their   examinations.   We   think   that   as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people, we  have  the  duty  to\r\n\r\npersuade this small number of pupils not to do such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoolish  things, because in a democratic  country,  any\r\n\r\nperson  has the right to sit for an examination and  he\r\n\r\ncannot  be denied this freedom. If we know this  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  democratic system, then it should  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nminority    should    follow   the    majority.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the Member for Queenstown  congratulated\r\n\r\nthis  small  number of pupils. But does he  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  his  congratulations will embolden the pupils  to\r\n\r\nflout  the law of the country and make them more daring\r\n\r\nto commit unreasonable actions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Members have said just now that all those\r\n\r\npupils  who boycotted the examinations were  picketing\r\n\r\npeacefully.  If their picketing were peaceful,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  it would not be necessary to table this  motion.\r\n\r\nBut in our view peaceful picketing should not mean that\r\n\r\nthe pupils should form a human chain and link arms.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I know, when the representatives of the pupils\r\n\r\ncame  to see me, they had already used every method  to\r\n\r\nconvene  protest meetings in the school. They had  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  persuade  the pupils not  to  sit  for  the\r\n\r\nexaminations, but their efforts had failed.  Then  they\r\n\r\nresorted   to  this  unreasonable  action.   If   their\r\n\r\npicketing  were peaceful, then it would not  have  been\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to use the police,  because  when  a\r\n\r\npupil  went  to  sit for the examination,  they  should\r\n\r\nconvince  him  and not - as reported in  the  paper  - use\r\n\r\nforce.

Are  they  any  different  from  the\r\n\r\nhooligans?\"  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we must  not  cover  up\r\n\r\neverything.   We   must  not  think   that   by   using\r\n\r\nunreasonable arguments, we can convince the people. All\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  gone  through this  experience  know\r\n\r\nwhether the attitude of the student picketers is right.\r\n\r\nI do not blame these student picketers because they are\r\n\r\nyoung  and  easily manipulated. Therefore, I hope  they\r\n\r\nwill ponder over what they have done. They should learn\r\n\r\nthat   they  should  not  be  made  use  of   by   evil\r\n\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened very carefully to the ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education when he  spoke.\r\n\r\nI  have not been in the Ministry of Education for long.\r\n\r\nI have been there for only two or three months now. The\r\n\r\nex-Parliamentary   Secretary  to   the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  was in the Ministry of Education  for  quite\r\n\r\nsometime  before me. Our Minister for  Education  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  frank  man.  He  knows that he  is  not  Chinese-educated,  and therefore on matters concerning  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation,   he   always  consults  his   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary. It was with surprise that I heard  the  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nsay  that the Government did not listen to the opinions\r\n\r\nof  education  bodies. It will be remembered  that  the\r\n\r\ndecision on the 4:2 system was taken after we have  had\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with the Committee of the  Chinese  School\r\n\r\nTeachers  Association. We have  been  accused  that  we\r\n\r\nforced  the principals of Chinese schools to adopt  the\r\n\r\n4:2 system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is an insult to the principals of Chinese schools\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Only God knows whether any principal of a\r\n\r\nChinese secondary school can be so easily deceived.  If\r\n\r\nthis is so, then what kind of a world is this going  to\r\n\r\nbe?  All  people in the educational field can  remember\r\n\r\nthe  attitude of the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education towards teachers and principals\r\n\r\nYet  he  dares to say that we force the Chinese  School\r\n\r\nManagement Committees to accept our proposal.  This  is\r\n\r\nan  insult  to  the  Committee of  the  Chinese  School\r\n\r\nTeachers  Association.  He  was  in  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation for two years and he knew very well what  the\r\n\r\n4:2  system was all about. But now he wants to  distort\r\n\r\nthe facts by saying that we want to make use of the 4:2\r\n\r\nsystem  to lower the standard of Chinese education.  It\r\n\r\nis  mentioned in the Paper that when the students  pass\r\n\r\nthe   examination   after   the   four-year   secondary\r\n\r\neducation, they will be promoted to the upper secondary\r\n\r\nclasses for two years. How can it be four years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said the Prime Minister made a very\r\n\r\nbig mistake because, on Teachers Day, he announced that\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the 3:3 or 4:2  system  could  be\r\n\r\ndecided by the educationists. If it is wrong to  decide\r\n\r\nthe  question by a majority, then I do  not  know  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also said that we wanted to buy over\r\n\r\nthe  students  with  money. Does it  mean  that  he  is\r\n\r\nopposed  to  the giving of aid and assistance  to  poor\r\n\r\npupils  to  enable  them to take up further  education?\r\n\r\nDoes he think that this is wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim said that the Government is\r\n\r\nshirking its responsibility. He wanted to know why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment did not want to exercise the right  that  it\r\n\r\nhas,  but  came instead to this Assembly to ask  for  a\r\n\r\nmandate  to  be  given  to them.  The  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are  contradictory in their  speeches.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim  and other Members  accuse  the'\r\n\r\nGovernment of being dictatorial. But now the Government\r\n\r\nis   not   willing   to  use  force.   Is   this   not\r\n\r\ncontradictory?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that when dealing with adult gangsters and\r\n\r\ncriminals we should use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  power.  But these are innocent and  young  middle\r\n\r\nschool  pupils  who are being made  use  of  by  other\r\n\r\npeople. We know the people behind the scenes who  want\r\n\r\nto  make use of them, to drive them into a clash  with\r\n\r\nthe  police  so as to create unrest in Singapore  with\r\n\r\nthe   object   of  getting  everyone  to  oppose   the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the merger question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another important matter. The Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  asked why we should make use of the  police\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Secondary IV examination was completed.  My\r\n\r\nanswer  is very simple. Today we have heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education that he was obstructed  by  the\r\n\r\npicketers  from going to his office. What  kind  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry  is  this  going to be? This  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\ninstigation of the Barisan Sosialis Members who incite\r\n\r\nthe  students  to trouble. Not only do these  students\r\n\r\nhave  no respect for their teachers but they also have\r\n\r\nno  respect  for  Ministers. This is the  aim  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for our tabling this motion is this. The\r\n\r\nexamination is in progress, and the Senior Middle  III\r\n\r\nExamination will be held on Friday. I do not need  any\r\n\r\ninformation from the Special Branch to know that  many\r\n\r\npupils  have been humiliated. They are disgusted  with\r\n\r\nthe  student  picketers and they are willing  to  give\r\n\r\ninformation to us. We have information that the Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle III students will boycott the examination. I am\r\n\r\nin the dark as to the reason for this boycott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Changi implied that the\r\n\r\nSenior  Middle III students also want to  boycott  the\r\n\r\nexamination.  This  seems to  be  connected  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  I feel strange  that  ten  minutes\r\n\r\nafter  the  motion  was passed in  the  Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nstudents who beleaguered me dispersed, and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  said  today that the  Senior  Middle  III\r\n\r\nstudents wanted to boycott the examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point is that the\r\n\r\nintention  of our motion is not to use the  police  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  the unarmed students. If we make a  detailed\r\n\r\nstudy  of  the motion, we will see that our motion  is\r\n\r\nintended to ask for police protection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the parents and the pupils, if the  pupils\r\n\r\nwho  boycotted the examination could carry  out  their\r\n\r\npicketing  peacefully, then there  would  not  be  any\r\n\r\nincidents or clashes with the police. Therefore,  what\r\n\r\nwe  feel  very  bitter about is that a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  deliberately  distorted  the   word\r\n\r\n\"protection\" into \"suppression\". Is this not something\r\n\r\nto provoke the pupils?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Upper Serangoon said that the\r\n\r\nChinese   School  Teachers'  Union  and  the   Chinese\r\n\r\nCommittee  Teachers' Association  had  suggested  many\r\n\r\nproposals.  But up to now we have still  not  received\r\n\r\nany  formal  letters from these organisations.  If  we\r\n\r\nfollow  what  is  reported in the newspapers,  it  can\r\n\r\nhappen that the reports in the papers may be wrong. If\r\n\r\nany  organisation has any views to submit,  it  should\r\n\r\nsubmit  them  to us in writing. We cannot  follow  the\r\n\r\npapers blindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I want to tell the House. Last\r\n\r\nnight,  the  Chairman of the Chinese School  Committee\r\n\r\nTeachers' Association (Mr Ko Teck Kin) rang me up and\r\n\r\nsaid  that he was under pressure from certain  people.\r\n\r\nHe  said, \"Everyday they give me trouble. They want me\r\n\r\nto  give a public statement. What must I do?\". I  told\r\n\r\nhim, \"It is very simple. You can say to them that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  School  Committee Teachers'  Association  has\r\n\r\ncome   to  an  understanding  with  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.\"  He  said, \"It is not as simple  as  that.\r\n\r\nThey  come  to  me everyday.\" As regards  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nSchool  Teachers' Union whose Chairman is Mr Lim  Sek\r\n\r\nKian,  you will remember it was reported in the papers\r\n\r\nthat that Union wanted to convene a meeting to discuss\r\n\r\nthe problem of the student boycott and the problem  of\r\n\r\nreform.  But on the following day, we did not see  any\r\n\r\nresolution made by the Association. We could only  see\r\n\r\nthe statement made by the Chairman. We want to ask Mr\r\n\r\nLim Sek Kian whether his statement was approved by all\r\n\r\nthe Members.
