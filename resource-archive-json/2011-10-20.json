The figures that\r\nwere cited were between $100 million and $200 million, depending\r\non how long it goes on and what facilities are affected. So, I would\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether the Government has an estimate\r\nof how much has been lost so far, in dollar terms, to the economy\r\nin terms of output. Second question, Sir, is: there are obviously\r\nSingaporeans working in Shell and Singapore businesses supplying\r\nservices to the Shell operations. Given that these livelihoods are\r\naffected, how is the Government working with Shell to ensure that\r\nthe operations come up online and in the safest way possible?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-5deaeb3f-c9a8-436e-a6a4-8fc1d51a4b09\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-5deaeb3f-c9a8-436e-a6a4-8fc1d51a4b09\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-45235a12-639a-475d-9a21-12224c48f256\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-45235a12-639a-475d-9a21-12224c48f256\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr S Iswaran</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I thank\r\nthe Member for the supplementary questions. Let me take the second\r\npoint first. As far as the coordination of the recovery effort is\r\nconcerned, there are two aspects to this: one is the fire safety\r\nand technical aspects, which we will address subsequently in another\r\nParliamentary Question. As far as the economic aspects are concerned\r\n\u2013 because this is part of an integrated value-chain for us \u2013 EDB\r\nis working very closely with Shell and with the downstream companies\r\nthat rely on some of the products in order to ensure that there\r\nis a smooth transition. I think, in the first instance, the key\r\npoint is that there are feedstock supplies. So, in other words,\r\nthere are inventories that can support the activities. So, a lot\r\nof the measurement of the outcome or the impact will really depend\r\non how smoothly and quickly Shell can restart its operations. So, when\r\nthe Member refers to private sector estimates, well, it really depends\r\non the assumptions on which they rely. As of now, the Government's estimation\r\nis that the impact would be minimal but we are reluctant to put\r\nan actual dollar value until we know the exact duration and rate\r\nof response in recovery.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3ae882ba-7ff4-412b-9820-72da872abce1\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-3ae882ba-7ff4-412b-9820-72da872abce1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 339</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-443db03d-b749-411f-a1e6-77cc5af751d1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-443db03d-b749-411f-a1e6-77cc5af751d1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, thank\r\nyou and just one more supplementary question.

So, in that 12-year period, 1,026 full-time National Servicemen\r\nwere disrupted for medical studies, 902 locally and 124 overseas.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 342</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e9493d1f-5444-4047-a6cb-0b31d2d63f09\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-663f7579-e5e8-4aa1-993d-9156ee3aa1f2__id-e9493d1f-5444-4047-a6cb-0b31d2d63f09\"><!--a--></a>MINDEF granted disruption\r\nso long as the medical degree was recognised by the Singapore Medical\r\nCouncil.

As I said in my reply, MINDEF is acutely aware that\r\nin order for NS policies to be successful, to have buy-in from the general\r\npublic, equity of treatment for NS must remain a cardinal principle.\r\nAnd we do it through a variety of ways, some explicit policy which\r\nmeans that, in this case, for disruption of medical studies, because\r\nit is in that sense a different treatment for a select group of\r\nmedical undergraduates, because SAF needs medical doctors, to make\r\nsure that the criteria are upfront and explicit. To the extent possible,\r\nwe list them. For instance, we said that they must produce documentary\r\nproof for admission to a medical school recognised by the SMC. In\r\nthe case of the US policy where we allow overseas medical studies,\r\nwe said that the pre-medical course does not lead to any other professional\r\ndegrees such as engineering or accountancy, they must furnish documentary\r\nproof from the University and that the pre-medical course leads\r\nto a medical degree. Where it is possible, we explicitly state so.\r\nThen there are signalling mechanisms. Our commanders understand\r\nthat if you do not uphold this principle of equity, you are going\r\nto undermine your authority because people think that if I have connections\r\nand I have preferential treatment, it is going to be very hard to\r\nbe able to train men as a group or make them feel committed to serve\r\nNS.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 345</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-43f8b0ac-3a52-45ea-984e-c78ffc2de8ad\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-663f7579-e5e8-4aa1-993d-9156ee3aa1f2__id-43f8b0ac-3a52-45ea-984e-c78ffc2de8ad\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I want to assure Members\r\nthat MINDEF understands this.

We understand that, but I think, overall,\r\nwe deal with it on a day-to-day basis, and we tell our commanders\r\nto make sure that when they apply a policy, they give good reasons\r\nwhy it is applied, maintain the principle of equity and lead by\r\nexample.

The more the world\r\naround us shifts and tilts, the more we need to be firmly anchored\r\nto a set of core values and to develop a quiet and well-founded\r\nconfidence about oneself and our nation. We will strengthen the\r\nemphasis on values and character development. MOE has brought together\r\nthe various content and skills to be learnt in National Education,\r\nCo-Curricular Activities, Civics and Moral Education under a Character\r\nand Citizenship Education (CCE) framework. We will work with schools\r\nto co-create a new CCE curriculum, comprising a national curriculum\r\ncomplemented by school-initiated programmes. This partnership is\r\nimportant because CCE is not something to be taught, but lived as\r\npart of the routine of everyday life in school.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-011af058-575e-4f35-8157-279c32a2bc85\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-011af058-575e-4f35-8157-279c32a2bc85\"><!--a--></a>We have increased curriculum\r\ntime for PE by between half an hour to an hour across all levels.\r\nWe have put in place new programmes such as the Programmes for Active Learning\r\n(PAL) for Primary 1 and 2 students which offer learning experiences\r\nthat are active, hands-on, meaningful and fun. Beyond the curriculum\r\nand programmes, we need the steady guiding hand of our teachers.\r\nIn recent years, schools have placed greater emphasis on helping\r\nstudents acquire social-emotional competencies, largely through\r\nthe pastoral role played by teachers, especially form teachers.\r\nAt the primary level, schools have put in place the Form Teacher\r\nGuidance Period which provides dedicated time within the curriculum\r\nfor form teachers to form positive relationships with their students.\r\nAt both the primary and secondary levels, we have advocated having\r\na constant form or co-form teacher with a class for two years to\r\nguide their social-emotional learning.

A good school is \"one\r\nthat caters to the needs of the students well, given the diversity\r\nof students that cannot be a single ruler to measure success. A good\r\nschool needs to know who the students are at the point of entry,\r\nstudy their strengths and needs, states what you like them to become\r\nwhen they leave the school, then exercises diligence and imagination\r\nto get there. A good school creates a positive experience for each\r\nstudent, allowing him to acquire the basics, but more importantly, making\r\nhim a confident and lifelong learner. It provides a supportive and\r\nappreciative environment\r\nfor teachers to experience the joy in impacting lives.

Many provide the opportunities which\r\nthe homes are less well-able to afford, be it the chance to play\r\nsports or musical instruments or to learn dancing. No two schools\r\nare identical.

My appeal is that these areas\r\nfor sports, music and dancing be areas where the students are not assessed\r\nand where they can cultivate and nurture into their own selves and\r\nwithin their own interests. When I was in school, I took part in\r\nfour different types of sports and I did not need to be in the school\r\nteam for them.

Indeed, I agree with him.\r\nFirst, let me say that the competition in our CCAs, the competition\r\nin sports and allowing students to do their best is not a bad thing.\r\nIt teaches value of striving for excellence. It teaches value of\r\nbeing gracious, in victory and in persevering in defeat. Therefore,\r\nthere will be a range of sports and other activities where there\r\nwill be a competitive element. Having said that, I fully agree with\r\nhim that in sports and other areas of music, arts and other areas\r\nof CCA development, there is scope for us to encourage greater participation,\r\nwhich is why during my workplan seminar speech, I also addressed\r\nthis issue that the Ministry will be reviewing the system of assessing\r\nstudents' participation in CCA, moving it towards a focus on participation\r\nrather than just achievements. I have also announced a review of\r\nSchool Excellence model.

In the subject of high-stake examinations\r\nand stress, I fully empathise with the parents and students. I know that\r\nmany working moms take leave during these high-stake examinations\r\nto help their children, and dads, too! Many of us have gone through\r\nexaminations and gone through the stresses of high-stake examinations.\r\nIndeed, in our meetings with parents, many have given us the feedback\r\non the issue of high-stake examinations and stress. We have given\r\nit much thought and I have had many discussions with our school\r\nleaders, and I have also spoken on this during the workplan seminar.\r\nLet me restate a few points.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-746b41c3-d9b1-4357-9d3a-7eea82b5b17f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-746b41c3-d9b1-4357-9d3a-7eea82b5b17f\"><!--a--></a>First, the reason why we\r\nput the focus on student-centric holistic education is to recognise\r\nthat each student is different, has different strengths and therefore\r\nit is important for us to develop those strengths. Indeed, our education\r\nsystem has over the years been moving in that direction. On the\r\nexaminations, let me say that if you are doing badly in examinations,\r\nit is no longer like you are missing the last train, as it was during\r\nour generation. Then, when resources were much more limited, the\r\nsystem therefore had to be more broad brushed. Indeed doing badly\r\nin the key high-stake examinations may mean a big difference in\r\none's life. But, over the years, successive changes have been made\r\nin our education system to provide a variety of pathways: whether\r\nit is going to the ITE, the polytechnics or the universities, or\r\neven across the different parts of our system. For example, in the\r\nNormal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams there are different\r\ntypes of courses which students can take, even at a higher level,\r\ntransfers between the different streams, whether it is Express,\r\nNormal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) are available. Therefore,\r\nthe system has many more bridges and ladders.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2b1d0f8e-4ff7-459d-92fc-341a7928f1aa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-2b1d0f8e-4ff7-459d-92fc-341a7928f1aa\"><!--a--></a>There will be more places\r\nat the universities, more pathways which the Minister of State Lawrence\r\nWong is currently reviewing. To reduce some of these high-stake examinations,\r\nadmission into secondary school, for instance, has been changed\r\nwith the DSA. And so, a percentage of students can be admitted on\r\nthe basis of their strengths. The universities and polytechnics\r\ntoo have the flexibility to look beyond examination results. So,\r\nwhen you look at the totality of those changes, there are indeed many\r\nmore pathways that allow our students to develop at their pace,\r\nand I would encourage parents and students to develop at an appropriate\r\npath and take advantage of what we have in the system.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2a90266a-63b3-4c2e-a498-4c423cb33c87\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-2a90266a-63b3-4c2e-a498-4c423cb33c87\"><!--a--></a>Let me also say that the\r\nparents whom I have met and the feedback that had been given is\r\nthat nobody has suggested abolishing examinations. Examinations\r\nwell done serve an important purpose which is it assesses the extent\r\nof learning and allows teachers and parents to gauge the extent\r\nof that learning. As a result of this, we have a rigorous system.\r\nHaving said that, I have also been studying the experiences of other countries.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 350</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1cb8f24-d710-48ab-9a1d-712cdaf2822c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-a1cb8f24-d710-48ab-9a1d-712cdaf2822c\"><!--a--></a>When I was in Japan a few months back,\r\nI looked at what Japan was doing. They had, because of the stress\r\nin the system, also reduced the curriculum content a few years back.\r\nBut within a few short years, standards had fallen so significantly\r\nthat they had to reverse course. The principals and teachers, whom\r\nI spoke to when I visited the schools, told me that the text books\r\nhave become even thicker and because they had made the change so\r\nquickly, teaching resources have been reduced and the teachers and principals\r\nare facing greater stress.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a0dc5733-a6a7-4438-ad82-a9db3d8a3bfa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-a0dc5733-a6a7-4438-ad82-a9db3d8a3bfa\"><!--a--></a>I also had many interactions\r\nwith my counterparts from the advanced countries, seeking to learn\r\nfrom them but they were seeking to learn from us. They asked me\r\ntime and again how do we maintain standards, how do we have such\r\na rigorous system. And in many other countries, they are looking\r\nat how they can raise the rigour and achievements of their students.\r\nAnd if you look at many of the reports, whether it is in Europe\r\nor US, you will see many of that. So, what I like to reiterate is\r\nthat I think we have a rigorous high-quality system, which should\r\nencourage and motivate our children to succeed to reach the standards\r\nbut at the same time recognise that each student, each child is\r\ndifferent and there are multiple pathways for us to develop them.\r\nThe system has changed a lot over the years. Nevertheless, I would\r\nsay that ours is not a perfect system and that the Ministry will\r\ncontinue to study ways to improve this. In my reply earlier, I mentioned\r\nabout how teams of Ministry officials have been hard at work looking\r\nat various key issues and this is one of those issues that we will\r\nbe looking at.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-09c368e2-7f49-48f0-9c75-5f32405e4dd8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-09c368e2-7f49-48f0-9c75-5f32405e4dd8\"><!--a--></a>Let me end by saying that\r\neducation is a long-term endeavour and whatever changes we make,\r\nlet us recognise that we have a high quality, strong system. Whatever\r\nchanges we make, let us do it systematically, thoughtfully and not\r\nbe rushed into doing the wrong thing because the consequences would\r\nbe hard to reverse. And the key focus for us in the coming years\r\nis this: Student-centric values driven education because that is really\r\nat the core of education. When we get that right, many parts of\r\nit will be right and I am just continuing the very good work that\r\nhas been done by my predecessors to move the system. If you look\r\nat the system, over the years, it has changed very significantly and\r\nlet us build on this and continue to evolve the system. I would\r\nalso like to appeal to parents to continue to work with our schools,\r\nwork with our teachers to bring out the best in every child.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-991b1027-a76d-46c7-8520-cc56850ac451\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-991b1027-a76d-46c7-8520-cc56850ac451\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e6f01971-9801-4cfa-b2a1-7ed16788bb35\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-e6f01971-9801-4cfa-b2a1-7ed16788bb35\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Yee Jenn Jong,\r\nlast question.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ebbca56a-df90-4ffb-bccb-643fcedb995a\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-ebbca56a-df90-4ffb-bccb-643fcedb995a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9bcd7481-71d2-48c1-a10f-e1560ee66b4a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-9bcd7481-71d2-48c1-a10f-e1560ee66b4a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nThank you to the Minister for clarifying.

I was looking for\r\nthe paragraph, and I have found it. Dr Patrick Tan served as a Laboratory\r\nOfficer in one of the SAF's combat support hospitals. This is a\r\nstandard designation in the combat support hospital.

Countries have different\r\napproaches and schemes towards private property ownership and management\r\nbecause of their different circumstances and history. We have forged\r\nour way just as Australia has forged its own way, for years. Policies\r\nare never static. As I said, we keep a close watch over the situation\r\nand it is not just watching over the property market. As I have\r\nexplained yesterday, while I need to make adjustments to housing policies,\r\neven more important is to make sure our adjustments do not unwittingly damage,\r\ndo harm to our economy and our society because at the end of the\r\nday they are all interlinked. So, it is a gingerly act of balancing\r\nand making trade-offs. It does require some skill and hopefully\r\nsome wisdom. I try to impart some into this whole transaction. So,\r\nthe bottom line is: we are watching the situation closely. Remember\r\nthe larger equation is beyond me \u2013 what is happening to Europe,\r\nwhat will happen next or this weekend when G20 leaders meet and\r\nwhat will they agree on, etc. Unfortunately, all these larger equations\r\ndo impact us and we have to be watchful.

I think that would be quite impossible.\r\nEven if you are able to project to such precision, that also cannot\r\nbe the way we do things because when we design the housing estate\r\n\u2013 let us say in existing Tampines \u2013 we have to know what is the\r\ncurrent housing distribution in Tampines and take that into account.\r\nBut as I said, regardless of the different application rates, at\r\nthe end of the day, no units get wasted.

He mentioned an article published\r\nin the <em class=\"ph i\">Straits Times</em> yesterday on issues that SMEs face.\r\nI happened to be the adviser for that group, the Association of\r\nSMEs (ASME), and have worked closely with a number of the ASME's\r\nbusiness leaders in the last few months. There are more pressing\r\nissues that SMEs face today than GLCs. In fact, competition comes\r\nin all forms, even MNCs would have the skills to offer cheaper prices.\r\nOther SMEs, because businesses in certain tiers, find it hard to\r\ndifferentiate as well. For example, in the real estate and construction sectors,\r\nthe competition from low-cost Chinese construction companies is\r\ntough. The issue of business is a practical one \u2013 profitability,\r\nhuman resources, costs of doing business. So, let us not try to\r\npoliticise the issue by targeting the GLCs and cooperatives and\r\nfocus on the real issues if you are truly interested in helping\r\nthe SMEs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-338b2ca6-19c9-4af2-a920-7c337cd08843\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-338b2ca6-19c9-4af2-a920-7c337cd08843\"><!--a--></a>In fact, one of the major\r\nissues they face today is the lack of manpower and high cost of\r\nbusiness due to the tighter quotas on foreign workers, the levies\r\nimposed on Work Permit holders and the higher wage criteria for\r\n\"S\" Passes. And I certainly agree that we have to level the playing\r\nfield for our workers, as mentioned in my Malay speech earlier. But\r\nif you speak to business leaders, as a result of some of these policies,\r\nsome have slowed growth plans, which means fewer jobs for locals.\r\nSome are thinking of relocating, which also means even fewer jobs\r\nfor locals. Some already moved part of their operations overseas\r\nwhere labour is less restrictive and usually at lower cost. So,\r\nI think MOM and MTI have a tough job ahead trying to balance this\r\n\u2013 the interests of our local workers, while trying to retain companies\r\nhere \u2013 locals as well as MNCs. And I am aware a number of MNCs have\r\nalso considered the same and a number have sought assurances from\r\nthe Government that we will continue to foster a favourable business environment. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f3ef0673-6138-40b8-9e1d-d8d986fdf0f6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-f3ef0673-6138-40b8-9e1d-d8d986fdf0f6\"><!--a--></a>So, Workers' Party members,\r\nMr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Yaw Shin Leong, are contradicting each other.\r\nMr Yee is concerned for the SMEs interests, while Mr Yaw would like\r\nfurther restrictions to foreign workers in addition to what the\r\nGovernment has put in place. I have not heard how Workers' Party\r\ncan assure SMEs and businesses in turn that Singapore is a place\r\nwhere their business can flourish and not be viewed as restrictive.\r\nLet us not forget the reality that businessmen are all practical\r\npeople and companies have options to relocate and what that means\r\nis lost jobs for Singapore. I fear for the jobs of Singaporeans\r\nbecause SMEs employ about 60% of the Singapore workforce.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a6dc786e-9f03-4db2-8f55-7688632b202a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-a6dc786e-9f03-4db2-8f55-7688632b202a\"><!--a--></a>But I do agree with Mr Yee\r\nthat many SMEs are struggling because of the high costs of doing\r\nbusiness here. As Minister of State Teo Ser Luck also mentioned\r\nthat there is no lack of grants but, in addition to the higher costs,\r\nmany are finding it hard to benefit from our productivity measures\r\nbecause of inherent weaknesses in being smaller in size.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 361</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d5c4bac6-b976-413c-8857-930f086523b4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-d5c4bac6-b976-413c-8857-930f086523b4\"><!--a--></a>I believe that SMEs also need a collective\r\nvoice so that they can be proactive like the larger companies to\r\nvoice the concerns of the sector more effectively, rather than individual,\r\nfragmented viewpoints. Their interests are varied because this segment\r\nis diverse, but they can focus on the major areas that the Government\r\ncan help and level the playing field.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-33f3c2dc-c775-43c4-bc26-4fb96759d3b8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-33f3c2dc-c775-43c4-bc26-4fb96759d3b8\"><!--a--></a>The next gap I see is that\r\nmany have no skills, no HR functions, no CFO functions, so many\r\nare not able to cope with changes or benefit from Government measures\r\nor productivity the same way the bigger firms can.

This is something that the Government needs to come\r\nto terms with, especially in these times of the \"Jasmine Revolution\",\r\nthe \"Arab Spring\" and \"Occupy Wall Street\" movements. The Government\r\nneeds to better demonstrate that we conduct our business, engage\r\nand transact with our citizens in a fair manner.

This was in spite of strong\r\ncalls by Singaporeans for whistle-blower legislation, partly because\r\nof the banking disasters that came\r\nto light in 2008, but more because of Singapore's acutely important\r\nrole as a financial and economic hub.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 368</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-969eb47e-f6b5-4b2b-b61a-5482550ec555\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-969eb47e-f6b5-4b2b-b61a-5482550ec555\"><!--a--></a>Singapore remains a prime\r\ntarget for economic crimes as much commerce passes through our shores.\r\nWhistleblower and whistleblower protection legislation makes ordinary\r\nSingaporeans part of the good governance process, not just the Government and\r\nlaw enforcement agencies.

The reason for the unhappiness in Singapore was that many\r\nSingaporeans felt that despite the 14.5% economic growth in 2010,\r\nthe fruits of that economic growth did not reach the ground and\r\nwas not spread out equitably. So the real lesson of the global events\r\nand our GE is that we must continue to pursue economic growth but\r\nwe must also at the same time ensure that it is spread out and shared\r\nequitably amongst all Singaporeans. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-32fc6a03-3756-42ff-95b9-8e6583719d90\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-32fc6a03-3756-42ff-95b9-8e6583719d90\"><!--a--></a>The question of economic\r\ngrowth has occupied the House over the last few days and the debate\r\nhas been positioned as economic growth versus happiness.

However, as they have grown older, many of\r\nthe co-tenants have passed on and now they are being asked to live\r\nwith strangers. If we can change this policy and have maybe rental\r\nflats for one occupant, some for two occupants, some for families\r\nand have some flexibility there, then we will fit our policies around\r\nwhat people need.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-eaa1ed65-5ea9-444d-9314-be8100e4cfd9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-eaa1ed65-5ea9-444d-9314-be8100e4cfd9\"><!--a--></a>I would also ask the Government\r\nto look into creative solutions to offset rising costs of living.\r\nOne suggestion which I wish to put forward, far-fetched as it may\r\nseem, is: Can we explore solar power for HDB flats?

It is very important to know what\r\nMr Singh thinks because a whole series of proposals are being put\r\nforward as to how the Government should deal with these perceptions.\r\nA Member of Parliament, when asked a direct question as to what\r\nhe believes in, should either say he is prepared to answer or should\r\nsimply tell the truth, which is that, \"I am not prepared to answer\r\nthe question\". </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-f88ebf06-70e6-468e-8975-f21886395207\">\r\n               <a name=\"president-address__id-f88ebf06-70e6-468e-8975-f21886395207\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-29318d7c-0f35-416c-86bc-f4c0555dcb85\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-29318d7c-0f35-416c-86bc-f4c0555dcb85\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I think\r\nthe Law Minister would know better than I how to answer a question\r\nin Parliament because he has been around here longer than I have.\r\nBut I can only answer a question with my hand on my heart.

And he said that\r\n\"the PAP needs to transform itself\" and here you have a backbencher\r\nwho has stood up and suggested to the Government in all sincerity\r\nnot to score political points but just to suggest to the Government\r\nthat there is scope for improvement. And if they need any advice\r\nor any suggestions, anything of that sort, I am sure I will be happy\r\nto provide them.

Our economy is more developed. It cannot expand in the same\r\nadolescent way as it used to, 7%-8% a year, effortlessly year after\r\nyear. We have domestic constraints of population and space. Population\r\ngrowing, Singapore getting crowded, space being allocated. We have\r\nto scramble to find space for new workers' dormitories, new factory\r\nland, new space for highways, for parks. Everything which you put\r\nin, something else has to be displaced. We are slowing down the\r\ninflow of foreign workers and immigrants, but that means squeezing\r\nout more businesses and reducing more growth. That is a very high opportunity\r\ncost. There is a trade-off. Already, many employers are feeling\r\nit, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and especially\r\nthose which are run by Singaporeans because they tend to be the\r\nless generous pay masters and the first ones to run into difficulties,\r\nnot able to get workers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ebc74845-fac0-4bef-85d5-1b33219a8339\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-ebc74845-fac0-4bef-85d5-1b33219a8339\"><!--a--></a>But it is not just the SMEs.\r\nIt is also in industries staffed mainly by foreigners serving Singaporeans,\r\nlike nursing homes. If you cannot find staff from the Philippines\r\nor from Indonesia or wherever the nurses come from, you will not\r\nfind enough Singaporeans to do this. So, we are going to face slower\r\ngrowth over the next 10 years. We have made 5.5% growth over the\r\nlast decade. Over the next 10 years, we have set a target of 3%-5% growth,\r\nbut I would say that we can make 3-plus % consistently over the\r\nnext 10 years if we have a good decade.

One advantage that\r\nwe do have when it comes to economics which is unique to us and very\r\nvaluable \u2013 and I am afraid often under-appreciated by Singaporeans\r\n\u2013 is that in Singapore, we can make our whole system work well.\r\nNot just individual pieces work, but the whole system works well.\r\nOur unions work with our employers and the Government, we have tripartism.\r\nOur business environment \u2013 everything clicks.

If\r\nyou want utilities, it is there. It is a tight, high-functioning\r\nsystem where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. And this\r\nis not just bragging rights. It is because of this, therefore, Singaporeans\r\nenjoy wages beyond what they would earn if the same person, the\r\nsame skill goes to work somewhere else. If you cross the Causeway,\r\nyou work somewhere, or just go overseas, work somewhere, one of\r\nour neighbouring countries, any of our neighbouring countries, you\r\nwould not get the same wage. In fact, many people come here to work\r\nfrom those neighbouring countries because they are taking advantage\r\nof our whole system performance, our entire system excellence and\r\nwe are taking advantage of them because they add to our numbers.\r\nSo, we have to keep that and, through that, I think our Singaporeans\r\ncan have a premium.

Specific issues which are important\r\nbut where there are specific groups which are concerned, like looking\r\nat the CPF concerning workers, employers, and the older workers,\r\nand they want their CPF rates revised. The Government is working with\r\nNTUC and with employers to review the question. But even on broader\r\nissues, like population and immigration, I think it is constructive\r\nfor us to have a discussion, to debate, to examine the facts, to\r\nunderstand what the trade-offs are, to focus minds. A month or two\r\nago, the Institute of Policy Studies put up a paper showing various projections\r\nof how Singapore's population will grow or shrink over the next\r\ndecade on certain different assumptions. It is not a conclusive\r\nlast word, but it was a very helpful contribution to the public\r\ndebate. I think it helped to educate people and make them understand\r\nwhat this is about. I think over the next year, we will put up more\r\npapers, we will discuss them, get people to focus their minds and\r\nto understand that we actually face very serious trade-offs. There\r\nis no free lunch. You can say you want to have fewer but, if you\r\nhave fewer, there are serious consequences.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-72487fa9-df76-4b23-a5f7-cc23dd5bd87b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-72487fa9-df76-4b23-a5f7-cc23dd5bd87b\"><!--a--></a>But the public debate is\r\nnot a free-for-all and there are risks. The French tried this. They\r\nhad a debate on what it meant to be French because they wanted to\r\nclose over some of the fault lines in their society between the\r\nimmigrants, the Muslims and the non-Muslims in France. The immigrants\r\nwere mainly Muslims. But it took a nasty turn. It became a xenophobic\r\ndiscussion. The government had to try and smooth things down and\r\ndistance themselves from the debate. So while we debate sensitive\r\nthings, we have to be very careful not to let sensible, moderate,\r\nthoughtful views be drowned out by unthinking xenophobia. So that\r\nis the first thing we do \u2013 take a more open approach to Government.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-329e2f0a-04b4-487a-94ef-baf40ab98714\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-329e2f0a-04b4-487a-94ef-baf40ab98714\"><!--a--></a>The second thing we must\r\ndo is to have more space for civic society and for the Government\r\nto pull back wherever possible, so as to have more Singaporeans\r\ntake the lead and act on their own. I spoke about this at the National\r\nDay Rally. I described the Yellow Ribbon programme and how volunteers\r\nare doing a lot of good work, helping prisoners rehabilitate themselves.\r\nBut there are many other examples. When we are talking about ageing, an ageing society\r\nand preparing for that, there, of all places, we will need lots\r\nand lots of civic society to be involved, and some of them are already active,\r\ndoing good things. For example, there is a Young At Heart Community\r\nCollege. Some of you may have heard of it. It is in Marine Parade,\r\nstarted by the Marine Parade Family Service Centre and Southeast\r\nCDC. They call it YAH! Although it has to deal with ageing, they\r\nare young at heart. And the idea is to help the elderly to learn\r\nmore about being self-reliant and leading an active lifestyle. The\r\npeople who come for the courses are trained as Community Education\r\nAmbassadors and they go out and promote awareness of wider issues.\r\nSo they are bringing in old people, giving them some useful knowledge\r\nand skills, and then they can go out and they can be active in their community\r\nand do good and feel useful, and I think probably improve their\r\nmindset and their health. So we need many more of these, one in\r\nevery constituency, times 88 constituencies, and even more.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 393</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9aa4a6d1-e686-47f5-ba49-f035e99e3e1f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-9aa4a6d1-e686-47f5-ba49-f035e99e3e1f\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, we need to emphasise\r\nhow our policies impact Singaporeans and are seen by Singaporeans.\r\nGovernment is not only about doing things. Government is also about making\r\npeople understand what we are doing, getting people to support what\r\nwe are doing and knowing what people would like us to do, so that\r\nwe can do the right thing for them. Everything the Government does\r\nis to benefit citizens. Why on earth do we want to do that? We are\r\nvoted by citizens. Our responsibility is to them. What we do must\r\nbe for them. But Government is complicated and, very often, the\r\nlink from the measures to the benefits are indirect and not obvious.\r\nSo the result is anxiety, sometimes opposition, sometimes a lot\r\nof angst. We try hard to communicate. We make speeches. We have\r\ndialogues. We listen. We talk. But as Members have not tired of telling\r\nus, and I hasten to tell Members that I have heard you, we do not\r\nalways do it as well as we could. And we need to communicate better\r\n\u2013 to listen, to engage, to explain, to be close and sense one another\r\nbetter. If the policies are wrong or circumstances have changed,\r\nthen say so. And change the policies. We are on a new tack. But\r\nif the policies are not wrong and we have to persevere, and it is\r\nthe perceptions which are mistaken, then I think we have to have\r\nthe courage of our convictions, preserve the core principles. We\r\ncan be flexible on the implementation. We can be flexible on the\r\ndetails. But we have to work hard to persuade Singaporeans that\r\nwe are doing the right thing. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b8db6a09-c426-492f-8451-b208c52c04cb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b8db6a09-c426-492f-8451-b208c52c04cb\"><!--a--></a>Take the ERP, for example.\r\nI believe it is the right thing. I think the Minister for Transport\r\nbelieves it is the right thing. I think some Members of the House\r\nbelieve it is the right thing and more Members understand that it\r\nis, although they wished it were not so. But it is something which\r\nwe cannot avoid doing. At the margins, we can adjust. Chinatown:\r\nin the evening, if I can stop earlier, and the shops feel that maybe\r\ntheir customers are less deterred, why not? Let us do that. Central\r\nExpressway: people are going home, they are prepared to be stuck\r\nin the traffic jam a little bit longer, all right, we can compromise\r\nat the edges; let us turn it off at eight o'clock. I am not sure\r\nthat it will solve the problem but if people feel less angst, and\r\nmakes the policy more acceptable, I think it is the right thing\r\nto do. Preserve the principles, adjust the details, politics is\r\nthe art of the possible.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-05c3554a-ea01-4af1-b63d-361d64c6b399\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-05c3554a-ea01-4af1-b63d-361d64c6b399\"><!--a--></a>Finally, we need to harness\r\nthe power of the new media, to use it better to engage and connect\r\nwith citizens, to manage it better to encourage responsible and\r\nconstructive behaviour. We need to strengthen what is called \"digital\r\njudgment\" and we need to set new norms and rules. What is \"digital\r\njudgment\"? That means the good sense to know that what you saw on\r\nthe website does not mean it is real, just because it is on the website,\r\nand just because it is a Wikipedia does not mean it is true. Ask,\r\nfind out, verify. We\r\ndid not invent the term \"digital judgment\".

For instance,\r\nsocial service agencies can further strengthen their outreach efforts,\r\ngalvanise the extensive local grassroots network, and encourage active\r\ncitizens in the community to help spot Singaporeans in distress.\r\nThe grassroots movement can also form local communities of care\r\nwithin closely-knit communities and neighborhoods, such as within\r\na precinct or even a single block, to provide support and care for\r\nthe disadvantaged.

But just like in the acute care environment, these\r\n\"patients\" have to see many specialist agencies, one after the other.\r\nFor instance, Mr Speaker, Sir, if they have financial problems or\r\nneed job placement, they might be interviewed by CDC. If family\r\ndisputes are involved, they might be referred to a Family Service\r\nCentre. If housing problems are in the mix, they may be interviewed\r\nby HDB. If they have difficulty paying for treatment, they would\r\nsee the hospital's Medical Social Worker.

However, we should see if it is possible to create a \"one-stop\r\nshop\" at centralised networks and node points such as the CDC to\r\nconsolidate basic information and documentation.

One example is the Seniors' Mobility Fund. It\r\nassists the elderly in getting basic mobility devices to achieve greater\r\nindependence in the community.

I asked him if a wheelchair might\r\nsolve part of the problem. He said \"yes\", and so I quickly applied\r\nunder the Fund for a wheelchair. Two days ago, I was advised that\r\nthe Fund could not be utilised because it was restricted to Singaporeans only.\r\nYou see, in this case, the man is a Singaporean but his wife had\r\nbeen a Permanent Resident for a long time. In the end, we found\r\nother sources of funding and support to help the family. But should\r\nit be this way? To be fair, this is a new scheme. I am confident that\r\nin light of experience on the ground, the relevant agencies will\r\nreview and widen its criteria.

In this article, it shows\r\nthat while it has brought about some accountability of government,\r\nthe converse has happened in terms of trust between government and\r\nits people. The article suggests that the Act may have perverse\r\nresults in the way government operates and I think, as this point\r\nis being made, we ought to carefully consider it and ensure that\r\nall the merits and the disbenefits of this legislation are thoroughly\r\ndebated.

Several Members\r\nof the House have also echoed this need in their speeches for the\r\npast few days and we have just heard the Prime Minister discussing\r\nthe same point. For example, Mr Edwin Tong spoke of having deeper\r\nand broader engagement with Singaporeans and the need for the Government\r\nto connect with their hearts. Mr Cedric Foo called for an open sharing\r\non information. Ms Sim Ann appealed for higher level of partnership within\r\nthe people of Government. Mr Baey Yam Keng touched on how the Government can\r\nleverage on the social media more effectively. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b255b39c-84f2-4cd6-b2ca-b8b48c442a30\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-b255b39c-84f2-4cd6-b2ca-b8b48c442a30\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to assure\r\nthe House that MICA will be working closely with fellow Ministries\r\nto ensure that the voices of citizens and the needs of our various\r\nsegments of society are heard, understood and considered in policy\r\nformulation. And this includes greater sharing of the rationale,\r\nthinking, trade-offs and in some instances, information on any policy\r\ndecision making process. The Government will make a concerted effort\r\nto communicate better and reach out to a more diverse populace.\r\nOur population today is more educated and vocal. Younger Singaporeans\r\nare also more adept in using social media and are receptive to all kinds of\r\nnews and views. So, the Government must evolve its communication\r\napproach and style, openness, empathy, responsiveness, authenticity\r\nand transparency are key pillars in good public communications.\r\nGuided by these principles, we can go a long way to expand public\r\nspaces to deliberate issues objectively and constructively and more\r\nimportantly, addrFess the challenges facing Singapore as one people,\r\none nation. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 403</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0eacb7b4-2ea9-4585-a14e-064dcfc67ca0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-0eacb7b4-2ea9-4585-a14e-064dcfc67ca0\"><!--a--></a>MICA, Sir, will facilitate\r\nthe whole-of-Government's efforts to leverage on multiple platforms\r\nto better inform, consult and engage the public in developing new\r\ninitiatives and shaping policies. In particular, the Government\r\nrecognises social media as a valuable platform that agencies can\r\nuse to directly engage with individuals and interest groups and\r\nget more people connected on collaborative projects. Most Ministries already\r\nhave some forms of social media presence, be it in Facebook, YouTube,\r\nblogs or Twitter. It is, however, not the number of social media\r\nplatforms that matters but rather the quality of the engagement\r\nprocess. It goes beyond having fresh and updated content that is\r\naccessible and informative to engaging in a two-way conversation.\r\nGoing forward, MICA is speeding up efforts to better equip public\r\noffices with greater awareness, knowledge and skills sets in social\r\nmedia engagement. In parallel, MICA will build a community of social\r\nmedia practitioners drawn from all Ministries to share widely on\r\ngood online engagement practices for the public sector. The leveling\r\nup of online engagement will serve to complement existing efforts\r\nand broaden the communication outreach of the Government. We must\r\nalso make known these channels widely so that more people can come\r\non board. MICA recently launched the Government's social media directory\r\nto provide a one-stop repository of all the social media platforms\r\nthat are run by our public sector agencies. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c349a80b-740b-4e6f-9f73-d566ca9bc6e0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-c349a80b-740b-4e6f-9f73-d566ca9bc6e0\"><!--a--></a>In a nutshell, Sir, we will\r\nraise the bar on online engagement. But having said that, I would\r\nlike to emphasise that social media is to supplement existing outreach\r\nchannels and not to replace them. Face-to-face dialogue sessions,\r\ntownhall meetings and kopitiam chats are \"high touch\" interactive\r\nchannels that we will continue to focus on. The Government is well\r\naware that it does not have the monopoly of good ideas. Over the\r\nyears, the Government has engaged the public in various public consultation\r\nefforts to improve policy robustness and developed consensus on\r\npolicy options. These dialogues were useful, allowing for many good\r\nideas to surface. Public inputs have been incorporated into numerous\r\npolicies such as the Ministry of Health's means-testing framework,\r\nMOM tripartite efforts to overcome the downturn in 2008, and MOE's regulatory\r\nregime for the private education sector.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cdeeaf0d-7129-41d7-b8c0-d54920c32bfe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-cdeeaf0d-7129-41d7-b8c0-d54920c32bfe\"><!--a--></a>With issues becoming more\r\nmulti-faceted, the need to tap on the broader community, including\r\nacademia, independent think-tanks and various segments of society,\r\nis of greater imperative. MICA recently sought the views of the\r\npublic, the arts community and the industry on the Arts and Culture\r\nStrategic Review (ACSR). This approach was also taken for the proposed\r\nData Protection Bill. I am heartened by the responses, and I would\r\nlike to emphasise that the Government welcomes active contributions\r\nand suggestions from all segments of society. Our approach in public engagement\r\nalso needs to be enhanced to be more inclusive and collaborative.\r\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and each agency has\r\nto consider the scope of engagement and its stakeholder profile,\r\npublic consultation must be considered as an essential component\r\nin policy formulation and in some cases implementation process. This\r\nmeans stepping up our efforts to tap on the people, private and\r\npublic sectors (3P Model) to come together to define problems, develop\r\npossible solutions and co-create policies.\r\nThe process of public consultation must also be made more visible\r\n\u2013 both through news media and social media \u2013 to encourage more people\r\nto come forward to contribute ideas. MICA will set out to share\r\nand spread best-in-class practices across Government agencies. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 404</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-07a071f1-2121-4d2d-b0fd-96c21d9329a1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-07a071f1-2121-4d2d-b0fd-96c21d9329a1\"><!--a--></a>One key area is in closing\r\nthe loop with the public after a public consultation exercise and\r\nmaking efforts to explain why a policy has been shaped in a particular\r\nway, why some suggestions can be incorporated, and why some cannot.\r\nSo, to better support the whole-of-Government communications, MICA\r\nwill expand its pool of Information Officers and enhance their skills\r\nto help deliver the desired outcomes.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3e613be6-721b-44a9-98f6-dae169f94387\">\r\n                  <a name=\"president-address__id-3e613be6-721b-44a9-98f6-dae169f94387\"><!--a--></a>Sir, several Members of\r\nthe House, such as Dr Amy Khor and Mr Lawrence Wong, have shared\r\ntheir concerns on the Internet becoming a conduit for undesirable behaviour.\r\nThe standards of behaviour on social media should be no different\r\nfrom the physical world.

For instance, earlier\r\nthis year it was reported that a Myanmar girl studying in Singapore\r\ncommitted suicide after her ex-boyfriend posted \"bad comments\" on\r\nher Facebook page, accusing her of being a \"loose woman\".
