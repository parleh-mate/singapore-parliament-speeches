I informed Parliament then that the Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, which is now called the Singapore Exchange  or\r\n\r\nSGX, had written to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on\r\n\r\n15th  November 1999.  The letter reminded KLSE that  SGX  had\r\n\r\nyet  to  receive  a  reply to its proposal  for  a  staggered\r\n\r\nrelease  of CLOB securities.  SGX sent KLSE another  reminder\r\n\r\non  7th December 1999 to ask for a response within one month.\r\n\r\nSGX has not received any reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX's lawyers had circulated a legal summary to all CLOB\r\n\r\ninvestors  on  17th  December  1999.   The  summary  apprised\r\n\r\ninvestors  of  their  legal rights  as  owners  of  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Authorised Nominee Status</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late December, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir\r\n\r\nand  Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said that  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nsecurities  might  be  transferred to the  Malaysian  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  when  the  Central  Depository's  (CDP)  authorised\r\n\r\nnominee  account expired at the end of 1999.  They  commented\r\n\r\nthat  CLOB investors should accept some of the private sector\r\n\r\noffers  promptly  to resolve the matter.   On  31st  December\r\n\r\n1999,  KLSE  announced  the  extension  of  CDP's  authorised\r\n\r\nnominee  status for a \"final period of six months to  end  of\r\n\r\n30th June 2000.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS responded with a press statement on 29th December\r\n\r\n1999.    It  cited  the  unanimous  view  of  legal  counsel,\r\n\r\nincluding  Queen's  Counsel, that SGX, actually  the  Central\r\n\r\nDepository (CDP), has acted in accordance with the  law;  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no basis in law for a transfer  of  the  CLOB\r\n\r\nsecurities to the Malaysian Minister for Finance,  either  on\r\n\r\n31st December or at any other time.  Whether KLSE extended\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCDP's  authorised  nominee status was not  relevant,  because\r\n\r\nCDP's  and  CLOB investors' legal rights under the  CDP-SCANS\r\n\r\nagreement  and  under Malaysian law did  not  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nnominee status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOB investors are asking for the securities to be\r\n\r\nmigrated into individual securities accounts, in keeping with\r\n\r\nMalaysia's   obligations under the WTO, KLSE's public  duties\r\n\r\nunder Malaysian law, and KLSE's contractual obligations under\r\n\r\nthe  agreement between CDP and SCANS.  Private sector  offers\r\n\r\ncannot  resolve  the  CLOB  issue.   They  do  not  supersede\r\n\r\nobligations that are binding in law, nor can they absolve the\r\n\r\nrelevant parties from their legal responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Malaysia's WTO obligations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has been advised by WTO legal\r\n\r\nspecialists that the measures taken by Malaysia against  CLOB\r\n\r\nare   inconsistent  with  the  most  favoured  nation   (MFN)\r\n\r\nprovision  of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  discriminate  against  CLOB  vis-a-vis   other\r\n\r\nforeign exchanges.  The failure to migrate the CLOB shares is\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with  Malaysia's  obligations  under  the   MFN\r\n\r\nprovision of the General Agreement on Trade in Services,  and\r\n\r\nits  specific  commitments to provide national  treatment  to\r\n\r\nforeign  providers of financial services, recognised  by  the\r\n\r\nWTO.   This is an issue that, if brought to the WTO  for  its\r\n\r\nreview, would have to be resolved government-to-government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>KLSE's legal obligations under Malaysian law</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Securities Industry (Central Depositories)\r\n\r\nAct amendments of September 1998 provide for the transfer  of\r\n\r\nCLOB  securities in the securities account of  CDP  into  the\r\n\r\naccounts of individual CLOB investors held with the Malaysian\r\n\r\nCentral  Depository (MCD).  This requirement under  Malaysian\r\n\r\nlaw  to migrate the securities into individual accounts is  a\r\n\r\nstatutory duty.  It is not a discretionary exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The CDP-SCANS Agreement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an effort to resolve the situation, CDP has also\r\n\r\nentered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Securities  Clearing\r\n\r\nAutomated Network Services (SCANS), which is a subsidiary  of\r\n\r\nKLSE,  to  migrate  CLOB securities into individual  accounts\r\n\r\nheld at MCD.  This is a key agreement whose significance  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian authorities have played down.  KLSE stated  in  May\r\n\r\n1999  that  the  agreement \"was entered into  to  assist  SES\r\n\r\n(Stock  Exchange  of Singapore) and CDP in  facilitating  the\r\n\r\nresolution  of the CLOB problem\".  And more recently  in  its\r\n\r\n31st  December  1999 statement, KLSE made no mention  of  the\r\n\r\nagreement, but continued to maintain that \"it is the duty and\r\n\r\nresponsibility of SGX and CDP to resolve the [CLOB] problem\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement of the CLOB issue is a matter of public\r\n\r\ninterest.   Furthermore, the failure of KLSE to  migrate  the\r\n\r\nCLOB   shares   in   accordance  with  this   agreement   has\r\n\r\nimplications under WTO law.  I am therefore providing Members\r\n\r\nwith  copies  of  the  actual  legal  document.   [Copies  of\r\n\r\nagreement distributed to hon. Members.]  I have the  original\r\n\r\ncopy here with me and what Members have are photocopies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, this is a formal legal agreement\r\n\r\nconcluded between the two parties.  Mr Lim Choo Peng, who was\r\n\r\nPresident of SES [SGX], had met with Dato' Mohd Azlan Hashim,\r\n\r\nExecutive Chairman of KLSE, on 8th September 1998 to  discuss\r\n\r\nhow  to effect the migration of accounts on CLOB to the  MCD.\r\n\r\nArising  from their meeting, the two sides formed  a  working\r\n\r\ngroup  comprising senior executives of the KLSE  and  SES  to\r\n\r\nwork out detailed procedures for migration.  The outcome  was\r\n\r\nthis CDP-SCANS Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement is dated 18th September 1998. It was\r\n\r\nsigned, as you can see, on page 7, by Yang Mulia Ungku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRazak,  duly  authorised  for and  on  behalf  of  Securities\r\n\r\nClearing  Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd, and by  Mr  Kok\r\n\r\nKar  Wing  duly authorised for and on behalf of  The  Central\r\n\r\nDepository Pte Ltd,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  this  was done in the presence of witnesses.   Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysian counsels as well as QC have advised that  this\r\n\r\nagreement  is  a legally binding contract and is specifically\r\n\r\nenforceable in Malaysian courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement lists clearly the steps by which CLOB\r\n\r\nsecurities  are  to  be transferred into individual  accounts\r\n\r\nwith the MCD for trading on the KLSE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer Members to clause 2 of the agreement which\r\n\r\ndefines the obligations of the CDP.  This is on page 3 and is\r\n\r\ntitled OBLIGATIONS OF CDP.  Clause 2(a) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"CDP shall unconditionally and irrevocably grant SCANS\r\n\r\nthe power and authority to act as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     (i)  to accept all securities to be transferred from CDP and\r\n\r\n          to be deposited into a securities to be established by SCANS\r\n\r\n          on behalf of CDP;\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n     (ii) to hold the said securities in custody and thereafter\r\n\r\n          transfer the securities to the respective Depositors' interim\r\n\r\n          securities accounts to be established and maintained by\r\n\r\n          SCANS;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     (iii)  upon request of the Depositors through their ADAs\r\n\r\n          and/or ADMs (these are intermediaries through which investors\r\n\r\n          open and maintain their MCD accounts), to transfer the said\r\n\r\n          securities from the respective Depositors' interim securities\r\n\r\n          accounts maintained by SCANS to the respective Depositors'\r\n\r\n          securities accounts established or to be established by the\r\n\r\n          ADAs and/or ADMs.\"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThose are CDP's obligations.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the agreement, which is on page 4, defines\r\n\r\nthe Obligations of SCANS.

(And  these\r\n\r\n        services  being  to accept all the securities  to  be\r\n\r\n        transferred  to  hold  it in custody  and  thereafter\r\n\r\n        transfer  them to the respective depositor's  interim\r\n\r\n        securities accounts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     (b)  SCANS shall provide the services pursuant to Clause\r\n\r\n        2(a)(iii)  above  only  upon  the  request   of   the\r\n\r\n        Depositors through the ADAs and/or ADMs.  (And  these\r\n\r\n        services  refer  to transferring the securities  from\r\n\r\n        the  interim  securities accounts to  the  respective\r\n\r\n        depositors' accounts.)\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     (c)   SCANS' responsibilities herein are merely  in  the\r\n\r\n       capacity  of  a  custodian  to  provide  the  services\r\n\r\n       pursuant to Clause 2(a) above, without any obligations\r\n\r\n       and/or liabilities howsoever derived or arrived.\"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998, KLSE stated in a letter to SES and CDP\r\n\r\nthat  SCANS' role is merely as custodian and shall be without\r\n\r\nany  obligations  and/or liabilities and  they  cited  clause\r\n\r\n3(c).  SES responded stating that it had been advised by  its\r\n\r\nlawyers that the clause does not excuse SCANS from performing\r\n\r\nany  and all obligations assumed by SCANS as custodian  under\r\n\r\nor  in connection with the agreement.  At the same time,  CDP\r\n\r\nalso  wrote  to SCANS to emphasise that the agreement  was  a\r\n\r\nlegally  binding contract, and CDP having performed  all  its\r\n\r\nobligations, was entitled to enforce the performance by SCANS\r\n\r\nof  its  obligations  under  the  agreement.   There  was  no\r\n\r\nrejoinder from either KLSE or SCANS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDP has fulfilled its part of the agreement. It has\r\n\r\nprovided  SCANS  with  all  information  required  under  the\r\n\r\nagreement and the CLOB securities have been transferred  into\r\n\r\na  consolidated account held with the MCD.  MCD informed  CDP\r\n\r\non  20th  October 1998 that individual interim  accounts  had\r\n\r\nbeen opened in the names of the persons appearing on the list\r\n\r\nfurnished  by the CDP.  But SCANS has failed to complete  its\r\n\r\nobligations  and  continues not to  perform  its  contractual\r\n\r\nduties.   CDP has since repeatedly requested SCANS to provide\r\n\r\nthe  interim securities account numbers.  SCANS has not  done\r\n\r\nso to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the KLSE has not replied to SGX's letter to it asking\r\n\r\nfor  a  response within one month of 7th December  1999,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, Dr Richard Hu,  has  written  to  his\r\n\r\nMalaysian  counterpart, Tun Daim Zainuddin, on  13th  January\r\n\r\n2000.   Dr  Hu's  letter sets out the Singapore  Government's\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the legal issues involved, and requested Tun\r\n\r\nDaim  to  ask the KLSE to fulfil its legal obligations  under\r\n\r\nthe CDP-SCANS agreement.  Dr Hu is now awaiting the Malaysian\r\n\r\nFinance Minister's reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CLOB issue must be settled in accordance with the\r\n\r\nlaw, and with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrights  and  obligations of CLOB investors and the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities.  An early resolution is in the profound interest\r\n\r\nof  both  countries.   The SGX and the  Singapore  Government\r\n\r\ncontinue to be anxious to resolve the matter bilaterally with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  will  make  every effort  to  do  so.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore premature to speculate on what further steps may be\r\n\r\nnecessary should a bilateral solution not prove feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I have a few\r\n\r\nsupplementary  questions  but,  before  asking  them,  may  I\r\n\r\ndeclare  that I have no personal pecuniary interest  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter because I have no investment or shares in CLOB at all,\r\n\r\nbut it is in the interest of 170,000 Singaporean shareholders\r\n\r\nwho have shares in CLOB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  tardiness or lack of reply from the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities,  whether  he  would  convey  to  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities  the  impatience and  indignation  of  investors,\r\n\r\nmostly  Singaporeans  and, in fact some  Malaysians,  on  the\r\n\r\ndelay.   This  delay  has  actually caused,  in  some  cases,\r\n\r\nhardship or perhaps even bankruptcy to the investors who  are\r\n\r\ncaught in the bind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have read in the newspapers that our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  going to have a meeting with Dr Mahathir  after\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese New Year.  I would like to ask the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he would ask that the  Malaysians  include\r\n\r\nthis CLOB issue as an agenda item in the discussion with  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia and also to convey the Singaporean\r\n\r\ninvestors' indignation and impatience over this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is, while we are being patient\r\n\r\nourselves  and  waiting  for  the  Malaysian  authorities  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  our various letters, especially the most  recent\r\n\r\nletter from the Minister for Finance, and in view of the June\r\n\r\n2000  deadline, will it not be possible for us  to  institute\r\n\r\nthe  legal process at the same time, because six more  months\r\n\r\nis  not a very long time.  This matter may still drag on  for\r\n\r\nmore than six months.  So is it possible for us to do it in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparallel, ie, institute the legal process through the WTO and\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Malaysian legal system?  At  least,  we  should\r\n\r\nregister our displeasure with the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first on the\r\n\r\nimpatience and indignation of investors, we have pressed  the\r\n\r\nmatter with the Malaysian authorities with all the vigour and\r\n\r\nurgency  which  we  are capable of.  They are  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nimpatience  of  the  investors.   SIAS has  expressed  itself\r\n\r\nrepeatedly in public, including in Malaysia, and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat proceedings in this House are also reported.  It can  be\r\n\r\nseen  that many of the MPs have raised this matter on  behalf\r\n\r\nof investors and wanted it to be solved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Prime Minister meeting Dr Mahathir, I think\r\n\r\nwhat the Prime Minister said was that he may meet Dr Mahathir\r\n\r\nafter the Chinese New Year period, not now.  If, by the  time\r\n\r\nhe  meets Dr Mahathir, the matter is not resolved, it will be\r\n\r\nraised between them.  It cannot not be raised, because it  is\r\n\r\none  of  the  issues.  But we are not depending  on  personal\r\n\r\narrangements to solve this problem.  This problem has  to  be\r\n\r\nsolved  in accordance with the law, with the contracts,  with\r\n\r\nthe  solemn  obligations which the Malaysian  Government  has\r\n\r\nundertaken at the WTO.  That is why Dr Hu has written to  Tun\r\n\r\nDaim  in order to ask him to get his officials to pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong then talked about the possibility of legal\r\n\r\nprocess  in  parallel.   As  I have  said,  it  is  a  little\r\n\r\npremature for us to commit now and speculate on what we would\r\n\r\ndo  if our bilateral measures do not work.  Dr Hu's letter to\r\n\r\nTun  Daim  was on 13th January 2000.  It is only a  few  days\r\n\r\nago.   So  it is only courteous for us to give the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nside  some  time to study the letter before we see  how  they\r\n\r\ndecide to respond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while\r\n\r\nwe  wait  for  the  reply  from the  Malaysian  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, can we at the same time set certain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeadline for ourselves as to what we would do next in case we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have a satisfactory response?

If so, how does it bind\r\n\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that the issue of CLOB has been long\r\n\r\noutstanding.  Perhaps the Government should set a deadline to\r\n\r\nresolve the issue.  If not, what is the course of action that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will take?  Otherwise, Singaporean  investors\r\n\r\nwould just be waiting with no solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nexplained,  the agreement was signed between CDP  and  SCANS.\r\n\r\nIt  is binding on the KL Stock Exchange and MCD.

I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.   It  is not a matter to be dragged on.  We are pursuing\r\n\r\nit  urgently, but I do not think it is helpful for us to make\r\n\r\npublic  announcements of deadlines and then  bind  ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  not  standing around.   As Mr Jeyaretnam  says,\r\n\r\nfinally  it has to be resolved  in a court, if it  cannot  be\r\n\r\nresolved any other way.  As the Prime Minister has said, this\r\n\r\nis not just a Malaysian court issue, but if there is no other\r\n\r\nway,   it  has  to  also  go  to  the  WTO.   [Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\ninterrupted.]   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  can  rest\r\n\r\nassured that the grass is not growing beneath our feet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, while I recognise  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no need for public deadlines, it may not be in  our\r\n\r\ninterest, will the Government at least set itself an internal\r\n\r\ndeadline?  Can we be assured of that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, given that the WTO remains a matter of\r\n\r\nrecourse,  the Deputy Prime Minister must be aware  that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  complaint  filed  with WTO was between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia regarding petrochemicals.  Why is this so different?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I tell him that\r\n\r\nI have an internal deadline, it becomes a public one.  As for\r\n\r\nWTO, I am aware that the first complaint at the WTO was filed\r\n\r\nby  Singapore with the Malaysian authorities and  the  matter\r\n\r\nwas  entirely and satisfactorily resolved within a reasonable\r\n\r\nperiod of the complaint being filed.  If you ask why is  this\r\n\r\ndifferent, my answer is, this is not different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, while there\r\n\r\nmay  not  be a need to disclose an internal deadline,  it  is\r\n\r\nuseful to have the Members of Parliament on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  express that we prefer a stated deadline of,  say,\r\n\r\nthree  months,  that we want to make public to the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities.   Thereafter, we would start the legal  process.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the legal process will never get started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,\r\n\r\namong all the proposals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat have been tabled or made, is there any one that seems to\r\n\r\nbe favourable or fair to our Singapore investors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the position which the Malaysians have\r\n\r\nproposed.  They have threatened that if it is not solved, the\r\n\r\nshares  would  be transferred to the Malaysian  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  Is there any basis for the Malaysians to claim that\r\n\r\nthese  shares could be transferred to the Malaysian  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have beaten the\r\n\r\nissue of deadlines to death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether any of the proposals are favourable and fair,\r\n\r\nit  is not for me to judge.  If a private sector proposal  is\r\n\r\nmade,  which  is  fully in accordance with  the  law  and  we\r\n\r\ndistribute  it,  then it is up to investors  to  make   their\r\n\r\ndecisions and decide whether it is favourable to them or not.\r\n\r\nThey know their legal rights.  We have informed them of their\r\n\r\nlegal rights.  They know that we are pursuing the matter with\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Government in order to help them  to  enforce\r\n\r\nthose legal rights.  So it is not a matter whether generosity\r\n\r\nhas   been  exercised,  but  have  their  legal  rights  been\r\n\r\nfulfilled or not?  If so, they settle.  If their legal rights\r\n\r\nhave  not been fulfilled or there has been a breach, then  it\r\n\r\nis up to them whether they want to settle for less.  But as I\r\n\r\nhave  explained  in  my  main answer, private  sector  offers\r\n\r\ncannot  solve  the  CLOB  problem because  the  CLOB  problem\r\n\r\ninvolves the two authorities.  The Malaysian authorities have\r\n\r\na responsibility to deal with this.  The CLOB investors, some\r\n\r\nof  whom  are  not Singaporeans, have rights which  they  can\r\n\r\nexpect the Malaysian authorities to respect.  If you ask what\r\n\r\nis  a fair agreement, I say a fair agreement is in accordance\r\n\r\nwith the law and the contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether there is a basis for transfer to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  of Malaysia if  they  do  not  accept\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  agreements, MAS has issued a statement  last\r\n\r\nyear  which  I referred to, there is no basis of transfer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance under Malaysian  law.

The aim was to attract foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  to list in Singapore to add depth to  our  capital\r\n\r\nmarket.   As a precaution, MAS required the foreign companies\r\n\r\nlisting in S$ to have at least 20% of their revenues, profits\r\n\r\nor  expenses attributable to their Singapore operations.  But\r\n\r\nfew foreign companies came, as most of those eligible to list\r\n\r\nhave  little or no operations in Singapore.  While they could\r\n\r\nstill  list  here  in  foreign  currencies,  not  many   were\r\n\r\ninterested  in  doing so, because foreign  currency  listings\r\n\r\ngenerate less trading interest than S$ shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in November 1999, MAS lifted the 20%\r\n\r\nrequirement,  and  allowed foreign companies  to  list  their\r\n\r\nshares  in S$ on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), provided  they\r\n\r\nmet SGX's listing requirements. However, they had to keep the\r\n\r\nS$  proceeds  from the share issue with a bank in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  convert  them  into foreign currency before  using  them\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, MAS also revised its guidelines to allow\r\n\r\nforeign  entities  of  good  credit  standing  to  issue   S$\r\n\r\ndenominated bonds,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovided  they swapped the S$ proceeds into foreign currency.\r\n\r\nThis  has  boosted  the  development of  the  Singapore  bond\r\n\r\nmarket.  It  provided a greater variety  of  debt  papers  to\r\n\r\ninvestors,   in   addition  to  the   traditional   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment and Singapore based corporate issuance.  So far, a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  S$3  billion  of foreign  bond  issues  have  been\r\n\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry players have fed back to MAS that further\r\n\r\nwidening  the  range  of  instruments  allowed  would   offer\r\n\r\ninvestors  more  opportunities to diversify  their  holdings.\r\n\r\nThus  MAS  announced  in November 1999 that  it  would  allow\r\n\r\nforeign  companies and sovereigns, both rated or unrated,  to\r\n\r\nissue  S$-denominated bonds. For unrated bonds, the  investor\r\n\r\nbase is restricted to sophisticated investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed risks when Singaporeans buy bonds\r\n\r\nissued  by   unrated foreign entities.  For  bonds  that  are\r\n\r\nrated  by  internationally reputable and  independent  rating\r\n\r\nagencies,  investors have the benefit of  their  analyses  to\r\n\r\nguide their decisions.  While some unrated issuers are indeed\r\n\r\nfinancially  strong,  investors at large  may  not  have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of independent analyses to aid them in their decision\r\n\r\nmaking.   Also, such issuers are not necessarily  subject  to\r\n\r\ninternationally  accepted disclosure rules.   Investors  must\r\n\r\ntherefore do their own homework to make an informed decision.\r\n\r\nThat  is why we have decided to restrict the sales of unrated\r\n\r\nbonds  to  sophisticated investors.  These are investors  and\r\n\r\ncorporations  who  have high net worth or  incomes,  and  who\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to make their own financial decisions  with\r\n\r\nfewer constraints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the equity and bond markets will bring\r\n\r\nmore  international  participation in  our  capital  markets,\r\n\r\nadding depth and critical mass. Listings of foreign companies\r\n\r\nincrease the capitalisation and turnover of Singapore's stock\r\n\r\nmarket,   expand  the  universe  of  investible   stocks   to\r\n\r\ninvestors, and attract more research analysts, fund  managers\r\n\r\nand  underwriters  to base here.  For the  bond  market,  the\r\n\r\nchanges  will broaden the credit spectrum of foreign entities\r\n\r\ntapping the Singapore bond market. A vibrant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbond  market in Singapore will provide corporations here  and\r\n\r\nin  the  region with another efficient avenue to raise funds,\r\n\r\non  top  of bank borrowings and equity issues.  It will  help\r\n\r\nSingapore to develop as an international financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of our policy on the non-internationalisation\r\n\r\nof  the S$ is to prohibit non-residents from borrowing S$ for\r\n\r\nactivities which are unrelated to the Singapore economy. This\r\n\r\ncould   lead  to  the  build-up  of  a  pool  of  S$  abroad,\r\n\r\npotentially  jeopardising  the effective  management  of  our\r\n\r\nexchange rate. To minimise this risk, we have maintained  our\r\n\r\nrequirement that the S$ proceeds raised by foreign companies,\r\n\r\neither  through a share listing or a bond issue, be converted\r\n\r\ninto  foreign  currency  before  they  can  be  used  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assessed the potential impact of the above\r\n\r\nchanges to our effective management of the S$ exchange  rate.\r\n\r\nWhile they may make the S$ exchange rate more volatile,  MAS'\r\n\r\nassessment  is  that  the movements can  be  managed.   These\r\n\r\ninitiatives  will make Singapore more attractive for  foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  tap our capital market, while strong  economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals, sound policies and ample reserves should enable\r\n\r\nus to withstand any market fluctuations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister says in the long term, to be a leading\r\n\r\nfinancial  institution, the internationalisation of Singapore\r\n\r\nDollar is inevitable.  At the end of the day, I think that as\r\n\r\nlong  as we have a strong economy, and he has mentioned about\r\n\r\nthe surpluses to keep the Singapore Dollar strong, how do  we\r\n\r\non  the one hand become a leading financial institution, like\r\n\r\nNew  York  and London, and at the same time hold  on  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Dollar and not internationalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is another\r\n\r\nissue.  Increasing internationalisation in the long term,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Chng  says, is inevitable.  But it is not something  that\r\n\r\nhappens overnight and it is not a black and white issue - you\r\n\r\nare either\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen,  or you are not.  It is a matter of degree.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of time.  It is a question of what safeguards you  can\r\n\r\nput  in, even partial safeguards, in order to deter excessive\r\n\r\ncapital  flows  - sudden amounts coming in or sudden  amounts\r\n\r\ngoing out - which can push the exchange rate either very high\r\n\r\nor  very  low  and  affect our exports, our trade,  our  real\r\n\r\neconomy  and our jobs.  It is not easy to do because  even  a\r\n\r\nbig  country, like Japan, finds the Yen pushed in  directions\r\n\r\nwhich  are against its basic real economy.  And when the  Yen\r\n\r\nis  high  at  90,  or at one stage below  90  to  US$,  their\r\n\r\nmanufacturing exports suffered, and many of their  industries\r\n\r\nbecame uncompetitive.  Then market sentiment changed and  the\r\n\r\nYen  moved to 150 and they became worried that this was going\r\n\r\ntoo  far and they intervened.  So even a big country does not\r\n\r\nhave full control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country, a very open economy, so we\r\n\r\ncannot  have  full  control.  But we can have  a  significant\r\n\r\ndegree  of control, firstly, because our economy is basically\r\n\r\nsound.  Secondly, because we are running significant physical\r\n\r\nsurpluses, that means, there is no reason for anybody to lose\r\n\r\nconfidence.   And thirdly, we have significant reserves.   So\r\n\r\nif the exchange rate is pushed in the wrong direction, we are\r\n\r\nnot  defenceless.  We have resources with which to intervene.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  you  must  judge that you  are  right,  and  the\r\n\r\nexchange  rate has gone in the wrong direction.   So  anybody\r\n\r\nwho  wants to speculate in the Singapore Dollar has  to  take\r\n\r\nthat  into account.  That has served us well for a long  time\r\n\r\nand I think that continues to be our approach.  We have in  a\r\n\r\ncontrolled way liberalised.  That is why we took a first step\r\n\r\nin  1998.   Then we took a year.  We watched the  experience.\r\n\r\nSome  companies  listed.  There were  some  bonds.   Quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign  entities issued  S$  bonds.   We  gained\r\n\r\nconfidence in the new position, we took a further  step.   So\r\n\r\nwe will take it incrementally and carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nfact that foreign companies are allowed to list in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand I think a lot of investors in Singapore may not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknow  very  much  of  what  is happening  overseas,  ie,  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  that are based overseas, what would  be  the  risk\r\n\r\ninvolved and what is the Government's advice to investors?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Government's answer is if you\r\n\r\ndo  not understand, better do not gamble.  That is a problem,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  a  foreign company or a  Singapore  company.\r\n\r\nBecause  even with many Singapore companies, their  investors\r\n\r\ndo  not really know what the risks are, but they stand there,\r\n\r\nlook  at the TV screen behind the glass, and get photographed\r\n\r\nfor television, and they hope that they will predict the next\r\n\r\nwiggle   in  the  chart  before  everybody  does.   But   CPF\r\n\r\nstatistics show that most of them do not outperform.  Many of\r\n\r\nthem underperform.  That is why our advice is, whether it  is\r\n\r\na  Singapore stock or a foreign stock, unless you  know  what\r\n\r\nyou  are doing and you can absorb the risk, do not punt.  Far\r\n\r\nbetter,  put it in a fixed deposit or a unit trust  with  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  risk profile or, as a last resort, leave  it  to\r\n\r\nCPF.    From   MAS'  point  of  view,  we  would  like   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take an active responsibility to manage their\r\n\r\nfunds  and  put  them  outside of the CPF.   But  that  is  a\r\n\r\ndecision  which  individual Singaporeans  have  to  make  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILATERAL ISSUES WITH MALAYSIA</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  is the status of the outstanding bilateral issues  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and whether there has been any progress  since  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has asked me to reply on his behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House will recall that at our\r\n\r\nsitting on 17th August 1999, I informed the House that senior\r\n\r\nofficials  from  both  countries have  had  three  rounds  of\r\n\r\ndiscussions on the package of bilateral issues  in  1999.   I\r\n\r\nalso  informed the House that it is Malaysia's turn  to  host\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnext meeting in Kuala Lumpur.  The Malaysians have on several\r\n\r\noccasions indicated that they are aware that the ball  is  in\r\n\r\ntheir  court.  But they have not yet responded with  specific\r\n\r\ndates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Minister whether bilateral  relation\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and Malaysia is affected by the delay  and\r\n\r\nnon-resolution  of the outstanding issues.   Second,  whether\r\n\r\nthis  delay and non-resolution has affected ties in terms  of\r\n\r\nsports,  arts  and  culture.   We  used  to  have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nrelationships.  Thirdly, the CPF issue.  The fact  that  they\r\n\r\nare  requesting  that  we  return  CPF  monies  belonging  to\r\n\r\nMalaysian  workers  is  a  major  obstacle  in  the  apparent\r\n\r\nunwillingness of Malaysia to resolve these bilateral  issues.\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, whether we should, in fact, fix a definite time\r\n\r\nline  to  resolve  these issues.  So at  least  we  get  some\r\n\r\ncommitment  and  secure  terms to  negotiate  some  of  these\r\n\r\noutstanding issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, on the fourth aspect about\r\n\r\ndeadline, maybe I should adopt, as the lawyers say,  \"mutatis\r\n\r\nmutandis\",  everything that Deputy Prime  Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nabout deadlines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that various ties, whether sports, cultural\r\n\r\nand  other  relationships, have continued.   But  as  Members\r\n\r\nknow,  these  are very much affected by episodic or  cyclical\r\n\r\nups  and downs in bilateral relations.  I would say bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations have on the whole been maintained.  But if you look\r\n\r\nat  the list of issues in the package, such as the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  CPF  funds  earlier than the legal requirements  by  West\r\n\r\nMalaysians,  the long-term supply of water to Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nposition of KTM land in Singapore, the Singapore Air  Forces'\r\n\r\nuse  of Malaysian airspace and the location of Malaysia's CIQ\r\n\r\nin  Singapore - if you look at all these issues  -  obviously\r\n\r\nthese  are  outstanding bilateral issues and  it  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest   of   both   countries  that   they   be   resolved\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.   Now, I cannot speculate why  they  have  not\r\n\r\nreverted  with dates - whether it is because they  have  been\r\n\r\npre-occupied with certain domestic considerations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich could be one explanation.  But I cannot speculate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned in discussions on the questions arising\r\n\r\nfrom  CLOB,  it was mentioned by Members that Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said that he hoped to meet Dr Mahathir after Chinese New\r\n\r\nYear,  and  Dr Mahathir is reported to have said that  he  is\r\n\r\nagreeable to such a meeting.  But when exactly such a meeting\r\n\r\nwill  take  place I do not know.  And I also do not  wish  to\r\n\r\npredict  the  substantive outcome of such a meeting.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould  anticipate that when the two Prime Ministers do  meet,\r\n\r\none  possibility is that they may give certain directions  to\r\n\r\nthe   officials  on  this  whole  question  of  the   package\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's specific question on the CPF, which\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the  bilateral issues to  be  discussed  in  the\r\n\r\npackage,  I  think Singapore's position on why  we  have  the\r\n\r\nlegal requirements governing withdrawal of CPF funds by  West\r\n\r\nMalaysians has been made clear by my colleague, Dr  Lee  Boon\r\n\r\nYang,  and  many others in this House as well  as  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEssentially,  the rules have provided for certain  withdrawal\r\n\r\nprocedures  and  we  have  followed  the  rules.    And   the\r\n\r\nexplanations  for the existence of the rules have  also  been\r\n\r\nexplained,  and  the  points have been  registered  that  the\r\n\r\nregime of withdrawal for West Malaysians is, in fact, in some\r\n\r\nsense,  more  advantageous than that for  Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysians can withdraw it, I think, five years earlier\r\n\r\nthan  Singaporeans and they do not have to have  any  minimum\r\n\r\nsum.  But notwithstanding this, we have said that as part  of\r\n\r\nan  overall package deal, we are prepared to look at it,  and\r\n\r\nthat position continues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, in this sense, has packaging them\r\n\r\ntogether  actually  helped  us  resolve  these  issues   more\r\n\r\nspeedily  or  should we relook at unbundling the  package  or\r\n\r\npacking  them  in slightly smaller parcels?  Is  there  issue\r\n\r\noverload instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Let us not forget that these issues on\r\n\r\ntheir own can be negotiated and tackled separately and it has\r\n\r\ngone on for some time prior to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntwo  Prime  Ministers'  meeting in Hanoi  in  1998.   It  was\r\n\r\nbecause the previous approach of treating them separately had\r\n\r\nnot produced results that the two Prime Ministers agreed - Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  proposed, and our Prime Minister agreed -  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  try to look at this as a package with officials  from\r\n\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also stress that some of the issues involved\r\n\r\nquestions  of  principles and law.  And  these  positions  of\r\n\r\nprinciple,  whether  it  is  on  sovereignty  or   on   legal\r\n\r\ninterpretations  of existing agreements such  as  on  railway\r\n\r\nland,  have to be maintained by Singapore.  So the fact  that\r\n\r\nthere is a package discussion and it is taking some time does\r\n\r\nnot  in any way affect the legal position of these agreements\r\n\r\nunder  the law.  And if you recall what I said in this  House\r\n\r\nin  1997 on the legal position on the railway land under  the\r\n\r\nPoints  of  Agreement, Members will recall very clearly  that\r\n\r\nthere are clear legal undertakings and responsibilities under\r\n\r\nthese agreements and the time schedule under these agreements\r\n\r\nis  not  affected.

Since 1970, Japan has consistently  been\r\n\r\namong Singapore's top three trading partners.  Japan is  also\r\n\r\ncurrently  the  second largest investor  in  Singapore,  with\r\n\r\ncumulative investments of over S$14 billion.  There are today\r\n\r\nabout  1,700 Japanese companies in Singapore, accounting  for\r\n\r\nabout  one-third  of  the  5,000  multinational  corporations\r\n\r\n(MNCs) operating here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These strong bilateral economic ties are underpinned by\r\n\r\na  congruence of geopolitical interests.  Both our  countries\r\n\r\nsupport the US' engagement in Asia, to maintain a balance  of\r\n\r\npower  and  ensure peace and stability in the  region.   Both\r\n\r\nrecognise    the   importance   of   trade   and   investment\r\n\r\nliberalisation,  and are active players in  multilateral  and\r\n\r\nregional fora such as the WTO, APEC and ASEM.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Japan-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will build upon\r\n\r\nand strengthen these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclose ties.  It is a natural development of our relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An FTA with Singapore will help to lock in Japan's\r\n\r\nengagement  in Southeast Asia for the long term.  The  region\r\n\r\nwill benefit from Japan's enhanced presence.  Japan has been,\r\n\r\nand  will continue to be, an important source of investments,\r\n\r\ncapital  and technology, and a major export market for  ASEAN\r\n\r\neconomies.   Before  the Asian crisis,  Japanese  investments\r\n\r\ncontributed  significantly to the regional  boom.   When  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  struck,  Japan offered much assistance  to  help  the\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian economies recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also expect the proposed Japan-Singapore FTA to\r\n\r\nstimulate  further trade liberalisation in  the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nregion.   While Singapore's primary commitment  remains  with\r\n\r\nthe  multilateral trading system, we believe  that  bilateral\r\n\r\nand  regional FTAs which are WTO-consistent and framed on the\r\n\r\nbasis   of   open   regionalism  (as   opposed   to   forging\r\n\r\nprotectionist blocs) strengthen, rather than weaken, WTO  and\r\n\r\naccelerate   global   trade  liberalisation   through   their\r\n\r\nratcheting  effect.  It is on this basis  that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\npursuing FTAs with Japan, Mexico and New Zealand to help fast-track  trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific, and to build\r\n\r\nbridges across the different regions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see already some positive effects. For example, at\r\n\r\nthe  recent  ASEAN  Informal Summit in  Manila,  the  Leaders\r\n\r\nagreed  to advance the timetable for the complete elimination\r\n\r\nof tariffs within the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement from 2015 to\r\n\r\n2010.

This is why we hope  to  go  beyond  the\r\n\r\ntraditional FTA to a \"new-age\" FTA focusing on liberalisation\r\n\r\nand  cooperation in the high growth services sectors  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture, such as the transport, financial and information  and\r\n\r\ncommunication technology sectors.

We  are  also\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  systemic implications,  in  particular\r\n\r\npolitical  support for the institution of the WTO in  various\r\n\r\ncountries.   Already,  protectionist  forces,  emboldened  by\r\n\r\ntheir perceived victory in Seattle, are now on the offensive.\r\n\r\nFor  example, labour groups and NGOs in the US have  publicly\r\n\r\nstated  that  their next target is to block the  granting  of\r\n\r\npermanent  Normal Trade Relations with China when  the  issue\r\n\r\ncomes up before the US Congress this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will work with other like-minded countries\r\n\r\ntowards the expeditious resumption of negotiations at Geneva.\r\n\r\nA New Round which takes into account the interests of all WTO\r\n\r\nmembers  would be important in ensuring that the  world  does\r\n\r\nnot slip into protectionism.  There is a danger that if we do\r\n\r\nnot  push  forward  on  trade liberalisation,  then  we  will\r\n\r\ngradually move back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel, Singapore will pursue complementary regional\r\n\r\nand bilateral initiatives, especially within APEC, to further\r\n\r\nthe cause of multilateral trade liberalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL BENEFITS SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhat is the progress in the implementation of the Alternative\r\n\r\nMedical Benefits System, which was proposed by the Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Extension of Retirement Age in 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in  November 1995, my  Ministry  appointed  a\r\n\r\nTripartite Committee to review the minimum retirement age and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  implications of a higher retirement age, including\r\n\r\nthe  desirability  to  move away from  the  employer-provided\r\n\r\nmedical  benefit  system.  The Committee recommended  raising\r\n\r\nthe   minimum  retirement  age  from  60  to  62.   This  was\r\n\r\nimplemented with effect from 1st January 1999.  The Committee\r\n\r\nalso  recommended  several  measures  to  help  enhance   the\r\n\r\nemployability  of  older workers so  that  the  extension  of\r\n\r\nretirement  age  would not undermine cost competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  employers.   These  measures  include  the  capping   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit payment, the implementation of the base-up wage system, and the replacement of the existing employer-provided  medical benefit scheme with an Alternative  Medical\r\n\r\nBenefit Scheme.  Progress has been good in voluntary adoption\r\n\r\nby  employers  and  unions  of the  capping  of  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefit and base-up wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been no progress in the case of the\r\n\r\nAlternative  Medical Benefit Scheme.  Under this  Scheme,  as\r\n\r\nproposed  by  1995  Tripartite Committee, existing  employees\r\n\r\nwill  be given average in-patient expenses for the past three\r\n\r\nyears  plus  1%  of salary as an additional  contribution  to\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave  account.   New  employees  will  receive  an\r\n\r\nadditional 1% of their salary also to be contributed to their\r\n\r\nMedisave   accounts.    For  outpatient  expenses,   existing\r\n\r\nemployees  will receive a salary adjustment  of  1%  or  some\r\n\r\nother mutually agreeable and appropriate level\r\n\r\nin return for co-paying their outpatient expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both unions and employers had encountered\r\n\r\ndifficulties   in  applying  this  idea.   The   unions   had\r\n\r\ndifficulty in persuading existing employees, particularly the\r\n\r\nolder  ones,  to opt into the scheme because  they  were  not\r\n\r\nwilling  to give up the comprehensive medical benefits  which\r\n\r\nthey  currently  enjoy.   As the trade-off  benefit  for  new\r\n\r\nemployees is lower at 1%, unions were also concerned that the\r\n\r\nolder  retrenched  employees, who would be  regarded  as  new\r\n\r\nemployees when they join another company, could end  up  with\r\n\r\ninsufficient Medisave to meet their in-patient expenses.   On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, employers were concerned about the additional\r\n\r\ncost of implementing the Alternative Medical Benefits Scheme.\r\n\r\nThey were concerned that not all existing employees would opt\r\n\r\ninto  the new scheme.  Employers would then end up having  to\r\n\r\noperate  more  than  one  medical benefit  scheme,  which  is\r\n\r\nadministratively very cumbersome. Some employers,  lacking  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  outlook,  felt  that the current  medical  benefit\r\n\r\nsystem  was  not too onerous and therefore saw no  reason  to\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are concerned that changes in the labour market\r\n\r\nand  the  rapid ageing of our workforce will, over the  long-term,  create  severe problems for the present employer-based\r\n\r\nmedical  benefit  system.  The traditional  employer-provided\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits  tend  to reduce  job  mobility  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  and those with poor health, by tying them  to  their\r\n\r\ncurrent employers and medical benefits.  Under this system, a\r\n\r\nworker who loses his job would automatically lose his medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.  This would not matter if he is young and  in  good\r\n\r\nhealth.   He  can find a new job quickly and  be  covered  by\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits provided by his new employer.  However,  if\r\n\r\nhe  is an older person and not in good health, a new employer\r\n\r\nwill  be  reluctant to employ him and accept  the  burden  of\r\n\r\nhigher  medical  expenses.  This could  happen  even  if  the\r\n\r\nmedical benefits were provided in the form of a group medical\r\n\r\ninsurance, because group medical insurance policies are  tied\r\n\r\nto the employer and not transferable to a new employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing technological changes and business\r\n\r\ncompetition,  companies often have to make quick  changes  to\r\n\r\ntheir  structures, operations, marketing strategies, manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements and skills in order to survive and prosper. This\r\n\r\nmeans   that  business  re-organisation,  restructuring   and\r\n\r\nretrenchment will be common occurrences in the  future.   The\r\n\r\nconcept  of life-long employment will no longer be  relevant.\r\n\r\nEven  in  Japan, where life-long employment has long  been  a\r\n\r\nsacred cow, companies are having to retrench workers in order\r\n\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our workers must also expect to change\r\n\r\njobs  several times in their lifetime.  Hence, it is in their\r\n\r\ninterest  to  have up-to-date skills and benefits  which  are\r\n\r\nportable,  that  means, they can transfer those  benefits  or\r\n\r\naccumulate the benefits and transfer them to their new job if\r\n\r\nthey  have  to switch jobs.   We should therefore  move  away\r\n\r\nfrom the employer-provided medical benefit system and replace\r\n\r\nit with a portable system, which allows employees to save for\r\n\r\ntheir future medical needs.  The Alternative Medical Benefits\r\n\r\nScheme  proposed by the Tripartite Committee  seeks  to  make\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits  portable and encourage employees  to  take\r\n\r\nindividual responsibility towards their own health.  It is in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of both employers and workers for such a scheme\r\n\r\nto be adopted widely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will establish a follow-up committee,\r\n\r\nincluding the Singapore National Employers' Federation,  NTUC\r\n\r\nand  MOH to review the concept of a portable medical benefits\r\n\r\nscheme to speed up its application.  The Committee will  look\r\n\r\ninto ways to promote the Alternative Medical Benefits Scheme,\r\n\r\nincluding    tax    incentives   for   additional    Medisave\r\n\r\ncontributions and cost of employer-provided medical benefits,\r\n\r\nincluding outpatient benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, instead of the\r\n\r\nportable  medical benefits scheme, is the Government  willing\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namend the Employment Act to give the workers a medical scheme\r\n\r\nunder the statutory provisions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I announced the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Tripartite Committee - I believe  this\r\n\r\nwas  in  1996 - I did say that we would like to implement  an\r\n\r\nAlternative  Medical  Benefits Scheme on  a  voluntary  basis\r\n\r\ninitially.

The two principal pieces of\r\n\r\nlegislation  governing trading on our securities markets  are\r\n\r\nthe  Securities  Industry Act and the  Futures  Trading  Act.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  latter  was substantially amended  in  1995,  the\r\n\r\nformer  has not been amended since 1986, when it was enacted.\r\n\r\nFor example, our insider trading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions,  which are found only in the Securities  Industry\r\n\r\nAct, were drawn from 1980 Australian legislation. Australia's\r\n\r\npractice has subsequently evolved, and their legislation  was\r\n\r\namended  in 1991, but we have not yet brought our legislation\r\n\r\nup to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has examined the provisions governing insider\r\n\r\ntrading  in Australia, as well as the laws in other countries\r\n\r\nwith more developed markets.  We have concluded that the most\r\n\r\npressing  gaps are in the lack of civil remedies for  insider\r\n\r\ntrading. These gaps will be remedied by this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides insider trading, the other main amendment in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  to  the  rules  governing  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nassistance  to  foreign  regulators.   We  propose  to  enact\r\n\r\nspecific provisions in both the Securities Industry  Act  and\r\n\r\nthe Futures Trading Act to extend MAS' powers in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civil remedy for insider trading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, under the Securities Industry Act, insider\r\n\r\ntrading is a criminal offence.  In addition, an investor  can\r\n\r\nobtain  civil compensation from a person convicted of insider\r\n\r\ntrading. The civil action has to be brought within 2 years of\r\n\r\nthe date of the offence, and depends on a criminal conviction\r\n\r\nbeing  secured within that period.  However, securing such  a\r\n\r\ncriminal conviction is difficult because the elements of  the\r\n\r\noffence  have  to be proved \"beyond reasonable doubt\".   Many\r\n\r\ndeveloped financial jurisdictions have therefore complemented\r\n\r\ntheir  criminal  regime for insider trading  with  autonomous\r\n\r\ncivil  actions,  where the burden of proof  is  only  on  the\r\n\r\n\"balance of probabilities\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to introduce two such civil actions,\r\n\r\nboth  with limitation periods of 6 years, instead  of  the  2\r\n\r\nyears  previously.  First, the proposed section 104A empowers\r\n\r\nthe  regulator,  MAS, to bring an action to  obtain  a  civil\r\n\r\npenalty. Where MAS succeeds in such an action (under sections\r\n\r\n103(1), (2), (3) or (6)), the Court may impose a penalty  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  three times the amount of profit gained,  or  loss\r\n\r\navoided, by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontravening person, subject to a minimum sum of $50,000  for\r\n\r\nan  individual, and $100,000 for a body corporate.  Where the\r\n\r\ninsider procures another person to trade, or communicates the\r\n\r\ninside  information to another person for that  purpose,  and\r\n\r\nthus  does  not himself make a profit or avoid  a  loss,  the\r\n\r\ncivil penalty will range from $50,000 to $250,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This penalty is in effect a fine, but the regulator only\r\n\r\nneeds  to  meet  the civil burden of proof,  instead  of  the\r\n\r\nstandard of proof of a criminal conviction. While new to  our\r\n\r\njurisprudence, there are overseas precedents. Both the United\r\n\r\nStates  Securities and Exchange Commission  and  Hong  Kong's\r\n\r\nSecurities and Futures Commission have successfully  utilised\r\n\r\nit  for  some time.  The United Kingdom has also  proposed  a\r\n\r\ncivil  penalty  regime  for market abuse,  including  insider\r\n\r\ntrading, in their Financial Services and Markets Bill 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 104C also creates an independent\r\n\r\ncivil action, enforceable by \"contemporaneous\" investors,  to\r\n\r\nobtain damages from the contravening person. The compensation\r\n\r\nwill  be limited to the gains made or losses avoided  by  the\r\n\r\ncontravening  person.  The  phrase  \"contemporaneous\"  covers\r\n\r\ninvestors  trading  at  or  about  the  same  time   as   the\r\n\r\ncontravening person, whether or not their orders were in fact\r\n\r\nmatched  with the contravening person.  This is because  they\r\n\r\nwould  have been adversely affected, even if their particular\r\n\r\norders were not matched. The price at which they traded their\r\n\r\nshares  would  have been quite different had the  information\r\n\r\nbeen in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 104E, investors can submit their claims on\r\n\r\nthe  coat-tail  of a criminal conviction or successful  civil\r\n\r\npenalty action by MAS, and will not need to re-prove all over\r\n\r\nagain  the  elements of the contravention.  They  have  three\r\n\r\nmonths from the date of the conviction or award of the  civil\r\n\r\npenalty is made final to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This three-pronged regime is quite similar to the\r\n\r\nexisting framework in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnited  States.   We  believe it is  the  best  approach  for\r\n\r\ncombating insider trading.  Investors bear responsibility for\r\n\r\ntheir own investment decisions, but the playing field must be\r\n\r\nkept  level.   Strong capital markets will attract  investors\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad,  boost stock valuations on the Stock  Exchange,\r\n\r\nand  in turn, draw dynamic and well-managed companies to list\r\n\r\non  the  Exchange.  More financial intermediaries will follow\r\n\r\ntheir  customers  to  Singapore and  a  creation  of  such  a\r\n\r\nvirtuous  circle begins with the quality and  enforcement  of\r\n\r\nour financial laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance to foreign regulators</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always made arrangements for mutual cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween   financial   regulators.    Through   Memoranda   of\r\n\r\nUnderstanding, we have had arrangements with other regulators\r\n\r\non a national basis.  But in the past, most regulatory issues\r\n\r\nwere  national issues.  Trans-border cases involving multiple\r\n\r\njurisdictions  were  the  exception.   But   now   with   the\r\n\r\nglobalisation of financial markets, financial crimes too have\r\n\r\ngone  international.   Money  laundering  and  complex  scams\r\n\r\nstraddle multiple jurisdictions, taking advantage of the gaps\r\n\r\nin  oversight  and co-operation between national authorities.\r\n\r\nThis   has  called  for  a  regulatory  rethink.   Individual\r\n\r\nregulators  cannot go it alone, and hope to be successful  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining fair, efficient and transparent markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Singapore authorities have\r\n\r\nreceived   more   requests   for  assistance   from   foreign\r\n\r\nregulators. While we have co-operated with them as  fully  as\r\n\r\nwe  could,  within  the constraints of  our  law,  on  a  few\r\n\r\noccasions,  the  legal restrictions have  prevented  us  from\r\n\r\nproviding  the  information they sought,  even  though  their\r\n\r\nrequests appeared legitimate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been participating in international bodies\r\n\r\nlike  the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The  FATF  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  international co-operation to  combat  money\r\n\r\nlaundering.   FATF reviews have highlighted weaknesses in our\r\n\r\nlegislation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  brought  home  to us the necessity of  cooperating  more\r\n\r\nclosely  with other financial centres.  We have  to  maintain\r\n\r\nour  good  reputation  as  a centre which  does  not  shelter\r\n\r\nillegal gains.  Singapore is not the place for the laundering\r\n\r\nof drug money or dodging regulatory oversight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of cross-border exchange alliance is\r\n\r\nanother factor.  The SIMEX, now called the Singapore Exchange\r\n\r\nDerivatives Trading, has had a mutual offset arrangement with\r\n\r\nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for 15 years.  Now this\r\n\r\narrangement is being expanded and strengthened to become  the\r\n\r\nGLOBEX Alliance, involving more exchanges in other countries.\r\n\r\nBefore  foreign  regulators  give  their  approval  to   such\r\n\r\nexchange  alliances, they invariably want MAS to  enter  into\r\n\r\ninformation sharing arrangements with them.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe   SIMEX-CME   link-up,  MAS  has  had   a   long-standing\r\n\r\narrangement  for  mutual assistance  with  the  US  Commodity\r\n\r\nFutures  Trading  Commission.  Now with the GLOBEX  Alliance,\r\n\r\nwhich includes the SBF-Paris Bourse, MAS had recently entered\r\n\r\ninto  MOUs  on mutual assistance with the French  regulators,\r\n\r\nthe COB and the CMF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will strengthen these relationships with other\r\n\r\nregulators, and further facilitate our cooperation with them,\r\n\r\nparticularly  regulators  in  developed  economies  like  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes specific provisions on the nature of\r\n\r\nassistance, the conditions for assistance and the  safeguards\r\n\r\nthat  apply.  Upon receiving a request, MAS will  examine  if\r\n\r\nthe pre-conditions necessary for it to render assistance have\r\n\r\nbeen  fufilled.   For example, MAS must be satisfied  that  a\r\n\r\nrequest  relates to a matter of sufficient gravity, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  information requested cannot reasonably be  obtained  by\r\n\r\nany  other means.  The granting of assistance also cannot  be\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  public interest or  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\ninvesting  public.   If  the conditions  are  met,  MAS  will\r\n\r\nconsider further factors such as reciprocity, and whether the\r\n\r\nact committed overseas would be an offence under our relevant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlegislation  had  it  been  committed  in  Singapore,  before\r\n\r\ndeciding whether to grant assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The types of assistance MAS may provide include\r\n\r\ntransmitting information in its possession, and  requiring  a\r\n\r\nperson  to furnish the requisite information to MAS for  that\r\n\r\npurpose.    MAS  can  also  require  a  person   to   furnish\r\n\r\ninformation  directly to the foreign regulator.  Persons  who\r\n\r\ncomply with MAS' requirements in this regard receive immunity\r\n\r\nwhere they would otherwise have been in breach of obligations\r\n\r\nsuch as client confidentiality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel with this, we are also amending other laws\r\n\r\nto improve cooperation with foreign regulators.  In September\r\n\r\n1999,  we  amended  the  Drug  Trafficking  (Confiscation  of\r\n\r\nBenefits)  Act to lower the threshold requirement for  mutual\r\n\r\nlegal assistance, and to expand the scope of offences covered\r\n\r\nbeyond  drug  trafficking to a range of  established  serious\r\n\r\ncrimes.   The  Minister of State for Law has just  introduced\r\n\r\nfor  First Reading the Mutual Assistance in Criminal  Matters\r\n\r\nBill  which,  when passed, will enable us to conclude  mutual\r\n\r\nlegal assistance treaties with other governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions therefore provide adequate safeguards\r\n\r\nto  prevent foreign authorities from fishing for information,\r\n\r\nand   protect   the   legitimate  needs  of   investors   for\r\n\r\nconfidentiality   of   their   financial   transactions   and\r\n\r\narrangements.   Our provisions will be similar  to  those  in\r\n\r\nother  established  financial centres, including  Switzerland\r\n\r\nand  Hong Kong.  Investors need not worry that the provisions\r\n\r\nwill undermine the protection they have hitherto enjoyed.  On\r\n\r\nthe   contrary,   enhanced  cross-border  cooperation   among\r\n\r\nsecurities regulators should increase their confidence in the\r\n\r\nsoundness and integrity of Singapore's capital markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing Regulatory Efficiency</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these two main amendments, the Bill proposes\r\n\r\nseveral  changes  to fine-tune provisions in  the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Act.   These include empowering the  MAS  to  issue\r\n\r\nwritten notices, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  deemed  not to be subsidiary legislation,  to  licensees\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act  (this  is under new section  33A);  and  the\r\n\r\nrationalisation  of the trust account rules for  dealers  and\r\n\r\ninvestment advisers (sections 58 and 65 respectively).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to amend the fidelity fund\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Act to cover defalcation or breach of trust\r\n\r\nby  remisiers, as well as the financial default of members of\r\n\r\nthe   Exchange  licensed  by  the  MAS.   Finally,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nstrengthens the criminal sanctions for market misconduct such\r\n\r\nas  price  manipulation and insider trading.  It proposes  to\r\n\r\nraise the maximum stipulated fines in section 104 of the  Act\r\n\r\nfor  the  market offences created by Part IX from $50,000  to\r\n\r\n$250,000 for an individual, and from $100,000 to $500,000 for\r\n\r\na body corporate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, amongst other\r\n\r\nthings, the amendments, which I support, seek to tighten  the\r\n\r\nrules  on  insider  trading and to offer those  aggrieved  by\r\n\r\ninsider trading a less onerous route towards seeking redress.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to begin by focusing on some of the  practical\r\n\r\nissues of the related amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the civil action alternative is welcomed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  may  still  prove  to  be  onerous  for  retail\r\n\r\ninvestors,  especially for those who have already lost  large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money  to insider trading.  If they  are  fortunate\r\n\r\nwhere, following action by the Authority, there is conviction\r\n\r\nor  imposition  of  a civil penalty, they can  then  leverage\r\n\r\ntheir claims accordingly.  However, if the Authority has  not\r\n\r\ninitiated  any action, as provided for under the new  section\r\n\r\n104A,  these retail investors themselves would have to  mount\r\n\r\ncivil  suits  on their own.  While the level of  proof  in  a\r\n\r\ncivil  suit is theoretically lower, retail investors continue\r\n\r\nto have limited access to necessary documents or information,\r\n\r\nespecially if it is cross-border in nature.  Would the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  consider making available a simpler  process\r\n\r\nfor retail investors to seek redress, whether it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  opportunity to persuade the Authority to commence  action\r\n\r\nor  through the appointment of an ombudsman or a civil  body,\r\n\r\nsuch as an investors' association?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stock options</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to some of the inherent difficulties of\r\n\r\ninitiating civil action by individuals, I would like to touch\r\n\r\non  an  emerging trend, that of stock options for  employees,\r\n\r\nwhich  may add to the complexity of defining insider trading.\r\n\r\nEmployee stock option schemes have a relatively short history\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.    There  are  numerous  justifications   for\r\n\r\nencouraging even more companies to consider this as  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  overall compensation structure, particularly as  we  are\r\n\r\npositioning  as a hub of intellectual capital.  Sir,  I  laud\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  to promote such a scheme, as I believe  it  can\r\n\r\nindeed  be  an  effective  way  of  rewarding  and  retaining\r\n\r\ncontributors  to  corporate innovation and  energy.   As  the\r\n\r\nscheme  takes  off, it would soon be commonplace  to  have  a\r\n\r\nlarger  pool  of  interested parties within an  organisation.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, the potential for insider trading may rise in\r\n\r\ntandem.  Whilst this may not be addressed specifically by any\r\n\r\nclause  in  the  Bill,  I would like  to  urge  the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities, as a preventive measure, to help raise awareness\r\n\r\nof   such  possibilities  of  insider  trading  amongst   the\r\n\r\nincreasing pool of equity partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>E-trading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on electronic trading, I would like to\r\n\r\nseek  the Deputy Prime Minister's clarification.  Fuelled  by\r\n\r\ntechnology and further liberalisation, electronic trading  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  increase by leaps and bounds, with  many  brokers\r\n\r\nalready offering a variety of services.  Would the amendments\r\n\r\napply equally to those who have transacted electronically, be\r\n\r\nthey  the claimants or insider traders?  Specifically,  would\r\n\r\nthe  factors  for  consideration under the new  section  104C\r\n\r\nencompass trades carried out through electronic means?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mrs Lim has raised\r\n\r\nthree questions.  First,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   difficulty  for  retail  investors  to  initiate  civil\r\n\r\nactions.  The short answer is that indeed it is difficult for\r\n\r\nretail  investors to bring independent civil action.   It  is\r\n\r\nalways  the  case  that insiders have more  information  than\r\n\r\nretail investors, and if the insider trading does not come to\r\n\r\nlight,  the retail investor would not even know that  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen taken advantage of.  Even if he suspects something,  the\r\n\r\nsheer  complexity  of establishing the facts  of  an  insider\r\n\r\ntrade  and  the  need  to  prove  all  the  elements  of  the\r\n\r\ncontravention requires financial and legal expertise, both of\r\n\r\nwhich are very costly.  So, we expect most investors to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  successful criminal prosecution or civil penalty  action\r\n\r\nby  MAS before filing their claims under the proposed section\r\n\r\n104E.   This  is already a big improvement from  the  present\r\n\r\nposition,  because  presently you can only seek  compensation\r\n\r\nafter a prior criminal conviction and, furthermore, you  have\r\n\r\nto do it within two years of the offence.  So, if there is no\r\n\r\ncriminal conviction or if the criminal conviction takes  more\r\n\r\nthan two years, then nobody can file and claim civil damages.\r\n\r\nNow  you  can  claim  civil damages  within  six  years  and,\r\n\r\nfurthermore, you can claim it on the coat-tails not just of a\r\n\r\ncriminal  conviction, but of the civil penalties as a  result\r\n\r\nof MAS' action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we now allow contemporaneous investors to tag\r\n\r\ntheir claim to such criminal or civil proceedings.  So you do\r\n\r\nnot  have to trade opposite the contravening trader.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot  have to sell directly to him.  Even if you had  sold  to\r\n\r\nsomebody else at about the same time when he was trading  and\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of the market, you can still  have  a  case\r\n\r\nagainst him.  So that is another significant step forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Attorney-General's Chambers and the MAS decide\r\n\r\nnot  to  pursue  the matter, then, of course,  it  is  up  to\r\n\r\ninvestors to chart their own course.  But that is the case in\r\n\r\nevery contentious court matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some jurisdictions which do not even allow an\r\n\r\nindependent  civil  claim  by  investors.   In  other  words,\r\n\r\ninvestors  do not have a cause of action against an  insider.\r\n\r\nInstead, only the state can take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncriminal action.  That is the current position in the UK.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia and Hong Kong, investors can bring civil\r\n\r\naction  for  damages, but they have to show that their  order\r\n\r\nwas matched with the insider before they have a case.  So  if\r\n\r\nyour  order was not matched with the insider but matched with\r\n\r\nsomebody  else  at  about the same time, you  have  no  case.\r\n\r\nWhether  your  order  was matched with the  insider  or  with\r\n\r\nsomebody  else a few seconds later, it is really a matter  of\r\n\r\nchance.   You  do  not have control over it.   But  you  were\r\n\r\naffected whether or not the matching took place.  So we  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to go for this more encompassing approach of  giving\r\n\r\ncontemporaneous  investors  a  cause  to  sue,  and  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething which the US already has.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans do have widespread securities class action\r\n\r\nlitigation.   That means a group of people get  together  and\r\n\r\nsue  on  behalf of all the investors.  The danger of this  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  could lead to frivolous law suits that may  tie  up\r\n\r\ninnocent insiders and their companies costly litigation.   So\r\n\r\nour  independent  civil  action by contemporaneous  investors\r\n\r\nwith the ability to tag on their claims goes, I think, as far\r\n\r\nas  is wise and acceptable in our jurisprudence.  Let us gain\r\n\r\nsome  experience  with this, and if we need to  take  further\r\n\r\nsteps later, we will review the position after a few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim's second question was on stock options and\r\n\r\nwhether this increases the pool and level of insider trading.\r\n\r\nYes,  the  use of stock options will increase the  number  of\r\n\r\nemployees  holding  options in their own companies,  and  all\r\n\r\nthese employees, under section 103 of the Act, are considered\r\n\r\nto  be  officers  of  their company and  therefore  insiders.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  are  prohibited  from  dealing   while   in\r\n\r\npossession  of  price  sensitive  information  that  is   not\r\n\r\ngenerally  available.  This means that it includes exercising\r\n\r\nthe stock options or possibly later on selling the underlying\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not know whether stock options will\r\n\r\nnecessarily raise the level of insider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrading.   Because  if  the employee has inside  information,\r\n\r\nwhich  he  does, and he wants to take advantage of  it,  even\r\n\r\nwithout the benefit of stock options, he could have just gone\r\n\r\non  to  the  market to buy and sell the shares himself.   And\r\n\r\neven  if  he did not do so personally, he could have procured\r\n\r\nsomebody   else  to  do  so  and  communicated   the   inside\r\n\r\ninformation  to that person for that purpose.   So  companies\r\n\r\nshould  make a timely disclosure of material information,  to\r\n\r\nput  it in the public domain as quickly as possible.  And  in\r\n\r\ncases  where  the information has to remain confidential  for\r\n\r\nlegitimate   reasons,  they  must  set  up  proper   security\r\n\r\nprocedures to limit employees access to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if somebody is tempted to do an insider trade by\r\n\r\nhis  stock  options, we have a good chance of  detecting  it.\r\n\r\nBecause  if an employee is dealing for himself, it is  easier\r\n\r\nto  detect than if somebody else was transacting whom we  did\r\n\r\nnot  know  was  connected with the company.   Not  only  will\r\n\r\nmarket surveillance by the Singapore Exchange pick up unusual\r\n\r\ntrades  to  be  matched against names  of  employees  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany, but the issuer company itself keeps record  of  when\r\n\r\ntheir employees exercise their stock options.  So it is a cat\r\n\r\nand  mouse game.  There is never a final solution,  but   the\r\n\r\ncat  is  trying to get smarter all the time, and I  think  we\r\n\r\nwill stay ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim's third and last question was on e-trading, and\r\n\r\nwhether the amendments apply equally to electronically traded\r\n\r\nsecurities.    The  answer  is  yes.   The   legislation   is\r\n\r\ntechnology-neutral.   This  is  in  line  with  one  of   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  adopted  by  the  International  Organisation  of\r\n\r\nSecurities  Commissions, that the fundamental  principles  of\r\n\r\nsecurities regulation do not change based on the medium.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the Internet does show up difficult issues, but  not\r\n\r\ntotally  novel ones.  Technology will heighten the  need  for\r\n\r\nfine-tuning the Act, as we have done, for example,  with  the\r\n\r\ndefinitions  of  stock  market and investment  adviser.   But\r\n\r\nwhere  insider  trading is concerned, the problems  posed  by\r\n\r\nInternet  trading are more of detection and enforcement,  and\r\n\r\nthey have been with us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  the  old days of physical delivery of share scrips  and\r\n\r\nrolling  settlements.  Indeed, it may be that as the Internet\r\n\r\nrelies on electronic systems in communications, if you design\r\n\r\nyour  electronic systems properly, then you  will  create  an\r\n\r\nelectronic  audit  trail that may enhance the  monitoring  of\r\n\r\nillicit  transactions.  So I believe that the  Exchange,  MAS\r\n\r\nand  the  Commercial Affairs Division will be able to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  insider  trading  does  not  grow  with  the  projected\r\n\r\nincrease in on-line securities transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year \"1999\" will be changed\r\n\r\nto \"2000\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 26 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FUTURES TRADING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.04 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of the Securities Industry\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill just now, I explained the  importance  that\r\n\r\ninvestors place on sound regulations, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the  proper  enforcement  of these  regulations.  I  also\r\n\r\ndescribed  how the lack of investor confidence would  have  a\r\n\r\ndetrimental effect on our financial markets, and consequently\r\n\r\nthe  real economy.  Although the focus there was on the  cash\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  same  considerations apply in  the  derivatives\r\n\r\nmarket.  The amendments proposed in this Bill are a subset of\r\n\r\nthose that we had considered earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment is the proposed new Part VIIA of the\r\n\r\nAct,  which  enhances  the  level of  regulatory  cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween  MAS  and other futures regulators.  I  have  already\r\n\r\nexplained  the significance of this international cooperation\r\n\r\nfor  our  development as an international  financial  centre.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the Bill proposes a new section 21A which gives\r\n\r\nMAS  the  authority to issue written notices  to  holders  of\r\n\r\nlicences  under  the  Futures Trading  Act.   The  Bill  also\r\n\r\nproposes  to amend some of the current provisions  concerning\r\n\r\nthe fidelity fund in order to extend the coverage of the fund\r\n\r\nto  include the financial default of members of the  Exchange\r\n\r\nthat  are  licensed by MAS.  Finally, the  Bill  proposes  to\r\n\r\nraise the maximum stipulated fines for Part VIII of the  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  covers trading offences such as bucketing. At present,\r\n\r\nthe  sum is $100,000. This will be increased to $250,000  for\r\n\r\nan individual and $500,000 for a body corporate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice, however, that the new civil actions\r\n\r\nfor  insider  trading are not found in this  Bill.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause insider trading itself is not presently proscribed by\r\n\r\nthe  Futures  Trading  Act,  which  governs  the  derivatives\r\n\r\nmarket.  We are aware that jurisdictions like Australia  have\r\n\r\nmade   insider   trading  an  offence  under  their   futures\r\n\r\nlegislation.    With  the  proliferation  of  new   financial\r\n\r\ninstruments,  futures  contracts, for  example,  stock  index\r\n\r\nfutures,  can theoretically be affected by specific corporate\r\n\r\ninformation.   So it is possible for insider trading to  take\r\n\r\nplace involving derivatives instrument.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, we may therefore also want to make\r\n\r\ninsider  trading a crime in our derivatives markets.  MAS  is\r\n\r\nstill studying the matter. We are considering\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstreamlining  our  securities and  futures  legislation,  and\r\n\r\ncombining  both into a single omnibus Act.  This  will  be  a\r\n\r\nnatural consequence of the demutualisation and merger of  SES\r\n\r\nand  SIMEX,  and the worldwide convergence of  the  cash  and\r\n\r\nderivatives markets.  Such combined legislation will  provide\r\n\r\na  unified framework for dealing with insider trading on both\r\n\r\nthe cash and derivatives markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take us one or two years to prepare omnibus\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Until  we  take this  next  step,  the  present\r\n\r\namendments will keep us in touch with current developments in\r\n\r\nthe capital markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year \"1999\" will be changed\r\n\r\nto \"2000\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 12 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FIRE SAFETY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Safety Act, or FSA in short, was enacted in\r\n\r\n1993.   In order for SCDF to keep up to date, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  amend the FSA to provide for new powers for the  SCDF  as\r\n\r\nwell as to fine-tune some of the existing provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Graduated penalties for Registered Inspectors and the establishment of a Committee to investigate complaints and to recommend penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first touch on the proposed changes to the\r\n\r\nRegistered Inspector (RI) scheme.  Registered Inspectors  are\r\n\r\na  group  of professional architects and engineers registered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Fire Safety Act.  The owner of a newly  completed\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  required to appoint a Registered  Inspector  to\r\n\r\ninspect  and  test  fire safety works in the  building.   The\r\n\r\nRegistered  Inspector  has to certify that  the  fire  safety\r\n\r\nworks  are completed in accordance with the fire safety plans\r\n\r\nand  the  Fire Safety Act before the Commissioner will  issue\r\n\r\nthe  Fire  Safety  Certificate  for  the  occupation  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.    While  the  current  Fire  Safety   Act   allows\r\n\r\nCommissioner  SCDF to appoint a committee to  assist  him  in\r\n\r\nconsidering  applications  for  registration  as   Registered\r\n\r\nInspectors,  it  does not provide for the  appointment  of  a\r\n\r\ncommittee to assist the Commissioner to investigate into  any\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  misconduct  or  negligence  by  a  Registered\r\n\r\nInspector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for a more transparent system of\r\n\r\ninvestigation, clause 4 of the Bill will create new  sections\r\n\r\n6A  to  6D  to give Commissioner SCDF the power to appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  either  on his own accord, or upon  receipt  of  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  to  investigate  into  any  complaint  against  a\r\n\r\nRegistered Inspector.  Members of the Inquiry Committee  will\r\n\r\ncomprise qualified persons such as professional engineers and\r\n\r\narchitects,  and  officers from the SCDF.  The  formation  of\r\n\r\nsuch   a   committee   will  ensure  a   greater   level   of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism   and  independence  in   the   investigation\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Safety Act currently only allows Commissioner\r\n\r\nSCDF  to  de-register  a  Registered  Inspector  because   of\r\n\r\nmisconduct.   There  is  no other form  of  punishment.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent   law  does  not  provide  for  graduated   penalties\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the gravity of the misconduct.    Clause  3\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  amends  section 5 of the Fire  Safety  Act  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Commissioner  to  impose  additional  forms  of\r\n\r\npenalties, namely, suspension from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractice,  and  written warnings.  The new  section  6C(7)(d)\r\n\r\ninserted by clause 4 also empowers the Commissioner to impose\r\n\r\na  fine  of  up to $5,000.   The Commissioner will  only  de-register a Registered Inspector if the latter is involved  in\r\n\r\nserious  cases  of negligence or misconduct  such  as  fraud,\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation or dishonesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Power to disapprove plans without a written direction and revoke approvals granted for plans of fire safety works</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to the system for approving fire\r\n\r\nsafety  plans. Currently, a person who wishes to construct  a\r\n\r\nnew building has to appoint a Qualified Person (QP), who is a\r\n\r\nprofessional engineer or architect, to prepare a fire  safety\r\n\r\nplan.  This plan has to be submitted to SCDF for approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of checking the plans submitted by the\r\n\r\nQualified Person, SCDF has detected errors, such as the  lack\r\n\r\nof  endorsement  from  the  QP in the  plan  submissions,  or\r\n\r\nsprinklers  are  not  specified.  Under  section  23  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Fire Safety Act, Commissioner SCDF cannot  reject  a\r\n\r\nplan  submitted  to  him  without  first  issuing  a  written\r\n\r\ndirection  to the Qualified Person to ask him to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  fire  safety  requirements.  This has led  to  instances\r\n\r\nwhere  some  Qualified Persons made careless submissions  and\r\n\r\nrelied on the SCDF to point out their mistakes in writing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, under the self-regulation system put in place\r\n\r\nby  SCDF  since September 1998, SCDF would approve  the  fire\r\n\r\nsafety plan prepared by a Qualified Person immediately if the\r\n\r\nQualified  Person  has also filed a written declaration  that\r\n\r\nthe  plan fulfils the fire safety requirements under the Fire\r\n\r\nSafety Act.  If an approved plan is found not to be complying\r\n\r\nwith  the  Act in subsequent audit checks, current provisions\r\n\r\nin  the Fire Safety Act do not allow SCDF to revoke it.  SCDF\r\n\r\ncan  only  issue  a written direction for the  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nproject to make the necessary amendments to the plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 will amend section 23 of the Act to allow\r\n\r\nCommissioner SCDF to reject\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  submitted plan outright, without having to issue a written\r\n\r\ndirection.  This power will be used for cases where there are\r\n\r\nglaring errors in the submission plans.  This will place  the\r\n\r\nonus  on  the  Qualified Persons to ensure that  their  plans\r\n\r\ncomply  with  all  fire safety requirements.   It  will  also\r\n\r\nprevent the Qualified Persons from being reliant on SCDF  for\r\n\r\nthe written directions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 23 also empowers\r\n\r\nCommissioner  SCDF to revoke an approval granted  earlier  if\r\n\r\naudit  check  reveals that the Qualified Person  has  made  a\r\n\r\nfalse declaration of compliance or provided false information\r\n\r\nto the Commissioner during the submission of the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fire  Safety Certificate or Temporary Fire Permit  for  newly completed building</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under section 29 of the Act, the person for\r\n\r\nwhom  the  fire safety works are carried out is  required  to\r\n\r\napply to the Commissioner for a fire safety certificate.  The\r\n\r\nconcept  of  self-regulation  for  Qualified  Persons   under\r\n\r\nsection 23 will be extended to the submission of approval for\r\n\r\nfire  safety  certificates under section  29.    The  amended\r\n\r\nsection 29 of the Act will empower Commissioner SCDF to issue\r\n\r\na  Fire  Safety Certificate (FSC) or a Temporary Fire  Permit\r\n\r\n(TFP)  for  a  completed building based on the  certification\r\n\r\ngiven  by  a  Registered Inspector.   Random  checks  may  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  before or after such certificates  are  issued.\r\n\r\nThe  Commissioner  will also be empowered under  the  amended\r\n\r\nsection 29 to similarly revoke the Fire Safety Certificate or\r\n\r\nthe  Temporary  Fire  Permit if  he  is  satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\ncertification   or  information  given  by   the   Registered\r\n\r\nInspector  is false or if the applicant fails to comply  with\r\n\r\nhis order to carry out rectification in the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provision for powers to order the demolition, removal, closure, alteration or demolition of buildings</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to enforcement action to be taken\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  non-compliance of fire  safety  requirements\r\n\r\nunder  the Act.  Clause 8 inserts new sections 30A,  30B  and\r\n\r\n30C.  These sections\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill confer powers on SCDF to take appropriate action against\r\n\r\ncases  of  unauthorised  fire  safety  works.   Section   30A\r\n\r\nempowers Commissioner SCDF to order the demolition or removal\r\n\r\nof  illegal  fire  safety  works  in  cases  of  severe  non-compliance.  He may issue an order for closure of a  building\r\n\r\nor  part of it, and enter any building to demolish, remove or\r\n\r\nalter  any  works  causing the non-compliance.   Section  30B\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  servicing and enforcement  of  a  closure\r\n\r\norder, while section 30C provides a channel to appeal to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions will enable SCDF to better deal with\r\n\r\ncases  of  non-compliance.  The power to demolish a  building\r\n\r\nwill  only be used as a last resort, in situations where  the\r\n\r\nunauthorised fire safety works or the building works actually\r\n\r\npose  an  immediate danger to the occupants of the  building.\r\n\r\nThese  new provisions are in line with similar provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe Building Control Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Making Fire Hazard Abatement Notice permanent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes amendments to facilitate the\r\n\r\nenforcement of the Fire Safety Act.  Currently, under section\r\n\r\n13  of  the Act, the Commissioner has to issue a Fire  Hazard\r\n\r\nAbatement  Notice (FHAN) to the occupier, owner, or  employee\r\n\r\nof  a  premises to remove the fire hazard each  time  a  fire\r\n\r\nhazard  is  detected, for example, blocking of passageway  to\r\n\r\nthe  fire exit.  The FHAN also specifies a timeframe for  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of the fire hazards.  If the FHAN is complied  with,\r\n\r\nthen the case is closed.  Otherwise, SCDF can either compound\r\n\r\nthe  offence, remove or seize any property causing  the  fire\r\n\r\nhazard, order the owner or occupier to close the premises for\r\n\r\nup  to  72 hours to remove the fire hazard, or apply  to  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court for a Fire Hazard Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the current law, there is nothing to stop\r\n\r\nthe  owner  or  occupier from committing a  new  fire  hazard\r\n\r\noffence  after  the  previous fire hazard has  been  removed.\r\n\r\nSCDF needs to re-issue the offender with a fresh FHAN even if\r\n\r\nthe nature of the new fire hazard is similar to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  previous act.  As a result, SCDF has to closely  monitor\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant cases and issue a FHAN each time the  same  type\r\n\r\nof offence is committed.  This is unproductive. The number of\r\n\r\nsuch recalcitrant cases has been on the rise.  There were  63\r\n\r\ncases in 1999, compared to only 15 cases in 1997 and 12 cases\r\n\r\nin 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close this loophole, clause 5 amends section 13 of\r\n\r\nthe  Act to empower the Commissioner when issuing a FHAN,  to\r\n\r\nrequire  the offender to take the necessary steps to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  re-occurrence  of  the  said  fire  hazard.   With  this\r\n\r\namendment,   SCDF   can   take   immediate   action   against\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant owners/occupiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals that I have presented today are necessary\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the Act remains relevant to our needs.   They\r\n\r\nwill  enable  us to maintain one of the highest  fire  safety\r\n\r\nstandards in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, I declare myself as a practising architect.  I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, it has always been a long and tedious\r\n\r\nprocess  for  the  professionals  to  obtain  building   plan\r\n\r\nclearance from the Fire Safety Bureau.  Usually it  takes  up\r\n\r\nto  two to three months or maybe even longer.  It was due  to\r\n\r\nthe  differences in the interpretation of grey areas  in  the\r\n\r\nFire  Code,  resulting  in time spent vetting  the  plans  in\r\n\r\ndetail   and   the   to-and-fro   discussions   between   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  the  Fire  Safety  officers.   With   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the amendment of section 23, new  subsection\r\n\r\n23(4),\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where an application for approval of the plans of fire\r\n\r\nsafety works under subsection (1) is accompanied by a written\r\n\r\ndeclaration  by the qualified person who prepared  the  plans\r\n\r\ndeclaring  that  the plans have been prepared  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  Fire  Code  adopted  under  section  55,  and  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this Act and any regulations made  thereunder,\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner may, without checking the plans, approve the\r\n\r\nplans  on  the  basis  of  the  written  declaration  by  the\r\n\r\nqualified person.\",\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  results in the time taken to approve the  plans  to  be\r\n\r\nshortened to less than a week.  This dramatic improvement  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  doing  away with the time-wasting  and  tedious\r\n\r\nprocess  necessary in the old system of vetting and  checking\r\n\r\nthrough  every plan submitted.  I must commend the tremendous\r\n\r\neffort  put  in  by the Fire Safety Bureau and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Architects in working out all the  details  and\r\n\r\nsafeguards that make this new submission procedure possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In safeguarding that there is no abuse to the new\r\n\r\nprocedure  under  the  same  section,  new  subsection  23(6)\r\n\r\nprovides that -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commissioner may at any time revoke any approval\r\n\r\ngranted in respect of any plans of fire safety works -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) under subsection (2) (a), if he is satisfied that\r\n\r\nany  information given in the application for approval or any\r\n\r\ndocument  submitted to the Commissioner  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\napplication  for approval is false in a material  particular,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) under subsection (4), if he is satisfied that the\r\n\r\nwritten   declaration  submitted  by  the  qualified   person\r\n\r\nreferred to in that subsection is false.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I think that this safeguard is necessary, and\r\n\r\nalthough  the Fire Safety Bureau and the Singapore  Institute\r\n\r\nof Architects have worked very hard in refining the grey area\r\n\r\nin  the Fire Code, there will always be problems arising  out\r\n\r\nof  the  different interpretation of the Code and not due  to\r\n\r\nthe  qualified  person  (QP)  intentionally  producing  false\r\n\r\ninformation or trying to violate the Code.  Even  though  the\r\n\r\nFSB  officers  have been very cooperative  in  granting  pre-consultation to the professionals, there may still  be  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  interpretation of the Fire Code differs.  And if  this\r\n\r\nsurfaces  after  the  building is  completed,  it  will  have\r\n\r\nserious and irreversible consequences, as it is stated in the\r\n\r\nnew  section  30A  wherein  the Commissioner  can  order  the\r\n\r\ndemolition,  removal, etc. of unauthorised fire safety  work,\r\n\r\nif  he  deems  that the building built has not  conformed  to\r\n\r\nregulations laid down by the Fire Code.  These include  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the plan has been certified by the QP and accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe SCDF during submission stage.  So, when the building\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  completed,  an application is made for  the  Fire  Safety\r\n\r\nCertificate.   If the Fire Safety Bureau or  SCDF  has  found\r\n\r\nthat  a  portion of the building which is built according  to\r\n\r\nthe  submitted plans cannot be accepted due to the  different\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  a certain clause in the  Fire  Code,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner can under section 30A order the affected part of\r\n\r\nthe  building to be demolished or removed.  It may  sometimes\r\n\r\ncreate an impossible situation as it is very difficult to  do\r\n\r\nso  in  order  to  comply  with  the  new  SCDF  requirement,\r\n\r\nespecially if it is a high-rise building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, let me give you an example. If the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the provision of minimum distance  between\r\n\r\ntwo   staircases   differs,  as  it  is  subject   to   other\r\n\r\nconsiderations  such  as provision of  external  ventilation,\r\n\r\nprovision  of fire doors, etc, and if the final  decision  by\r\n\r\nthe SCDF is that the distance falls short of the requirement,\r\n\r\nthen  it will be a very difficult situation for the owner  as\r\n\r\nit  may  not only be extremely costly to do any rectification\r\n\r\nat  that stage, but it sometimes may not be practical  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  Although there is a provision for an aggrieved person to\r\n\r\nmake  an appeal to the Minister under section 30C, it may  be\r\n\r\ntoo  late to dispute who has the correct interpretation,  and\r\n\r\nusually the FSB or the SCDF will win.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it would be most important that we ensure\r\n\r\nthat the Fire Code is so clear and precise that it leaves  no\r\n\r\nroom  for  different interpretation.  At this point,  I  must\r\n\r\ncommend  that  the SCDF and the Institute of Architects  have\r\n\r\nput  in  tremendous  work  in  drafting  the  handbook  which\r\n\r\naddresses  most  of these grey areas in the Fire  Code.   But\r\n\r\nthere should be constant review of the Code to ensure that no\r\n\r\nambiguity, especially those involving critical areas, is left\r\n\r\nunresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to request the Minister to look\r\n\r\ninto  an  area  which is not covered in this Amendment  Bill.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  old system, the developer has to pay  a  sizeable\r\n\r\nplan  fee  for  the plans to be processed.  It  is  justified\r\n\r\nbecause  much time and effort has to be made by  the  FSB  to\r\n\r\nprocess  all  the  plans submitted.  However,  now  that  the\r\n\r\nsystem has been streamlined and no vetting of plans is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeded  and no administration time is required, I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister can consider adjusting the plan fee accordingly.\r\n\r\nBesides,  under the new system, a fee has to be paid  for  an\r\n\r\nappeal for waiver is submitted anyway.  Therefore, it is only\r\n\r\nappropriate that the plan fee required under the  old  system\r\n\r\nbe reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to support the motion.  Before I proceed, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  declare  my interest.  I am one  of  the  qualified\r\n\r\npersons mentioned in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fire safety is one of the important issues for\r\n\r\nbuildings, especially for public buildings, because there  is\r\n\r\nrisk  of life in the event of a fire.  To ensure fire  safety\r\n\r\nwork  to be properly designed, built and maintained, the Fire\r\n\r\nSafety  professional, the qualified persons,  the  Registered\r\n\r\nInspector and the landlord must do their part to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe Fire Safety Act and the related Code of Practice.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  uncommon  for people to violate fire safety regulations.\r\n\r\nJust during the last Christmas shopping season, the Singapore\r\n\r\nCivil Defence Force had found that some shopping centres  did\r\n\r\nnot comply with the fire safety requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a free market economy like Singapore,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  try  to save cost and professionals  try  to  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  and lower their professional  fees.   Both  the\r\n\r\nbusiness cost and the professional fee could only be  lowered\r\n\r\nto   an   extent,  where  minimum  standards  of  the  safety\r\n\r\nspecifications  are still achievable, below which  they  will\r\n\r\nall  breach the Fire Safety Act and will be punishable  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   The Act must therefore be crafted in a  way  with\r\n\r\nsufficient deterrent measures which are effective  enough  to\r\n\r\ndeter  any person from violating the Fire Safety Regulations.\r\n\r\nThese  amendments  spell  out  the  type  of  punishment  and\r\n\r\ndisciplinary   action   against  the  Registered   Inspector,\r\n\r\nqualified person and the landlord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Registered Inspector, the newly added\r\n\r\npunishment for written warning, short-term suspension and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimposed  $5,000 penalty by the Commissioner of Civil  Defence\r\n\r\nForce are commendable.  The penalties imposed range from  low\r\n\r\nto  high  to  deal with the different degrees of severity  in\r\n\r\nbreaching  the fire safety requirements.  We do not  need  to\r\n\r\nwait  for an error or violation to be so great that a  person\r\n\r\nshould be punishable under the Professional Engineers Act  or\r\n\r\nthe  Architects Act with a fine of up to $50,000  and  to  be\r\n\r\nstruck  off  from the register.  With this new  measure,  the\r\n\r\nincorporation  of  a minor penalty, the Registered  Inspector\r\n\r\nhas  to be careful, regardless of the size and nature of  the\r\n\r\nwork.   By  doing so, the RI has to be more thorough  in  his\r\n\r\nwork and he will exercise care, even though it is a small job\r\n\r\nand with a small fee of only a few hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, when a person is\r\n\r\npenalised  under  this  particular minor  punishment  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Civil Defence Force,  is  the  person  also\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the disciplinary action under the Professional\r\n\r\nEngineers Act and the Architects Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended section 6A(7) states that in the absence of\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of an Inquiry Committee, the Commissioner  will\r\n\r\nappoint  an acting Chairman.  Section 6B(3) states  that  all\r\n\r\nthe members of the Inquiry Committee must be present in order\r\n\r\nto  constitute  a quorum of the Inquiry Committee.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask whether there is any conflict between these  two\r\n\r\nclauses.  The amendment focuses on the issue of investigation\r\n\r\nof  complaint  against the RI and whether he is guilty  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   However,  the Act is silent on  the  complainant.\r\n\r\nShould  the  complainant  also be subject  to  some  form  of\r\n\r\npunishment  if he makes a frivolous complaint  against  a  RI\r\n\r\nwithout any reasonable ground?  This will prevent people from\r\n\r\ntaking advantage of the Act to go against any RI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 23(4) is the implementation of the self-declaration for fire safety work by a qualified person. The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  will  approve the submission  plan  immediately\r\n\r\nwithout  checking.  This is a positive measure  to  speed  up\r\n\r\napplication work and could save a lot of money for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   landlord  who  is  desperate  for  time  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nconstruction  or renovation work.  This measure places  trust\r\n\r\non   the  qualified  person  and  also  puts  a  very   heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility on him.  This is because the qualified  person\r\n\r\ndesigns the work based on the code of practice.  This kind of\r\n\r\ncode will not be exhaustive in the coverage of all aspects of\r\n\r\nthe   work   involved.    Sometimes,   it   is   subject   to\r\n\r\ninterpretation  when there should be a  grey  area.   In  the\r\n\r\nolder  system,  the qualified person will wait for  approval.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  it  is  amended  in accordance  with  a  list  of\r\n\r\napproved conditions.   Under the new rules, if the grey  area\r\n\r\nshould  be spotted and declared as non-compliance,  the  risk\r\n\r\nwill be that they have to face additional costs, loss of  use\r\n\r\nand  also  the possibility of withdrawal of the  Fire  Safety\r\n\r\nCertificate after the completion of fire safety works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Commissioner will go after the\r\n\r\nqualified person but, in actual fact, the cost and  the  loss\r\n\r\nof  use  of  the premises are normally borne by the landlord.\r\n\r\nThe  latter may resist and delay the rectification  work  and\r\n\r\ncause  the  qualified  person to  commit  the  offence  under\r\n\r\nsubsection (9).  Could the Minister explain how the Bill will\r\n\r\ndeal  with these situations, as I have explained, so that  no\r\n\r\nparty involved could obstruct the measures taken in order  to\r\n\r\ncomply with the specific notice issued by the Commissioner?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of demolition and removal order under\r\n\r\nsection  30, it will be served to the landlord or the  tenant\r\n\r\nif the building had already been issued with a temporary fire\r\n\r\ncertificate.   However, the order is actually served  to  the\r\n\r\nqualified  person if the fire safety works are  in  progress.\r\n\r\nFor  the  latter,  in my view, the landlord  and  the  tenant\r\n\r\nshould  also be served with a similar order because they  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to be the party causing obstruction to the action  in\r\n\r\ncompliance with the demolition and removal order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 30B, it is mentioned that a premises could be\r\n\r\nissued  with  a closure order and the order could  be  lifted\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  is no mention about why a closure order is issued  and\r\n\r\non what grounds the order will be lifted.  Could the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain  the  rationale behind the closure order  in  section\r\n\r\n30B?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I thank the Members for supporting\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen is concerned about the grey areas of\r\n\r\ninterpretation after the building work is done.   I  am  sure\r\n\r\nFSB  in working together with the various professional bodies\r\n\r\nwill make sure that such problems do not regularly happen and\r\n\r\nthat  the Fire Safety Code is regularly reviewed to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  grey  areas  are clarified.  As  far  as  the  Code  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  can make it as explicit as  possible  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  cover  all eventualities.  But with  the  process  of\r\n\r\ndialogue which has been going on for a long time between  the\r\n\r\nvarious professional bodies and SCDF, I think this process of\r\n\r\nconsultation will continue to work well to improve  the  Fire\r\n\r\nSafety Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the plan fees, I would like to assure the\r\n\r\nMember  that  we  are not reaping all the  benefits  of  cost\r\n\r\nsavings  and not returning some of the savings to the parties\r\n\r\nconcerned.   Even  before  the  self-regulation  system   was\r\n\r\nimplemented,  it  has always been the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nqualified persons to ensure that the plans comply fully  with\r\n\r\nthe  fire  safety  requirements.  The self-regulation  system\r\n\r\nonly entrusted the qualified persons to take greater care  in\r\n\r\npreparing  their  plans  and  ensure  that  the  fire  safety\r\n\r\nreqirements  are  fully complied with.  But  with  the  self-regulation  system,  the FSB's efforts are  now  directed  at\r\n\r\nproviding consultation to the public and conducting  detailed\r\n\r\naudit  checks  on the plans that were submitted.   Plan  fees\r\n\r\nwere already revised and adjusted in September 1998 when  the\r\n\r\nself-regulation system was implemented to better reflect  the\r\n\r\nactual  resources used by the FSB.  Compared to the  previous\r\n\r\nplan  fees structure, I am told that the FSB's assessment  is\r\n\r\nthat  there is an average cost reduction of about 23% for  an\r\n\r\napplication.  So it is quite a substantial reduction in  view\r\n\r\nof the new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Prof. Low's questions, I will deal with them\r\n\r\nspecifically.  Firstly, with regard to whether the Registered\r\n\r\nInspector will be subject to disciplinary action by  its  own\r\n\r\nprofessional  body,  it  is  really  up  to  the   respective\r\n\r\nprofessional body to decide whether the Registered  Inspector\r\n\r\nhas   breached  or  contravened  any  of  the   board's   own\r\n\r\nregulations  or  provisions under the Professional  Engineers\r\n\r\nAct or the Architects Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the conflict about appointing an acting\r\n\r\nChairman and that section 6B(3) requires that all members  of\r\n\r\nthe Inquiry Committee must be present, I have been advised by\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General that there is no conflict between these\r\n\r\ntwo  clauses.  The acting Chairman, if so appointed, will act\r\n\r\nin  the capacity of Chairman for the Inquiry.  Together  with\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the members of the Inquiry Committee, they  will\r\n\r\nstill fulfill the requirement that all members of the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittee must be present to constitute the quorum.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure him and Members of the House that  the  same\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  been  appointed  to  sit  in  the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommittee will investigate the case from the beginning to the\r\n\r\nend.   The  Commissioner  would not exercise  his  powers  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute  the  Chairman, if that is what  he  is  concerned\r\n\r\nabout,  or  any  other member, if the Inquiry  Committee  has\r\n\r\ncommenced its proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether the complainant who makes\r\n\r\nfrivolous  complaints against a Registered Inspector  without\r\n\r\nany  reasonable  ground  should be  punished.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the current Bill for any action  to  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  any  person  who makes false  complaints  against  a\r\n\r\nRegistered  Inspector.  Even under the present law,  no  such\r\n\r\nprovision is in place and the Attorney-General's Chambers has\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  this  is also the case for  the  Professional\r\n\r\nEngineers Act and the Architects Act.  The check really  lies\r\n\r\nwith  the  SCDF  where  the Commissioner  must  exercise  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion  in screening the complaints to ensure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  not frivolous or that they are not without basis and the\r\n\r\nSCDF  is prepared to re-look into the issue if there  is  any\r\n\r\nevidence of abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also talked about the grey areas he spotted\r\n\r\nand  the additional cost involved, and he also alluded to the\r\n\r\npoint  that the landlord normally may want to resist or delay\r\n\r\nthe  rectification work causing the QP to commit the  offence\r\n\r\nunder  section  7(b).  I would like to explain  that  section\r\n\r\n7(b)  itself  is not amended.  But under section  23(7)(b)  - maybe he is referring to section 23(7)(b) instead - the order\r\n\r\nto   rectify  non-compliance  is  issued  to  the  owner  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  is in the owner's interest to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nrectification work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of points on the demolition order or\r\n\r\nremoval order under section 30,  which is being served on the\r\n\r\nlandlord  if  the  building has already been  issued  with  a\r\n\r\ntemporary fire certificate.  Prof. Low says that the order is\r\n\r\nserved  only  to a qualified person if the fire safety  works\r\n\r\nare  in progress and in the case of a completed building,  he\r\n\r\nthinks the landlord or tenant should also be served with  the\r\n\r\norder  because  he  is  likely to be the  party  causing  the\r\n\r\nobstruction  to the actions.   Let me assure  him  that,  for\r\n\r\ncases  where the fire safety works are in progress, the order\r\n\r\ncan  be served to either the owner or qualified person.   And\r\n\r\nin  practice, the SCDF serves the order on both the owner and\r\n\r\nthe qualified person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low's last point is on section 30B where he\r\n\r\nmentioned  that the premises could be issued with  a  closure\r\n\r\norder  and the order could be lifted later and that there  is\r\n\r\nno  mention at all why a closure order is issued and on  what\r\n\r\ngrounds  the  order would be lifted.  He wanted to  know  the\r\n\r\nrationale  behind  the closure order  in  section  30B.   The\r\n\r\nclosure  order would only be issued in a scenario  where  the\r\n\r\nowner refuses to comply with the order by the SCDF to rectify\r\n\r\nany non-compliance in the fire safety works and the situation\r\n\r\nis  such that the non-compliance will pose an imminent danger\r\n\r\nto  the  occupants of the building.  With the closure of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding, the Commissioner may then take action to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe rectification works and the closure order would be lifted\r\n\r\nwhen  the  necessary rectification works have been  completed\r\n\r\nand the building meets the fire safety requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions raised by the\r\n\r\ntwo Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year \"1999\" will be changed\r\n\r\nto \"2000\", as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 9 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.43 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill before the House seeks to amend the\r\n\r\nFactories   Act  to  introduce  provisions  to  enhance   the\r\n\r\nframework  for  self-regulation and  to  improve  safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth standards at factories and other workplaces.  The Bill\r\n\r\nalso  seeks  to  extend the scope of the Act  to  cover  more\r\n\r\nworkplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past 10 years, the industrial\r\n\r\naccident  situation  has improved.   In  1990,  the  accident\r\n\r\nfrequency  rate was 4.0 accidents for every million man-hours\r\n\r\nworked.   It  fell  to  2.5 accidents per  million  man-hours\r\n\r\nworked  in 1998, which is a reduction of about 40%.  I cannot\r\n\r\nuse the more recent figure for 1999\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause the statistics have not been finalised yet.  So I  am\r\n\r\ncomparing it to the 1998 figure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the improvement was seen across the board even in\r\n\r\nindustries,   such  as  shipbuilding,  ship   repairing   and\r\n\r\nconstruction.   The  marine industry, for  example,  suffered\r\n\r\n12.2  accidents  per million man-hours worked  in  1990.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  there  were  only 6.1 accidents per million  man-hours\r\n\r\nworked, which is an improvement of 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the construction industry, the accident\r\n\r\nfrequency rate also fell from 3.7 in 1990 to 2.7 in 1998,  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  about  30%.  These  improvements  could   be\r\n\r\nattributed  to  the implementation of safety regulations  and\r\n\r\nimproved  self-regulation by the industries.   Despite  these\r\n\r\nimprovements,  we  must continue with  our  efforts  to  make\r\n\r\nworkplaces safer for all workers.  We must bear in mind  that\r\n\r\ncurrent  safety  performance  is  still  below  that  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.   For example, the  accident  frequency\r\n\r\nrate  for  Japan in 1997 was only 2.08 accidents per  million\r\n\r\nman-hours  worked compared to Singapore's 2.6  accidents  per\r\n\r\nmillion  man-hours  worked for the same  year.  One  area  of\r\n\r\nparticular concern is that we still see many fatal  accidents\r\n\r\nin the construction industry. The number of fatalities in the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry had increased to 73 in 1998 from 36  in\r\n\r\n1990.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasize, right from the onset,\r\n\r\nthat  legislation  alone  will not resolve  the  problems  of\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health  at the workplace.  The  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  be  complemented by the  employers'  strong\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  the  safety and health  of  their  employees.\r\n\r\nEmployers and management must, therefore, take ownership  and\r\n\r\nset  their agenda to improve safety and health conditions  at\r\n\r\nthe workplace.  Supervisors and workers must also be alert to\r\n\r\nworkplace hazards and learn to work safely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic framework to get the industries to self-regulate has been put in place for some time. Since then, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  been  actively  promoting  self-regulation  in\r\n\r\nindustry and implementing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  help factory occupiers and employers  towards\r\n\r\nthis objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Act will further enhance\r\n\r\nthis  framework by introducing provisions to require  factory\r\n\r\noccupiers  to  take  a more pro-active role  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nsafety and health of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the key amendments in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Factories Act to expand\r\n\r\nthe interpretation of \"factories\" to include any premises  in\r\n\r\nwhich mechanical power is used in sorting, packing, handling,\r\n\r\nor  storing of articles which is carried out by way of  trade\r\n\r\nor  incidental  to  other  businesses.   Currently,  the  Act\r\n\r\ncontains  a provision to cover workers involved in this  kind\r\n\r\nof  work,  that  is,  the  sorting, packing  or  handling  of\r\n\r\narticles  in a warehouse only where such work is carried  out\r\n\r\nas  a  business  or  by way of trade.  In  other  words,  the\r\n\r\nwarehouse must be a commercial warehouse taking in the  goods\r\n\r\nfor storage for and on behalf of customers.  However, whether\r\n\r\nthe  warehouses where such activities are being  carried  out\r\n\r\nare  in  the  warehousing business or just  a  company's  own\r\n\r\nwarehouse to store its own products or materials, workers are\r\n\r\nactually  exposed  to  the  same  kind  of  hazards.      The\r\n\r\nMinistry, therefore, proposes to expand the scope of the  Act\r\n\r\nto include warehouses or open yards where such activities are\r\n\r\ncarried  out and where mechanical power is used.   Warehouses\r\n\r\nwhere  no  mechanical  power  is  used  are  obviously   less\r\n\r\nhazardous  to  the  workers. Hence,  the  amendment  excludes\r\n\r\npremises which are essentially stores where articles are kept\r\n\r\nincidental to business activities and no mechanical power  is\r\n\r\nused  at  all.  The  extension of the Act  will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  exposed  to occupational  hazards  in  all\r\n\r\nwarehouses  and  open storage areas where mechanical  devices\r\n\r\nare in use would be adequately protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers engaged in the maintenance work on the MRT and\r\n\r\nLRT  tracks,  ie, for repair or maintenance  of  the  railway\r\n\r\ntracks,  including  viaducts  and  tunnels,  are  exposed  to\r\n\r\nvarious hazards such as falling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  the  place  of  work, or hazards  posed  by  electrical\r\n\r\nequipment  and  also  moving vehicles on  the  tracks.   Such\r\n\r\nworkers  should  also be accorded protection under  the  Act.\r\n\r\nClause  2 of the Bill will amend the Act to cover maintenance\r\n\r\nwork on the MRT and LRT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 creates a new section 24A to require occupiers\r\n\r\nof  factories to establish and implement a \"Lock-out\"  system\r\n\r\nto  prevent  accidental activation of machinery or equipment.\r\n\r\nThis  consists of a device to lock-out the power source  such\r\n\r\nas  an  electricity supply, and a related set  of  procedures\r\n\r\nusing  special  tags  or additional locks  to  indicate  that\r\n\r\nworkers  are  still engaged in the work.  Such  a  system  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  ensure that any plant, machinery  or  equipment\r\n\r\nthat   is   under  inspection,  cleaning,  repair  or   other\r\n\r\nmaintenance work would not be inadvertently switched  on,  or\r\n\r\nactivated in any way that might endanger the workers involved\r\n\r\nin the repair or the maintenance work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, we had two mechanics trying to clear a\r\n\r\nchoke in a machine. They had actually deactivated the machine\r\n\r\nby  turning off the isolation switch to the machine.  One  of\r\n\r\nthem  had  to  leave the job to attend to a  related  matter.\r\n\r\nWhen  he returned, he assumed the choke had been cleared  and\r\n\r\nswitched on the power supply to the machine. This resulted in\r\n\r\nthe  amputation  of a finger of the other  mechanic  who  was\r\n\r\nstill  working  on  the machine. With the  \"Lock-out\"  system\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in  this amendment, a lock or some other  suitable\r\n\r\ndevice would have been used to indicate that someone is still\r\n\r\nworking  on  the machine and therefore power to  the  machine\r\n\r\nshould  not  be turned on.  We would then have prevented  the\r\n\r\naccident.   Hence,  we are moving towards this  direction  of\r\n\r\nrequiring \"Lock-out\" mechanisms to be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 creates a new section 27A to require occupiers\r\n\r\nof  factories  to ensure that certain categories  of  persons\r\n\r\nemployed  in a factory are given safety training.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nInspector  is empowered to specify the training  courses  and\r\n\r\nthe  categories of persons, such as managers of  construction\r\n\r\nprojects\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  wafer  fabrication plants, supervisors of processes  that\r\n\r\npose  specific risks, and workers who have to work in tunnels\r\n\r\nand  other confined spaces.   Such training for employees  or\r\n\r\nworkers is fundamental to workplace safety and health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 creates a new section 47A that prohibits the\r\n\r\ncommencement of any hazardous work specified in a new Twelfth\r\n\r\nSchedule,  unless  certain  specified  precautions  had  been\r\n\r\ntaken.   These  include  identifying  the  hazards  to  which\r\n\r\npersons  at the workplace could be exposed, setting out  safe\r\n\r\nwork  procedures,  and implementing safety  measures  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of work and during an emergency. For example, if  work\r\n\r\nis  to  be  done in a confined space where there is  risk  of\r\n\r\nsuffocation  or  fire or explosion, then procedures  such  as\r\n\r\ncarrying out the necessary tests on the air quality, briefing\r\n\r\nworkers  on the nearest emergency exit, and measures such  as\r\n\r\nproviding  adequate  ventilation  and  continuous  monitoring\r\n\r\nshould be undertaken before commencement of the work itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 re-enacts section 49 to provide additional\r\n\r\npowers and penalties -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to reinstate the power of the Chief Inspector under\r\n\r\nthe repealed section 48 to stop the use of machinery or plant\r\n\r\nin a factory;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to raise the maximum penalty for failure to comply\r\n\r\nwith  an  order  under the section, that is,  a  \"stop  work\"\r\n\r\norder,  which requires the occupier to remedy the  danger  to\r\n\r\npersons  or to stop any process or work in the factory.   The\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty will be an increase in the current  fine  of\r\n\r\n$10,000  to  $200,000;  or  to imprisonment  of  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding one year instead of the current term of 6 months or\r\n\r\nto  both.   In the case of a continued offence,  that  is,  a\r\n\r\n\"stop work\" order has been issued but the occupier disregards\r\n\r\nthe  \"stop  work\" order and carries on with  the  work,   the\r\n\r\npenalty  would  then be increased from a fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$1,000  per day to a fine not exceeding $20,000 per  day.  To\r\n\r\nput this in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperspective,   the  maximum  fine  under  the   Act   for   a\r\n\r\ncontravention  that  results in two  or  more  fatalities  is\r\n\r\n$200,000. Therefore, the proposed fine is in keeping with the\r\n\r\nseverity  of the offence and will deter any factory  occupier\r\n\r\nfrom  deliberately  violating such a \"stop  work\"  order  and\r\n\r\nknowingly  putting workers at risk because in many instances,\r\n\r\nthe  liquidated  damages for any delay in a project,  or  the\r\n\r\nlosses  due to suspended production are far more costly  than\r\n\r\nthe existing fine of just $10,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to empower the Chief Inspector of Factories to take\r\n\r\nappropriate  measures to prevent unauthorised  entry  to  any\r\n\r\narea, or unauthorised access to any machinery affected by the\r\n\r\norder;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to empower a police officer or an inspector\r\n\r\nauthorised  in  writing  by  the Chief  Inspector  to  arrest\r\n\r\nwithout  warrant any person who contravenes  the  section  by\r\n\r\nentering  areas, or gaining access to machinery  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe order, without the authorisation of the Chief  Inspector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 creates three new sections, 70A, 71B and 71C.\r\n\r\nThese  will  empower  the Minister to  require  occupiers  of\r\n\r\ncertain factories -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to appoint a safety co-ordinator, with suitable\r\n\r\nqualifications and training, to promote the safe  conduct  of\r\n\r\nwork generally within a factory, under the new section 71A;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to implement a safety management system to ensure\r\n\r\nthe  safety, and to protect the health and welfare of persons\r\n\r\nemployed, under the new section 71B; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to appoint a competent person (who must be approved\r\n\r\nby  the  Chief  Inspector of Factories) to  conduct  periodic\r\n\r\nsafety  inspections, carry out the recommendations  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  the  inspections  and  to  submit  the  report  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetent person to the Chief Inspector when required,  under\r\n\r\nthe new section 71C.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 creates a new section 78A to empower the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  require occupiers of factories to  comply  with\r\n\r\nprescribed Singapore Standards and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCodes of Practice published by the Singapore Productivity and\r\n\r\nStandards Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 amends section 85 to increase the maximum\r\n\r\npenalty for obstructing an inspector in the execution of  his\r\n\r\nduties under the Act from a fine not exceeding $2,000 to  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding  3\r\n\r\nmonths to a term not exceeding 6 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 amends section 88 -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to provide under subsection (2) that any person\r\n\r\nwho  contravenes  any  provision of  the  Act  or  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation made under the Act is guilty of an offence;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to empower the Chief Inspector, under subsection\r\n\r\n(3),  instead of the Commissioner, to authorise an  inspector\r\n\r\nto  arrest without  warrant, any employed person who wilfully\r\n\r\ninterferes  or misuses any means or appliances  for  securing\r\n\r\nthe health and safety of workers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to extend the provision relating to corporate\r\n\r\noffences  under subsection (13) to cover offences under  both\r\n\r\nthe  parent  Act  as  well as offences under  the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation  made  under the Act, instead  of  covering  only\r\n\r\noffences under the Act; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) introduce a new subsection (14) to make every\r\n\r\npartner in a partnership liable for any offences committed by\r\n\r\nthe partnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the other provisions on penalties were\r\n\r\nintroduced  more  than 20 years ago, that is,  the  penalties\r\n\r\nstipulated  in the existing Act were nearly two decades  old.\r\n\r\nBesides the penalties which I have mentioned earlier, we have\r\n\r\nalso  reviewed  other  provisions to  ensure  that  penalties\r\n\r\nremain  effective  deterrents and help to better  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety of workers at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 amends section 89 -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to increase the maximum penalty for offences under\r\n\r\nsubsection  (1)  from $1,000 to $2,000  and  from  $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$5,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for contravention which is likely to cause death or\r\n\r\nbodily  injury  to any person, to increase the  maximum  fine\r\n\r\nfrom $10,000 to $20,000;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for contravention which results in a dangerous\r\n\r\noccurrence  or  serious  bodily  injury  to  any  person,  to\r\n\r\nincrease the maximum fine from $25,000 to $35,000; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to provide for an enhanced penalty of up to twice\r\n\r\nthat  provided under the Act if the offender is convicted  of\r\n\r\ncommitting  an  offence  in  the same  designated  categories\r\n\r\nlisted  in the Fourteenth Schedule for a second or subsequent\r\n\r\ntime.   These  include offences arising from persons  falling\r\n\r\nfrom  height as a result of failure to provide barricades,  a\r\n\r\nsafe  work  platform or workplace; falling  objects  injuring\r\n\r\nworkers;  electrocution, just to name a few.   Investigations\r\n\r\ncarried out by my Ministry indicated that the majority of the\r\n\r\nfatal accidents could be attributed to these examples which I\r\n\r\nhave  just mentioned.  We have recorded instances where  such\r\n\r\naccidents  recurred because the occupier of a  factory  or  a\r\n\r\nworksite  did  not  seem  to  learn  the  lesson  from   past\r\n\r\naccidents.   They  continued to allow  unsafe  conditions  to\r\n\r\nremain and suffer a second accident as a result.  My Ministry\r\n\r\ntherefore  proposes  that the fines  for  such  offenders  be\r\n\r\ndoubled  as  an added deterrent.  There is no reason  why  an\r\n\r\noccupier  should allow an unsafe situation which had  already\r\n\r\nresulted  in  an  accident to be continued  and  for  another\r\n\r\naccident  to be repeated.  We hope that the enhanced  penalty\r\n\r\nfor  those  situations listed in the new Fourteenth  Schedule\r\n\r\nwill deter employers/occupiers from allowing unsafe situation\r\n\r\nat the workplace to continue, and to take immediate action to\r\n\r\nrectify  and  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of  such   unsafe\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 amends section 90 to increase the maximum fine\r\n\r\nfrom $300 to $1,000 per day for non-compliance of an order of\r\n\r\nthe Court to remedy a contravention under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 amends section 91 to increase the maximum\r\n\r\npenalty  for  any forgery of certificate, false  entries  and\r\n\r\nfalse declarations from $2,000 to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the Chief Inspector may compound any\r\n\r\noffence  under  the  Act for an amount not exceeding  $1,000.\r\n\r\nComposition has proven to be an effective and efficient means\r\n\r\nof  persuading  occupiers to take prompt  action  to  rectify\r\n\r\nunsafe  conditions.  To further enhance the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthis  enforcement option, the Ministry proposes  to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  maximum compound fine to $2,000.

Radiant heat is generated by  furnaces\r\n\r\nor similar processes.  Similar to lighting or humidity, it is\r\n\r\none of the factors that may affect workers' health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 amends section 104 to limit the circumstances\r\n\r\nin  which  the  Minister may amend the  Fourteenth  Schedule.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  Schedule  listing  out  all  the  offences  or\r\n\r\ninfringements under which a repeat offence can  result  in  a\r\n\r\ndouble  penalty.   This Schedule, as I  said,  sets  out  the\r\n\r\nclasses   of  offences  for  which  a  second  or  subsequent\r\n\r\nconviction  carries an enhanced fine under  the  new  section\r\n\r\n89(6).   The  new subsection (2) provides that the Fourteenth\r\n\r\nSchedule cannot be amended to include new offences or classes\r\n\r\nof  offences,  or to change the classification  of  offences.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  new  subsection (3) makes it  clear  that  the\r\n\r\nFourteenth  Schedule  may  be amended  for  the  purposes  of\r\n\r\ncorrecting    cross-references,   re-numbering    or    other\r\n\r\nconsequential changes.  In other words, the list of  offences\r\n\r\nwhich  will attach a heavier penalty for a repeat offence  is\r\n\r\nfixed,  as it is now in the Bill and it cannot be just  added\r\n\r\non without coming back to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 amends the Fourth Schedule by adding three\r\n\r\nother  classes  of  dangerous occurrences:  in  other  words,\r\n\r\nincidents  that  must  be reported to  the  Chief  Inspector.\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Failure or collapse of form-work or its supports;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Collapse in part or in whole of a scaffold\r\n\r\nexceeding  15 metres in height or of a suspended scaffold  or\r\n\r\nhanging  scaffold from which a person may fall a distance  of\r\n\r\nmore than 3 metres;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Accidental seepage or entry of seawater into dry or\r\n\r\nfloating  docks  resulting in flooding of  the  dry  dock  or\r\n\r\nfloating dock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also contains other amendments that are\r\n\r\nmade  for  the purpose of bringing the Act up-to-date.   They\r\n\r\nare  mostly  of a technical nature.  Explanations  for  these\r\n\r\namendments can be found in the Explanatory Statement  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, I support the  Bill\r\n\r\nmoved by the Minister for Manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Factories Act, in order to expand\r\n\r\nthe  coverage  of this legislation, in areas  not  previously\r\n\r\ncovered,  such  as  MRT and LRT tracks, and warehouses  where\r\n\r\nmechanical  power  is  used, are  indeed  timely.   The  work\r\n\r\nenvironment  is  changing rapidly, with  development  of  new\r\n\r\ntechnology and the creation of new types of occupations,  the\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation will therefore need  to  keep  up  with\r\n\r\nthese changes.  However, I would like to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  eventually transforming the Factories Act  into  an\r\n\r\nOccupational  Safety and Health Act so that all  work  areas,\r\n\r\nand not just factories\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand the limited areas currently defined in the Factories Act,\r\n\r\ncan  also be covered by the relevant safety provisions in the\r\n\r\nAct.  For example, new section 27A of the Bill regarding  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  safety training for employees  could  then  be\r\n\r\napplied  to  cover domestic workers at their work  places  in\r\n\r\nhigh  rise  homes  in  order to reduce or  eliminate  mishaps\r\n\r\ninvolving  falls from windows or balconies in the  course  of\r\n\r\ntheir  work.   There has been a sharp rise in the  number  of\r\n\r\nsuch mishaps.  We are aware that the Ministry of Manpower has\r\n\r\nalready  taken  measures to promote safety  awareness   among\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers and their employers.   However,  if\r\n\r\nthese  measures do not achieve their desired  results,   then\r\n\r\nmandatory  safety training, as stipulated in new section  27A\r\n\r\nof the Bill, should be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the revision of the penalties imposed for\r\n\r\nthe  various offences under the Factories Act.  As  mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister, many of these penalties were enacted  more\r\n\r\nthan  20  years ago, and it has not been updated.  A revision\r\n\r\nof  these  outdated penalties would make them more  effective\r\n\r\nand relevant to present day situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new sections 71A, 71B and 71C empower the Minister\r\n\r\nto  make  it  mandatory  for  occupiers  of  any  factory  to\r\n\r\nimplement  safety  management  systems  and  also  to  employ\r\n\r\ncompetent  safety  coordinators and  appropriately  qualified\r\n\r\nsafety  auditors  and  to carry out regular  inspections  and\r\n\r\naudits to ensure the safety, health and welfare of the people\r\n\r\nemployed in the factory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety objectives of such provisions in the Bill are\r\n\r\nquite  obvious.   However, the provisions should  not  be  so\r\n\r\nonerous  that it would hinder operational efficiency and  add\r\n\r\nunnecessary  costs.   Requiring  factories  that  engage   in\r\n\r\nrelatively  low hazard activities to implement  sophisticated\r\n\r\nsafety management systems and employ safety coordinators  and\r\n\r\nsafety auditors, adds very little value to the safety of such\r\n\r\nfactories  but  may  add significantly to  the  cost  of  its\r\n\r\noperations.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould therefore like to urge the Minister to be judicious  in\r\n\r\ngazetting factories that would be required to comply with the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  new sections 71A, 71B and 71C.  Consideration\r\n\r\nshould  be given not just to the size of the factory and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of workers it employs, but also, more importantly,  to\r\n\r\nthe hazard level of its activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, new section 47A of the Bill\r\n\r\nstipulates that safe work procedures must be employed  before\r\n\r\nany  activity  can  commence in any  factory  or  potentially\r\n\r\nhazardous work environment specified in the Twelfth  Schedule\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.   Among the safety measures  listed  are  that\r\n\r\nhazards and potential harm to which persons at the work place\r\n\r\ncould  be  exposed  as  a result of  such  work  have  to  be\r\n\r\nidentified  and that appropriate measures must  be  taken  to\r\n\r\neliminate  these hazards.  Workers should also be made  aware\r\n\r\nof safe work procedures, safety precautions and actions to be\r\n\r\ntaken  during  an  emergency and they must be  provided  with\r\n\r\nproper  personal protective equipment.  But most importantly,\r\n\r\nevery  person  must  observe and comply with  the  safe  work\r\n\r\nprocedures in a potentially hazardous work environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the legislation of safe work\r\n\r\nprocedures  in  such  work  environment.   But  I  share  the\r\n\r\nMinister's view that the problem of safety in the work  place\r\n\r\ncannot be resolved solely by enactment and strict enforcement\r\n\r\nof the law.  The efforts of the Government must be matched by\r\n\r\na  strong determination by employers and management to ensure\r\n\r\nthe  safety of their workers through self-regulation.  Unions\r\n\r\nand  workers must also play their part by adopting safe  work\r\n\r\nprocedures complying with safety regulations and by taking an\r\n\r\nactive part in creating a safe work environment at their work\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of the Factories (Amendment) Bill moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that this Factories (Amendment) Bill is\r\n\r\nlong  overdue considering the fact that some of the items  in\r\n\r\nthe current Act has not been revised as far back as 1973,  or\r\n\r\nabout 27 long years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of such items is defying a stop work order which\r\n\r\ncarries, among other stipulations, a maximum fine of $10,000.\r\n\r\nThe amendment Bill seeks to increase the penalty for such  an\r\n\r\noffence to $200,000 and also double the imprisonment term  to\r\n\r\na year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other provisions to increase penalties\r\n\r\nranging  from approximately a 40% increase from  the  current\r\n\r\nquantum to a three or four-fold increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support the increased penalties in view of\r\n\r\nthe increased number of fatal accidents over the last several\r\n\r\nyears,  particularly involving errant contractors failing  to\r\n\r\ntake  adequate measures to protect workers' safety,  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if the Minister could explain why the  proposed\r\n\r\npenalty   for defying a \"stop work\" order has been raised  by\r\n\r\n20 times, and also why it took 27 long years for this penalty\r\n\r\nto  be  revised rather than raising it incrementally  as  the\r\n\r\nneed arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For repeat offenders, especially those who have caused\r\n\r\ndeaths  due to deliberate safety negligence at work sites,  a\r\n\r\nmandatory jail sentence should also be considered in addition\r\n\r\nto the proposed higher penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the enhancement of penalties generally serve well\r\n\r\nas  a deterrent, I personally believe that such measures  may\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily go a long way in preventing accidents at the\r\n\r\nwork  place.   This  view  is also  that  of  several  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in the GPC for Manpower.  Sir, I think  paramount\r\n\r\nto  instilling proper sense of Occupational Safety and Health\r\n\r\n(OSH)  at  the workplace is continuous education of employers\r\n\r\nand  workers.   It  is a widely known fact that  we  are  now\r\n\r\nmoving into a knowledge-based economy in which people will be\r\n\r\nthe key competitive factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSafeguarding  the  safety and health of our  workforce  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  become  even  more  critical.   To  motivate  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  perform  at their best at  all  times,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinually  accord priority consideration to  their  safety,\r\n\r\nhealth and general well being.  They must feel good and  safe\r\n\r\nknowing  that great care has been taken to ensure  that  they\r\n\r\nare in the best work place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower 21 has introduced bold and exciting initiatives\r\n\r\ngeared  to  place  Singapore in a strategic  position  as  we\r\n\r\nemerge  from the economic crisis into the new millennium.   I\r\n\r\nam  glad to note that one of the  key aspects of Manpower  21\r\n\r\nis  Occupational Safety and Health 21 (OSH 21) and  that  the\r\n\r\nprogramme has considered various improvements to the  current\r\n\r\nOSH  system, in addition to identifying strategies and  areas\r\n\r\nof  focus to propel Singapore towards realising our vision of\r\n\r\nhaving the best OSH standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that future OSH activities must not\r\n\r\njust  be about preventing accidents but also take on  a  more\r\n\r\ndevelopmental and proactive approach in tackling  safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth  issues  so as to maximise our overall potential.   It\r\n\r\nshould  lead  to  a new national OSH culture.  Responsibility\r\n\r\nfor OSH hazards must be placed  on the shoulders of those who\r\n\r\ncreate  the  risk,  such  as  architects  and  developers  of\r\n\r\nbuildings,   as  well  as  designers  and  manufacturers   of\r\n\r\nmachinery and equipment, who must ensure that the safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth  of  the workers will be adequately safeguarded.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower should clearly communicate  this  major\r\n\r\nchallenge  that  our  organisations  and  employers  need  to\r\n\r\nshoulder in dealing with OSH issues in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Safety Performance Awards (ASPA) scheme which\r\n\r\nwas  introduced in 1986 to give recognition to companies that\r\n\r\nhave  achieved excellent safety performance should  be  given\r\n\r\nexpanded  coverage  and  used as  an  education  platform  to\r\n\r\npropagate  the  importance of OSH.  OSH Excellence  and  Gold\r\n\r\naward winners should share their experiences and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuccessful implementation of their safety management  systems\r\n\r\n(SMS)  in  the  light  of the proposed  framework  for  self-regulation  by industries.  Since there is a requirement  for\r\n\r\nthe  safety  management systems of companies to be  gradually\r\n\r\naudited, my concern is for smaller establishments which  need\r\n\r\nguidance  and time to prepare themselves to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the revised Act.  How will the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower deal with this issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from recognition at the Annual Safety Performance\r\n\r\nAward  ceremonies,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  should  also\r\n\r\nconsider devising incentives to encourage best practices  and\r\n\r\nrecognise  companies  that  have  consistently  put  in  good\r\n\r\nefforts to improve work environment and prevent  injuries  at\r\n\r\nthe work place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, workers who have shown exemplary safety\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and  responsibility at the work  place  should\r\n\r\nalso  be made role models and accorded proper recognition  to\r\n\r\nmotivate  others.  It must be made a requirement for  workers\r\n\r\nto  make  safety  at their work place a part of  their  daily\r\n\r\nroutine  and priority, and continually reinforce in them  the\r\n\r\nimportance of adopting safe work procedures at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another question that comes to mind is whether the\r\n\r\namended  Act  sufficiently addresses the  safety  and  health\r\n\r\nissues  in  new industries in Singapore, such  as  the  wafer\r\n\r\nfabrication and the bio-technology industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of foreign domestic workers engaged in window\r\n\r\ncleaning  has been given much public airing lately.   My  GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,  Mr  Charles Chong, has spoken at  length  on  this\r\n\r\ntopic  earlier.   I hope the Ministry of Manpower could  also\r\n\r\nconsider introducing legislation to provide for the safety of\r\n\r\nsuch  employees  either  under  the  Factories  Act  or   the\r\n\r\nimpending Occupational Safety and Health Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a whole, the Act should ideally aim at making all\r\n\r\nworkplaces  safe  instead  of confining  it  to  specifically\r\n\r\ndefined work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplaces.    Its   ultimate  aim  should  be  such   that   all\r\n\r\nconstituents  responsible for bringing about  safety  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  -  be it the Government, employers or employees  - are  motivated  to work together to do their  best  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout the highest level of safety at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, we are rapidly\r\n\r\ntransiting  into a knowledge-based economy.   It  will  be  a\r\n\r\nworld  in  which  economic value is derived from  the  active\r\n\r\ngeneration and application of knowledge, a world where  human\r\n\r\ncapital  forms  the new basis for wealth.   Safeguarding  the\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health of our workforce should therefore  become\r\n\r\nmore  important than ever.  It is essential not only to train\r\n\r\nour workforce in new technical skills and knowledge, but also\r\n\r\nto  cultivate  the  humanistic respect for  human  lives  and\r\n\r\ndignity.   There is no excuse whatsoever for  any  worker  to\r\n\r\nlose his life or become permanently disabled in an industrial\r\n\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we discuss the amendments to the Factories Act today,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to accelerate\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of its Occupational Safety and Health  21\r\n\r\nprogramme,  which  aims at transforming the work  environment\r\n\r\nand  propelling  as many Singapore companies as  possible  to\r\n\r\nachieve world class OSH standards in the new millennium.   An\r\n\r\nenhanced  and  transformed  work  environment  will  help  to\r\n\r\ninstill a new national OSH culture, which not only will raise\r\n\r\nproductivity  and participation rates of our  workforce,  but\r\n\r\nwill  also  increase the competitiveness  of  businesses  and\r\n\r\nprovide for a better quality of life for the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, once again, Sir, I support the Factories\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  for today be exempted at this day's sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nstand   to  support  the  Factories  (Amendment)   Bill.    I\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly support especially the part of the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nfurther ensures the safety of factory workers.  I would like,\r\n\r\nhowever,  to seek clarifications on certain aspects regarding\r\n\r\nthe safety of workers in factories and comment on some of the\r\n\r\namendments to the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how does the Ministry monitor and ensure that all\r\n\r\nthe  factories  using  hazardous materials  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nsafety  precautions  required in the use of  such  materials,\r\n\r\nespecially  of  new  chemicals?  There are  new  advances  in\r\n\r\ntechnology all the time and as such, new chemicals and  other\r\n\r\nsubstances  are constantly being churned out for use  in  our\r\n\r\nfactories.   Section  60A  in  the  Factories  Act   provides\r\n\r\nregulatory  control  on  the  use  of  toxic,  corrosive  and\r\n\r\ninflammable  substance under the Material Safety Data  Sheet.\r\n\r\nHow  does  the  Ministry enforce this regulation,  especially\r\n\r\nwith  regard to new materials used?  Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhow  does the Ministry keep track and recognise adverse  side\r\n\r\neffects that these materials may possess?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 60A(3), the fine for contravening the\r\n\r\naforesaid  regulation has not been changed from  $5,000.   Is\r\n\r\nthis  an  oversight, in view of the increasing  relevance  in\r\n\r\nthis  area with more newer, possibly toxic, substances  being\r\n\r\navailable due to improved technology?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in the Factories Act (section 69)\r\n\r\nrequiring  all factory workers that are exposed to  hazardous\r\n\r\nmaterials to go for regular medical check-ups.  How does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  ensure that the exposed workers go for  the  check-ups?   Furthermore, how does the Ministry help the  factories\r\n\r\ndetermine \"at risk workers\" that should go for regular check-ups?   Sir,  I have encountered factories sending  all  their\r\n\r\nstaff,  including  their  managers,  who  do  not  deal  with\r\n\r\nhazardous   substances,  for  regular  check-ups   for   such\r\n\r\nsubstances, and thereby adding unnecessary costs to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  healthcare expenditure.  How does the Ministry  decide\r\n\r\non  the interval on the compulsory medical check-ups required\r\n\r\nby  the  workers for each hazardous substance?  How does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   balance  the  safety  aspect  of  each   hazardous\r\n\r\nsubstance  with the cost for the factories?  Furthermore,  is\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  providing  designated  factory  doctors   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  continuous updates and education on new  hazardous\r\n\r\nmaterials  approved by the Ministry so as to ensure  adequate\r\n\r\ncheck-ups   through  appropriate  blood   tests   and   other\r\n\r\ninvestigations on their factory patients?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, how does the Ministry help to\r\n\r\neducate  both  the  management and the workers  on  the  side\r\n\r\neffects of the hazardous materials?  Here, the age-old  adage\r\n\r\n\"prevention  is  better  than cure\"  is  most  apt.   If  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  were  aware  of the harmful  effects  of  certain\r\n\r\nsubstances,  they  would  be more  inclined  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary protection for their workers.  If the workers  know\r\n\r\nabout  the  adverse effects of certain substances  that  they\r\n\r\nhandle  each  day,  they will certainly be more  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  safety measures that  are  prescribed  and\r\n\r\nprovided.   Take, for example, the use of earmuffs  at  noisy\r\n\r\nfactories  to  prevent noise-induced deafness.  Most  workers\r\n\r\ncomplain  of  discomfort or inconvenience in  their  use  and\r\n\r\noften  ignore the advice given.  They will probably  be  more\r\n\r\ncompliant  if  they realise how easily they  may  suffer  the\r\n\r\ndebilitating effects of noise-induced deafness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the measures taken by the Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  protection  of  expectant  mothers  in   the\r\n\r\nhandling   of   materials  that  may  cause  abnormality   to\r\n\r\ndeveloping  foetuses?  Do we compel our factories  to  inform\r\n\r\nour  female  workers  on the dangers  to  their  newborns  in\r\n\r\ncertain  hazardous  factory jobs?  This  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nexpectant   mothers  cease  holding  such  jobs  from   early\r\n\r\npregnancy,  that these teratogenic effects take place  during\r\n\r\ntheir  early weeks of pregnancy must be highlighted to  these\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can enlighten me on the queries I\r\n\r\nhave posed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to comment on some of\r\n\r\nthe amendments in the Factories (Amendment) Bill as follows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 6 - I believe that the word\r\n\r\n\"liquified\"  appearing in section 6(2)(m) also  needs  to  be\r\n\r\namended to read as \"liquefied\" similar to section 6(2)(t).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 9 - I feel that some flexibility\r\n\r\nhas  to  be given for the fixed period of one month.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  substitution should read as \"one month or such  extended\r\n\r\nperiod as the Chief Inspector may approve in writing\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 27A - I feel that these words \"if so\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Chief  Inspector  in  writing\"  should  be\r\n\r\ninserted  immediately after these words, \"The occupier  of  a\r\n\r\nfactory  shall\", appearing on line 31.  It is  difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe  occupier of a factory to know whether his employees fall\r\n\r\ninto that class or description, unless some form of notice is\r\n\r\nsent  to  him  by  the  Chief Inspector indicating  that  his\r\n\r\nemployees  do  fall  within  that category  requiring  safety\r\n\r\ntraining courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 47A - I note that section 47A(1) (d) and\r\n\r\n(3)(b)  require  employees to be  made  familiar  and  to  be\r\n\r\ninformed  on  the  safe work procedures and means.   Further,\r\n\r\nsection 47A (4) states that a written description of the safe\r\n\r\nwork  procedures  shall  be  kept  by  the  occupier  or  the\r\n\r\nemployer.   As  such,  I  feel that section  47A  (5)  should\r\n\r\nprovide  that the occupier of the factory or the employer  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  ensure that every person in  the  factory  will\r\n\r\nobserve  and  comply with the procedures.  Sir, the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  47A (5) does not seem to impose such a duty  on  the\r\n\r\noccupier  or  employer.   Also  I  wonder  whether  the  word\r\n\r\n\"inspector\"  appearing on the last line of  section  47A  (4)\r\n\r\nrefers  to  the  Chief Inspector.  If it is,  why  not  state\r\n\r\n\"Chief Inspector\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 88 - Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Manpower if the new section 88(14)  is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary.   I ask because the law on partnership  is  clear,\r\n\r\nand we have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPartnership Act (Chapter 391) covering this situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 89 - as the explanatory note\r\n\r\nstates, this new section 89(6) is to enhance the penalty  for\r\n\r\nsecond or subsequent conviction.  However, one may note  that\r\n\r\nall  other subsections have provided that additional fine per\r\n\r\nday  could  be  imposed for further offence if  contravention\r\n\r\ncontinues  after the conviction.  As such, I  wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthe  enhanced penalty, that is, the amount of fine in the new\r\n\r\nsubsection 6, includes the additional fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I stand to support the Factories (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I thank\r\n\r\nall  the  hon.  Members for speaking up in  support  of  this\r\n\r\namendment to the Factories Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now respond to the various comments and queries\r\n\r\nthat Members have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Chairman of the GPC for Manpower, Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong,  asks  whether  we  would  consider  transforming  the\r\n\r\nFactories Act into an Occupational Safety and Health  Act  to\r\n\r\ncover  all work areas.  The answer is yes.  This is, in fact,\r\n\r\none of the recommendations of the Manpower 21 Committee.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  has recommended that Government consider  enacting\r\n\r\nan Occupational Safety and Health Act to cover all workers at\r\n\r\nwork.   Government  has  accepted  this  recommendation.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is,  in  fact, studying the  requirements  and  the\r\n\r\nimplications of creating such a legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Occupational Safety and Health Act will obviously\r\n\r\ncover  a  wider group of workers and cover more  work  places\r\n\r\nthan  the  existing Factories Act, even after this  amendment\r\n\r\nbefore the House.  Currently, the Factories Act covers  about\r\n\r\n700,000  employees.  If we adopt an Occupational  Safety  and\r\n\r\nHealth  Act  for  all work places, conceivably  we  could  be\r\n\r\ncovering in the region of 2 million or more workers.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare, in fact, working on this piece of legislation, and as  I\r\n\r\nsaid earlier on, studying the various implications and how to\r\n\r\ngo  about formulating such a legislation.  We expect the  new\r\n\r\nlaw  to  be ready by sometime next year.  But for the moment,\r\n\r\nwe  are still proceeding with this amendment to the Factories\r\n\r\nAct  because we cannot wait till the new Occupational  Safety\r\n\r\nand  Health Act is in position.  In the interim, the  amended\r\n\r\nFactories  Act will provide better protection for workers  at\r\n\r\ntheir work place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong suggested that we should consider\r\n\r\nwhether  to bring in the work places of the domestic workers,\r\n\r\nin other words, the home, under the coverage of the Factories\r\n\r\nAct,  or in the future when we enacted an Occupational Safety\r\n\r\nand  Health  Act, to include homes so that domestic  workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the foreign domestic workers, are not exposed to\r\n\r\ndangers of falling from windows while they are cleaning high-rise  windows.   I think Mr Ahmad Magad has also  touched  on\r\n\r\nthis aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we share the concern of Members for the safety of\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers working in the homes of their employers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, particularly if they have to clean windows in high-rise  dwellings.   We  have  considered  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  address this issue.  But we  concluded  that\r\n\r\nlegislation is, in fact, not the best approach to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  There was, in fact, a question raised  by  Mr\r\n\r\nKenneth  Chen  at  this sitting's Question for  Oral  Answer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  time  did  not  permit  me  to  answer   this\r\n\r\nQuestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say in response to both Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong  and  Mr  Ahmad  Magad  is that  domestic  workers  are\r\n\r\nemployed  in  residential premises to do  ordinary  household\r\n\r\nchores.   They are not trained and we cannot expect  them  to\r\n\r\nundertake  risky jobs, unlike construction workers and  other\r\n\r\nworkers working in factories.  In fact, there is no necessity\r\n\r\nfor a foreign domestic worker to be asked to climb out of the\r\n\r\nwindow in order to clean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  window or to be standing up in a precarious position  to\r\n\r\nclean the windows of high-rise flats.  There are available on\r\n\r\nthe  market  cleaning  implements with handles  that  can  be\r\n\r\nextended  which will enable a domestic worker to  clean  both\r\n\r\nthe  exterior and the interior of the windows safely, without\r\n\r\nexposing herself to any risk of falling from the window.   So\r\n\r\nemployers  of  foreign domestic workers  should  teach  their\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers and provide them with the right  implements\r\n\r\nto  undertake this window cleaning job, and they  should  not\r\n\r\nrequire  or  ask them to clean the window in a  dangerous  or\r\n\r\nhazardous  manner.  It is not quite the same as  construction\r\n\r\nworkers.   There is no recourse but the construction  workers\r\n\r\njust  have  to work on a worksite, in an incomplete  building\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  many hazards present.  It is  unavoidable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to bring them within the coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nFactories  Act  or,  in future, the Occupational  Safety  and\r\n\r\nHealth  Act  (OSHA)  to ensure that they  are  given  maximum\r\n\r\nprotection, for instance, requiring them to use safety  belts\r\n\r\nor  safety  harnesses if they are working on the  edge  of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  if  there  is a danger  of  falling  from  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic workers are not in the situation at all. They\r\n\r\nare  in  the safe home environment of their employers.   They\r\n\r\nshould  not be exposed to the risk.  Therefore, it would  not\r\n\r\nbe quite appropriate to cover them under the Factories Act or\r\n\r\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act.  I have been informed\r\n\r\nthat  other  countries  which  have  introduced  Occupational\r\n\r\nSafety  and  Health  Act,  such as  US,  Canada,  Sweden  and\r\n\r\nGermany,  have  also excluded domestic work  from  such  law.\r\n\r\nThey  have  already considered this issue and they have  felt\r\n\r\nthat domestic work should not be part of an OSHA legislation.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should adopt the same position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the domestic workers being exposed to\r\n\r\nrisks  at the place of work in their employer's home is  best\r\n\r\naddressed   through  proper  public  education   by   raising\r\n\r\nawareness  among the employers and their domestic workers  of\r\n\r\nsome of the hazards that can be found in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir home, such as cleaning windows.  We should educate  the\r\n\r\nemployers and domestic workers so that they know what is  the\r\n\r\nsafe  way  of  cleaning windows.  There is no reason  to  put\r\n\r\nthemselves  at  risk.  I believe that with  sustained  public\r\n\r\neducation  both employers and domestic workers can  learn  to\r\n\r\nwork  out  safe  procedures to carry out all  their  domestic\r\n\r\ntasks.  There will be no need for further legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chong also supported the section requiring\r\n\r\nfactories  to  implement safety management  systems,  appoint\r\n\r\nsafety  coordinators, conduct safety audits and have  regular\r\n\r\ninspections.   This  is  in clause 20 and  the  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsections  71A,  71B  and 71C.  But he questioned  whether  by\r\n\r\nrequiring  such  an intensive or elaborate  safety  framework\r\n\r\nwould   add  costs  to  all  employers,  particularly   those\r\n\r\ncompanies  that are not involved in hazardous  work  or  deal\r\n\r\nwith  hazardous substances.  I share his view.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.   We  should be rational.  We should not be over-zealous\r\n\r\nin   implementing   our  safety  regulations.    Our   safety\r\n\r\nregulations  should  be  applied in a  focused  and  targeted\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will identify factories which have the highest risks,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  using hazardous chemicals and ensure  that  these\r\n\r\nfactories impose the most stringent safety management system,\r\n\r\nregular  inspection and safety audit in order to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  all  their  workers.   Whereas  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nfactories  with very few hazards or no hazard at all,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to impose such a heavy requirement on them.   They\r\n\r\nneed   not  be  gazetted  under  the  category  of  factories\r\n\r\nrequiring  safety management system.  But they can employ  or\r\n\r\nappoint one of their employees to act as a safety coordinator\r\n\r\nto deal with various safety and health issues in the factory.\r\n\r\nThis safety coordinator could be one of the existing managers\r\n\r\nor  supervisors, and it would of course be part of his  other\r\n\r\nduties.   And it would certainly not add to the cost for  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  That is the approach that we would take and it  is\r\n\r\na  sensible and rational way of requiring industries to adopt\r\n\r\nthe  new  safety management system.  It is not an across-the-board blunderbuss kind of approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor  instance, even for construction worksites which are,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, quite dangerous for the workers, we have certain\r\n\r\ncriteria.   For example, they must have a contract  value  of\r\n\r\n$10  million or more before we require them to implement  the\r\n\r\nsafety  management system because the value  of  the  project\r\n\r\nindicates the complexity and is very often the height of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.  If you build a low-rise building, a single  storey\r\n\r\nbuilding, it is unlikely to cost a lot of money.  But if  you\r\n\r\nbuild a multi-storey building, then it is going to cost  tens\r\n\r\nof  millions  or  even hundreds of millions of  dollars.   In\r\n\r\nwhich  case, you must have a more elaborate safety management\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of shipyards, if they employ 200 or more\r\n\r\nworkers, we will require them to employ external auditors  to\r\n\r\nregularly  audit  their safety management system.   Likewise,\r\n\r\nexternal  auditors or safety auditors will only  be  required\r\n\r\nfor  construction projects which are in excess of $30 million\r\n\r\nor more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to Mr Ahmad Magad. Mr Magad also\r\n\r\nsupports the Bill.  He feels that some of the amendments  are\r\n\r\nlong  overdue.  Yes, we could have amended them  earlier  on,\r\n\r\nbut  perhaps  at  that point in time, it was  felt  that  the\r\n\r\npenalties  were adequate and the situation did not warrant  a\r\n\r\nrevision,  particularly the various penalties.   Now  is  the\r\n\r\ntime  to  address some of these issues which is  why  we  are\r\n\r\nprompted  to  review  the whole Factories  Act  dealing  with\r\n\r\nvarious  provisions.   In fact, some of the  provisions  were\r\n\r\nactually introduced earlier on by way of regulation.  But  in\r\n\r\norder to give them a stronger force of law and to ensure that\r\n\r\nnon-compliance will constitute an offence, we have decided to\r\n\r\nbring   in  some  of  these  provisions,  particularly  self-regulation into the main Act itself.  So it is not as  if  we\r\n\r\nhave not done anything to amend the Act.  In 1995, we had  in\r\n\r\nfact  amended the Act to beef up various provisions.  We have\r\n\r\nalready introduced, as I said earlier on, various regulations\r\n\r\nto  improve  the  safety  situations,  particularly,  in  the\r\n\r\nshipyard and the construction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also mentioned the large increase in penalty\r\n\r\nfor occupiers who defy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  \"stop work\" order.  Under the existing Act, occupiers  who\r\n\r\nviolate  a  \"stop  work\"  order, in  other  words,  a  safety\r\n\r\nviolation had been detected on the premises and we had issued\r\n\r\na  \"stop  work\" order to protect the workers but the employer\r\n\r\npersisted   in   continuing  with  the  work  and   therefore\r\n\r\nendangering  his  workers,  the  existing  penalty  is   only\r\n\r\n$10,000.   The amendment before this House seeks to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  penalty to a maximum of $200,000.  Let me point out that\r\n\r\na  \"stop work\" order is only issued when a workplace is found\r\n\r\nto be unsafe and workers are being exposed to severe risks or\r\n\r\naccidents  by continuing to work on such an unsafe  worksite.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when an employer deliberately violates or flouts a\r\n\r\n\"stop  work\" order, he is actually putting the worker's  life\r\n\r\nand limb at risk.  We feel that, under these circumstances, a\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine of $10,000 is not adequate for such  a  blatant\r\n\r\ndisregard for the workers' safety and health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons is that in the case of, let us say,\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry, the  construction  projects  are\r\n\r\nplanned  on a very tight schedule and the developer or  owner\r\n\r\nof  the  building under construction often imposes liquidated\r\n\r\ndamages  on  the  contractors.  And some of these  liquidated\r\n\r\ndamages  could range from $1,000 to more than $50,000  a  day\r\n\r\nfor any delay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with enforcement of the Factories Act in\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry, for example, shows that it takes,\r\n\r\non average, about seven to 10 days for contractors to rectify\r\n\r\nthe safety defects on their worksite and then we can lift the\r\n\r\n\"stop  work\" order and they can resume work.  In other words,\r\n\r\nin  certain construction projects, the liquidated damages can\r\n\r\neasily  accumulate to more than $200,000  in  excess  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting fine of only $10,000.  This could result in tempting\r\n\r\nsome contractors, for instance, in the industry who receive a\r\n\r\n\"stop  work\"  order to disregard the order and carry  on  the\r\n\r\nwork.  In fact, the penalty is much less than what they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay to the developer by way of liquidated  damages.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, my Ministry has found\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthree  contractors  who had blatantly  violated  \"stop  work\"\r\n\r\norders issued by the Chief Inspector of Factories.  The  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore proposes to raise the penalty for violation of  the\r\n\r\n\"stop  work\"  order by increasing the fine  to  $200,000,  or\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or  both.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is necessary in order to ensure that contractors\r\n\r\nor  factory occupiers who are served with \"stop work\"  orders\r\n\r\ndo  not take this lightly and do not continue to endanger the\r\n\r\nsafety and health of their employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also asked whether we would consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  mandatory jail sentences for  repeat  offenders.\r\n\r\nSir,   presently,  the  Factories  Act  does  not  have   any\r\n\r\nprovisions  with  mandatory  jail  sentences.   But  it  does\r\n\r\ncontain provisions to enable offenders to be penalised  by  a\r\n\r\nfine, or a jail sentence, or both a fine and a jail sentence.\r\n\r\nSir, generally, contravention of the Factories Act arises  as\r\n\r\na  result  of  failure of the employer or  occupiers  of  the\r\n\r\nfactory  to take measures, such as the provisions of personal\r\n\r\nprotective   equipment,  proper  work   platforms,   suitable\r\n\r\nbarricades or similar means to ensure the safety of  workers.\r\n\r\nFailure   to  take  measures  or  provide  necessary   safety\r\n\r\nprovision  is  generally  an  act  of  omission  rather  than\r\n\r\nintentional  malice.  In such circumstances, I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  present penalty under the Act would serve as an adequate\r\n\r\ndeterrent.  The court will evaluate the evidence presented in\r\n\r\neach  case and mete out the appropriate penalty.  Whether  it\r\n\r\nshould  include a prison term or not should be  left  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt  to  decide.   Generally, if an accident  resulting  in\r\n\r\ndeath  or  serious  bodily injury was caused  by  a  rash  or\r\n\r\nnegligent act of any person, my Ministry could also work with\r\n\r\nthe  Police  to charge the person under the Penal Code  which\r\n\r\ncarries more severe penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the factors and circumstances leading to an\r\n\r\naccident are varied.  Therefore, the option of mandatory jail\r\n\r\nsentences  as  a  deterrent has to be considered  with  great\r\n\r\ncaution.   Nevertheless, where the circumstances warrant,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  certainly  press  for  deterrent  sentences,\r\n\r\nincluding sentencing repeat offenders to jail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also emphasised the importance of moving\r\n\r\ntowards an occupational safety and health approach to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  working environment which is ideal, a concept  which  we\r\n\r\nfully  support.   And as I said earlier on, the  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nstudying  this issue and we will look into how  to  enact  an\r\n\r\nOSHA legislation some time next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad suggested giving extended or better coverage\r\n\r\nfor  the  various  safety  awards  that  are  being  made  to\r\n\r\nhighlight the good or best practices by various employers.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with him.  In fact, this is something that my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  been  doing.  We will be giving recognition to companies\r\n\r\nthat have good safety records, and the best practices through\r\n\r\nour  annual  safety performance award.  And  more  than  just\r\n\r\ngiving  the  awards to factories that have good  records,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been actively organising seminars and talks by inviting\r\n\r\nthe  award winners back to participate in these seminars  and\r\n\r\ntalks  and inviting other employers or managements  from  the\r\n\r\nsame industry to attend these talks so that the experience of\r\n\r\nthe  company  that  has  got good practice  and  good  safety\r\n\r\nrecords can be shared with the other employers.  In that way,\r\n\r\nwe can extend the benefits of best practices to all the other\r\n\r\nemployers  in the same industry.  This is something  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry takes on very earnestly and we would continue to  do\r\n\r\nso  to  propagate the benefits from best practices  that  are\r\n\r\nalready tested in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider his suggestion about highlighting\r\n\r\nthe  importance of workers who have been able to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nsafe working environment, holding them up as role models  for\r\n\r\nother  workers.  In fact, this is very important  and  it  is\r\n\r\nbest done within the companies. Each company should highlight\r\n\r\ntheir  own  employees  who  have contributed  to  the  safety\r\n\r\nperformance of the company and give recognition to their  own\r\n\r\nemployees, for instance, the Safest Worker for the  Month  or\r\n\r\nthe  Safest  Worker for the Week, so that  their  efforts  to\r\n\r\nensure   work  safety  for  all  their  fellow  workers   are\r\n\r\nrecognised and noted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether the amendment would deal with the\r\n\r\nnew  hazards  introduced  by new industries,  such  as  wafer\r\n\r\nfabrication,  bio-technology and other  new  industries  that\r\n\r\nmight  be  coming  in the pipeline. The answer  is  yes.  The\r\n\r\nFactories  Act  itself is non-specific  in  that  sense.   It\r\n\r\napplies  to  all the industries but we can use the provisions\r\n\r\nto  deal with any new hazards that might arise in the  course\r\n\r\nof economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the points raised by Dr Lily Neo. She\r\n\r\nsupported  the  amendment but asked how  the  Ministry  would\r\n\r\nmonitor  factories which are using hazardous  chemicals.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, how would we know that a factory is using hazardous\r\n\r\nchemicals and therefore they should implement certain  safety\r\n\r\nprocedures?  In fact, all factories are required,  under  the\r\n\r\nFactories  Act, to be registered with the Chief Inspector  of\r\n\r\nFactories.   Before  they start work  in  establishing  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  building up their factory,  they  are  already\r\n\r\nrequired  to  inform the Chief Inspector. When  applying  for\r\n\r\nregistration, the factory occupier must submit the  necessary\r\n\r\ninformation,  including  a list of  all  the  chemicals  used\r\n\r\nwithin  the  premises,  and they must  include  the  Material\r\n\r\nSafety Data Sheet of all the chemicals that are likely to  be\r\n\r\nused on the premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 60A(2) of the Factories Act requires factory\r\n\r\noccupiers  and  employers  to obtain  the  relevant  Material\r\n\r\nSafety  Data Sheet (MSDS) of hazardous substances,  including\r\n\r\nnew  chemicals  which  they may use in the  course  of  their\r\n\r\noperation  later  on.   This  MSDS  contains  information  on\r\n\r\ntoxicity, health effect and all the safety measures that have\r\n\r\nto  be  taken in connection with workers who are  exposed  to\r\n\r\nsuch chemicals.  This information should be made available to\r\n\r\nall  employees  on  the  premises who are  exposed  to  these\r\n\r\nchemicals  and  are, therefore exposed to  the  hazards.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment of Industrial Health checks the list of  chemicals\r\n\r\nto  identify the high-risk factories and to place them  under\r\n\r\nan industrial hygiene monitoring programme and the Department\r\n\r\nof Industrial Safety will then send inspectors out to conduct\r\n\r\nregular inspections to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncheck on the effectiveness of the control measures introduced\r\n\r\nor applied by the employers or occupiers of the premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also checks for compliance with the MSDS\r\n\r\nrequirements at the time of factory registration as  well  as\r\n\r\nduring   subsequent  inspections.  For   instance,   if   the\r\n\r\nprospective  occupier  tells  us  that  they  are   using   a\r\n\r\nparticular  chemical that requires a special  set  of  safety\r\n\r\nprecautions, we would check that in the design and layout  of\r\n\r\nthe  factory  and  the  installation of  the  machinery,  the\r\n\r\nappropriate   safety   measures  and   precautions   can   be\r\n\r\nincorporated.  Checks are also made on the  accuracy  of  the\r\n\r\ninformation in the MSDS provided by the supplier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked why is it that with all the penalties\r\n\r\nbeing  revised,  there  is a particular  penalty  in  section\r\n\r\n60A(3) of a fine of $5,000 for non-compliance by the supplier\r\n\r\nfor  not providing adequate and accurate information  in  the\r\n\r\nMSDS  which, in this amendment, we have not amended it.   Let\r\n\r\nme  point out that this fine was introduced only recently  in\r\n\r\nthe  1995 amendment of the Factories Act and, in our  current\r\n\r\nreview, we felt that since it was only introduced in 1995, it\r\n\r\nis  still effective as a deterrent.  There is no real need to\r\n\r\nincrease  the penalty unlike the case of some other  offences\r\n\r\nwhere  we  have revised the penalties because they  were  set\r\n\r\nalmost 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo wanted to know how the Ministry ensures that only\r\n\r\nthe  workers who are at risk or exposed to various  hazardous\r\n\r\nchemicals go for regular medical check-ups and how to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat such medical examinations are in fact cost-effective and\r\n\r\nare  not  just  conducted on every worker,  even  though  the\r\n\r\nperson may not be exposed to the chemicals.  Sir, workers are\r\n\r\nrequired to undergo specific medical examination if they  are\r\n\r\nemployed  in any hazardous occupation listed under Regulation\r\n\r\n2  of  the  Factories (Medical Examinations)  Regulations  to\r\n\r\nensure  that they remain fit for work within that  particular\r\n\r\nfactory  or  working environment. An example of  a  hazardous\r\n\r\noccupation is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none  which  involves the use or handling of  or  exposure  to\r\n\r\nfumes,  dust or vapour of arsenic, cadmium or lead.  All  the\r\n\r\nvarious   hazardous   chemicals  are   identified   and   the\r\n\r\nRegulations  would  spell  out which  are  the  companies  or\r\n\r\noccupiers  who have to take special notice.  If the employers\r\n\r\nare  not  sure which workers they should send for the medical\r\n\r\nexamination,  they  can  always  consult  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial Health. We will advise them on who are the workers\r\n\r\nwho need to be sent for this medical examination on a regular\r\n\r\nbasis.   The employer may also consult the designated factory\r\n\r\ndoctors.  We have appointed about 600-odd designated  factory\r\n\r\ndoctors  throughout the whole island who serve  employers  in\r\n\r\nvarious  factories  and  other  places  which  use  toxic  or\r\n\r\nhazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the workplace is identified to have a low exposure\r\n\r\nto  the  hazards  that  are listed in  the  Regulations,  the\r\n\r\nfrequency  of  medical  examination may  be  reduced  or  the\r\n\r\nfactory  itself may be exempted from having to  send  workers\r\n\r\nfor  such medical examination.  And to date, we have exempted\r\n\r\n178  factories from medical examination required  under  this\r\n\r\nRegulation.  If an employer has any doubt, please consult the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Industrial Safety. We would provide the  advice\r\n\r\nand  if  it  is  found that in that particular  factory,  the\r\n\r\nmedical examination is really not necessary, we would  exempt\r\n\r\nthe  factory  so that the employer does not incur unnecessary\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also update all the designated factory doctors by\r\n\r\nsending   out  circulars  and  conducting  regular   briefing\r\n\r\nsessions for them so that they are kept informed of  the  new\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  various industry  practices,  particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  new  chemicals  or new processes  are  introduced  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, we would update the factory doctors so  that  they\r\n\r\nare  well  informed and knowledgeable about the changes  that\r\n\r\nare taking place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also wanted to know how the Ministry helps to\r\n\r\neducate  both the management and the workers on side  effects\r\n\r\nof  hazardous  materials.  We  recognise  the  importance  of\r\n\r\neducation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  workers, occupiers or employers. As I said right at  the\r\n\r\nonset  in my Second Reading speech, legislation alone is  not\r\n\r\nadequate.   For us to succeed in creating a safe and  healthy\r\n\r\nworking  environment,  we need the full  commitment  of  both\r\n\r\nemployers  and  workers.  And to help employers  and  workers\r\n\r\nbetter  understand  the hazards of the various  chemicals  or\r\n\r\nother  risks that they are being exposed to at the workplace,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  conducts training courses for safety  officers,\r\n\r\nsafety  committee  members and the  workers  themselves.  The\r\n\r\neffect  of  hazardous materials which they may be exposed  to\r\n\r\nare  covered  in  these safety courses.   The  Department  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health  also  conducts  workshops  and  talks  in\r\n\r\nfactories  on topics such as handling of hazardous  chemicals\r\n\r\nand  dealing with various hazards at workplaces. In addition,\r\n\r\nduring  routine  factory inspections,  our  inspectors  would\r\n\r\nhighlight various safety aspects of materials that  are  seen\r\n\r\nto  be used or being handled by workers in the factory.  They\r\n\r\nwould   highlight  the  danger,  risk  and  also  the  safety\r\n\r\nprocedures  involved  in handling such  materials.   We  also\r\n\r\npublish  extensive  educational pamphlets and  best  practice\r\n\r\nguidelines  on various occupational health topics  which  are\r\n\r\nthen  distributed to workers, management and to  occupational\r\n\r\nhealth personnel during factory inspections and at our safety\r\n\r\nseminars and talks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also pointed out the question of spelling. I\r\n\r\nmust  compliment her on her eagle's eye to have noticed  this\r\n\r\nlittle discrepancy in the way the word \"liquefied\" was  spelt\r\n\r\nin  section 6(2)(m).  It was spelt with an \"i\" instead of  an\r\n\r\n\"e\".   We have, in fact, introduced an amendment but we  have\r\n\r\noverlooked section 6(2)(m). I thank her for pointing  it  out\r\n\r\nto  us.   But  I understand the word \"liquefied\", spelt  with\r\n\r\neither  an  \"i\"  and  \"e\",  is both acceptable  although  the\r\n\r\nspelling  with an \"i\" is considered obsolete and the  present\r\n\r\nmodern  form is to spell it with an \"e\".  But that is besides\r\n\r\nthe  point.  We should amend section 6(2)(m), as pointed  out\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Neo,  to make it consistent with the other provisions\r\n\r\nwhich have used the spelling of \"liquefied\".  As this is only\r\n\r\na question of spelling which will not affect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe substance of section 6(2)(m), I suggest that we leave  it\r\n\r\nto the Law Revision Commissioner under the Revised Edition of\r\n\r\nLaws  Act  to correct this spelling error. The Factories  Act\r\n\r\nwould  probably  be revised by the Law Revision  Commissioner\r\n\r\nsometime towards the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo asked for a flexible period for occupiers to\r\n\r\nsubmit  their  applications for factory  registration.   Sir,\r\n\r\nunder the Act, it is an offence for a person to occupy or use\r\n\r\nany premises as an unregistered factory. The existing section\r\n\r\n9(2)   of  the  Act  stipulates  that  the  application   for\r\n\r\nregistration  of factories shall be submitted not  less  than\r\n\r\ntwo  months before the operation of the factory. This was set\r\n\r\nsometime ago to allow the Department of Industrial Safety  to\r\n\r\nprocess  the  application  and  to  issue  a  certificate  of\r\n\r\nregistration  to  the factory occupier before  they  actually\r\n\r\ncommence operation. This amendment seeks to reduce the period\r\n\r\nof  two  months to one month which is already an  improvement\r\n\r\nbecause  the two months means that they have to get ready  so\r\n\r\nmuch  more in advance of the actual operation.  Now,  we  are\r\n\r\ngiving them one month's advance notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo asked whether we could give them a shorter period\r\n\r\ninstead  of  a minimum of one month. The question is  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Department of Industrial Safety would have the  time  to\r\n\r\nassess  their  application and to consider all the  potential\r\n\r\nhazards   that  might  arise  from  the  operation  of   this\r\n\r\nparticular factory, or the safety precautions that need to be\r\n\r\ntaken.   And if we do not have sufficient time to go  through\r\n\r\nit  thoroughly, then we would be under pressure to allow  the\r\n\r\nfactory  operator,  who  has  made  millions  of  dollars  of\r\n\r\ninvestment,  to commence operation before we can clearly  say\r\n\r\nthat  his factory is a safe place for our workers.  We  would\r\n\r\nprefer to stick to the present minimum period of one month to\r\n\r\nensure  that we have adequate time and opportunity to make  a\r\n\r\nthorough assessment of the application to ensure that by  the\r\n\r\ntime  all  factories start operation, the question of  safety\r\n\r\nwould  have been thoroughly studied and dealt with.  I  would\r\n\r\nurge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDr  Neo  to  support this amendment to keep it at  one  month\r\n\r\nwhich would, in fact, lead to a safer working environment for\r\n\r\nall our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has asked whether occupiers would be informed if\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  comply  with the provision  to  send  certain\r\n\r\ncategories  of  their employees for training  under  the  new\r\n\r\nsection  27(A).  Sir,  the  answer  is  yes.   If  the  Chief\r\n\r\nInspector  wishes  to specify the class or description  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  who has to attend the prescribed training course,  he\r\n\r\nhas  to  make  an order to be published in the Gazette  under\r\n\r\nsection  27A  (2).  Sufficient details would be  provided  to\r\n\r\nenable  the industry to meet these provisions.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  assure  the  Member that my Ministry will also  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  action  to  inform  relevant  employers  of   this\r\n\r\nrequirement.   We  would make the effort to  inform  all  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  employers who need to send their  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nexposed to certain hazards for training courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo suggested amending section 47A to ensure that\r\n\r\nevery person in a factory would observe and comply with  safe\r\n\r\nwork procedures.  The objective of the new section 47A is  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that occupiers and employers set up a safe working\r\n\r\nprocedure for the workers and adequately inform them  on  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  actions, including measures and ways to carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  work safely.  It would not be reasonable to hold every\r\n\r\nperson  in  a  factory responsible for the action  or  unsafe\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of every other person.  In the event of  a  worker\r\n\r\nwho  fails  to  follow the safe work procedure and  puts  his\r\n\r\nfellow  workers at risk, he could be taken to task under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  sections 80 and 81 of the Factories Act.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, there are already existing provisions when someone who\r\n\r\nmisuses an appliance, which has been provided for the  health\r\n\r\nand  safety of his fellow workers, could be taken to task and\r\n\r\ncould  be penalised for such misuse.  If a worker contravenes\r\n\r\nthe  Act by wilfully endangering himself and that of his  co-workers, there is also a provision under section 81  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith such wilful endangerment of his fellow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers.   We  already  have this provision  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nworkers pay attention to safe work procedures.  And if in our\r\n\r\ninspection of any factory we come across a situation where we\r\n\r\nnotice such a violation, we would certainly take action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked what is the intended meaning of the\r\n\r\nword  \"inspector\"  in section 47A(4). The intention  of  this\r\n\r\nprovision is to require the occupier of a factory or employer\r\n\r\nto  keep  a  copy of the safe work procedures and to  produce\r\n\r\nthis  for the perusal of the inspector who is inspecting  the\r\n\r\nfactory.   The  word  \"inspector\"  here  would  include   any\r\n\r\ninspector from the Department of Industrial Safety, including\r\n\r\nthe Chief Inspector himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the need for section 88(14), let me point out\r\n\r\nthat  under section 88(13) of the Factories Act, the existing\r\n\r\nprovision covers company, co-operative society and the office\r\n\r\nbearers such as Director, Chairman, Secretary, etc.  However,\r\n\r\npartnership  is  not  included under the  provision.   Hence,\r\n\r\nsection 88(14) is being introduced in this amendment to cover\r\n\r\npartnership and to make every partner liable under  the  Act.\r\n\r\nWe  should  make this completely clear to all occupiers  that\r\n\r\neven as a partner in a partnership operating a factory, every\r\n\r\nsingle  partner  is  equally liable for  the  safety  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers and employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also enquired whether the new provision under\r\n\r\nsection 89(6) covers a continuing offence.  The provision  to\r\n\r\npenalise an offender for a continued offence after conviction\r\n\r\nis stipulated in section 89(2) of the Act. Therefore, when an\r\n\r\noffender  is convicted under the new section 89(6)  with  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  penalty,  the provisions for  a  continued  offence\r\n\r\nwould  still apply. The Court may impose a fine not exceeding\r\n\r\ntwice of that provided for under section 89(2) for every  day\r\n\r\nduring which the offence is continued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that I have dealt with all the points\r\n\r\nraised by the Members.  Once again, I wish to thank them  for\r\n\r\nsupporting the Factories (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nelaborate  and  comprehensive answers.   Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfurther  enlighten me on my question about the protection  of\r\n\r\nexpectant  mothers,  with special regard to  the  teratogenic\r\n\r\neffect of certain hazardous materials in our factories?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, my apology for\r\n\r\noverlooking  this point. Where substances are known  to  have\r\n\r\nreproductive  health  effect,  the  information  would   have\r\n\r\nalready  been  included in the Material  Safety  Data  Sheet.\r\n\r\nFactory  occupiers and employers are required  to  note  such\r\n\r\ninformation  and  to take the necessary measures  to  prevent\r\n\r\nhazardous  exposure  of their pregnant female  workers.  They\r\n\r\nmust also communicate it to their workers who are exposed  to\r\n\r\nthese chemicals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has provided guidelines to designated\r\n\r\nfactory doctors on the management of women who are exposed to\r\n\r\nsubstances with established reproductive health risks such as\r\n\r\nlead  and mercury.  The designated factory doctor may  advise\r\n\r\nthe  occupier  to  re-deploy the female  employees  to  avoid\r\n\r\nfurther  exposure once it is found that she is  pregnant  and\r\n\r\nher normal work would entail her working with such chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe  employer is required to comply with the advice given  by\r\n\r\nthe   designated  factory  doctor.  This  would  ensure  that\r\n\r\npregnant  workers are properly protected and are not  exposed\r\n\r\nto any chemicals or substances that may have an impact on the\r\n\r\nunborn child.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether we have a\r\n\r\nregulation that compels the employers to inform employees  to\r\n\r\nstop  work  as  soon as they are pregnant because  we  cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  on  designated factory doctors.  A lot of  time,  the\r\n\r\ndesignated  factory doctors do not know who are the  patients\r\n\r\nthat are involved with such hazardous materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier in response to another\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint,  when the factory applies for registration,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave known what are the chemicals that they use and where  we\r\n\r\nnotice  from the MSDS that some of the chemicals may have  an\r\n\r\nimpact on reproductive health, we would highlight this to the\r\n\r\nfactory  occupiers' attention so that subsequently,  if  they\r\n\r\nknow  they  have  women workers, they would have  to  monitor\r\n\r\nwhether  they should continue to be deployed for  such  work.\r\n\r\nThe  question of preventing pregnant workers from doing  such\r\n\r\nwork  does not just lie with the designated factory  doctors.\r\n\r\nIf  the  issue  is  brought  to my Ministry's  Department  of\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Safety's  attention, we  will  also  require  the\r\n\r\nemployer  to cease deploying pregnant workers for such  work.\r\n\r\nBut,  as I said earlier on, we would have already placed such\r\n\r\nfactories  using such hazardous chemicals on  our  industrial\r\n\r\nhygiene monitoring scheme and we would be keeping a watch  on\r\n\r\nall  these companies that use chemicals such as lead, mercury\r\n\r\nand  cadmium which have this kind of effect on the developing\r\n\r\nfoetus  and would advise the employers to make sure that  any\r\n\r\npregnant  worker  should  not be  exposed  to  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nchemical hazard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This citation year \"1999\" would be\r\n\r\nchanged to \"2000\" as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 35 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>4.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n.     Sir,  this Bill carries the first set of amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Legal Profession Act which my Ministry proposes to table\r\n\r\nin  this  House  this year.  There will  be  another  set  of\r\n\r\namendments  mainly  concerning  reform  of  the  disciplinary\r\n\r\nprocedures which will be tabled later this year after we have\r\n\r\ncompleted consultations with the Law Society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill implements two important initiatives\r\n\r\nwhich  were  announced recently.  The first is to  allow  law\r\n\r\nfirms to practise in the form of limited liability companies.\r\n\r\nThe  second is to allow foreign law firms to form  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures  and  formal  law alliances with  local  law  firms.\r\n\r\nThese  changes will strengthen the legal profession and  make\r\n\r\nit  more  competitive,  especially when  firms  go  regional.\r\n\r\nThere have been wide consultations on these initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now discuss the first change, which is, on the\r\n\r\ncorporatisation of law practices.  Today, law firms can  only\r\n\r\nexist  in  the form of sole proprietorships (if the firm  has\r\n\r\nonly  one  owner) or partnerships (if the firm has more  than\r\n\r\none  owner).   They cannot form limited liability  companies.\r\n\r\nOne   characteristic  of  a  partnership  firm  is  that  the\r\n\r\nliability  of the firm is not separate from the liability  of\r\n\r\nthe  partners.  If a partnership does not have enough  assets\r\n\r\nto  meet  a claim against it, the claim will have to  be  met\r\n\r\nfrom the partners' personal assets.  Indeed, all the partners\r\n\r\nin  the  firm are jointly responsible for the acts  of  every\r\n\r\nother  partner.  It is therefore possible for  one  partner's\r\n\r\nmistake  to  wipe out the personal assets of  all  the  other\r\n\r\npartners.   This acts as a disincentive for the formation  of\r\n\r\nlarger  law  firms  as, in reality, it is  not  possible  for\r\n\r\npartners in a large law firm to adequately supervise  matters\r\n\r\nhandled by other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npartners.  It may also hold law firms back from taking on new\r\n\r\nventures  or expanding operations overseas, as such  ventures\r\n\r\nnecessarily involve risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy\r\n\r\nof Law therefore proposed to the Government that law firms in\r\n\r\nSingapore   be  allowed  to  operate  as  limited   liability\r\n\r\ncompanies.    In  doing  so,  the  Committee   endorsed   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of a Sub-Committee comprising members of  the\r\n\r\nCourts,  Attorney-General's Chambers, Law Faculty as well  as\r\n\r\nlegal  practitioners.   The  Government  has  accepted   this\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of allowing professionals to form limited\r\n\r\nliability  companies  is  not new to Singapore.   Architects,\r\n\r\nprofessional  engineers and land surveyors have been  allowed\r\n\r\nto form limited liability companies since 1991.  Allowing law\r\n\r\nfirms to form limited liability companies will encourage  law\r\n\r\nfirms  to  grow larger, giving rise to greater  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale  and greater competitiveness.  It will allow law  firms\r\n\r\nto  build up their institutional identities, thus encouraging\r\n\r\nthem   to   commit  to  greater  long  term  investments   in\r\n\r\ninformation technology and other high-tech equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other jurisdictions like the United States, United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  Australia and Hong Kong allow law firms  to  either\r\n\r\nform   limited  liability  companies  or  limited   liability\r\n\r\npartnerships.   Hence,  allowing  Singapore  law   firms   to\r\n\r\ncorporatise  will  enable them to compete  on  a  more  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field with foreign firms.  This move is timely  both\r\n\r\nin  facilitating  the  expansion of  overseas  operations  by\r\n\r\nSingapore firms and also in preparing Singapore firms for the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the legal market to foreign firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now briefly outline the framework under\r\n\r\nwhich  limited  liability company law  firms,  known  as  law\r\n\r\ncorporations in the Bill, can be formed.  A law firm  wishing\r\n\r\nto operate as a law corporation must apply to the Law Society\r\n\r\nfor approval.  Like other companies, law corporations will be\r\n\r\nincorporated under the Companies Act.  They will  be  subject\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Act's regulatory regime, with a few exceptions,  notably\r\n\r\nthat  law  corporations  need not  have  the  words  \"private\r\n\r\nlimited\"  in  their names, carrying instead  the  words  \"Law\r\n\r\nCorporation\" or the letters \"LLC\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited liability notwithstanding, a number of\r\n\r\nsafeguards have been built into the Bill to ensure that  high\r\n\r\nprofessional standards are maintained and that the  interests\r\n\r\nof consumers are adequately protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the interest of maintaining standards, it is\r\n\r\ncurrently  provided  that  all  the  shareholders  of  a  law\r\n\r\ncorporation  must be lawyers.  However, to allow  flexibility\r\n\r\nfor  employee  shareholding and the  possibility  of  forming\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplinary practices in the future, the  Bill  allows\r\n\r\nrules   to   be  made  in  future  to  provide  for  minority\r\n\r\nshareholding by non-lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill provides that a lawyer of less than\r\n\r\nthree  years' standing is not allowed to be a director  of  a\r\n\r\nlaw  corporation unless there is at least one director in the\r\n\r\nlaw corporation who was in active practice for at least three\r\n\r\nout of the preceding five years.  This is consistent with the\r\n\r\nexisting  rules governing partnerships and serves to maintain\r\n\r\nprofessional standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valid concern is that limited liability may mean a\r\n\r\nloss  of  consumer protection.  Let me assure the House  that\r\n\r\nthis   will  not  be  the  case.   The  law  corporation   is\r\n\r\nessentially   a  vehicle  for  the  provision  of   services.\r\n\r\nIndividual  lawyers in a law corporation  who  provide  legal\r\n\r\nservices   will  continue  to  be  regulated  by  the   Legal\r\n\r\nProfession Act.  In other words, they will be subject to  the\r\n\r\nsame  standards  of  professional  conduct  and  disciplinary\r\n\r\ncontrols  as  if  they were providing the legal  services  as\r\n\r\nsolicitors  in a sole proprietorship or partnership.   Hence,\r\n\r\neven   though  the  law  corporation  operates  with  limited\r\n\r\nliability, the personal liability of the lawyer who  provides\r\n\r\nthe legal services will not be affected.  The formation of  a\r\n\r\nlaw  corporation therefore does not shield a lawyer from  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of his mistakes.  Also, the consumer will know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  being  advised by a law  corporation  as  every\r\n\r\ninvoice  and official correspondence must carry the statement\r\n\r\nthat the firm is incorporated with limited liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on this first amendment, a law corporation will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  take out a minimum amount of  coverage  for\r\n\r\nprofessional indemnity insurance.  This is the key  safeguard\r\n\r\nfor consumers.  If there is sufficient insurance coverage, it\r\n\r\nwould  not  matter  to the consumer whether  the  law  firm's\r\n\r\nliability  is  limited or unlimited.   The  exact  amount  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  coverage will be spelt out later in  rules  to  be\r\n\r\npromulgated by the Council of the Law Society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the second set of amendments in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  which relates to foreign lawyers and  foreign  law\r\n\r\nfirms.   In  1997,  the  Government set up  a  multi-sectoral\r\n\r\ncommittee   headed   by   the  Attorney-General   to   review\r\n\r\nSingapore's  strategic legal needs in the  financial  sector,\r\n\r\nand  the conditions under which foreign law firms and foreign\r\n\r\nlawyers  could be allowed to operate in Singapore, so  as  to\r\n\r\nensure Singapore's competitiveness in financial services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee began its task by soliciting feedback\r\n\r\nthrough surveys from foreign financial institutions, offshore\r\n\r\nlaw   firms   in   Singapore,  local   banks,   corporations,\r\n\r\nstockbroking   houses,   Government-linked   and    insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies   as  well  as  local  law  firms.   The  Committee\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its  Report to the Government in June  last  year.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  accepted the Report's  recommendations.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  gives  effect to the Committee's  recommendations\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  essence,  seek to promote a  more  vibrant  legal\r\n\r\nservices sector through closer collaboration between offshore\r\n\r\nand  Singapore lawyers.  The focus is on how to supply  legal\r\n\r\nservices  more conveniently and efficiently and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, upgrade the legal expertise of local lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides for two types of collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween local firms and foreign firms: joint law ventures and\r\n\r\nformal  law alliances.  Let me list, first of all,   the  key\r\n\r\nsimilarities and differences in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese two models of collaborations.  First, the similarities.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General's approval must be obtained to form both\r\n\r\njoint  law  ventures and formal law alliances.   To  maintain\r\n\r\nflexibility,  the  criteria  for registration  of  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures  and formal law alliances will be spelt out  in  the\r\n\r\nrules.     These   will   be   based   on   the   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  I expect that the rules will  be  published\r\n\r\nby  probably April or thereabouts this year.  Lawyers in both\r\n\r\njoint  law ventures and formal law alliances will be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  draft  documents  relating to cross-border  transactions,\r\n\r\nincluding documents governed by Singapore law.  However, they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  allowed to appear in local courts.   Important\r\n\r\nbenefits  which  both  joint  law  ventures  and  formal  law\r\n\r\nalliances  can  enjoy  include sharing  staff,  premises  and\r\n\r\nresources; marketing themselves as one-stop service providers\r\n\r\nand billing their clients as a single entity.\r\n\r\n.     Now,  for  the differences.  A key difference  is  that\r\n\r\nforeign  lawyers in a joint law venture will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nrender  advice on Singapore law.  Before doing  so,  he  must\r\n\r\nseek  registration with the Attorney General who may  require\r\n\r\nhim  to  undergo  prescribed courses.  To protect  consumers,\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  lawyers who practise Singapore  law  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  local rules concerning professional  conduct  or\r\n\r\nethics,  unless  otherwise exempted by the Attorney  General.\r\n\r\nThe  AG will have powers to discipline these foreign lawyers.\r\n\r\nAnother  key difference is that a joint law venture would  be\r\n\r\nstructured as a distinct business entity from its constituent\r\n\r\nfirms.   It  can take the form of a partnership or a  limited\r\n\r\nliability  company.   In  contrast,  a  formal  alliance   is\r\n\r\nessentially  an alliance of law firms without a new  business\r\n\r\nentity being created.\r\n\r\n.     Sir,  the opening up of our legal market in this manner\r\n\r\nwill  bring  benefits to players in our financial sector,  as\r\n\r\nthey can now obtain one-stop service for their legal needs in\r\n\r\ninternational transactions.   While benefits to the financial\r\n\r\nsector  are  the  main  focus  of  these  amendments,   these\r\n\r\namendments will also bring in legal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpertise   in   other  fields,  such  as   information   and\r\n\r\ncommunications technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberalisation will benefit both Singapore law\r\n\r\nfirms  and  offshore  law firms.  Singapore  law  firms  will\r\n\r\nbenefit because, firstly, local firms will be exposed to  the\r\n\r\norganisational, management and marketing techniques of  their\r\n\r\noffshore partners;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, local firms may gain access to clients of the\r\n\r\noffshore firms;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, local firms can upgrade their legal expertise\r\n\r\nin  areas of financial work which they otherwise may  not  be\r\n\r\nexposed to;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, local firms may use the partnership with\r\n\r\noffshore  firms  as  a springboard to expand  their  regional\r\n\r\npractice; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, there will be greater possibility of expanding\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of Singapore law as a governing law for  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, offshore law firms will benefit because:\r\n\r\nfirst,  they  will  have a Singapore law firm  to  complement\r\n\r\ntheir  global network of law firms; second, they can practise\r\n\r\nSingapore  law;  third, they can provide a  one-stop  service\r\n\r\nwhich  they  presently cannot without using a  Singapore  law\r\n\r\nfirm;  fourth, in time, they will be able to induct the  best\r\n\r\nof  our  legal talent into their global practice; and, fifth,\r\n\r\nthey will feel more at home in Singapore if they are able  to\r\n\r\nwork with Singapore lawyers for the same goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main objective of these amendments is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  both  the local and offshore legal services sector  can\r\n\r\nmeet  Singapore's strategic legal needs, in  the  context  of\r\n\r\nensuring  Singapore's competitiveness in financial  services,\r\n\r\nand to upgrade the legal expertise of local lawyers; in other\r\n\r\nwords, the beneficiary will be Singapore.  Singapore aims  to\r\n\r\nbe   a  strong  financial  centre  with  good  legal  support\r\n\r\nservices, a major centre for legal and financial services, in\r\n\r\nthe years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore law firms are already highly-rated in Asia.\r\n\r\nAs reported in the Business Times of 13th January, the latest\r\n\r\nedition  of  Asia  Pacific Legal 500 published  by  Britain's\r\n\r\nLegalese Ltd ranked Singapore law firms amongst the  best  in\r\n\r\nAsia.   The Report however noted that there were shortcomings\r\n\r\nin  the  delivery  of legal services, reflecting  partly  the\r\n\r\nprohibition against foreign lawyers from practising Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw.   In  turn, this has made it difficult for local lawyers\r\n\r\nto  gain experience in top-flight international and corporate\r\n\r\npractice.   The Report then highlighted that the authorities,\r\n\r\nrecognising   these  shortcomings,  have   taken   steps   to\r\n\r\nliberalise the legal sector.\r\n\r\n.     Sir,  the  point is that our strategic  move  has  been\r\n\r\npicked up abroad.  It has been recognised for what it is.  An\r\n\r\nopening up that will further enhance the quality of the legal\r\n\r\nprofession  here   -   one  which  already  has  gained  some\r\n\r\nreputation  in  the  region.   That  can  only  be  good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the amendments in this Bill which have\r\n\r\nbeen  carefully thought through over a period of  time,  with\r\n\r\ninputs  from many and diverse quarters, should   lead  to  an\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  local legal expertise, thus bringing  about  a\r\n\r\nstronger  local  Bar,  a more vibrant and  competitive  legal\r\n\r\nservices  sector, one able to better meet the  challenges  of\r\n\r\nthe   new  millennium,  including  the  challenge  of   going\r\n\r\nregional.\r\n\r\n.    Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill contains significant changes to the\r\n\r\nway  in  which lawyers can group themselves to provide  legal\r\n\r\nservices.   Hitherto, lawyers have operated  in  partnerships\r\n\r\nand  practise  largely domestic law, with a few larger  firms\r\n\r\nundertaking  cross-border work.  Today, we are considering  a\r\n\r\nBill  that  would  allow the setting up of law  corporations,\r\n\r\njoint   law   ventures  and  formal  law  alliances.    These\r\n\r\namendments are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntherefore  important,  not just from the  legal  profession's\r\n\r\npoint of view, but also from the businessmen's point of view.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of the main reasons for the Bill is to\r\n\r\nfollow up on the recommendations of the Legal Services Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  in  June  last year that are intended  to  enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness in the  financial  sector.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee observed that the weak legal services sector  would\r\n\r\nimpede  the  growth of Singapore as a financial  centre.   To\r\n\r\nquote  the  Committee, \"The legal services  sector  plays  an\r\n\r\nimportant  contributory role in enhancing competitiveness  in\r\n\r\nfinancial  services,  but does not  drive  it.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nperceived  needs for the legal profession at  present  is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   the  legal  expertise  for  cross-border  financial\r\n\r\ntransactions.\"  In fact, I should go further and say that  as\r\n\r\nSingapore   positions  itself  as  an   e-commerce   hub,   a\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs hub, and a telecommunications hub, in addition\r\n\r\nto being a financial centre, it is important to develop legal\r\n\r\nexpertise in these fields as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that while we do have some law firms\r\n\r\nthat  can  handle such work as well as the foreign firms,  we\r\n\r\nmay  lack the number of legal experts that would provide such\r\n\r\nservices  once  the industry begins to grow.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nassessment of the Committee is that our law firms are  coping\r\n\r\nwith the current volume of cross-border work, but not if such\r\n\r\nwork increases substantially, as well it might.  Secondly, it\r\n\r\nis  also  clear  that  we  lack the expertise  for  what  the\r\n\r\nCommittee referred to as Tier 1 \"legal software\" expertise to\r\n\r\nhandle  such  matters as project finance,  of  infrastructure\r\n\r\nworks  such  as  power, roads, water and  telecommunications,\r\n\r\nasset  securitisation,  and structured  finance.  This  legal\r\n\r\nsoftware can best be imported to Singapore through the import\r\n\r\nof foreign talent, ie, foreign lawyers.  Hence, the provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill for the setting up of formal law alliances  and\r\n\r\njoint law ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comments and queries are directed principally at\r\n\r\nclause  15  of  the Bill, referring to the new  Part  IXA  on\r\n\r\n\"Foreign  law  firms,  joint law  ventures,  and  formal  law\r\n\r\nalliances\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contemplates two different types of\r\n\r\norganisation between local and foreign lawyers  -  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures,  and  formal law alliances.  The first  question  I\r\n\r\nhave  for  the Acting Minister is: what are the  reasons  for\r\n\r\nhaving these two types of organisation?  As far as I can see,\r\n\r\nand  from the explanation that the Acting Minister has  given\r\n\r\njust now, the privileges are more or less the same, except in\r\n\r\nrelation to the role of the foreign lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a joint law venture, the foreign lawyer can be\r\n\r\nregistered  to  practise Singapore law,  but  does  not  have\r\n\r\nappearance  rights before any judge, arbitrator or regulatory\r\n\r\nbody  unless otherwise permitted to do so.  In the case of  a\r\n\r\nformal  law  alliance, the foreign lawyer who is a  \"partner,\r\n\r\ndirector or an employee of the foreign law firm\" may \"prepare\r\n\r\nall  the  documents  in a transaction involving  the  law  or\r\n\r\nregulatory  regime of more than one country or  jurisdiction,\r\n\r\nexcept that any legal opinion relating to Singapore law  must\r\n\r\nbe  given by a Singapore lawyer\" who is in practice.  Is this\r\n\r\nnot  too  fine  a  distinction to have  in  the  legislation,\r\n\r\nespecially in the area of banking and finance law, where  the\r\n\r\nbase  is  contract law, and where Singapore  applies  English\r\n\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question because it is important for the\r\n\r\nlegislation to be seen to be attractive enough to attract the\r\n\r\nbest foreign law firms and foreign lawyers to enter into such\r\n\r\nventures  and  alliances with our local law  firms.   If  the\r\n\r\nbenefits for entering into an alliance and joint venture  are\r\n\r\nnot evident, we may be disappointed if there is a low take-up\r\n\r\nrate  for such alliances or ventures.  I should like  to  add\r\n\r\nthat  even now we are behind Hong Kong in attracting  foreign\r\n\r\nfirms  to Singapore.  Hong Kong in 1998 had 86 foreign  firms\r\n\r\ncompared  to  69  in Singapore for the same  year.   This  is\r\n\r\ndespite  the somewhat liberal conditions  for the setting  up\r\n\r\nof offshore law practices in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is this: the Bill does not disclose\r\n\r\nthe   guidelines  for  the  approval  of  such  ventures  and\r\n\r\nalliances.  Of course, these are important to know before any\r\n\r\nlaw  firm decides to enter into negotiations with its foreign\r\n\r\ncounterparts.   Could the Acting Minister let  us  know  what\r\n\r\nsort of guidelines would be given?  I know that the Committee\r\n\r\ngave several criteria for the approval of such alliances, but\r\n\r\nthese are specific to the financial sector.  This leads me to\r\n\r\nmy third question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is this: if the guidelines are sector-specific, will there also be guidelines to encourage firms\r\n\r\npractising  in information technology law, telecommunications\r\n\r\nlaw,  and  intellectual property law to  enter  into  similar\r\n\r\nalliances  with their counterparts in the US and  Europe?   I\r\n\r\nsee  a great need for us to encourage the setting up of  such\r\n\r\nalliances  in  the areas of law that I have  just  mentioned.\r\n\r\nSingapore, as we all know, is positioning itself as a hub for\r\n\r\ne-commerce, telecommunications and technopreneurs.  Without a\r\n\r\ndoubt,  these  sectors also require legal  expertise  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest order.  These are truly the cutting edge areas  where\r\n\r\nthere  is global competition for lawyers in these fields.   I\r\n\r\nwould respectfully suggest that we should also encourage,  as\r\n\r\nquickly  as  possible, alliances of foreign and  local  firms\r\n\r\nspecialising  in  these  areas,  if  these  are  not  already\r\n\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a last comment, I should like to point\r\n\r\nout   that  the  legal  profession  is  facing  its  greatest\r\n\r\nchallenge  since  the  practice of law  began  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLawyers   in  practice  must  now  not  just  compete   among\r\n\r\nthemselves for business, but may have to compete with foreign\r\n\r\nlawyers,  at  least those who are registered  under  the  new\r\n\r\nJoint  Law  Venture scheme.  There is a need to upgrade  both\r\n\r\nskills  and  knowledge to enable them to compete on  a  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field.   Our  members of the legal  profession  must\r\n\r\naccept that as the amendments bring with it more competition,\r\n\r\nit  also has the potential for high reward for those who  are\r\n\r\nperceptive enough to take up the challenge to make  Singapore\r\n\r\nthe legal services centre of the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these high hopes in mind, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to speak on the amendments to  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Profession  Act  which I support.   Before  proceeding\r\n\r\nfurther,  allow  me to declare my interest  as  a  practising\r\n\r\nsolicitor   who  will  be  affected,  whether   directly   or\r\n\r\nindirectly, by the outcome of the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the present amendments have no doubt been\r\n\r\ninitiated by the recommendations of the Legal Services Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.  In its report to the Government dated June  1999,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee made a number of significant proposals that  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  form the basis of the amendments that are before  us\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following from the recommendations of the Financial\r\n\r\nSector  Review  Group on the liberalisation of the  financial\r\n\r\nsector,   the  Legal  Services  Review  Committee  has   also\r\n\r\nrecommended that the legal services sector should likewise be\r\n\r\nliberalised.  Towards this end, the Committee has recommended\r\n\r\nthat  the Government allow an unrestricted number of  foreign\r\n\r\nalliances  and a restricted number of joint ventures  between\r\n\r\nlocal  and offshore firms.  The recommendations for strategic\r\n\r\ntie-up  come with a string of other recommendations; such  as\r\n\r\nkeeping  tabs on the talent pool of Singapore lawyers working\r\n\r\nabroad  and relocating in-house counsel of the global banking\r\n\r\nand financial institutions to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively debate on the present Bill, it\r\n\r\nis  therefore  necessary  for us to  examine  in  detail  the\r\n\r\nunderlying   premises   of  the  Legal  Service   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the Legal Services Committee has\r\n\r\nput  in substantial amount of effort in seeking to tap  on  a\r\n\r\nwide  range  of  opinions to see how  Singapore's  long  term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  in  the  financial services  can  be  better\r\n\r\nserved by a restructuring of the legal services industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their findings, the Committee envisaged that the\r\n\r\nvolume of onshore and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffshore and cross-border financial transactions is likely to\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the coming years.  With the expansion  in   the\r\n\r\nvolume  of financial services, it would therefore be  crucial\r\n\r\nthat  the legal services in Singapore have the capability  to\r\n\r\nsupport such an expansion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of finding, the Committee concluded that\r\n\r\nSingapore law firms have the capability to undertake  Tier  2\r\n\r\nand  Tier  3  work.   On the other hand, the  Committee  also\r\n\r\nconcluded   that  local  firms  do  not  have  the   adequate\r\n\r\ncapability to advise on Tier 1 work.  For the benefit  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues   here,   let  me  just  explain   the   different\r\n\r\ndefinitions  with respect to the different  tiers  that  were\r\n\r\nreferred  to  by the Committee.  By definition, Tier  2  work\r\n\r\nrefers  to  the  legal  software  required  for  conventional\r\n\r\nfinancial services, such as the issue and trading of  capital\r\n\r\nmarkets  instruments, onshore and offshore financing such  as\r\n\r\nsyndicated   and  multi-currency  loans,  and   mergers   and\r\n\r\nacquisitions.   Tier  3  work refers to  the  legal  software\r\n\r\nrequired  for  Singapore  law  opinion  on  Tier  2  offshore\r\n\r\nfinancial products, domestic property, consumer financing and\r\n\r\nunsecured  loans.  On the other hand, Tier 1 work  refers  to\r\n\r\nthe   software  required  for  the  cutting  edge   financial\r\n\r\nproducts, such as project finance of infrastructure involving\r\n\r\npower,  roads,  water  and  telecommunication,  international\r\n\r\ncapital markets, asset securitisation and structured finance.\r\n\r\nIn  the area of the legal capability for Tier 1 work,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot deny that offshore firms, in particular those coming from\r\n\r\nthe UK and US jurisdictions have it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendation of the Committee to intensify\r\n\r\ncollaboration between offshore and Singapore firms to provide\r\n\r\nconvenient  and  efficient  legal services  for  cross-border\r\n\r\nfinancial  transactions is one strategy which  the  Committee\r\n\r\nhas   recommended  to  help  Singapore  breach  the  gap   in\r\n\r\ncapabilities for Tier 1 work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recognised that in contrast to New York\r\n\r\nand  English law which is used for Tier 1 work, Singapore law\r\n\r\nis  used  largely  for  onshore  and  cross-border  financial\r\n\r\ntransactions which are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntypically  Tier 2 and Tier 3 work.  Currently, these  onshore\r\n\r\nand  cross-border  financial transactions constitute  only  a\r\n\r\nsmall percentage of the total value of financial transactions\r\n\r\nin  the region.  Singapore law services play an insignificant\r\n\r\nrole   in   enhancing  Singapore's  competitiveness   as   an\r\n\r\ninternational financial centre.  The Committee concluded that\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  Singapore  law  services  alone   does   not\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  Singapore's competitiveness  as  a  financial\r\n\r\ncentre.   What  it does mean is that as far as  international\r\n\r\nfinancial  transactions are concerned, parties  still  prefer\r\n\r\nthe  application of New York and English law as the governing\r\n\r\nlaws,  especially  for financial transactions  funded  in  US\r\n\r\ndollars  which  is  the  standard currency  of  international\r\n\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offshore firms in Singapore do play a part in meeting\r\n\r\nthe  demands  for  legal  services  in  respect  of  regional\r\n\r\ntransactions that apply non-Singapore laws.  It follows  that\r\n\r\nunless  and until home-grown Singapore financial institutions\r\n\r\nexpand  their  capacity for regional lending, the  choice  of\r\n\r\ngoverning law will continue to be New York and English  laws.\r\n\r\nIn  this regard, it does not appear that, at least in respect\r\n\r\nof Tier 1 work, Singapore law is likely to have a significant\r\n\r\nrole  in  the foreseeable future.  Moreover, because  Tier  1\r\n\r\nwork  typically involves substantial capital funding,  it  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  local financial institutions are  willing  to\r\n\r\nbear  the  bulk  of the risk without syndicating  such  risk,\r\n\r\noften  internationally.  Where there are foreign elements  in\r\n\r\ncross-border transactions, and I am referring to the  foreign\r\n\r\nbanking  and  financial institutions, as  it  stands  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  one  finds  it  hard to see how  we  can  avoid  the\r\n\r\napplication   of  New  York  and  English   laws   in   these\r\n\r\ntransactions.   This is also particularly compounded  by  the\r\n\r\nfact that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a stringent\r\n\r\npolicy against using Singapore currency for offshore lending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also concluded that in respect of the\r\n\r\nlegal  services for Tier 2 and Tier 3 work, Singapore lawyers\r\n\r\nare sufficiently equipped and would have the legal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpertise  to undertake these transactions.  The  finding  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  also  confirmed  the  opinion  of  the  large\r\n\r\nmajority of offshore lawyers that Singapore lawyers have  the\r\n\r\nadequate skills for current onshore financing and also for  a\r\n\r\nlimited range of cross-border financial transactions.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  known fact that in respect of Tier 1 work, Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw  firms  do  not have the necessary legal expertise.   But\r\n\r\nthen again, until Singapore law becomes the applicable law in\r\n\r\nthese  transactions,  it is unrealistic to  expect  Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers to acquire any expertise in Tier 1 work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it does not mean that we should\r\n\r\nnot,  as  part  of  our  evolutionary process  of  our  legal\r\n\r\nprofession, begin to acquire such expertise.  However, as  it\r\n\r\nstands  at  the  moment, unless and until Singapore  develops\r\n\r\nsubstantially as an international financial centre where  the\r\n\r\ninternational community has developed much confidence in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  Singapore law, it is unrealistic to expect Singapore\r\n\r\nlegal capabilities to develop on its own in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current arrangement involving a division of labour\r\n\r\nbetween  offshore and local firms in respect of  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal law seems to have worked very well to meet the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  present  requirements of the financial  sector  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  in  respect of Tier 1 work.  One would therefore  be\r\n\r\nvery  hard  put  to  see how acquiring Tier  1  expertise  by\r\n\r\nSingapore   lawyers   is   likely  to   improve   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness as an international centre if in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthese transactions, the governing laws continue to be US  and\r\n\r\nUK  laws.   It  is non sequitur, Sir, that because  Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers have acquired expertise in Tier 1 work, international\r\n\r\ninvestors  and  financial institutions are  likely  to  apply\r\n\r\nSingapore law as the governing law of the transaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if as the Committee has concluded, the weakness of\r\n\r\nthe  local  legal services lies in the lack of capability  in\r\n\r\nTier  1  work,  formal  alliance and  joint  ventures,  which\r\n\r\ndepending on the nature of the tie-up, allow for the practice\r\n\r\nof Singapore law by foreign lawyers is unlikely to help us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nacquire Tier 1 capability if Singapore law is unlikely to  be\r\n\r\nused  in  Tier  1  work for the foreseeable  future.   As  it\r\n\r\nstands, the Committee is of the view that our legal expertise\r\n\r\nin Tier 2 work is adequate for our needs.  Giving foreign law\r\n\r\nfirms and foreign lawyers a licence to practise Singapore law\r\n\r\ndoes  not necessarily assure us that local lawyers will  have\r\n\r\nthe  hands-on  experience for Tier 1 work.  Unless  Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers  are  equally equipped or qualified to  practise  New\r\n\r\nYork  or  English law, there is a strong likelihood that  the\r\n\r\njoint  venture or formal alliances in form and substance  may\r\n\r\nresult in a situation where Tier 1 work will continue  to  be\r\n\r\ndominated by foreign lawyers and Tier 2 and Tier 3 work  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be handled by local lawyers with foreign  lawyers\r\n\r\ncompeting  on  Singapore law as well.  What it does  mean  is\r\n\r\nthat  while there is no assurance that Tier 1 technology will\r\n\r\nbe  transferred to the local lawyer, greater competition will\r\n\r\nresult  from  giving  foreign  lawyers  the  opportunity   to\r\n\r\npractise local law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that the Committee did not\r\n\r\nconsider  in depth the consequences that follow from allowing\r\n\r\nforeign  law firms to practise Singapore law.  How  will  the\r\n\r\nsmall  firms  adapt  to  the greater  competition  that  will\r\n\r\nresult?  The Committee believes that formal alliance or joint\r\n\r\nventure  will  provide  a convenient and  efficient  mode  of\r\n\r\ndelivery   for   legal  service  in  cross-border   financial\r\n\r\ntransactions and the upgrade of legal expertise of  Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers through the transfer of expertise presumably in  Tier\r\n\r\n1  work  from  foreign  lawyers to  Singapore  lawyers  which\r\n\r\nhitherto has yet to materialise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support the amendment to the Legal Profession\r\n\r\nAct  not  because  I  believe that the  joint  venture  would\r\n\r\nnecessarily   transfer  substantial  Tier  1   expertise   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers, but because I believe  that  by  allowing\r\n\r\nforeign lawyers to practise Singapore law, it would intensify\r\n\r\nthe  extent of competition with respect to Tier 2 and perhaps\r\n\r\nTier  3  work, and hopefully result in an overall improvement\r\n\r\nin the quality of legal services in Singapore.  Hopefully the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of off-shore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirms  in  local  practice  will increase  substantially  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of our financial services  sector  and  help\r\n\r\npromote Singapore as a regional financial hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore firms have evolved in its own way because it\r\n\r\nhas  been a relatively sheltered profession all these  years.\r\n\r\nWe do not deny that legal services in Singapore have improved\r\n\r\nover  the  years.  In terms of the way law firms are  managed\r\n\r\nand  run, I would admit that the current local legal services\r\n\r\nare  still lacking in some ways when compared to the offshore\r\n\r\nfirms.   In  this regard, there are many areas that Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw  firms can usefully learn from their counterparts.  Joint\r\n\r\nventures  and formal alliances will give Singapore firms  the\r\n\r\nability  to bring themselves up to the standards and  demands\r\n\r\nof  an  international practice.  Intensive  interaction  with\r\n\r\nthese   law firms will give Singapore lawyers the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  provide  legal services at a standard which is comparable\r\n\r\nwith those of the West.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that the Act sets out certain\r\n\r\nsafeguards in respect of formal alliances and joint ventures.\r\n\r\nOne must bear in mind that in a joint venture the possibility\r\n\r\nof  a  stronger party dominating the weaker one is very real.\r\n\r\nHere  unless such ventures are regulated, we cannot  be  sure\r\n\r\nhow  Singapore  law  firms may not be  overwhelmed  by  their\r\n\r\nstronger foreign counterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to focus the changes to the legal\r\n\r\nprofession on formal alliances and joint venture entirely may\r\n\r\nbe  to  miss  the  point altogether.   What  is  crucial  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  enhance  Singapore's competitiveness  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  really  lies in the quality of the  lawyers  that  we\r\n\r\nproduce.   The  Committee  recognised  that  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlawyers  in  recent  years  has generally  speaking  improved\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  Yet, while the quality of the entrants to the\r\n\r\nlaw  faculty  and the profession has improved,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean by the same token that these graduates  will\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of  their career acquire  the  cutting  edge\r\n\r\ntechnology in the legal profession which Singapore needs  for\r\n\r\nthe future.  Acquiring these skills through\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhands-on  experience and through formal alliances  and  joint\r\n\r\nventure  is  part  of  the solution.  Perhaps  the  authority\r\n\r\nshould   seriously  consider  setting  up  an  institute   of\r\n\r\nfinancial services within the law faculty of the NUS that  is\r\n\r\ndedicated to the teaching and research of Tier 1 work.   This\r\n\r\ninstitute  could  perhaps  be  dedicated  to  acquiring   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  legal software and know-how and disseminating  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  practitioners  who  are  currently   in   the\r\n\r\nprofession dealing with these sorts of matters.  The focus of\r\n\r\nthe institute should be more on the practical approach to the\r\n\r\nlaw,  including drafting and negotiation.  And  I  might  add\r\n\r\nthat in the curricula, they should include subjects from  the\r\n\r\nother  disciplines as well, such as business  administration,\r\n\r\neconomics  and accounting.  By acquiring an overall expertise\r\n\r\nin  not just law alone but in the other disciplines, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  will  go  a  long way in the training of our  lawyers  to\r\n\r\nacquire Tier 1 expertise.  There is a great gap at present in\r\n\r\nour  legal  education  at this moment with  respect  to  such\r\n\r\nrequirements,  and I would urge the Government  to  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider such an initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was greatly encouraged by another amendment which\r\n\r\nallows the formation of limited liability corporation.  It is\r\n\r\na  fact  that as lawyers, unlimited liability hangs  over  us\r\n\r\nlike  a sword of Damocles.  This adds greatly to the stresses\r\n\r\nand  anxieties  that a solicitor has had to  face.   The  new\r\n\r\narrangement means that a lawyer's liability need no longer be\r\n\r\nunlimited  in  respect  of  his partners'  deeds.   Presently\r\n\r\nlawyers,  as  you may have heard earlier, act in partnerships\r\n\r\nand are liable for one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I welcome the amendment, I would say that the\r\n\r\namendment,  however,  does not go  far  enough.   Presumably,\r\n\r\nretaining  the  personal liability of the solicitor  at  law,\r\n\r\ndespite the formation of law corporation, is meant to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  solicitor continues to give his full attention  to\r\n\r\nhis work.  This provision seems to assume that the removal of\r\n\r\nthe liability of the solicitor under a corporation would mean\r\n\r\nthat a solicitor would not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive his full attention and this may increase the possibility\r\n\r\nof  negligence  on  his  part.  I am not  sure  whether  this\r\n\r\nassumption is borne by any empirical evidence.  Does it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  solicitor  will be careless  in  his  work  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  he  no  longer  suffers  from  being  liable  in  an\r\n\r\nunlimited manner?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the concerns are with the care and diligence with\r\n\r\nwhich a solicitor handles his work, and the protection of the\r\n\r\nclients, these issues can be dealt with in several ways.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  a  solicitor  can be  struck  off  the  Rolls  for\r\n\r\nnegligence, in which case the price he pays will be a loss of\r\n\r\nlivelihood through legal practice.  Alternatively,  the  laws\r\n\r\ncould  be  amended to ensure that there is adequate insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage  in  such  matters.  The  extent  of  the  insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage may be made known to the clients in advance so  that\r\n\r\nif a client chooses to deal with the solicitor on a matter in\r\n\r\nexcess of the amount covered by the insurance, he deals  with\r\n\r\nhis solicitor at his own peril.  Additionally, where most  of\r\n\r\nthese  transactions  run  into astronomical  sums,  making  a\r\n\r\nsolicitor liable will not help recompense the victim  in  any\r\n\r\nway.  It is unlikely that the solicitor is ever going to have\r\n\r\nsufficient assets to pay for his mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems strange to me that fund managers who give wrong\r\n\r\nadvice and cause people to suffer losses in their investments\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  hide behind the veil of  incorporation.\r\n\r\nLawyers, on the other hand, are expected to face consequences\r\n\r\non  their  own.   Sir, I believe this is an anomaly.   It  is\r\n\r\narchaic and should be rectified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all said, subject to my earlier comments, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I speak in support of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments.  And if it needs to be said, let me  declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest as a practising lawyer, and I practise in a  law\r\n\r\nfirm  that  has  perhaps the keenest interest  in  how  these\r\n\r\namendments work out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has pointed out the two major elements in\r\n\r\nthese amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFirst,  is to allow law firms to corporatise and, second,  is\r\n\r\nto  allow  foreign lawyers to practise Singapore law,  within\r\n\r\nthe  framework set out in the amendments.  Both  changes  are\r\n\r\nrevolutionary in the context of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change, the move to allow law firms to\r\n\r\ncorporatise, is to be welcomed and really for law firms,  the\r\n\r\ndecision to corporatise should be a no brainer, and I say  no\r\n\r\nmore about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change sought to be brought about by these\r\n\r\namendments  has  drawn mixed reactions among  local  lawyers,\r\n\r\nforeign lawyers, as well as in the corporate world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of these proposed amendments has differed,\r\n\r\ndepending  on the perspectives and interests of  the  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Singapore lawyers have reacted with concern  about\r\n\r\nthe    entry   of   foreign   lawyers.    Foreign    lawyers,\r\n\r\nunderstandably, welcome the move to open up the legal  sector\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  People who use lawyers are also divided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this scenario, what is the best policy? I would\r\n\r\nargue  that  the  proposed Bill seeks  to  strike  the  right\r\n\r\nbalance  between the competing interests and  concerns.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  for the policy maker has to be not what is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of Singapore lawyers.  Nor should the question  be\r\n\r\nwhat  is  in the interests of foreign lawyers.  The  question\r\n\r\ninstead  should  be, what is in the best  interests  for  the\r\n\r\nmajority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it in the interests of Singaporeans that the legal\r\n\r\nprofession be opened up, albeit in a limited way?  Convincing\r\n\r\nand  powerful  arguments can be made both for opening  up  as\r\n\r\nwell as for retaining the existing system.  Singapore lawyers\r\n\r\nwould  say,  as  my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann,  has  said  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  earlier, that the level and  competency  of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  services is high in Singapore and that  the  entry  of\r\n\r\nforeign lawyers is really not necessary, and will only  serve\r\n\r\nto drive up costs and perhaps affect the profession as it is.\r\n\r\nForeign  lawyers and non lawyers will not be  sympathetic  to\r\n\r\nsuch arguments and will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsay  that  competition can only be better for all  concerned.\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers'  case  is  not  much  advanced   by   the\r\n\r\nperception,  sometimes  exaggerated, about  the  compensation\r\n\r\nlawyers  get  in  Singapore.  The figures  one  sees  in  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Times  and Straits Times do not reflect  what  most\r\n\r\nlawyers  earn.   They  reflect the  income  of  a  very  tiny\r\n\r\nminority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside the issue of income, and weighing the\r\n\r\nreasons  for and against opening up, I think the balance,  in\r\n\r\nrecent  times,  has  swung  towards  opening  up  the   legal\r\n\r\nprofession, in the way these amendments seek to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because the risks of not opening up outweigh\r\n\r\nthe   risks  of  opening  up.   If  we  open  up  fully   and\r\n\r\nimmediately,  that would create a level playing  field  where\r\n\r\nthe  players would be of vastly different sizes.  The largest\r\n\r\nfirms in Singapore can probably be bought up with one or  two\r\n\r\nmonths'  cash flow of some of the world's largest law  firms.\r\n\r\nA legal scene devoid of local firms may not necessarily be in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of Singaporeans.  At least, we cannot say with\r\n\r\ncertainty at this stage that that is a desirable outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are very significant risks if\r\n\r\nwe  were not to open up at all.  There is a revolution  going\r\n\r\non  in the market place throughout the world.  Technology and\r\n\r\nglobal  integration are moving at lightning speed.   And  for\r\n\r\nthose of us who have not woken up, the fact that AOL can take\r\n\r\nover  Time Warner is a real wake-up call.  All that does  not\r\n\r\nautomatically  mean that opening up is the correct  thing  to\r\n\r\ndo.  Only time will tell if opening up is the right strategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we have not opened up, and that is a mistake, and\r\n\r\nby  the time we realise that we should have done so, it  will\r\n\r\nprobably  be  too late.  On the other hand,  if  we  open  up\r\n\r\ncautiously  now, giving ourselves flexibility, in future,  to\r\n\r\nadapt  policies,  as  dictated by changed circumstances,  and\r\n\r\nhindsight, that will probably be a better option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other advantages. Mr Sin, my colleague,\r\n\r\nsaid earlier that local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlawyers  do  not  do Tier 1 work anyway and how  would  these\r\n\r\namendments  seek to introduce Tier 1 competency  among  local\r\n\r\nlawyers.  I think the answer is this.  At present, perhaps we\r\n\r\nare  completely  out  of  the market.   If  there  are  joint\r\n\r\nventures   and   alliances  allowed,  there  is   a   serious\r\n\r\npossibility  that when there is Tier 1 work involved  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  some  of the local lawyers involved  in  such  joint\r\n\r\nventures and alliances would get access to their expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that the Committee perhaps did not\r\n\r\nconsider  the impact on small firms.  Perhaps one could  make\r\n\r\ntwo points.  The Committee's role was perhaps not to consider\r\n\r\nwhat  other interests of the small firms.  It was to consider\r\n\r\nwhat  best  enhances  the competitiveness  of  the  financial\r\n\r\nsector in Singapore in the context of the provision of  legal\r\n\r\nservices.  But more importantly, small law firms are  not  in\r\n\r\nthis  market  anyway and they are unlikely  to  be  seriously\r\n\r\naffected  by this opening up, because the kind of  work  that\r\n\r\nmajor foreign law firm would go for would not be the kind  of\r\n\r\nwork  that  the small law firms would be handling.   To  that\r\n\r\nextent, the people most affected are the larger law firms and\r\n\r\nmost of us know their names.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested that Prof. Chin consider seriously\r\n\r\nintroducing  some classes on Tier 1 work.  Again,  I  suppose\r\n\r\none  has  to make the point that for Tier 1 work, you  really\r\n\r\nbecome  an  expert by doing it and there is a limited  amount\r\n\r\nthat you can do in the law faculty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I welcome the fact that the amendments provide\r\n\r\nfor  a considerable degree of flexibility.  In line with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Legal Services Review  Committee,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  the Attorney-General would approve joint ventures  and\r\n\r\nalliances which would be structured to provide for a transfer\r\n\r\nof  know-how,  in  return for the foreign  firms  getting  an\r\n\r\nequitable share of our growing economy.  Though the Attorney-General  needs  no such urging, I would point out  that  \"Ali\r\n\r\nBaba\" arrangements should be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiscouraged.   There is a serious risk, in my view,  of  that\r\n\r\nhappening.  Only genuine joint ventures and alliances  should\r\n\r\nbe promoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Prof. Chin, asked why the proposal to have\r\n\r\na  difference between joint ventures and formal alliances.  I\r\n\r\ncan  understand the question.  The answer is  this,  that  in\r\n\r\npractice, both the bigger Singapore law firms as well as  the\r\n\r\nbigger international law firms, which would look towards this\r\n\r\npotential  marriage as a loose liaison, might want  to  check\r\n\r\neach other out.  They might not want to immediately rush into\r\n\r\na  serious  joint venture.  For those who are  concerned  and\r\n\r\nwant  a  looser form of arrangement, and there are many  like\r\n\r\nthat,  an  alliance  makes sense.   And  for  those  who  are\r\n\r\nabsolutely sure of the marriage or the union, a joint venture\r\n\r\nmakes  sense.   So  it  is  to  be  welcomed  that  there  is\r\n\r\nflexibility in the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Prof. Chin made the point that perhaps we are\r\n\r\na  little bit behind Hong Kong in that Hong Kong has over  80\r\n\r\nforeign  law firms whereas we only have about 69.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  policies  should  be dictated  by  that  consideration\r\n\r\nalone.  And the reason is simple.  Hong Kong was, until  very\r\n\r\nrecently,  a  colony, a haven for British law firms  who  had\r\n\r\nfree  access and the economy was considerably monopolised  by\r\n\r\nBritish companies, and there was a good historical reason for\r\n\r\nthe  number of foreign law firms that one sees in Hong  Kong.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  necessarily the best policy to  encourage  local\r\n\r\ntalent to thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he suggested that we should consider joint\r\n\r\nventures  and alliances to be moving into other  areas,  like\r\n\r\ninformation  technology, and so on, as quickly  as  possible.\r\n\r\nMy  own  view would be that the speed and pace of the  reform\r\n\r\nand  change,  as  emphasised  by  the  present  Bill,  should\r\n\r\nprobably  be  adequate because this is an area one  wants  to\r\n\r\nproceed.   Open up and let the best of the foreign law  firms\r\n\r\nto  come in, have loose forms of alliances and joint ventures\r\n\r\nand take it one step at a time.  Because the level of playing\r\n\r\nfield  on a completely open environment in any sector in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy is perhaps a long term objective.   But  if\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant to make sure that Singaporeans are left standing at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  day,  perhaps a step by step process  might  be\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments are also significant in that they\r\n\r\nvest  a  comfortable degree of discretion  on  the  Attorney-General  or  discretion that he has been given.   And  he  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  discretion to approve the structure of the  joint\r\n\r\nventures and formal alliances, the discretion to approve  the\r\n\r\nterms  on  which  licences are given to  joint  ventures  and\r\n\r\nalliances,  and  absolute  discretion  to  also  revoke  such\r\n\r\nlicences.  There can be no appeal to the Minister in  respect\r\n\r\nof these matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not someone who usually likes to see\r\n\r\nlegislation  which  invests  absolute  discretion  on  anyone\r\n\r\nwithout further recourse.  That is not the norm.  However,  I\r\n\r\ncan  understand  and  I  support the considerable  degree  of\r\n\r\ndiscretion   that  is  given  here  to  the  Attorney-General\r\n\r\nbecause, I suppose, one is unclear as to how these amendments\r\n\r\nwould work out and have an impact on the legal profession and\r\n\r\nthe  economy as a whole.  To that extent, it is perhaps  best\r\n\r\nthat  considerable discretion be given to see  through  these\r\n\r\namendments  as it were over the next few years.   However,  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that consistent with all aspects of the rule of\r\n\r\nlaw,  that as time goes by and the situation becomes clearer,\r\n\r\nperhaps  one should move towards institutionalising how  this\r\n\r\ndiscretion is exercised in a slightly more structured way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I want to make a clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to clarify the point which I made earlier.  In my\r\n\r\nspeech  earlier,  I  said  that,  for  Singapore  lawyers  to\r\n\r\npractise  here,  the opportunities are  not  that  many.   My\r\n\r\nlearned colleague has replied by saying that there are plenty\r\n\r\nof opportunities.  I do not deny that at this present moment,\r\n\r\nthe opportunities for tie-up and therefore to learn areas  of\r\n\r\nTier 1\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork,  which we otherwise do not have, are there.  Presently,\r\n\r\nthe  opportunities  are  there for  Singapore  law  firms  to\r\n\r\nacquire  Tier  1  expertise through continuing  participation\r\n\r\nwith  their  foreign  counterparts and  their  regional  work\r\n\r\nitself.   What  I  am  saying  is  that  to  formalise   this\r\n\r\narrangement  by  an  amendment to the legislation  under  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Profession Act may not be necessary if  that  was  our\r\n\r\nonly concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which Mr Shanmugam said is in respect\r\n\r\nof  small  firms.  I agree that the mandate of the  Committee\r\n\r\ndoes   not   encompass  the  effects  of   allowing   foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition  on small and medium-size practices.   One  would\r\n\r\nhowever need to consider the issue of excesses in competition\r\n\r\nthat  would result from increasing competition in Tier 2  and\r\n\r\nTier  3  work  which results from allowing foreign  firms  to\r\n\r\npractise  Singapore  law.   We  all  know  that  excesses  in\r\n\r\ncompetition  may not necessarily be good for  the  consumers.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  concerns  arising  from  this  competition  and\r\n\r\nallowing foreign law firms to practise Singapore law  is  the\r\n\r\nincrease in costs for the consumers.  With rising costs, I am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  whether or not this would have an  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our financial services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third point about my suggestion that the\r\n\r\nfaculty set up an institute of financial services, I  do  not\r\n\r\ndeny that hands-on experience is important.  But I would also\r\n\r\nat  the same time like to add that hands-on experience is  of\r\n\r\nlimited application if it is not tied up with theory which is\r\n\r\nacquired  in  the  classroom.   I  think  with  maturity   of\r\n\r\nexperience in practice, going back to the classroom  and  re-examining some of the propositions in law and having a deeper\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the legal theories would help make us better\r\n\r\nlawyers.   In  this regard, I stand by my earlier suggestions\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a place for such an institute  to  be  formed\r\n\r\nunder the auspices of the Law Faculty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much has been\r\n\r\nsaid  and  I  do not propose to repeat what has already  been\r\n\r\nsaid by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  others.  But before I begin my speech, may  I  also  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  a  practising lawyer but  I  have  no  pecuniary\r\n\r\ninterest in this Bill, nor do I hope to have any interest  in\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that I am not very concerned or worried about\r\n\r\nthe first part of the Bill which seeks to allow law firms  to\r\n\r\ncorporatise  except  to  add that  I  personally  regret  the\r\n\r\npassing of a law firm which is a personal service rendered by\r\n\r\nthe  solicitor to a client into a kind of impersonal  service\r\n\r\nand  the practice becoming a business.  But I suppose  it  is\r\n\r\nthought that in these days, the bigger the better.  I am  not\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  bigger the better is right.  I  hear,  quite\r\n\r\noften,  clients or people coming to tell me when I  see  them\r\n\r\noutside,  \"Oh, we never get to see the lawyer who himself  is\r\n\r\nhandling our work.  We are always delegated to somebody  else\r\n\r\nin the firm or even the clerks.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said about the corporatisation of the local\r\n\r\nfirms, may I say something about clause 15 which introduces a\r\n\r\nnew  part, Part IXA, into the Act, ie, allowing the entry  of\r\n\r\nforeign  lawyers into Singapore practice.  It  seems  to  me,\r\n\r\nspeaking not on behalf of the big law firms, but on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe  smaller  firms and especially those  who  do  a  one-man\r\n\r\npractice, that perhaps in the pursuit of financial excellence\r\n\r\nor  wanting to become an international finance centre, we are\r\n\r\nsacrificing our lawyers to whom we have a duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not very long ago, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that it\r\n\r\nwas  thought  we  had  too  many  lawyers  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\namendments  were made to restrict Singaporeans  who  obtained\r\n\r\ntheir  degrees  outside  from  practising  in  Singapore   by\r\n\r\nrequiring  that  they  had to hold their  degrees  only  from\r\n\r\nselected  universities.  The number of universities  was  cut\r\n\r\ndown  drastically and they were also told that  they  had  to\r\n\r\nhave a Second-Class Honours degree before they could apply to\r\n\r\npractise  in Singapore.  Hand in hand with that,  action  was\r\n\r\ntaken  to  restrict the number of people coming  out  of  the\r\n\r\nNational University of Singapore to practise law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe feeling was that there were too many lawyers in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  there  was of course the other action taken to  restrict\r\n\r\nthe almost ad lib admission of Queen's Counsel to do work  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts were required to insist on greater requirements\r\n\r\nfor  the  necessity  for  the  admission  of  the  QC  before\r\n\r\nadmitting the QC.  But now, it seems to me that suddenly  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seems to have a change of mind.  This Bill  seems\r\n\r\nto  open the door, perhaps not the floodgates altogether,  to\r\n\r\nforeign  lawyers coming into Singapore, not only just  to  do\r\n\r\noffshore  work  but  also  to practise  Singapore  law.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  of State said they would not be able to  appear  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore courts.  But as I read the amendment, if  they\r\n\r\nare  registered by the Attorney-General and if they have  got\r\n\r\ntheir  registration  approved by the  Attorney-General,  then\r\n\r\nthey  can do whatever the Singapore lawyer can do under  Part\r\n\r\nIV of the Legal Profession Act.  That is how I read the Bill.\r\n\r\nIf  I am wrong, I wish to be corrected on it.  But I see that\r\n\r\nto  practise Singapore law the definition is to be able to do\r\n\r\nwhatever the Singapore lawyers can do under Part IV and  have\r\n\r\nthe same rights and privileges, and of course the major right\r\n\r\nand  privilege is the appearance in Singapore courts.  So  we\r\n\r\nare  now opening the door to foreign lawyers coming in.   Are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to  place the same restrictions on  these  foreign\r\n\r\nlawyers who come in, requiring them to have degrees only from\r\n\r\nselected universities, and of attaining a certain standard in\r\n\r\ntheir  degree  before  they  are admitted?   What  about  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of whether they are to be resident in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nnot?   Are  we going to allow a foreign lawyer,  who  is  not\r\n\r\nresident in Singapore, to apply for registration, and then to\r\n\r\nturn  up in Singapore to do court work?  That does not appear\r\n\r\nclear to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we are unduly favouring foreigners\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of our own people.  This, I suppose,  is  in\r\n\r\nline  with the declared policy, that we have heard from  time\r\n\r\nto  time, that Singapore needs foreign talent, that  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  got  the talent.  I question that.  It seems to  me  too\r\n\r\neasy a way out.  And Mr Sin, may I say, rightly asked whether\r\n\r\nthe expectations of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransfer of expertise is not perhaps misplaced.  How is  this\r\n\r\ngoing  to  ensure, as he has pointed out, that the  expertise\r\n\r\nwill be transferred to Singapore lawyers unless, again as  he\r\n\r\nsays, Singapore law becomes the governing law?  Is there  any\r\n\r\ngreat  expectations of that happening?   And  how  will  that\r\n\r\nhappen  by  just allowing foreign law firms to go into  joint\r\n\r\nlaw ventures or law alliances with the Singapore firms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is that after a foreign lawyer\r\n\r\nhas  been registered with the Attorney-General, he enjoys the\r\n\r\nsame rights and privileges, including the right to appear  in\r\n\r\nthe courts on any matter, not just a case involving financial\r\n\r\ntransactions.  He is not limited to that.  He  is  not  under\r\n\r\nthe  disciplinary control of the Council of the Law  Society,\r\n\r\nbut  he  is  under the disciplinary control of the  Attorney-General.   Why  this  differentiation?   If  he  is   to   be\r\n\r\nregistered and to enjoy the same rights and privileges  as  a\r\n\r\nSingapore   lawyer,   and   has   the   required   practising\r\n\r\ncertificate,  should  he  not  come  under  the  disciplinary\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Council of the Law Society, rather  than  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General?    Would  he  be  required   to   pay   the\r\n\r\nsubscriptions that Singapore lawyers pay to the Law Society?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like an answer to these questions from the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State.  But, as I said, it  seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nsuddenly we are opening the doors to foreign lawyers, and not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  the  right  kind of  lawyers  that  we  need  in\r\n\r\nSingapore at the expense of our own local lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould like to declare my interest as a practising lawyer, and\r\n\r\nalso  to  state  that  I have no interest  in  the  amendment\r\n\r\ninvolving formal law alliances  and joint law ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the amendments go, I think they are\r\n\r\ntimely.  They come in the wake of the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Services  Review Committee, chaired by  the  Attorney-General, and the Law Reform Committee, chaired by the Justice\r\n\r\nof   Appeal,   L.P.   Thean,   on  Corporatisation   of   Law\r\n\r\nPartnerships.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our judicial system and the legal service have won world\r\n\r\naccolades  for being progressive, and being ready to  embrace\r\n\r\nchange.   It  is  timely  that  our  legal  profession   also\r\n\r\npositions  itself for change  -  change to become better  and\r\n\r\nto become world-class law firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments before this House seek to address\r\n\r\ntwo  critical issues for the legal profession.  The first  is\r\n\r\nthe  corporatisation of legal practice for the setting up  of\r\n\r\nlaw   corporations.   I  am  happy  that  corporate   limited\r\n\r\nliability will be extended to legal practitioners.  It is not\r\n\r\nuncommon  in  the past for all partners of a law  firm  being\r\n\r\nexposed  to claims and, in some cases, to substantial claims.\r\n\r\nWhilst   insurance  helps,  in  cases  of  fraud  and   other\r\n\r\ninstances,  insurance  does  not  cover  these  areas.   With\r\n\r\nlimited  liability, the directors and shareholders  of  these\r\n\r\nlaw  corporations  can  enjoy protection  on  their  personal\r\n\r\nassets, save for the partner who is in default.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my only concern is: how do we ensure that the\r\n\r\nclient is adequately protected in instances where there is  a\r\n\r\nmisfeasance by a partner or a practising lawyer  of  the  law\r\n\r\ncorporation?    Whilst   the   Law   Society   arranges   for\r\n\r\nprofessional indemnity as a group, my concern is that not all\r\n\r\nlaw  firms take insurance to provide for non-negligent areas,\r\n\r\nparticularly like fraud.  I was happy to hear the Minister of\r\n\r\nState say that he will be looking carefully into the area  of\r\n\r\ninsurance,  and I would urge that serious attention  be  paid\r\n\r\ninto   the   area  of  insurance  coverage  for   these   law\r\n\r\ncorporations.   Many  a time,  law firms  choose  a  form  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  which is low cost, because if they take  a  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very extensive and covers every field of  possible\r\n\r\nclaim,  then  it  will  lead to the cost  of  services  being\r\n\r\nrendered much higher.  So I would urge the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nto look carefully into the form of insurance that needs to be\r\n\r\ntaken  up by these law corporations, so that clients  of  law\r\n\r\nfirms  who  engage  these  law  corporations  are  not  short\r\n\r\nchanged,  as  many laymen may not be able to distinguish  the\r\n\r\ndifference between a sole proprietorship, a partnership and a\r\n\r\nlaw corporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that I would like to raise in respect\r\n\r\nof  law  corporations is the question  of  why  is  there  no\r\n\r\nminimum paid-up capital for these law corporations.  Here,  I\r\n\r\nam  concerned  because looking at the way the amendments  are\r\n\r\ndrafted,  there is no clear minimum paid-up capital  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded for these law corporations.  Even an employment agency\r\n\r\nthat  is being set up under the Ministry of Manpower, I think\r\n\r\nthey   require   a  minimum  paid-up  capital  of   $100,000.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  there  are  many  other  corporations  which  are\r\n\r\nregulated  by various bodies where a minimum paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nis  required.  I would recommend that, depending on the  size\r\n\r\nof the law corporation and depending on the number of lawyers\r\n\r\nwho are involved, perhaps a minimum paid-up capital needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  laid  down,  so  that  members of  the  public  can  feel\r\n\r\ncomforted  by the amount of paid-up capital that a  law  firm\r\n\r\nhas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that I would like to raise is why\r\n\r\ndo  we  limit  the shareholding of these law corporations  to\r\n\r\nlawyers  only.   New  section 81H  of  the  Legal  Profession\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  will  only  allow  solicitors  to   become\r\n\r\nshareholders.   Subsection (2) says, \"may  be  held  by  such\r\n\r\nother  persons  or  class of persons as may  be  prescribed.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  it is unclear now who is this class of persons who  can\r\n\r\nhold shares in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the shareholding structure of these\r\n\r\nlaw  corporations  be liberalised for several  reasons.   For\r\n\r\none,  some lawyers have expressed the view that allowing non-lawyers to become shareholders in these law corporations will\r\n\r\nhave a great impact on them, particularly in relation to  the\r\n\r\nethical   standards,   and  that   as   compared   to   other\r\n\r\ncorporations,  law  corporations  are  distinct  because,  as\r\n\r\nofficers of the court, they owe a duty to the court.   But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that these can be addressed with adequate provisions,\r\n\r\nas these standards and duties are personal to the lawyer as a\r\n\r\nlegal practitioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one possible way to ensure that lawyers remain in\r\n\r\ncontrol is perhaps by restricting the non-lawyer shareholding\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot more than 49% at any time.  I am quite sure that such  an\r\n\r\napproach will allow for the flow of investments to law  firms\r\n\r\nfrom  other  professionals.  And such an approach will  allow\r\n\r\nfor  cross  shareholding among the different professions  and\r\n\r\npave the way for multi-disciplinary practices in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another creature that could also be considered to\r\n\r\nallay  the  fear  that  shareholders will  interfere  in  the\r\n\r\npractice of law is perhaps a class of shares, like preference\r\n\r\nshareholding,  be created.  Because some law firms  could  be\r\n\r\nlimited  in  size,  and finance also.  If they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nobtain  external finance, it could be a form  of  investment.\r\n\r\nThey  could  invest  in better IT equipment,  recruit  better\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  expand  their business.   So,  allowing  for  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  form of shareholding besides ordinary shareholding\r\n\r\nwill allow law firms to tap into other forms of investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendment that is\r\n\r\nbefore  this  House,  which  is the  creation  of  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures and formal law alliances under Part IXA of the Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  (Amendment) Bill.  The provision  for  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures and formal law alliances is in line with the move to\r\n\r\nmake   Singapore  a  premier  financial  centre.   The  legal\r\n\r\nprofession here has been recognised as being among  the  best\r\n\r\nin  Asia, as was highlighted by the Minister of State from an\r\n\r\narticle  in  the  Business Times of 13th  January.   However,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been criticism that there is only a very  limited\r\n\r\npool   of   local  practitioners  experienced  in   top-notch\r\n\r\ninternational and corporate practices such as securitisation,\r\n\r\nproject  finance  and  structured finance.   Sir,  some  have\r\n\r\nattributed  this  to the ban on foreign law firms  not  being\r\n\r\nable  to  practise  local law and restricting  themselves  to\r\n\r\noffshore work only.  Not doing anything will lead to the  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses who do cross-border transactions having to  engage\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign law firms to advise them or document cross-border transactions elsewhere.  This certainly increases  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  the  work and also takes more time to complete  the\r\n\r\nwork.   The  provision of joint law ventures and  formal  law\r\n\r\nalliances  will allow for local firms to tie up with  foreign\r\n\r\nfirms and offer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none-stop  service  centres.  This will  certainly  allow  for\r\n\r\nworld-class   legal  service  for  businesses  operating   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and in the region.  This will certainly enhance the\r\n\r\nreputation   of   Singapore  not  only  as  an  international\r\n\r\nfinancial  hub  but also as an international legal  hub  just\r\n\r\nlike London and New York.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment also comes at a time when some of our\r\n\r\nlaw  firms are also expanding in the region.  Just as our law\r\n\r\nfirms wish that they will be allowed to practise local law in\r\n\r\nthese  countries  where they are now expanding,  foreign  law\r\n\r\nfirms  are also wishing that they can be allowed to  practise\r\n\r\nlocal  law through these vehicles as they would also like  to\r\n\r\noffer one-stop legal services to their clients for their home\r\n\r\ncountries.  Hence, this amendment comes at a timely moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, there are concerns raised whether the law\r\n\r\nfirms  will be aggressive and take away substantial  business\r\n\r\nfrom  the  bigger  law  firms  who  will  face  the  greatest\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  these joint law ventures  and  formal  law\r\n\r\nalliances.   How  do we ensure that these foreign  law  firms\r\n\r\nindeed pass on the specialised knowledge which is purportedly\r\n\r\nlacking  in Singapore law firms?  How do we also ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese  foreign law firms do not become a means to  monopolise\r\n\r\ninternational  legal work here with little or no  benefit  to\r\n\r\nthe  local firms.  I would urge the Attorney-General  who  is\r\n\r\ngiven  great  powers under the Bill to carefully monitor  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the scheme, and to impress  upon  the  law\r\n\r\nfirms,  particularly the foreign law firms, the intent behind\r\n\r\nthe whole exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other concern expressed is the shareholding or\r\n\r\nassociated  structure that will be allowed.   It  is  unclear\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  formula that these foreign law firms  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to adopt with regard to joint law ventures and formal\r\n\r\nlaw  alliances.  Will these foreign firms be allowed to  hold\r\n\r\n99% of these law corporations or joint law ventures?  Because\r\n\r\nif   it   means  that  they  control  99%  or  a  substantial\r\n\r\npercentage,  I  think it may even lead to a  situation  where\r\n\r\nsome  of  these smaller law firms, as Mr K Shanmugam  earlier\r\n\r\nstated, may be used\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  a  front  like  an Ali Baba operation where  they  merely\r\n\r\nrubber stamp documents and the prime beneficiary becomes  the\r\n\r\nforeign  law  firm.  I think it is  wise  or  perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething which we should look carefully into how foreign law\r\n\r\nfirms  take  an interest in the local practice.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  perhaps the local firms which are  involved  in\r\n\r\nthese  joint  local  ventures or  foreign  law  alliances  do\r\n\r\ncontrol the majority, at least in the initial stage, so  that\r\n\r\nthe  fear  that some of the smaller firms may be  used  as  a\r\n\r\nTrojan Horse to win the business of the corporate world  here\r\n\r\nwill  be  avoided.   I  would urge the  Attorney-General,  in\r\n\r\nformulating the rules, to be mindful of the fear of  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  law firms here that these joint local ventures, if there\r\n\r\nare  loopholes in the shareholding structure, may be used  to\r\n\r\ncome  and  take  away  business from  the  local  law  firms,\r\n\r\nparticularly the bigger law firms, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Legal Profession (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join\r\n\r\nin  the  debate.   I  would  like to provide  a  non-lawyer's\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore maps out its strategy to operate in a\r\n\r\nborderless  economy,  the underlying business  infrastructure\r\n\r\nmust  be  modified  and necessary changes made to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  realisation  of  these objectives, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  services sector.  Towards this end, the amendments\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill will go a long way, especially in view  of  the\r\n\r\nballooning  volume of cross-border transactions, as  observed\r\n\r\nby many of my colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-business stance of Singapore is well known and\r\n\r\noften  cited  as  one of the main reasons for investments  by\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals.  The proposed amendments under  section  103\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate  the formation of foreign law  ventures  and\r\n\r\nalliances,  thereby allowing an integration  of  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal expertise.  This is especially crucial to enabling  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector  to  cater to multiple jurisdictions  in  an\r\n\r\nefficient and effective way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this perspective, I find the process and\r\n\r\ndecision making relating to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  application  for a foreign law venture  or  alliance  as\r\n\r\noutlined in the new section 130B, to be slightly inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith  the overall intent, and lacking in transparency.  Allow\r\n\r\nme, Sir, to elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) provides for the Attorney-General to\r\n\r\nconsult \"such authorities as may be prescribed\".  May  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister who these authorities are, and would the list be\r\n\r\nmade  public?  In addition, I would like to echo Prof. Chin's\r\n\r\ncall to publicise the guidelines for setting up such ventures\r\n\r\nand alliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as my colleague, Mr Shanmugam has raised,\r\n\r\nsubsection (4) provides for the Attorney-General to refuse to\r\n\r\napprove   an  application  \"without  assigning  any  reason\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  section 130H states that the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\ndecision \"shall be final and conclusive\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Sir, that these amendments, firstly, do\r\n\r\nnot  provide  for the degree of transparency  that  would  be\r\n\r\nexpected  of Singapore by foreign parties; secondly,  do  not\r\n\r\nallow  for  an  appeal or further discussion  to  support  an\r\n\r\napplication;  and, thirdly, would place the  approving  power\r\n\r\nsolely  with the Attorney-General.  Can the Minister  explain\r\n\r\nif  inputs  from either Government agencies or  the  industry\r\n\r\nwould be incorporated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I end on a short point of\r\n\r\nclarification.   Subsection (6) of new section  81H  proposes\r\n\r\nthat  a  solicitor who is suspended would not be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nhold  shares  in a law corporation.  While this is  justified\r\n\r\nfor those struck off the roll, in the case of a solicitor who\r\n\r\nis suspended for only a short period of time, the penalty may\r\n\r\nappear  to  be  disproportional.   Can  the  Minister  kindly\r\n\r\nclarify, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is timely. It will enable\r\n\r\nthe profession to move\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforward  with  the  times  to keep pace  with  the  worldwide\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the profession and to meet the growing  needs\r\n\r\nof  the business community.  I would like, however, to  raise\r\n\r\nthree points for the Acting Minister's clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the law corporation. Clause 81C of the Bill\r\n\r\nproposes  that  every law corporation shall have  either  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"law corporation\" or the acronym \"LLC\" as part of  its\r\n\r\nname and that no person, firm or group practice other than an\r\n\r\napproved law corporation shall have such words as part of its\r\n\r\nname.   I  have received feedback from some quarters  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community that the use of the acronym \"LLC\" may  not\r\n\r\nbe  appropriate.  This is because the acronym may  be  easily\r\n\r\nconfused  with  the foreign equivalent of \"Limited  Liability\r\n\r\nCorporation\",  which is widely adopted in countries  such  as\r\n\r\nthe United States and certain tax haven locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to comment on the shares of the\r\n\r\nlaw   corporation.   Although  the  Minister  mentioned   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  multi-disciplinary firms emerging  from  the\r\n\r\nproposed corporatisation scheme, the Bill appears to restrict\r\n\r\nthe  ownership  of  law corporation basically  to  practising\r\n\r\nsolicitors.   There  are definite merits in  restricting  the\r\n\r\nshares  of  law corporations to within the legal  profession.\r\n\r\nAn  obvious advantage is that the profession's standards  and\r\n\r\nethics  are  best maintained by solicitor shareholders.    In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  legal  standards and ethics will  not  be  easily\r\n\r\noverlooked or inadvertently diluted by shareholders  who  are\r\n\r\noutside the profession and who will be excessively driven  by\r\n\r\ncommercial  interests  and gains.   The  flip  side  to  this\r\n\r\nrestriction is that it does not encourage the development  of\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplinary professional corporations,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ngrowing trend overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the business environment is getting more complex\r\n\r\nand multi-disciplinary.  News about mega mergers confronts us\r\n\r\nalmost   every  other  day.   Ironically,  the   demand   for\r\n\r\nimmediate,  simple and integrated solutions  has  become  the\r\n\r\nnorm of the day.  This phenomenon has led to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npropensity of forming strategic alliances across professions,\r\n\r\noften  involving  lawyers,  auditors,  tax  advisors  and  IT\r\n\r\nconsultants.   Going forward, I can envisage one-stop  multi-disciplinary consultancy centres sprouting out in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this trend, may I ask the Minister to clarify\r\n\r\nif  a capping of the percentage of non-solicitor shareholders\r\n\r\nto  a fixed  appropriate percentage has been considered.  The\r\n\r\ninjection of a multi-disciplinary shareholder interest  would\r\n\r\nbetter equip our law corporations to meet with the demand  of\r\n\r\nthe  business environment with its increasingly regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational  aspects.  At the same time,  the  capping  can\r\n\r\nensure that the legal profession standards and ethics are not\r\n\r\ndiluted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way, the Bill also seems to rule out the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  share option schemes for employees.   Whilst\r\n\r\nthere are other compensation schemes, many corporations  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  realise the benefits of rewarding their  loyal  and\r\n\r\nquality  employees by way of share options.  Incorporating  a\r\n\r\nlaw  firm  opens up the possibility of extending compensation\r\n\r\nschemes to match the trend in the market place which competes\r\n\r\nfor  the same human talent.  It will also promote job loyalty\r\n\r\nand permanence beyond merely direct monetary attractions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership of law corporation therefore should be\r\n\r\nextended  to  other than practising solicitors  and  a  fixed\r\n\r\npercentage specified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, like what my learned colleague had earlier\r\n\r\nsaid,  I am concerned about the provision of clause 81D which\r\n\r\nstates  that the personal liability of the solicitor  is  not\r\n\r\naffected  by  the mere fact that a solicitor  provides  legal\r\n\r\nservice  as  a  director or an employee of a law corporation.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  need  to make a distinction as the  claims  against\r\n\r\nprofessionals are grossly disproportionate to the  fees  that\r\n\r\nthey  earn.  The tendency for such claims is due to the  deep\r\n\r\npocket  syndrome,  as  professionals  such  as  lawyers   and\r\n\r\naccountants usually take up indemnity insurance, which  makes\r\n\r\nthem  prone  to  law suits and claims.  Such disproportionate\r\n\r\nclaims are neither fair\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnor  equitable, given that a single successful claim can wipe\r\n\r\nout  the  entire reserves of a law corporation  and,  if  the\r\n\r\nlatter  is insufficient, the personal assets of the solicitor\r\n\r\nproviding  the legal service.  In the event that a successful\r\n\r\nclaim  brings down a law corporation, the repercussions  will\r\n\r\nbe felt beyond the profession concerned. The employees of the\r\n\r\ncorporation  will  be  affected and so  would  the  immediate\r\n\r\nfamily of the solicitor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a professional, the ultimate punishment for an\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory    professional   conduct   or    professional\r\n\r\nmisconduct  is to be struck off the roll or to  be  suspended\r\n\r\nfrom  practice.  This recourse is generally available.  Where\r\n\r\na  claim  is  made  on the assets of the  solicitor,  it  may\r\n\r\ntantamount to double punishment or jeopardy.  Due to the fear\r\n\r\nof  litigation, a solicitor may also so qualifies his  advice\r\n\r\nas  to  significantly  reduce his effectiveness.   It  is  of\r\n\r\ncrucial  importance to the commercial life of Singapore  that\r\n\r\nour  professionals should feel free to give advice  in  clear\r\n\r\nand forthright terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the claims sought and awarded against solicitors\r\n\r\nshould  bear some relationship to the quantum of fees charged\r\n\r\nwhich  is  based  on the complexity and time  spent  on  each\r\n\r\nassignment,  and not on the level of risks and likelihood  of\r\n\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to clarify whether he\r\n\r\nwill  consider  a  capping  on  the  liability  of  the   law\r\n\r\ncorporations, including the solicitor concerned, to a maximum\r\n\r\nmultiple of the assignment fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few points which I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nclarify, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank all\r\n\r\nthe speakers who have spoken up.  I think all of them are  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill, except perhaps for Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers have expressed some concerns. Some of these\r\n\r\nconcerns  are  valid, which I would deal  with.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nheartening  to note that all of them see the need  for  these\r\n\r\nchanges.  As I have said in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmy speech which Members have appreciated, this is a cautious,\r\n\r\nbalanced  start.  These are not sweeping changes.  These  are\r\n\r\ncarefully  thought  through changes  of  the  Legal  Services\r\n\r\nReview   Committee  headed  by  the  Attorney-General   which\r\n\r\nconsulted  many  players  on the ground,  balancing  what  is\r\n\r\nneeded  for Singapore.  I think Mr Shanmugam makes the point.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not for the benefit of Singapore lawyers or  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of foreign lawyers, but a scheme which will fill up a\r\n\r\ngap  which  exists in the current legal sector  and  also  to\r\n\r\nensure  that Singapore's financial centre drive continues  to\r\n\r\nreceive  the support of the legal services.  I think that  is\r\n\r\nimportant.  That is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that while we make a start, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor these amendments.  This is a point  which\r\n\r\na  few  speakers  have made, including Mr Ravindran.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  because,  for a start, the  Attorney-General  with\r\n\r\ninputs,  will have to make a decision as to who to admit  and\r\n\r\napprove  as  joint venture partners and to  form  formal  law\r\n\r\nalliances.  He will assess how these foreign firms which  are\r\n\r\nregistered  or  approved will perform and whether  the  needs\r\n\r\nare  met  by  their inputs.  These will have to be  assessed.\r\n\r\nThey are not cast in stone.   But certainly we will take this\r\n\r\napproach and we will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Committee's recommendations\r\n\r\nhave  been  approved  by Government and adopted.   This  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  the  framework on which these  recommendations  are\r\n\r\nmounted.   But  there  is  also in  place  an  Implementation\r\n\r\nCommittee headed by the Attorney-General with representatives\r\n\r\nfrom the various involved players, including, I believe,  the\r\n\r\nDean of the Law Faculty, Law Society and so forth, which will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make  the rules so that the scheme  will  work.\r\n\r\nThese are the few general comments that I want to make.  This\r\n\r\nis  not a sudden change.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam would want to\r\n\r\npaint  the picture that Government is flip-flopping.  But  we\r\n\r\nare   talking  about  different  things  altogether   -   the\r\n\r\nrestriction on the number of lawyers,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  aim  was  to  boost  the  quality  of  lawyers  who  are\r\n\r\npractising  here,  especially Singaporean  students  who  are\r\n\r\ntrained overseas, and that is why there is a requirement  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  come  only from 15 scheduled foreign  universities.\r\n\r\nAll those issues have been largely and widely debated.  Their\r\n\r\naims are quite different.  So now we are not just opening  up\r\n\r\nto  all  and sundry.   We are doing a very selective process,\r\n\r\nopening up a certain sector of the legal services market to a\r\n\r\ncertain select group of lawyers who can fill that need.   And\r\n\r\neven  when they are registered or approved, they can only  do\r\n\r\ncertain  designated  things, and certainly  not  practise  in\r\n\r\ncourt.   This is very clear from the Committee's report  even\r\n\r\nthough it may not be expressed in the Bill.  Certainly,  this\r\n\r\nis not a back door way for foreign lawyers to come and appear\r\n\r\nin our courts.  I can give this assurance to Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with one primary concern which Members have\r\n\r\nraised.   This  has appeared through different threads.   But\r\n\r\nthe  point  really is: how do we ensure that  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbenefit,  that the regime that is set in place  will  achieve\r\n\r\nits  intended  effect of absorbing legal services  that  will\r\n\r\nfill  up the recognised gaps?  Prof. Chin puts it this way  - whether  or  not the joint law ventures and formal  alliances\r\n\r\nwill  also  facilitate the entry of critical non-banking  and\r\n\r\nnon-financial  areas of law, such as information  technology.\r\n\r\nHe  sees  that  need.  And indeed there is a need.   But  the\r\n\r\nquestion,  of  course, is the pace and  how  we  do  it.   Mr\r\n\r\nShanmugam has cautioned that we should not open up the  doors\r\n\r\nfor all and sundry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what the Committee intends to do, I understand, is to\r\n\r\nagain  take  a  balanced approach.  There  is  a  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween formal law alliances and joint ventures.  Insofar  as\r\n\r\nformal law alliances are concerned, I understand that AG will\r\n\r\nexercise  his flexibility vis-a-vis foreign firms  which  may\r\n\r\nhave  expertise in, for example, information technology, with\r\n\r\na  clear  understanding  and proper analysis  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nneeds.  I think that is a point I must continually emphasise.\r\n\r\nAG, as Chairman of the Committee, was on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njob  for  two years.  He knows what Singapore needs from  all\r\n\r\nhis  consultations.  Members have pointed  out  that  AG,  in\r\n\r\nfact, is the key player in the entire exercise.  But he  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  alone.  Because, for example, in considering whether\r\n\r\nor  not an application for a joint venture or formal alliance\r\n\r\nshould  be approved, he will consult other relevant  agencies\r\n\r\nand   authorities,  including  the  Monetary   Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   He will consult them and take their  inputs.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that this will be published in the rules  which  Mrs\r\n\r\nLim Hwee Hua has asked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not the scheme will allow also the\r\n\r\ninflux  of expertise in non-banking and non-financial related\r\n\r\nareas, the answer is yes.  But again a cautious start through\r\n\r\nformal  law alliances, and only in those areas where  AG,  in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of  Singapore's strategic  needs,  thinks  will\r\n\r\nbenefit Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I understand that for joint law ventures,\r\n\r\nthey may still bring in expertise in some areas, for example,\r\n\r\nIT  and  telecommunication laws, as transactions that require\r\n\r\nknowledge of IT and telecommunications constitute part of the\r\n\r\nlarger  project  financing  deals.   There  will  not  be   a\r\n\r\nconscious  effort, but it will be one of the side-effects  of\r\n\r\nhaving  these  foreign lawyers come in and  do  the  work  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So that is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a good point that Members have made,\r\n\r\nwhich  is, we should ensure that firms that come in  are  not\r\n\r\nfirms  that  ride on a \"Ali Baba\" arrangement.   I  think  Mr\r\n\r\nShanmugam made this point.  In other words, we should not  be\r\n\r\ntaken for a ride.  Some Members have asked if Singapore firms\r\n\r\nhave that strength, that depth of expertise to really be full-fledged  partners  with these foreign  firms.   I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier on that the Business Times have reported that the  UK\r\n\r\nLegalese  Limited Report says that we have  done  very  well.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, over the last three to five years, many Singapore\r\n\r\nfirms  have  already  entered into  informal  alliances  with\r\n\r\nforeign partners.  So that is not a new game for them.   They\r\n\r\nare  already  into this process.  What we are  doing  now  is\r\n\r\ngiving them a choice of a more formal structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to a point that Prof. Chin asks: why are\r\n\r\nthere two types of collaboration?  I think the approach is to\r\n\r\ngive  law  firms  a choice.  Do they want to  go  in  with  a\r\n\r\ntighter  fit, like a joint venture, or a looser fit, sort  of\r\n\r\nengagement  before a marriage?  I think Mr  Shanmugam  talked\r\n\r\nabout  that  process.  You may not want to straightaway  rush\r\n\r\ninto  it.  Enter into a formal alliance, not a single entity,\r\n\r\nwhere  instead  of a distinct entity, one can  have  all  the\r\n\r\nbenefits - one marketing centre, one billing centre  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  sharing  some expertise, foreign lawyers  can  draft\r\n\r\ndocuments on cross-border transactions, even including  those\r\n\r\nrelating  to  Singapore  law,  but  they  cannot  advise   on\r\n\r\nSingapore  law.   So  you  see  the  nice  balance  that  the\r\n\r\nCommittee must have thought through, how to ensure that there\r\n\r\nis  a  gradation  for law firms which may not  want  to  jump\r\n\r\nstraight into the fray.  Then when they are prepared, they go\r\n\r\nahead.   Of  course, there may be some Singapore  firms,  the\r\n\r\nbigger  ones, who are confident enough and having  considered\r\n\r\nthe  pros and the cons, because there will be pros and  cons,\r\n\r\nif  you enter into a joint venture with one particular  firm,\r\n\r\nyou  may  stop  other  referrals from  coming  to  you,  they\r\n\r\nproceed.   So  the scheme is such that it is flexible  enough\r\n\r\nfor  law  firms to make their own judgements,  do  their  own\r\n\r\nsums, and then come to a decision how they want to do it.  It\r\n\r\ngives them some flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is this point about how to ensure that law\r\n\r\nfirms  which come in will indeed add value.  Here, again,  AG\r\n\r\nis the person primarily tasked with this important job.  Like\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  he  will  consult  other  relevant  agencies,\r\n\r\nincluding the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  He  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  look at the track record of firms which  apply,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  track record and expertise of foreign  lawyers  in\r\n\r\nthese  firms.  Foreign lawyers in these firms -  I  think  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  made  this point - should not  come  in  and  take\r\n\r\ncontrol.   It is important that they do not come  in  in  the\r\n\r\nguise  of  a joint venture when, in fact, they are practising\r\n\r\nin  Singapore wholly on their own.  This point has been taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration.  Because the rules that will be made will\r\n\r\nsay  that  in  a  joint law venture, the number  of  offshore\r\n\r\npartners\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not exceed the number of local partners, so that  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  will  not  fall into the  hands  of  the  foreign\r\n\r\npartners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also important is that each applicant for a\r\n\r\njoint  venture licence or registration must submit a business\r\n\r\nplan.   In  other words, the ball is really in  their  court.\r\n\r\nThey  have to persuade and convince the AG that they can  add\r\n\r\nvalue.   And  this strategy is also a good one  because  they\r\n\r\nwill then be monitored against their business plan over time.\r\n\r\nThe business plan will therefore act as a benchmark - whether\r\n\r\nthey  are delivering on their promises.  If they do not, then\r\n\r\nthe  next  time their registration comes up for renewal,  the\r\n\r\njoint venture will not be renewed.  And I think this acts  as\r\n\r\na  very  good safeguard because foreign firms which  want  to\r\n\r\nenter  into  joint venture arrangements with Singapore  firms\r\n\r\nare reputable firms which will not risk their reputation.  AG\r\n\r\nhas many years of experience doing this already.  Because  we\r\n\r\nhave  had many offshore firms coming to Singapore to  set  up\r\n\r\nbranches here and they must get permission from the  AG.   So\r\n\r\nhe is not a new boy in the block.  He has been doing this for\r\n\r\na  long  time.   I  believe that the  AG  has  the  necessary\r\n\r\nwherewithal to handle this task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question arises as to why when foreign lawyers\r\n\r\ncome  in  they are treated differently from local lawyers  in\r\n\r\nterms of the disciplinary process.  The feedback that we have\r\n\r\nis  that  foreign lawyers, in fact, prefer a system  that  is\r\n\r\nconfidential.   They would prefer not to be involved  in  the\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  processes of the Law Society,  ie,  they  would\r\n\r\nrather  that  the current regime continues.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  AG  will  still be the primary person who will  regulate\r\n\r\nthem  and discipline them.  But he will not be doing it in  a\r\n\r\nvacuum  because  the  Act says that the rules  can  prescribe\r\n\r\nCodes of Conduct and Ethics by which foreign lawyers will  be\r\n\r\njudged,  will  be  pegged  against,  so  that  when  the   AG\r\n\r\ndisciplines  them, he will not be doing it in a  vacuum.   He\r\n\r\nwill  be  doing it in that context.  Indeed, the Act provides\r\n\r\nthat before he disciplines a lawyer, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlawyer  would  have  the  opportunity  to  submit  a  written\r\n\r\nexplanation,  and  then  AG will act  if  he  has  sufficient\r\n\r\nreasons  to do so.  Mr Jeyaretnam makes that point.   But  he\r\n\r\nshould not worry for these foreign players who come in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is whether or not the entry of foreign\r\n\r\nlawyers  will  lead to hardship for local lawyers.   I  think\r\n\r\nthere   will  be  some  adjustments.   There  will  be   more\r\n\r\ncompetition.   So  a lot depends on the local  lawyers.   Are\r\n\r\nthey  up to it?  Do they see the need for the move?  Are they\r\n\r\npositive, and indeed I think many are positive.  Two to three\r\n\r\nyears ago when the fact was announced that the Government was\r\n\r\nlooking  into  this, local lawyers were more resistant.   But\r\n\r\nover  time, partly because of the economic crisis and  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of what is happening elsewhere, I think they realise\r\n\r\n-  and  also  partly because of the work being  done  in  the\r\n\r\nregion by local law firms - that there is a market out there.\r\n\r\nThere  is now greater confidence on the part of local players\r\n\r\nto tie up with foreign partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will local law firms be affected? I think a lot will\r\n\r\ndepend  on how they respond to the challenge.  If the  scheme\r\n\r\nworks  out,  as it should, where the AG takes in  established\r\n\r\nreputable  firms who will give us their business plans,  whom\r\n\r\nthe   AG   assesses  will  work  for  Singapore,  and   these\r\n\r\nestablished foreign firms do not take us for a ride, as  they\r\n\r\nprobably will not, and they come in and do the type  of  work\r\n\r\nwhich  currently only a small percentage of top-notch lawyers\r\n\r\nare exposed to, ie, Tier 1 work, which will then be available\r\n\r\nto  a  larger  number of Singapore lawyers, a good  start  is\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann wondered whether this will benefit\r\n\r\nSingapore lawyers.  I think he himself has answered it.   For\r\n\r\na  start,  it  may not be a quick uplift.  But, I  think,  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers get exposed to Tier 1 work, complex  work,\r\n\r\nthey will also be clued in.  It may not be Singapore law, but\r\n\r\nthen   they  will  be  exposed  to  the  documentation,   the\r\n\r\nprocesses.   And  over  time as these joint  ventures  become\r\n\r\nlarger  and  venture into the region - as I have said  in  my\r\n\r\nSecond Reading speech - they may,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  fact, push for Singapore law to be the governing  law  of\r\n\r\nthese  regional  contracts.  So this is  a  process  which  I\r\n\r\nthink,  if  all  works well, will indeed be  a  boon  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore legal sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, small firms will continue to have a\r\n\r\nrole.   I  think much has been said about this too.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nout  of  the 800 law firms in Singapore, about half, 430  are\r\n\r\nactually sole proprietorships.  So despite the fact that  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  law  has  become harder  -  quicker  deadlines,\r\n\r\ngreater  client expectations - there is still a large  number\r\n\r\nof  small  firms  out  there  - sole  proprietorships,  small\r\n\r\npartnerships - who cater to Singaporeans who need services in\r\n\r\ncontract matters and advice on family law and  criminal laws.\r\n\r\nThe  point  is  that Singaporeans need not fear that  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  this opening up, costs will rise so astronomically that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  even  have  access  to  legal  services.   This\r\n\r\napproach  really,  together  with  the  other  amendments  on\r\n\r\ncorporatisation,   increases   the   choice   for   Singapore\r\n\r\nconsumers.  We are talking about the mode of delivering legal\r\n\r\nservices.  So besides the sole proprietorship, you  have  got\r\n\r\nyour   small  partnerships.   And  indeed  even   for   small\r\n\r\npartnerships,  some  of  them have created  niche  practices.\r\n\r\nOthers  are larger partnerships.  And now there will  be  law\r\n\r\nfirms  in  the  form  of corporations.   Then  you  have  got\r\n\r\ninformal law alliances which are existing and soon formal law\r\n\r\nalliances,  and joint ventures.  So there is a  whole  range.\r\n\r\nEven  as there is a whole range of consumers, now there is  a\r\n\r\nwhole range of suppliers, and the matching can be done by the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered most of the major concerns which\r\n\r\nMembers  have  raised.  There are also some good  suggestions\r\n\r\nmade by Members.  For example, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked whether\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  law corporations should be required  to  divest\r\n\r\ntheir shares when suspended for a short period.  I think that\r\n\r\nis  a  good  point.  The Bill provides that a lawyer  who  is\r\n\r\nsuspended   from  practice  cannot  take  part  directly   or\r\n\r\nindirectly   in  the  management  or  practice   of   a   law\r\n\r\ncorporation.   However, I think she also has noted  that  the\r\n\r\nBill provides that a suspended lawyer cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhold  any  shares in a law corporation unless the Council  of\r\n\r\nthe  Law Society grants him a grace period to dispose of  the\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point, of course, is that if the suspension is\r\n\r\na  short period, should he be made to divest his shares, only\r\n\r\nto,  after  the suspension is over, buy back the shares?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  cannot  pre-empt the Council who  must  make  the\r\n\r\ndecision  and  exercise its discretion.  But I  should  think\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  suspension is really for  an  extremely  short\r\n\r\nperiod,  a few months, for example, so that it is impractical\r\n\r\nfor  the  lawyers to divest his shares during the  suspension\r\n\r\nperiod and then buy them back immediately, it could well be a\r\n\r\nreasonable exercise of the Council's discretion to grant  the\r\n\r\ngrace period which covers the entire suspension period.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  wait  and see whether the  Council  takes  this\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Ravindran argues that law corporations should\r\n\r\nhave  a minimum paid-up capital.  This question was, in fact,\r\n\r\nconsidered  very carefully by the Law Reform  Committee.   It\r\n\r\nwas  decided on balance that there was no need to provide for\r\n\r\na  minimum  paid-up  capital, as it was felt  that  the  best\r\n\r\nprotection for clients or corporations is to ensure that they\r\n\r\nare  adequately insured to cover any claims which clients may\r\n\r\nmake  against them.  Hence, as I said in my speech, the rules\r\n\r\nwill set out what is the minimum coverage that is required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, for lenders who lend to these law corporations,\r\n\r\neven  though they are private exempt companies and  therefore\r\n\r\nneed not file annual returns, if they are scrupulous, careful\r\n\r\nlenders,  they  can  ask  the firm  for  its  accounts.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Bill provides that law corporations must  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the  Solicitor's Accounts Rules and that  includes  the\r\n\r\nfiling  of the accountant's report with the audited  accounts\r\n\r\nwith the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  That is a safeguard\r\n\r\nwhich lenders of law corporations can take up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Sin Boon Ann makes, and which I\r\n\r\nthink Mr Noris Ong also supports, is why lawyers in law\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncorporations  should  not also enjoy limited  liability.   Mr\r\n\r\nNoris  Ong's  case  is that his liability should  be  capped.\r\n\r\nThis  is  of course a matter of debate.  But the position  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  we take this tack, it may lead to a lawyer lowering\r\n\r\nhis  guard and hence, lower professional standards.  We think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  probably  in the public interest  that  lawyers\r\n\r\ncontinue to be personally liable for matters over which  they\r\n\r\nhave  personal charge.  We think this is the correct approach\r\n\r\nbecause  lawyers, even though they operate in the context  of\r\n\r\nlaw  corporation, are still professionally charged  with  the\r\n\r\nduties that are incumbent on them.  Indeed, they are expected\r\n\r\nto  be  competent and exercise due diligence in matters  over\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  charge.   So  I  would  expect  in  a  law\r\n\r\ncorporation, the directors would have to decide  who  is  the\r\n\r\nbest person to handle a particular deal.  That is one of  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  a  law  corporation where  directors  can  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  legal expertise.  The point is the directors  will\r\n\r\nthen  not say, \"I don't want to handle this because if I take\r\n\r\nit up and anything goes wrong, I am personally liable.\"  This\r\n\r\nis  a  management  decision which  the  directors  in  a  law\r\n\r\ncorporation  must  make.  Because if none  of  the  directors\r\n\r\nwants to handle the deal, then the deal will go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Noris Ong makes is on the\r\n\r\nacronym  \"LLC\".   \"LLC\"  was  suggested  by  the  Law  Reform\r\n\r\nCommittee  which included two Senior Counsels and  other  law\r\n\r\nfirm  partners.   There was no objection  expressed  to  this\r\n\r\nacronym  which,  in  our  context, stands  for  \"Limited  Law\r\n\r\nCorporation\".  It is felt that the acronym should  not  cause\r\n\r\nany  confusion  when used in Singapore for  domestic  clients\r\n\r\nalthough  in  some  jurisdictions, LLC may have  a  different\r\n\r\nmeaning,  ie, Limited Liability Company.  But in  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontext,  the  fact  is that - I have mentioned  this  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  -  the  invoice and the official correspondence  must\r\n\r\nstate  that this is a law corporation with limited liability.\r\n\r\nSo  domestic  clients  dealing with the  law  firm  which  is\r\n\r\nincorporated  will know who he is dealing with.   We  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it will cause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfusion.   But in any case, for people who  want  to  avoid\r\n\r\ndoubt, the Bill actually gives an option.  You can either put\r\n\r\n\"LLC\"  or \"Law Corporation\".  So those law corporations which\r\n\r\nhave US clients may want to adopt that option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that has been mentioned is why the\r\n\r\nprovision that all shareholders must be solicitors.  Both  Mr\r\n\r\nNoris Ong and Mr Ravindran know that, from the Bill, this  is\r\n\r\nthe current position.  But the Bill itself provides that,  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  the rules can prescribe for other non-solicitors  to\r\n\r\nbe  shareholders.   As some Members will know,  this  vehicle\r\n\r\ncalled  the multi-disciplinary practice is in fact  something\r\n\r\nwhich many other jurisdictions have considered.  I understand\r\n\r\nthat there is a working committee of the Law Society which is\r\n\r\nalso considering that.  So I think that is something for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  And if, indeed, the rules are changed, I am sure the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  made  by  Mr  Ong  and  Mr  Ravindran  will   be\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

The  National\r\n\r\nManpower  Council, chaired by the Minister for  Manpower,  is\r\n\r\nthe  forum  where  such manpower decisions  are  taken.   The\r\n\r\nuniversities'   intake  targets  are   derived   from   these\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the university level, our universities proactively\r\n\r\nensure  that graduates receive sufficient preparation to  fit\r\n\r\ninto specific sectors they are trained for.  This is done  in\r\n\r\nseveral ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our universities receive feedback and inputs from\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from the industries in a systematic  manner.\r\n\r\nAt  NUS, Departmental Consultative Committees are set up  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose.   At NTU, they are called the School  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittees.   These  committees  comprise  leaders  in  those\r\n\r\nfields  of society and industry most relevant to each of  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  or  schools.  The committees play  an  important\r\n\r\nrole  in  providing feedback on the quality of graduates  and\r\n\r\nindustry  trends.  The committees also assist in the periodic\r\n\r\nreview  of the curriculum so that it will remain relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the industry.  Where appropriate, proposals for\r\n\r\nnew curriculum or for curriculum review are circulated to key\r\n\r\npersonnel in the targeted industry for their inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the teaching staff are in touch with the\r\n\r\nindustry.   A  significant number of academic  staff  at  our\r\n\r\nuniversities  have prior work experience in the  industry  or\r\n\r\nare  currently  engaged in industrial  consulting  work.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  our universities appoint a number of professionals\r\n\r\nfrom  industry  to  be  adjunct professors/lecturers.   These\r\n\r\nstaff  will  have  a  good sense of what  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nindustry  are.  They can also show students the relevance  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they  learn to real-life problems.  They,  too,  are  a\r\n\r\nvaluable   source   of   industrial   input   to   curricular\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a large proportion of our students undergo work\r\n\r\nattachments during the course of their undergraduate  degree.\r\n\r\nFor instance, all engineering students are required to do a 6-month  industrial attachment in their third  year.   Law  and\r\n\r\nBusiness students also have the opportunity to be involved in\r\n\r\nvarious  forms  of attachments during their vacations.   Such\r\n\r\nattachments expose students to working life and help them see\r\n\r\nhow their training in university relates to industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT PATIENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\n(a)  how  many  intensive care unit  (ICU)  patients  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  University  National  Hospital,  Singapore  General\r\n\r\nHospital,  Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Alexandra Hospital  had\r\n\r\ndied  of  pneumonia from 1995 to 1999 respectively;  and  (b)\r\n\r\nwhether  his Ministry is satisfied with the standard  of  ICU\r\n\r\ncare in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of pneumonia deaths in the ICUs of NUH,\r\n\r\nSGH,  TTSH  and AH from 1995 to 1998 is low and  ranges  from\r\n\r\n0.7%  to 5.3% of all ICU admissions.  Excluding the data  for\r\n\r\n1999  which is not yet available, the total number of  deaths\r\n\r\nfrom  pneumonia  in  the ICUs of the four hospitals  annually\r\n\r\nfrom 1995 to 1998 is 63, 104, 88 and 125 respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of deaths from pneumonia per se is not\r\n\r\nappropriate as a meaningful indicator of infection control in\r\n\r\nthe  ICU.  Patients  in  the ICU are severely  ill  and  more\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to  complications such as  lung  infections.   A\r\n\r\nsignificant number of patients are also admitted into the ICU\r\n\r\nfor the management of severe infections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more appropriate and internationally accepted\r\n\r\nindicator  of infection control in the ICU which is monitored\r\n\r\nby   our   acute   hospitals  is  the  \"ventilator-associated\r\n\r\npneumonia  rate\".   This  rate  measures  the  incidence   of\r\n\r\npneumonia  associated  with  the  use  of  ventilators.   The\r\n\r\nventilator-associated  pneumonia rates  in  our  major  acute\r\n\r\npublic  sector  hospitals range from 7.6 to  33.2  per  1,000\r\n\r\nventilator-days,  which is comparable  to  the  rates  of  US\r\n\r\nhospitals which range from 12.7 to 26.1 per 1,000 ventilator-days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of quality of care in the ICU is a\r\n\r\ncomplex   process.   In  addition  to  monitoring   infection\r\n\r\ncontrol,   hospitals  regularly  set  and  review  ICU   care\r\n\r\nprotocols  and guidelines.

The employer's CPF contribution will be  restored\r\n\r\nby  2%  point  to 12% from 1st April 2000.  The  CPF  Board's\r\n\r\nprojections show that despite the lower CPF contribution rate\r\n\r\nfor  a  few  years,  CPF  members  would  still  be  able  to\r\n\r\naccumulate  sufficient savings for basic old-age needs.   CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  should give an employee who has worked  continuously\r\n\r\nfor  35 to 40 years, a monthly retirement income of about 20%\r\n\r\nto  40%  of his last take-home pay, after paying for  a  home\r\n\r\nwhich  is  commensurate  with his income  and  setting  aside\r\n\r\nsavings for his medical needs in old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the self-employed, since July 1992, those\r\n\r\nwith  a  net  trade income of more than $2,400 per  year  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  contribute  to  the  Medisave  Account.    They\r\n\r\ncontribute between 6% to 8% of their yearly net trade income,\r\n\r\ndepending  on their age. Such contributions are  granted  tax\r\n\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at December 1999, about 231,500 self-employed persons\r\n\r\nwere  contributing to their Medisave Accounts under the  law.\r\n\r\nTo encourage self-employed persons to contribute beyond their\r\n\r\nMedisave  Account,  tax relief is also given  for  additional\r\n\r\nvoluntary CPF contributions.  The tax relief is subject to  a\r\n\r\ncap of 20% of the self-employed persons' net trade income  or\r\n\r\n$14,400,  whichever  is  the lower.   Of  the  231,500  self-employed  persons  who contribute to Medisave,  76,400  (33%)\r\n\r\nmade   voluntary  contributions  on  top  of  their  Medisave\r\n\r\ncontributions.  Self-employed persons who only contribute  to\r\n\r\nMedisave would obviously not have savings for their  old  age\r\n\r\napart  from savings for medical care.  We hope that they  are\r\n\r\nputting  aside  their  own savings or  making  voluntary  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions to prepare for retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the ageing population, savings for old age\r\n\r\nneeds  are  becoming  more important.

This\r\n\r\nmalpractice  is  most  often seen in the construction  sector\r\n\r\nwhere  large  numbers  of foreign workers  are  brought  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  under  construction  work  permits  but  are  then\r\n\r\nredeployed to work illegally in other sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As licensed employment agents are regulated by my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and are liable to lose their licences and  security\r\n\r\ndeposit  should they breach the regulations or conditions  of\r\n\r\ntheir  licences,  it is likely that many of the  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nagents bringing in illegal workers on false promises of  work\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are unlicensed agents operating illegally.  The\r\n\r\npenalties  for operating an unlicensed employment agency  are\r\n\r\n$5,000  for  the  first offence, and $10,000  for  second  or\r\n\r\nsubsequent  offences with a possible jail term  of  up  to  6\r\n\r\nmonths.   My  Ministry will not hesitate  to  prosecute  such\r\n\r\nillegal employment agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more effective and substantive measure against such\r\n\r\nexploitation is to be more selective in allowing the entry of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, both in terms of numbers and skills levels.\r\n\r\nThis  would reduce opportunities for unscrupulous agents from\r\n\r\nbringing  in  foreign workers illegally in the  first  place.\r\n\r\nTo this end, my Ministry has adopted a two-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na)   <br><br><i>Review of the Work Permit Allocation System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have tightened the Work Permit Allocation\r\n\r\nsystem in the construction sector by introducing a system  of\r\n\r\nMan-year  Entitlements,  which  are  allocated  to  the  main\r\n\r\ncontractors  based  on the project size and  actual  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirement.   The main contractors will be  responsible  for\r\n\r\ndistributing these entitlements to their subcontractors.  The\r\n\r\nmain contractors will also be held responsible for the upkeep\r\n\r\nand  welfare  of  the foreign workers of their subcontractors\r\n\r\nshould  these  workers  be abandoned.   It  is  thus  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest   of  the  main  contractors  to  ensure  that   the\r\n\r\nentitlement goes to genuine sub-contractors who will  do  his\r\n\r\nwork.   This will result in less opportunity for unscrupulous\r\n\r\nsub-contractors  to  apply  for  excessive  number  of   work\r\n\r\npermits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been monitoring the new Work Permit\r\n\r\nAllocation system carefully.  Our findings suggest that  main\r\n\r\ncontractors have indeed become more circumspect in allocating\r\n\r\ntheir  work permit entitlements to their subcontractors.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  for  projects that have been completed,  about  55%  of\r\n\r\ntotal work permit entitlements given out have been used. This\r\n\r\nsystem had resulted in fewer work permit applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer term objective as spelt out under the\r\n\r\nConstruction  21  report is to reduce the number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers in the Construction sector by 50% over a period of 10\r\n\r\nyears,  that is, from the current 200,000 foreign workers  to\r\n\r\naround  100,000  workers.  We may be able  to  speed  up  the\r\n\r\nprocess by reviewing and tightening the allocation formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb)    <br><br><i>Ensuring  Better  Quality and  Higher  Skilled  Foreign Workers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is to ensure that the foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  brought in are of better quality with higher  skills\r\n\r\nlevel.  We have found that skilled workers are less likely to\r\n\r\nbe exploited or abused by the employment agents or employers.\r\n\r\nThey  are  also  less  susceptible to scams  by  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployment  agents,  both   local as  well  as  foreign,  and\r\n\r\nemployers.   Hence with effect from 1st April 2000,  all  new\r\n\r\nnon-traditional  source  foreign  workers  employed  in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction   industry  have  to  pass  the   Basic   Skills\r\n\r\nCertificate (BSC) test in their home countries.  This is  the\r\n\r\nfirst step in raising the skills requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer-term, as stated in the Construction 21\r\n\r\nReport, we hope to have 45% of the construction workforce  as\r\n\r\nskilled   workers   by  2005  and  60%  by   2010.    Skilled\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers refer to those who can meet  our  NTC-2\r\n\r\n(practical) requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry's two-pronged approach will minimize\r\n\r\nopportunities  for fraudulent practices by  local  employment\r\n\r\nagents  and  employers.  However, we would  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  unscrupulous agents in foreign countries.   What  we\r\n\r\ncan and will do is to ensure that foreigners taking the Basic\r\n\r\nSkills  Certificate  tests in their home countries  are  made\r\n\r\naware   of   the  Work  Permit  regulations  covering   their\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore before they come here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INJURIES RESULTING FROM MILITARY TRAINING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and Minister for Defence if he will give an  update\r\n\r\non  the trend of fatal accidents and injuries resulting  from\r\n\r\nmilitary  training or exercises from 1997  to  1999  and  the\r\n\r\nadequacy of existing military training safety regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of fatal accidents and injuries in the SAF\r\n\r\nhas decreased steadily over the last 3 years.
