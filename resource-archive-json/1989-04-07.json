For operational reasons, it needs to be able to recall reservists at short notice. It therefore needs to know where each individual reservist is at all times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, reservists should apply for exit permits for each one of their overseas trips. Up till 1981, MINDEF in fact required them to do so. Then MINDEF relaxed the rule.

And this means a lot of inconvenience for many of our reservists who are in the business sector.

With the help of well-organized trafficking syndicates, they were sometimes able to escape detection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, the Marine Police Division and the Immigration Department have stepped up patrols and surveillance to curb this trafficking. They have succeeded on several occasions to arrest traffickers and intercept these attempts to land illegal immigrants. For example, in December 1988, a ring leader was arrested and this was followed by another arrest in February 1989. In October 1988, a boatman with a female assistant was arrested while trying to land eight illegal immigrants near the Senoko Power Station. Another boatman was arrested at sea in January 1989 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> while attempting to convey 10 illegal immigrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Police and Immigration will intensify their patrols and surveillance efforts on all potential landing sites to curb the activities of the trafficking syndicates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent amendments to the Immigration Act, convicted illegal immigrants and those who overstay for more than 90 days will face mandatory imprisonment of 3 months and 3 strokes of the cane. Those trafficking in illegal immigrants or harbouring them are also subject to severe penalties: a mandatory minimum jail sentence of 2 years and mandatory caning for traffickers, and mandatory minimum jail sentence of 6 months and fine of up to $6,000 for harbourers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy to deal with illegal immigrants is to enhance our border security with more patrol and surveillance as well as to implement more effective deterrents such as caning for offenders. At the same time, we will also enforce the law against employers of illegalimmigrants and overstayers of more than 90 days. On conviction, they will face imprisonment and fines. These deterrent measures should reduce the inflow of illegal immigrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, may I ask the Hon.

Almost 80% of them entered Singapore lawfully with valid travel documents, ostensibly as tourists and then overstayed illegally in order to work here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration officers handle about 45,000 arrivals per day at the Woodlands Checkpoint. In 1988, they refused entry to 13,500 persons who could not satisfy Immigration Officers that they were bona fide tourists. However, Immigration Officers cannot detect every visitor who intends to overstay and work illegally, no matter how vigilant they may be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this House was informed during the debate on the Second Reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill in January, this matter was brought to the attention of this House. And the Government has been very concerned with the problem of illegal immigrants for the past two years. It knew the numbers were large. This House was informed that, in 1988 alone, 4,120 overstayers were arrested. This House was also informed that 17% of our prison population were immigration offenders. For every overstayer arrested, many more were evading detection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police and Immigration Departments would have required a sustained massive effort to round up all these illegal immigrants. Illegal workers, including those with forged work permits, move from worksite to worksite, merging with other foreign workers who have proper work permits. Errant employers deliberately keep no records to avoid being implicated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was why the Government amended the Immigration Act to provide for caning for illegal immigrants who overstayed more than 90 days, and for a presumption clause to enable us to prosecute their employers. Those 10,000 illegal immigrants and overstayers virtually voluntarily surrendered to be repatriated before the amendments came into force shows that these measures were both necessary and effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Could the Minister please comment on the report that many of them who overstayed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> had forged documents. How does this come about? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> This comes about because there are syndicates who are engaged in forged documents. And when we catch them, they will be severely punished. Indeed, quite a number of cases are being investigated and are dealt with by the Commercial Crime Department. In other words, forgery of work permits is an offence. Investigations also are commenced whenever we have information on individuals or syndicates working in forged work permits. In fact, some of those who are trafficking in illegal immigrants are also engaged in forgery of work permits, and action will also be taken against them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, this question is put because of the large number of overstayers and also --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you ask your question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, What is more important is that these people who overstayed, according to the reports, were able to go undetected because of the documents which they have. So I thought the Minister's reply should give us a clearer view as to what exactly is done to get rid of these syndicates. I mean if there are a lot of foreigners around here with forged documents, it is a serious problem for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Indeed, Sir, it is a serious matter and it is because the Government felt it was a serious matter that we came to this House to ask for more powers, more penalties, to enable us to deal effectively with this serious problem. I recall the Member speaking against the measures to introduce caning. He was not the only one. Others too. But if we had not adopted those measures, a question which Members must ask themselves is: would they have voluntarily surrendered? As I said in my answer, these persons who came into Singapore at the checkpoint had valid passports and valid travel documents. It is after they enter Singapore on valid social visit pass that they decide to overstay and work illegally, some without any forged documents, some with forged documents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister will remember that during the debate on the amendment to the Immigration Act he did not mention or even give a hint that so great a number of illegal immigrants were moving around Singapore with forged documents.

He should know that under the Immigration Act it is clearly defined that an overstayer is a person who came in on a valid social visit pass and has overstayed.

What happens after you enter into Singapore, whether you managed to get a forged document is irrelevant for the purpose of investigating and apprehending that person.

The innuendo is that we knew of these offenders and deliberately did not take any action, which is not true. As early as November 1987, the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok issued a statement of the penalties which were then in force and informing all those who were reading the Thai newspapers and this was published in the Bangkok Post. This was as long ago as 1987. In February 1989 the Thai MFA issued further press releases. So it is not a case of suddenly taking action only now. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think I have to put on record that the Minister should not take objection to me asking that question.

This is because such exemption could lead to tax avoidance schemes such as placing funds in the names of retirees. Secondly, I would like to point out that retirees are also entitled to the personal relief of $2,000, like everyone else. This means that a retiree's income - if it is only interests from savings alone - will not be taxed unless it exceeds $2,000. Additional relief of up to $6,000 per year is also available to the retiree if he tops up his own CPF account to the Minimum Sum. Income from annuities purchased under the Minimum Sum Scheme, and interests from the POSB, are also tax-exempt. In regard to cases where the savings are indeed substantial and taxable interests earned do exceed $2,000, I should point out the tax rate for chargeable income of up to $5,000 is less than 3%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio also asked whether the Finance Minister would consider allowing tax deduction for medical expenses of retirees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a question of how we should help the needy retirees. Government policy has been that children should be encouraged to look after their aged parents. For this purpose, children have been allowed to use their Medisave balances to pay for their parents' medical expenses, and the tax relief for maintaining parents has been increased. Tax \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> deduction for retirees for their own medical expenses is also not appropriate because the financially needy retiree would have little or no assessable income for deduction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I would like to assure Members that no citizen would be denied medical attention simply because he cannot afford it. The Finance Ministry administers a remission scheme for those who cannot afford their medical fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GEYLANG EAST SWIMMING COMPLEX</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Repairs and renovation works)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe</b> asked the Minister for Community Development (a) if he will provide a progress report of the repairs and renovation works which are being carried out by the Singapore Sports Council at the Geylang East Swimming Complex; and (b) when the works are expected to be completed and the Complex opened for use by the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Seet Ai Mee (Minister of State for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Community Development (Dr Seet Ai Mee) (for the Minister for Community Development):</b> MrSpeaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The renovation works at the Geylang East Swimming Complex are undertaken by the HDB.

Statutory boards should be privatized at the opportune time and floated in the market at a pace that the market can absorb. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB engaged consultants to study the privatization of its electicity and gas operations. It did not consider privatizing the water operations, because of the sensitive and strategic nature of Singapore's water supply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultants have reported that it is feasible to privatize PUB's electricity and gas operations. Since the PUB, unlike government-owned utilities in some other countries, does not suffer from the gross inefficiencies, privatization is unlikely to yield immediate gains in performance or efficiency. It will, however, give us the general advantages of privatization mentioned above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new utility company will have greater flexibility in managing its affairs and serving consumers' needs. As it will be a monopoly, it will have to be regulated, like other utility companies over- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> seas, and like the bus and MRT services in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided, in principle, to privatize the electricity and gas operations of the PUB. The key question is timing. There are several considerations: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The utility company will be large. It could be worth some $10 billion or more, and it cannot be sold off in a hurry. The Government will probably retain a substantial portion of the shares even after the company has been floated, as it did in the case of SIA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The PUB is presently conducting negotiations to purchase natural gas from Malaysia. It is preferable to settle these negotiations first. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Government prefers to hive off statutory boards one by one, in an orderly manner. Several boards are possible candidates for privatization. Depending on the outcomes of ongoing studies, other statutory boards, for example, Singapore Telecom, may be ready sooner than the PUB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position will be clearer after a few months. At present it seems likely that the PUB will not be the first statutory board to be privatized. However, we can begin to privatize PUB within the next five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Sir, two supplementary questions.

By privatizing the electricity and gas company, in due course we hope that it will be able to run more efficiently, that it will be able to meet consumers' needs more responsibly, and that consumers will have a better, more reliable supply of electricity and gas at lower prices. These prices should still not be subsidized, but should be achieved, because the company is efficient and productivity, knows what people need, and provides it to them. I see no reason why in principle this should be impossible. The British have recently privatized electricity and gas. It will take some time for their situation to settle. In America, electricity and gas are routinely supplied by private companies, and their utilities are not more expensive than in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> When the Minister says \"people\" whom does he mean - only those people who could afford to buy the shares? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody who uses utilities in Singapore, which includes every household in Singapore, will benefit from this.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Previous debates</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished partially or completely has been debated in this House recently on two different occasions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, this House debated the Constitution (Amendment) Bill and the Internal Security (Amendment) Bill. These amendments which were approved by the House provided that there will be no more appeals to the Privy Council in respect of any acts or decisions taken under the Internal Security Act as well as on questions of interpretation of Part XII of the Constitution which dealt with emergency powers and powers to deal with subversion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in February, this House approved amendments to the Legal Profession Act to provide that in disciplinary cases affecting lawyers, there will be no appeals to the Privy Council from a decision of the Court of three judges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Parliament told of other aspects of appeals to Privy Council being considered</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that during the debate in January, I said that the Government's concern was not only with regard to security matters but that we had been concerned also for some time with the question as to how long we could really continue with this system of appeals to the Privy Council. I pointed out that there were also other areas, particularly of public law and administrative law, where our courts must have the final say. This was because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the political, social and economic circumstances of a country are crucial factors in interpreting and applying of laws by judges of a country. I said that the Government would decide on these matters after careful consideration. So Members may well have anticipated this Bill which deals with appeals to the Privy Council on matters not covered in the earlier proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Key considerations</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the provisions of the Bill, it may be useful, Sir, to recapitulate some of the reasons why we cannot continue with appeals to the Privy Council in the way we have had them for so many years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, very few Commonwealth countries retain their links with the Privy Council. In Asia, apart from Brunei, Singapore is the only independent country to have appeals to the Privy Council. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia have a long time ago cut off appeals to the Privy Council. In the South Pacific, Australia has done away with appeals and New Zealand, whose culture, heritage and political system is most akin to United Kingdom, is also proposing to do away with appeals to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16th September 1963 when Singapore's direct administrative links with Britain were severed upon our joining Malaysia, our economic, social and political developments have been on divergent paths when compared to the United Kingdom. This underscores two points. First, our laws must meet the problems and conditions of Singapore's circumstances. Secondly, these laws are best understood and interpreted by judges who are a part of our society and who share our history and our culture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, we have allowed Privy Council appeals to continue from colonial days because we valued the ability and erudition of their judges. But we have to recognize that because judges of the United Kingdom have no experience of our own circumstances, it is inevitable that they must draw on their own history, their own culture when reviewing our cases. Furthermore, judicial attitudes and values in our respective societies have also diverged as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a result of different circumstances, including the fact that the United Kingdom has been affected by important constitutional changes, important to the United Kingdom but really irrelevant for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, United Kingdom's entry into the European Community. The divergence between United Kingdom and Singapore's legal systems has increased over the years especially since 1973 when the United Kingdom joined the European Community, and when it did so, the European Community law became automatically part of United Kingdom law and was directly applicable in United Kingdom, creating rights and duties for individuals. And where there is inconsistency between Community law and the law of a member state of the European Community, Community law prevails. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, constitutional change. The United Kingdom House of Lords is subject to the European Court of Justice. This supremacy of Community law is emphasized by this fact that the House of Lords in United Kingdom is no longer the court of final appeal in the United Kingdom. In matters concerning the interpretation of the European Community treaties, the validity and interpretation of acts and statutes of the Community institutions, it is the Court of Justice of the European Communities which is now the supreme tribunal. Its decisions in these areas are binding on all United Kingdom courts including the House of Lords. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Singapore is not in Europe and all these developments which have affected United Kingdom legal trends arising from its membership of the European Community are not relevant to us and are totally different from our situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the main changes which these amendments seek to bring about. First, I will deal with civil appeals. Under the amendments, appeals on civil cases will henceforth lie only as between those parties to the proceedings who have consented in writing to be bound by an appeal to the Privy Council. They can agree at any time, before or after the commencement of proceedings, but they must have so consented before the Court of Appeal in Singapore hears the case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify, Sir, that this new subsection (3) to Section 3 of the Act does not require that the consent of all the parties to the proceedings must have been obtained. For example, if there is one plaintiff and ten defendants in a case, but one defendant does not agree that the case can be appealed to the Privy Council, even though the plaintiff and the other nine defendants have agreed, then, as between those parties who have agreed, an appeal to the Privy Council can lie. Members will note that there is an express provision that an appeal to the Privy Council in such a case will not affect any party to the proceedings who has not consented. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have we adopted this approach of consent? Let me say that the Government had considered whether we should do away with appeals altogether to the Privy Council in civil cases. We did consider an option. However, we also considered and took into account various views and suggestions expressed in this House as well as outside this House, in particular the view that we should not completely cut off access to the legal store of knowledge and expertise of the Privy Council in commercial matters. The practice of the banking and the shipping community is almost standard throughout the world. So there is little risk of local conditions being misunderstood or misinterpreted by British judges even though they have never visited Singapore. With this approach, banks, financial houses, shipping companies can now contract to retain the Privy Council as their final court of appeals. Of course, another advantage in this approach is that any party who does not wish to incur the additional costs of an appeal to the Privy Council cannot now be compelled to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have distributed statistics (Cols. 127 - 130) (two pages) of cases heard by the Privy Council for the period 1978 to 1988. Members will note that for the past 11 years, the Privy Council heard only 45 appeals, of which the majority (25) were dismissed; 8 other cases are pending. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890407/19890407-HA-0540127.htm\">statistics - APPEALS TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL, NO. OF CASES FIXED FOR HEARING BEFORE THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL FROM 1979 TO 1988 (Cols. 127 - 130)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to criminal cases. The approach on criminal cases is that appeals to the Privy Council will lie in cases where the offence is punishable with the death penalty or life imprisonment. This is subject to the condition that such appeal will lie only if the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal is not unanimous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I should point out here that whether an appeal will be allowed is not dependent on the actual sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, but the approach in the Amendment Bill is whether under the law the offence is punishable by death or punishable by life imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we limit appeals only to offences punishable by death or life imprisonment? First, these are the offences where the accused is liable to receive the most severe penalties that can be imposed under our law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we look again at the statistics of cases (the second page) heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Singapore, most of these cases involve the death penalty or life imprisonment. Out of 126 appeals heard during this period of 10 years, 105 were such cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Members may also note from the statistics of appeals to the Privy Council for the past 11 years, that, of the 55 criminal cases, 54 involved the death penalty and one case life imprisonment. Members may also note that special leave was granted only in three cases out of 47 cases decided so far, and even in those few cases, appeals were dismissed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the requirement that decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal is not unanimous. The reason for this is that we think it is fair that the accused is afforded the right to appeal where the Court of Criminal Appeal is not unanimous. It means that at least one member of the Court had a serious doubt about the decision. Since there is no unanimity, it is fair that he be allowed to appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also refer Members to the transitional provision (clause 4) which ensures \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that any appeal to the Privy Council, or any application for leave or special leave to appeal, under the existing Act will not be affected in respect of any decision of the Court of Appeal or Court of Criminal Appeal given before the commencement of this Amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain, Sir, let me give an example. If these amendments, once approved by the House, were to come into force, shall we say, on lst May, a losing party can still appeal to the Privy Council against a decision of our Appellate Court if the decision is given before that date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the amendments leave intact most of the other requirements and conditions presently contained in the Judicial Committee Act, such as requiring the leave of the Appellate Court and the minimum quantum value of the matter in dispute in civil cases. But these provisions will now be subject to these amendments before the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, coming in the wake of speculation that all appeals to the Privy Council will be abolished, this Bill comes as a pleasant surprise. However, it is not without difficulties and I would like to highlight some concerns about problems which might arise from the operation of this Bill when it comes into law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the purpose of the Bill is to give contracting parties the option to agree to go all the way up to the Privy Council. But that is not an option which is available to all parties because, as it is proposed, it does not cover a certain segment of contesting parties who are presently parties to legal proceedings in the High Court. It is too late for them to come to any form of an agreement which usually comes into effect before proceedings are commenced. And if the matter has not come up before the Court of Appeal, it is not a case of simply coming to terms on going to the Privy Council. It becomes a tactical move. One party looks at the other party, determines how Round 1 went, and then decides whether it will agree to give its consent or not. It can be a very risky \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> business because if one party decides against consenting and then loses at Round 2, he does not get a chance to go to Round 3 (the Privy Council), and he may lose a very valuable right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are other parties, and in this regard I would like to declare my interest, who are already before the Court of Appeal and decisions have not been made. It is too late for them to agree because by the wording of the Act, the agreement must be given before the commencement of the hearing before the Court of Appeal. So if you have pending hearings before the Court of Appeal today, there is no way for you to agree that you will go up to the Privy Council, and that option is therefore foreclosed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully suggest that the rules not be changed mid-stream, that we should not affect rights of parties who are already engaged in legal battle. Parties may have chosen the Singapore forum for a number of reasons, but one reason may have been the avenue of appeal to the Privy Council under the present law. If we change that now, it is going to pose some difficulties to these parties, especially in complex commercial cases where one party may feel that it is appropriate to go all the way to the Privy Council for a definitive ruling. I would therefore suggest that the rules be changed prospectively, that there be a time lag between now and when the Act comes into force, so that institutions or any contracting parties have the opportunity of putting that clause into their agreement and so that the Act only applies to proceedings commenced after a particular date. Therefore, existing rights, existing avenue, are not affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is the impact of such legislation on lawyers and parties generally. Let me paint this scenario. Round 1 (at the High Court), one party wins; the losing party then writes to the other party (the winning party) to say, \"Look, would you agree, we'll go to the Privy Council.\" The winning party is obviously going to go to his lawyer and he is going to say, \"Look, should I agree or not? I would only agree if I will lose in the Court of Appeal (round 2).\" The lawyer looks at it. There is no way that the lawyer can be sure what the Court of Appeal is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> going to decide and how it is going to rule. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the lawyer may go wrong. The client gives up a right of appeal to the Privy Council purely on the basis of that advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the consequences? Lawyers will protect themselves by getting QC's opinions. The cost will go up. Even QCs cannot be sure. Therefore, is it right that parties' avenue of appeal to the Privy Council should be determined by whether they get good or bad advice? And if they get bad advice, there is a possibility that because an avenue of appeal is closed to them on account of that advice, they can then commence legal proceedings against the lawyer for negligence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third concern I have is in relation to the development of the law. Take the case of a complex commercial matter where the Court of Appeal rules by a majority. In other words, two Judges go one way and the third the other. When this law comes into force, it will be within the power of one party to decide or to stop an appeal to the Privy Council. The question I have is: is this in the interest of the development of the law? Is it in the public interest that it should be within the power of one party to stop an appeal to the Privy Council on what may be a very complex commercial issue which calls for an affirmative ruling? I would therefore respectfully suggest that appeals for commercial cases where the sums involved exceed $100,000 not be affected. Because in relation to these appeals, the local circumstance, our cultural background, our historical background, is not such a relevant factor in cutting off appeals. Also, as the Hon. Minister has said, we get the benefit of the legal knowledge that the Privy Council has acquired all these years in commercial matters and it helps us to keep abreast of developments in the banking, shipping and corporate fields. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister to consider these concerns in the light of the amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the parliamentary debates earlier this year, I had expressed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the view of my GPC and Resource Panel that Singapore should work towards the setting up of a permanent Court of Appeal. This Bill before us today makes it more urgent that we should have our own Appellate Court. This would be in keeping with our effort to establish a financial centre second to none in Singapore, and will provide the judicial infrastructure for the convenience and reassurance of foreign investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us today deals with two specific aspects of law. Firstly, criminal law; secondly, civil law. This Bill proposes changes to our present system of appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, with regard to criminal law. In criminal law cases, appeal to the Privy Council is only allowed where: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the decision of the Appellate Court is not unanimous. The intention here is clear, for it restricts appeal to serious cases where decision of the Appellate Court is not unanimous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the provision provided here is adequate as it is borne out by the statistics circulated by the Hon. Minister. Appeals to the Privy Council in the last 11 years show that the number of petitions for leave was 55; and the results, dismissal 44; granted, 3 (the substantive appeal in all these 3 were subsequently dismissed). And there are 8 cases pending. The statistics thus bear out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In civil cases, Sir, my understanding of this amendment is that the purpose is to allow the parties involved in civil matters to decide for themselves as to who should be their final arbiter. The spirit of this Bill is laudable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek the Minister's clarification and views regarding the following issues: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what is the position regarding all the agreements already entered into, ie, prior to this date? How will this Bill affect the rights of the parties involved? This is a cause for concern as some may have entered into agreement on the premises that the Privy Council will be the final arbiter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what is the standing in our Courts of judgments already passed by the Privy Council prior to this amendment? Are they still binding on our Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, will this amendment precipitate businessmen to insert a clause to ensure that their matters are resolved according to English law and by English court, such as the insertion of a clause similar to one such as this: \"this agreement shall be governed by the law of England, and the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English court\". In other words, will businessmen in future opt for English law or other foreign law to be the \"proper law\" of their contracts? If they opt for English law or any other foreign law to be their \"proper law\", will they then not opt for English courts or other foreign courts to be their forum? What will be the impact of this on Singapore as a financial and commercial centre? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that this Bill is a follow up of the recent amendments to the Constitution, the ISA and the Legal Profession Act. But may I correct him, Sir. I say it is more correct to say that it is a follow-up of Government's reaction to the Privy Council's judgment on J.B. Jeyaretnam's appeal. If you remember, Sir, a whole series of amendments have been brought up because of the Privy Council's judgement on J.B. Jeyaretnam's appeal. And the Government in defence of its action has said that it wishes to uphold Singapore's indepndence and sovereignty. Well and good, Sir, if that was true,although today the Minister has not emphasized too much on that aspect of it. But this argument rings rather hollow, in view of the fact that it was never brought up earlier, eg, in 1965, but only recently following the judgement on the appeal of J.B. Jeyaretnam. Therefore, many jpeople can see that all these amendments have come about as a result of knee-jerk reactions to what has happened recently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I ask, why the unseemly haste about this Bill? We received this Bill last week. It was not then in the Order Paper. It was not there. I received today's Order Paper this morning, and I suddenly discovered that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Bill is at the top of the list. I was misled by the Order Paper that was sent to me before. I am suggesting, Sir, that such a thing should not happen again. The Opposition and all the other Members should be informed of any change well beforehand. At least, that would give us some time for preparation and allow us an opportunity to consult other opinions which may be very useful to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Can I interrupt? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. It is a point of order, Dr Lee. Please resume your seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, it is important for me to interject at this stage. The Bill was introduced at the last sitting. When it was introduced, I was asked, Sir, by you when would the Second Reading take place. And I said at the next available sitting. Today is the next available sitting since the last sitting and the required period provided under the Standing Orders was complied with. The notice of introduction of the Bill was circulated to all Members and the matter appears on the Order Paper today. So I cannot see how Dr Lee or any other Member could not know that at the next sitting following the last, this Bill would be taken up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> What the Minister has said may be true, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is true. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Nevertheless, I think all Members of the House should be adequately informed well before-hand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> They are. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> I think Government will benefit a lot from consultations with the Law Society or with other people. It will get more valuable opinions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us consider the Bill itself. According to the Explanatory Statement, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Bill seeks .... to restrict appeals to the Privy Council in any civil matter to parties to the proceedings who at any time before the hearing of the case by the Court of Appeal have consented to be bound by such an appeal;' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two previous speakers have touched on this issue. Naturally, Sir, only the multi-national corporations, all the big companies, will have this safeguard. They always have this safeguard. Whenever things go wrong, they want to make sure that if there should be any dispute, then the final arbiter is the Privy Council. But what the Minister has not mentioned is: what happens to the ordinary citizen, the ordinary man-in-the-street? What happens when he has a case against the Government, when he is a critic of the Government, when he is a political opponent, when he is picked up by the Government and he has to go to Court against the Government? Is the Government saying that all such cases will be denied appeals to the Privy Council? Do not forget that the Government is a party to the litigation. And under those circumstances, just to limit appeals only to big companies and MNCs is patently unfair. If it is only limited to big companies, I must ask: why the discrimination against the common man? Is he not more important than some big company? Is he saying that the common man means nothing to the Government? And as the Constitution says, Sir, everybody is supposed to be treated equally before the law. But it does not appear that this amendment is intended to allow that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of criminal matters, the Explanatory Statement says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Bill seeks ... to restrict appeals to the Privy Council in any criminal matter only to cases where the offence is punishable with either death or imprisonment for life [all right, let us go on that] and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal is not unanimous.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has passed round two sheets of paper which tell us of the number of petitions of appeals registered and the number of appeals heard. But has he also given us the number of the unanimous decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal? How many of them have given different decisions? Does the Court always give a unanimous decision? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that in Singapore it is very often that only one judgment, is given, and by one single judge, and usually the other two judges merely concur. If that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should be the case, it amounts to only one single judgment. If this system should continue, it only means that the ordinary man, in future,will never have a chance of appeal. Unless, of course, if the Government intends to make sure that in future each single judge of this Court of Appeal must deliver his own judgment. Then at least we have three judgments in the Court of Criminal Appeal and not, as I have been told, usually only just one judgement with the other two judges merely concurring. Therefore, Sir, this means something that is very unfair and unjust to the ordinary man. And if such life and death cases are allowed to go on in this manner, then it reflects very badly, I think, on the moral judgment of the Singapore Government. It only shows how much value it places on the life and librty of the common man. Recently, Sir, Government has been speaking a lot about moral values and core values. What about the core value for the protection of the life and liberty of the common man? Is the Government interested in that? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has tried to explain to us why Government has embarked on this new Bill and why we cannot keep on appealing to the Privy Council. The main argument here is, I think, that the local conditions here are different from those elsewhere. But what are the local conditions here that are different? Are we in the jungle? Or are we in the Arctic or the Antarctic? Why are we different? We have the same things over here, we have the similar judges, we have the same facilities, cars, TV, everything els. The only difference, Sir, is that we have a Government that has continued to be the Government for the last 30 years, and a Government that imposes its authority over many many aspects of our life. So, as far as we can see, there are no real differences between our local conditions and those elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other argument which the Government usually brings up, and has today lightly touched on, is that the local conditions are best interpreted by judges who are part of the local culture and so can review cases not based on a culture. And also that the UK is now affected by constitutional changes as a result of its entry into the EEC. Sir, justice \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is the same justice the world over. It is the same whether it is in Singapore, or in the EEC, or in Japan,or in UK. Why should it be different? In fact, three or four days ago, the King designate of Malaysia made certain remarks and his remarks (he was the Lord President of the Federal Court) were to the effect that it is untrue to say that Malaysian courts apply the English Common Law in giving judgment in Malaysia. I believe the same holds true in Singapore. Unless the Minister tells us that in Singapore there is no such thing as common law. Or that we have had no time to develop it in spite of all these years, and that everything else is different. Therefore, Sir, such an argument is a fallacy. It is wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Minister has said, it would appear that many things too are wrong. May I remind the Minister again, Sir, what he once said although he tried to counter that himself, namely, that the Privy Council is a litmus test of judicial independence. I have got a photostat copy here, Sir. It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the litmus test of judicial independence, said Home Affairs and Second Law Minister, S. Jayakumar.' And may I also refer to what the Prime Minister himself has said. Referring to the Singapore judiciary: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew told Parliament last year \"in Singapore we have an extra supervision on them. When they write their judgments they know that they could go up to the Privy Council.\"' Sir, the issue here today is plainly whether the Government intends to uphold justice or not uphold justice. That is the key argument and the key ingredient in the present Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also remind the Minister that recently there have been a number of misjudgments in the Singapore courts. Therefore, one must ask: is it opportune to abolish appeals to the Privy Council at this juncture? If confidence in the judiciary has been shaken, I think Government should not try to shake this any further. We should try and make sure that everybody is happy with the judgments here, and that those who are dissatisfied with what has happened, at least have a chance to go up to the Privy Council, either in civil or in criminal cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me just ask again, why has the Bill been suddenly pounced on the House? Is it because Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam has announced his intention to take his case to court that he had been wrongly convicted? I do not know, Sir. The facts are there. Of course, it is up to the Government to explain. And we would like to hear what the Government has to say. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Sir, I rise to support the amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to refer to what Dr Lee Siew-Choh said about the sameness between Singapore and England. I think we should not pretend that we can be the same. We cannot pretend to be Englishmen. We can speak Singapore English or some form of English but we cannot pretend to be speaking like Englishmen and try to put on a stiff upper lip like the Englishmen. We are different. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Internal Security (Amendment) Bill was debated and passed by this House, some quarters outside speculated that what would follow would be the complete removal of appeal to the Privy Council in all other cases,\"a wholesale slaughter\" according to some. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have reason to expect that this would be the line of action. Indeed, some members of the public urge that we should completely abolish appeal to the Privy Council. It is a colonial legacy, a relic of the past, an anachronism. After all, only Singapore, Brunei and Hong Kong in this region still retain the Privy Council. Hong Kong is a Crown colony and by 1997 it will be handed back to mainland China, and this link will also be cut. Australia has abolished it. Malaysia has abolished it. New Zealand is thinking of abolishing it. As we develop as a sovereign and independent state, we should also abolish it and cut the apron strings. As we grow up, it is time to be ourselves, to be our own men, to be on our own. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one could imagine the pressure on the Minister for Law, as he gave due deliberation to all factors, weigh the evidence and ponder over the course of action. If I may misquote Shakespeare: \"To Privy Council or not to Privy Council, that is the question.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that after due deliberation, Sir, the Minister and the Government have come up with a measured step by step approach, and taken all factors and opinions into consideration. The sceptics again have been proven wrong. It is not a wholesale abolition nor an abortion, but I think a selective application, tailor-made to suit our local needs and local conditions. Allowing appeal to civil cases will be reassuring to foreign and local companies, to foreigners and citizens alike, and indeed to the common man that there is a higher court for appeal. And allowing appeal in criminal cases involving life imprisonment or the death penalty would be a compassionate act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this measured and moderated approach makes the task of Backbench MPs more difficult, as we explain the policy to our constituents. It is easier to present the case if the Government were to go the full hog and abolish the Privy Council once and for all. Selective or part measures would appear to be contradictory or even illogical. But explain and support this Bill we must for, I believe, it is the right measure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, listening to Dr Lee on the proposed amendments, one would get the impression that the entire legal system and the judicial system in our country is breaking down. However, much of his arguments are based on the presumption that there are no rights to the Privy Council. That is, however, not the case with the proposed amendments. They seek to provide for appeals between consenting parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then dealt with equality before the law. Again, I think the concepts are slightly confused because all the equality before the law means every person within Singapore has an equal right under the law. The law does not say MNCs can appeal or anyone else cannot appeal. Everyone has an equal right to consent to an appeal. By virtue of economic power, MNCs may be in a better position to insist that right of appeal to the Privy Council be retained. But that is a question of economics and not law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of local conditions. From the time when we received English law in 1823 under the Charter of Justice right until the recent decision of the Privy Council, if Dr Lee were to read these legal material, including the judgments of the Privy Council, he will see the phrase \"local conditions\" repeated over and over again. Law cannot be distinct from the cultural context of any civilization of any country. We live in a multi-racial society which is different from England. And local conditions has a definite meaning. For example, laws in sedition, laws as on freedom of speech when it infringes upon toleration of other races, religious beliefs and so on, will have to be enforced with greater strictness in Singapore than perhaps in England. Thus, we have to take into account local conditions. The question is not whether local conditions differ but whether they necessitate the present amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that, whenever amendments are proposed to the judicial system, the question always is: does this in any way affect the independence of the judiciary? The Minister can argue with some conviction that the amendments do not affect the independence. Rights to the Privy Council are not abolished, in civil cases consenting parties can appeal, in criminal cases where serious penalty of death or life imprisonment is involved, and where at least one judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal dissents, there is a right of appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the basics of that argument. However, there is one aspect which, I think, requires more consideration, the question of investor confidence in Singapore, an excellent legal framework which dispenses speedy justice is important for business and for business investor confidence. In fact, Beri, in its recent survey, when ranking Singapore as the fourth best place to invest, cited our excellent legal framework as putting us in a better position than Taiwan or South Korea. Investors who come in to Singapore know that there is a sophisticated legal system to facilitate business. It is my view that there is an important aspect for a foreign investor - the existence of the unrestricted right of appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make myself clear. I do not suggest that our courts are in any way unable to dispense justice. But we who deal with the system in Singapore know the constitutional position and understand that. It would not be accurate to expect or to assume that a foreign investor will have as much knowledge or confidence in the judicial system of a developing country, unfair as it might be. The Minister can say, \"Well, such a foreign investor knows the law and can ensure that his right of appeal to the Privy Council exists simply by making it a term of the business when he invests.\" That may be so, but doing business in Singapore is more than just the initial investment. After the investment, there will hopefully be a long association with Singapore and it is impractical to expect such investors to continually ensure that all their business contract dealings specifically provide for automatic right of appeal to the Privy Council. Disputes can arise over a wide spectrum between the investor and his bank, between the investor and his local supplier. Not all of these contracts are automatically in written standard forms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister to consider amending subsection (3) so as to make a distinction between civil cases which are commercial in nature and those which are not. Automatic rights of appeal can be retained for civil cases which are commercial in nature. The present proposed amendments can apply to all other civil cases. This, in fact, ties in broadly with the present position of applicability of English law in Singapore. The Minister will note that under section 5 of our Civil Law Act the commercial law of England automatically applies to Singapore, and that is an important selling point. When people in business ask, \"What is the law of Singapore in banking, insurance, and on any commercial law?\" we say,\"It is the same as English law\", immediately the businessman knows what we are talking about. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may then say the applicability of the law should be distinguished from who is to administer it. English law can apply, but our courts should be the only ones to administer it unless the parties agree otherwise. I would urge him to look at it from a different point of view. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> We could say to an investor, \"Our law in commercial matters is the same as English law and in all commercial matters there is an unrestricted right of appeal.\" If, of course, English commercial law moves along lines that makes it unsuitable for applicability in Singapore, then we can always consider amending it. In fact, I think this principle about the importance of tapping onto the legal resources available in England is already recognized by the Minister in his opening speech because he said that all rights of appeal to the Privy Council were not abolished because we wanted to retain such rights in commercial matters where local conditions do not really play a part. Commercial law, shipping law and so on are more or less the same, be it in England or Singapore. If the rights of appeal are to be retained, I say, why not retain the full rights of appeal in commercial law? I do not think the example of India, Ceylon or Malaysia may be relevant in this context because we rely on foreign investors to a far greater extent, I believe, than these countries. That, Sir, is my main point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three other short points. The second point, and here I declare my interest as a lawyer, has been quite well put by the Member for Toa Payoh GRC, Mr Davinder Singh, ie, there are any number of cases that are presently pending before our High Court and Court of Appeal which were commenced because the parties believed that they had a right to go up to the Privy Council. To introduce an amendment mid-stream, as it were, and cut off the rights to the Privy Council may cause and does cause concern in those cases. Perhaps a saving provision could be considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, is a technical point. The Minister will realize that under certain technical rules of precedent our Singapore Court of Appeal considers itself bound by all its previous decisions. The English House of Lords and the Privy Council do not consider themselves bound. They consider themselves free to reverse their previous decisions. That makes for keeping the law alive, so to speak. As circumstances change the courts can reconsider the position and consider that they have made a wrong decision previously. That is not the position with the Court of Appeal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which in many cases now will become the final court as far as Singapore is concerned. That will potentially have the effect of seriously outdating our law and, if this amendment is considered, the Minister ought to consider amending our Supreme Court of Judicature Act so as to allow our Court of Appeal, or give it powers, to reverse itself from its previous decisions. The Court of Appeal recognizes that it has the right to reverse itself but in very limited circumstances. If it effectively becomes our final Court of Appeal, then perhaps it should be given liberal powers to reverse itself and keep the law up to-date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point, Sir, is that at least some sections of the public may question and, in fact, Dr Lee has questioned the reasons for the amendment. It may be argued that the Government does not wish itself where it is the litigant to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Privy Council in civil cases. That, Sir, is a sensitive point and will not go away. It will be in the minds of at least some people and I hope that the Minister will take steps to clarify the position and the reasons for the amendment, paying perhaps particular attention to that point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this amendment is really a momentous event. It has been said that we have the British system of law in Singapore since 1823, I believe, over a century and the final appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has always been part of our system. I take the point of Dr Lee Siew-Choh that in fact we should really be given more time - I think the Singapore people should be given more time - to discuss and air this matter, especially relevant bodies like the Law Society, to give their views. What we are really doing is in effect to cut out appeals to the Privy Council. Basically that is what we are doing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons have been given by the Minister and, as I sat there and took note of the reasons, I am not convinced at all that there is a compelling reason to abolish or almost abolish the Privy Council from our judicial system. The most relevant reason is that the Minister should convince this House that at this point of time the Privy Council is not relevant to our judicial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system. If he says so and convince us, then I think we will support him. Look at his reasons. He says few Commonwealth countries have this link to the Privy Council. It does not mean that if other countries do not have that link, we also, should cut off the link with the Privy Council. This is not a reason at all because countries like Australia, India, Pakistan, from their point of view the Privy Council is no longer relevant or, for nationalistic reasons, they feel that they want to build up their own independent judicial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that the countries in Asia retaining links with the Judicial Committee are rather small countries - Hong Kong, Singapore and Brunei. Probably they do not have the means to support that many judges. So this is not a good reason. It does not mean that other countries have taken away the Judicial Committee as their final appeal, we should do the same. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister goes on to say that now there are divergent paths taken by England and Singapore. What divergent paths? Basically, our laws are still the same. The only point I can think of is in regard to internal security matters. That we have taken divergent paths. The law in England requires that in cases of such matters the courts want to have a look at the reasons or the circumstances given by the Executive whether or not in fact it is justified to detain a person without trial. I think that is very basic and that is really divergent. But I think liberty of a person, freedom of a person is important and I think we should adopt the path taken by England and other Commonwealth countries. I think we should not take away the freedom of a person without really telling the person why or the public wants to know why that person is detained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard of local conditions, judicial attitudes, values are also divergent, and we have heard there are constitutional changes in England because of the fact that England is joining the European Community, and that even in England the House of Lords is no longer the final court of appeal in regard to certain matters under the enlarged European Community laws. Singapore is not an isolated country. It has been declared that our policy is to make Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore a global international city. We do our business with the whole world and not with the region. So what is wrong with opening even new avenues of law into the European Community? I think it will benefit us in the long run. It will, in fact, be an improvement and not a retrogressive step. There is no harm, in fact, in enlarging our laws to take into account laws in Europe. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had a good look at the statistics given by the Minister. Maybe in criminal cases, it is relevant to take away appeals to the Privy Council because out of the three all three failed. It is just like in Malaysia. Apparently, all cases that went to the Privy Council had the same result as that decided in the court of appeal in Malaysia. But we should ask the Minister the reasons why so many of these criminal cases were not granted leave of appeal to the Privy Council. I think there is still something lacking there. The statistics are very flimsy. In fact, only three cases were allowed to go to the Privy Council and three were dismissed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> 44. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Allowed there and they were dismissed. Sir, under the Civil Cases are the cases involved with the Internal Security Act and the Legal Profession Act grouped in these statistics as Civil Cases? Can the Minister please tell us. I think the appeals to the Privy Council are very relevant. I am just looking at the statistics given by the Minister. They are very relevant because many of them were allowed by the Privy Council. If you look at the left-hand corner, starting with the earliest date (1978), you will see: 4 cases went up to the Privy Council, 3 were allowed; only 1 was not allowed. In 1979, 5 appealed, 2 allowed; 1980, 6 appealed, 1 allowed; 1981, 7 appealed, 2 allowed; 1982, 10 appealed, 1 allowed (1 in 10); and 1983, 5 appealed, 3 allowed. I think it is important that we go to the Privy Council for civil cases. And then in 1984, 15 appealed, 6 were allowed. I wonder whether these included all the lawyers who have appealed to the Privy Council in disciplinary proceedings and whether all were allowed. Sir, 1985, 2 appealed, and both were withdrawn; 1986, 3 went on appeal and 1 allowed; and the rest are still \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pending. But in 1988, 4 are pending and 1 is allowed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So according to statistics, appeal to the Privy Council is very relevant in our case. I think the Minister has to convince this House why he is taking away the appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is really a disappointment. It appears to me to be just an expedient move or an ad hoc amendment. I do not believe the Government has really given proper thought and made the amendment in greater detail. In effect, this amendment is to take away appeals to the Privy Council in both civil and criminal cases, although it has been said that consenting parties can still litigate in civil cases. But if one of them refuses, then the other will have no chance. Normally, of course, the person who feels that he is going to lose will not consent. And it has just been mentioned by Mr Shanmugam that there are sensitive cases involving the Government. Will the Government automatically consent? There are so many cases involving Government - administrative cases, immigration cases, land acquisition cases, passport cases - you name them. So will the Government give their word that they will consent for parties to appeal to the Privy Council? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as regards criminal cases, we see that there must be an unanimous decision. I have been in the Bar for 13 years or so, I have not come across a dissenting case in capital cases. So probably in capital cases there will be no appeals to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think if we want to take away appeals to the Privy Council, there must be an alternative, a good alternative - appeal court, perhaps a permanent appeal court. We cannot just remove a thing without really replacing it with something else. In fact, we are taking a major benefit away from the people of Singapore without giving them something in return. It would appear to me - now in my second term in this House - that the Government really has got no long-term policies. They only change the law when it is necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Don't change unnecessarily. Change when it is necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is necessary to them, politically I would say. When something has happened and it annoyed or embarrassed the Government, and then it quickly changed the law. We have seen it. We have seen how this Government changed the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act just because the Government thinks that Mr Jeyaretnam was talking too strongly in this House. Then we had amendment to the Legal Profession Act just because the lawyers were giving their opinions and challenged the Government on certain new legislation. And when the foreign reporters were reporting on Singapore which displeased the Government, the Newspaper (Printing Presses) Act was accordingly amended, allegedly to stop interference in local politics. And then, more recently, we have seen the two amendments to the Judicial Committee Act where ISA cases are involved. So those detainees no longer have a chance to have their matters heard in the Privy Council, and also in regard to lawyers when they were subject to professional discipline. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this amendment really has got no compelling reason. The most compelling reason I can think of, from the point of view of the Government, has already been mentioned by Dr Lee Siew-Choh. Probably, the Government is angry with the Privy Council's judgment in relation to Jeyaretnam's appeal which was allowed in regard to his disbarment from practice as a lawyer. You will remember that the judgment of the Privy Council was, in fact, a scathing attack on the political/legal system here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that appeal, their Lordships looked behind, just the appeal, and looked into the original four convictions of not only Mr Jeyaretnam but also Wong Hong Toy. So I think it is worthwhile to read part of that judgment and probably you will know why the Government is very angry. This is what their Lordships said in their judgment: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Their Lordships have to record their deep disquiet that by a series of misjudgments the appellant and his co-accused Wong have suffered a grievous injustice. They have been fined, imprisoned and publicly disgraced for offences of which they were not guilty. The appellant, in addition, has been deprived of his seat in Parliament and disqualified for a year from practising his profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Lordships' order restores him to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore. But because of the course taken by the criminal proceedings, their Lordships have no power to right the other wrongs which theappellant and Wong have suffered. Their only prospect of redress, their Lordships understand, will be by way of petition for pardon to the President of the Republic of Singapore.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this judgment really points to only one direction and that is, we must not, in fact, at this juncture take away the right of appeal to the Privy Council. Our courts have erred not once, not twice, but a series (according to the judgment here), a series of injustices. Sir, if we are saying that we are promoting justice in order to take away appeal to the Privy Council, I will support all for it. But according to this judgment, it does not appear so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Shanmugam has spoken of probably an escape route by allowing litigants to appeal to the Privy Council if they consent, because to promote investors' confidence. But, as I understand it, this is only apparent, because I believe all these foreign business people who have got offshore loan agreements have already got into their agreements the jurisdiction which is not based in Singapore. They probably agree among themselves, if there is any dispute, to have their dispute resolved in courts in England or elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is going to be a retrogressive step because it has not been properly worked out. And if the Minister can say that after 30 years, our judicial system has reached a stage where we have to stand on our own two feet and not, as Members have said, our judicial system still tied to the apron strings of the Privy Council, and if we are able to stand on our own two feet, and let us work out a proper system, a new judicial system, then I will agree with it. But with this ad hoc amendment, I do not think it will serve the interest of the public of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me speak on this Bill basically as a layman and to give some of my personal views. I have listened to some of the arguments here in the House, both from our own Backbenchers as well as from Members of the Opposition, as well as the views which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> others outside the House have, since the Bill was published, expressed to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the views expressed are a mix of relief that the appeal to the Privy Council has not been completely cut off and fears that the change proposed will affect the quality of justice in Singapore. I am personally very surprised that after almost 25 years as an independent nation, our minds seem to be still shackled and we still expect others to protect our interests and to ensure a high quality of justice in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the unspoken fear, the underlying thought behind these various reservations? I think the unspoken fear is this: that we do not have men of competence and knowledge, of integrity, character, men with a strong sense of justice to ensure that our courts deliver judgments which are in accordance with the highest standards of justice and fair play. I think this may be putting it very bluntly. But I think this is the unspoken fear. The fear is that our judges or magistrates are constantly looking over their shoulders to assess what would please the Government and therefore their judgments are coloured by this desire to please the Government. I think that is the thought behind all the nice arguments and words, diplomatic words, that we have heard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is not the case with our magistrates and with our judges. But even if it were so, even if it were the case, that the cream of our society, some of the best educated in our society, some of the leaders of our society, do not have the courage, sense of justice, the gumption, the spine, to do what is right and not what will please the Government, even if it were so, I would still support the proposal to cut ourselves off from the Privy Council. Because if we, as a society and as a people, can only have people at the very top of this calibre, of this lack of a sense of justice, of courage, then we as a people deserve our fate. Do we still want to be tied, as the Member for Potong Pasir said, to the apron strings of the British? Do we want others to look after our interests? Or do we think that we are mature enough people to look after our own interests? And that if we cannot look after our own interest, we should throw up people within \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our own society who would look after our interests. How long do we want others to look after our interests? How long do we want others to ensure that the quality of justice in Singapore is what we as a people deserve? I say that if we cannot stand up as a people after 25 years of independence, then we deserve our fate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that we should be completely cut off immediately for all appeals to Privy Council. But I can see why some interim measures are needed; that this cannot be done away with immediately. I think the suggestion that the Member for Potong Pasir made is a good one, that we should have a substitute, maybe a full-time Court of Appeal. And that certainly I am sure is something that my colleague, the Minister for Law, and the Cabinet will look into. But that does not mean that we should not already take steps to be a truly independent people. I know I am expressing a layman's view. But I think this is a view that we ought to think about carefully. Do we want to continue to depend upon others to look after us? Or do we think that we are ready to look after our own interests? And, if necessary, force our society to throw up leaders who would look after our interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in favour of the proposals made in the Bill. I would even go further - I think it is about time we took the steps to become a mature people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Members who have spoken. It is clear that we have a spectrum of views. There are some like my colleagues, the Minister for National Development and Dr Ong Chit Chung, who would have favoured immediate cutting off of all appeals. There are others who felt that the provisions perhaps go too far. This shows that perhaps the approach taken in the Bill is a good balance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the various points raised by Members. I will try to take them in the order of the speakers. First, Mr Davinder Singh made several interesting observations. First, he did not agree with the approach taken, with regard to the transitional provision, and would advocate an approach which would allow appeals for all proceedings which have been commenced, whether at High Court stage or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Court of Appeal stage. In other words, all pending appeals should be caught by the transitional provision. My first comment is that this will mean that there will be a considerable delay in the practical operation of the new law. I think he himself pointed out that it takes many years for cases to be heard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to point out that the transitional provision which we have is not too different from the transitional provisions of some other countries. We have looked at the transitional provisions in Malaysia when they cut off appeals to the Privy Council and the transitional provisions in the Australian legislation when they abolished appeals to the Privy Council. The approach taken in our Bill is, in fact, similar to the approaches taken by Malaysia and Australia. In fact, we can say that our approach is wider. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third observation I would like to make is that obviously where the Court of Appeal gives a decision, the losing party is unlikely to get the winner's consent. That is why we have taken the approach in the transitional provision that if the Court of Appeal's decision is given before the commencement of the operation of this Act, then appeals without consent can still proceed. But the point I want to underline is that the approach taken in our transitional provision is not unprecedented, as there are good models on which they are based. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is what I would call the argument of intolerable burden placed on lawyers. I have listened with interest to his exposition of this point. But first I think it is necessary to emphasize that the consent approach in this Bill is not giving consent if you lose. It is consent given in advance to a system. In other words, the parties agree before the matter is heard by the Court of Appeal that the consent to the dispute going to the Privy Council without knowing whether they are going to win in the Court of Appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not quite understand his point. I will disagree with his proposition that this places a special or impossible burden on lawyers. He has asked how will a lawyer \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> advise a client who comes to the lawyer and says, \"Should I consent in a particular case?\" I would assume that if a client approaches a lawyer and asks for advice as to whether he should consent, I would expect that the lawyer would advise him to the best of his ability, outline the risks, advantages, disadvantages, pros and cons of the law. But the final decision is up to the client. And the client then will instruct the lawyer. I do not see how this situation is different from the countless other situations which a lawyer is faced everyday. Clients come and ask for advice. \"Should I sue? Should I institute action in the courts?\" And if he institutes action in the courts and he loses, he comes and asks for advice, \"Should I institute an appeal to the Court of Appeal?\" Or if he is offered settlement for a lower sum, \"Should I accept the settlement which is of a low value or should I appeal?\" In all these cases, the lawyer really has no crystal ball. Neither the lawyer nor anyone can guarantee what the outcome of litigation will be. Litigation has its risks. And I cannot see any lawyer guaranteeing to his client, \"Yes, you will win.\" If that is the case with the countless situations which lawyers are faced when clients come and ask for advice, I do not think this situation is very different. Nor is it different from cases, which are plentiful now, where existing contracts may have provisions for arbitration and a client asks for advice, well in advance of any dispute arising, whether he should consent to this particular provision. In all these cases, including the case presented by Mr Davinder Singh, I think the lawyer would have to advise to the best of his ability and the client would have to make up his own decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by Mr Davinder Singh was his observation that this approach in the Bill means that a development of the law is not in the hands of the court but of the parties in this sense, that if there is a complex or complicated question of law which might deserve a hearing and exposition of the law in Privy Council, it really is dependent now on both the parties, which means one party can prevent it from going out. That may be so. But I do not see how that is really a serious objection to the approach. Because even as it is now, whether a case involving \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> interesting or complicated or a novel point of law, whether it goes up to a higher Court of Appeal or to the Privy Council really is dependent on the parties. And the losing party whether he appeals or not is going to decide on a variety of factors, not only on the basis of the advice he gets on the probabilities of his success but on other factors, costs, tactical considerations and so on. But he is probably going to decide on the basis of what is in his own interest rather than whether he is going to contribute to a great development of law in a particular branch of law in Singapore for future litigants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to points raised by the Chairman of the GPC, Dr Arthur Beng. His first point was what would happen to existing agreements. My answer to that is, first of all, we cannot assume that all those who entered into existing contracts had entered into those agreements on the assumption that Privy Council would be the final Court of Appeal. But in any case, the important point is that we are not stopping the parties to those existing agreements from still agreeing under this new Bill for the disputes to be resolved by appeals to the Privy Council. It is still open to them. We are not restricting them and they can subsequently still agree by supplementary agreement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to Privy Council judgments already given, whether they would be still binding on our courts, if I am not mistaken, the previous judgments will still be binding on our courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that he raised was this. Will businessmen be prompted or prodded into inserting provisions on choice of law? And they might make choice of law in the United Kingdom or other countries and resulting in more disputes being heard in the United Kingdom. Whether this will happen or not, I am not sure. But I would assume that for local contracts, I do not see why they would want to insist that the choice of law would be United Kingdom. For international contracts, the present practice is, in fact, that the parties are already inserting provisions as to choice of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to note is that the amendments proposed before the House \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> do not circumscribe the existing practice. In other words, whatever is the practice of choice of law provisions, they are still free to continue with the practice. And if they want, they can agree that the matter can go up to the Privy Council. I think it may be necessary for me to make a distinction between provisions in contracts on choice of law and where the dispute is going to be heard. These are two different points and one does not follow from the other necessarily. In other words, if contracting parties decided that it will be United States law or New York law which shall govern the contract,it does not automatically follow that the courts in New York will have jurisdiction because whether the courts in New York will have jurisdiction would be dependent on many rules governing the jurisdiction in the United States' courts, whether the cause of action arose there and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I refer to the points raised by Mr Shanmugam. He has dealt with many of the points raised by Dr Lee Siew-Choh. He referred to investor confidence and my reply to his comments on that is that it is precisely because of considerations like that that we have not completely abolished appeals to Privy Council and we have provided for a mechanism where investors and others who consider it important for them to have appeals to Privy Council to arrange their agreements and other documents in such a way that they can still retain appeal to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised a technical point as to whether there is a need to amend the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. This is a matter which I would obviously have to take up with the Attorney-General and I assure him that it will be looked into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the major substantive point which Mr Shanmugam raised was that because the Civil Law Act provides that in commercial law matters, English law shall be applicable in Singapore. Our approach should be to provide that there will be automatic appeals to the Privy Council in such matters. At first hand, this may seem an attractive idea but upon closer scrutiny I am not in favour of that approach because we must make a distinction between the applicable law on the one hand, and on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> other hand, the dispute settlement procedure and the judicial process. The two are separate and should be kept separate. If I may just give a hypothetical example. Suppose we decided as a matter of law that our securities in stock market law had to be reformed and we concluded that the United States' law is the best in the world. If we legislated to provide that in that area \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he United States' law shall be applicable in Singapore, that is to say one thing but it does not follow that in that area of the law we must have appeals up to the United States Supreme Court. The two are different. So you may have the Civil Law Act making English law applicable on a variety of subjects but it does not follow that you must have appeals to the Privy Council because of that. I should also point out that there is no difficulty for judges in Singapore deciding what is the applicable English law on any particular point. It may also require us to note that under the Civil Law Act although it provides that the commercial law of England applies here, it is also provided that this is subject to modifications and adaptations due to local circumstances in Singapore. And indeedthe applicability of English law is also subject to whetherthere are local statutes on the matter, and indeed in many areas, corporate law, banking law, we have our own legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I come to the points raised by Dr Lee Siew-Choh. I need not answer all his questions as Mr Shanmugam has dealt with his other points. One point raised by both Dr Lee Siew-Choh and Mr Chiam is that there have been very few dissenting opinions. I recognize that, but at the same time, as I have pointed out in the last sitting on the Committee of Supply debate on the Judicature, we are going to have provisions for more judges and I pointed out that this year there will be provision for some 17-19 judges and a total number of 22-23 courts will be available by 1990. So the number of judges will increase and we cannot expect that there will never be dissenting judgments in the future. And we cannot assume that there will always be unanimous opinions in criminal matters involving death penalty and life imprisonment. Indeed, we can foresee that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> if a judge feels very strongly that he disagrees with his two brother judges, then he can record his dissent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lee Siew-Choh says we do not value life and liberty. Then can I ask him why is it we have provided that in death penalty and life imprisonment, there can still be appeals to Privy Council? Dr Lee made the curious observation that this Bill has been sprung as a surprise because Mr Jeyaretnam has announced at the press conferenece that he is going to bring legal action against the Government but he forgot to mention that Mr Jeyaretnam gave his press conference after this Bill was introduced and he does not explain why, although the Privy Council judgment was issued last year, Mr Jeyaretnam has not done anything between then and now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's remarks really come as a surprise. I think he should decide what his stand is. Sir, this is what he said on 17th February, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to go on record that I think it is high time that Singapore, after over 20 years of our judicial system in Singapore, should grow up and not be tied to the apron strings of the Privy Council.' I think sometimes, Sir, he speaks from the heart. I think that was the occasion. And sometimes when he has the script, he speaks to the gallery. So I feel tempted to ask: will the real Mr Chiam, please put up his hand? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chiam and Dr Lee asked, will the Government give advance notice whether it is going to consent? Obviously we cannot. It must depend on the transaction, it must depend on the case. Sometimes the Government may be the plaintiff, the Government may be the prosecutor and sometimes maybe the defendant. It depends on the individual case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His comments on a permanent Court of Appeal. This was thoroughly discussed in response to comments made by the Chairman of the GPC during the Committee of Supply debate and I think my views on that are known. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether the appeals listed in the statistics are there many which involve disciplinary cases. I do not have all the breakdown but the civil cases listed for that period include 6 show-cause discipli- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nary proceedings of which only two were allowed, according to my records. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the comments. If I have missed out any, I shall be grateful if Members point it out. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> The Minister has missed out something. He said something about life and death. If the Criminal Court of Appeal normally gives only one judgment and the other two judges merely concur, would he now require that in future every judge must give his own judgment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think Dr Lee during the tea break should discuss with both Mr Chiam and the other two lawyers here because whether there is one judgment in respect of which the other two judges agree is irrelevant or whether there are three separate judgments or whether there are two judgments and one judge agrees with the other is also irrelevant. The point is, were the three judges unanimous or not regardless of how many judgments they wrote. That is the test. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> It is not irrelevant, Sir, because we want to know what each judge really thinks and he should not merely just to concur. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have got two matters to bring up with the Minister. The first one is in regard to the show-cause action of lawyers. I can think of at least five lawyers who were successful at the Privy Council. I do not know why his record shows only two. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am certainly in favour of having our own local appeal courts. I think it is time that we should grow up and have our last Court of Appeal. But I am not inconsistent. I am against the present amendments because it is half-hearted, as I say, expediency, and on an ad hoc basis. So we have mentioned the sensitive areas where the Government is a litigant, that is the problem. I think many people will still feel uneasy with these amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Sir, if I might just repond to something that Dr Lee said. He asked whether it is desirable to direct the judges sitting on the Court of Appeal to write three judgments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in England it often happens that the Court of Appeal decides and you have the --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of order? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think he is the Minister. He should raise it through the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> With your permission, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How can anybody make a reply? I can reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is perfectly in order. This is a debate, Mr Chiam. Carry on, Mr Singh. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> He should go through the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Singh, you may carry on. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> I am grateful, Sir. I am only trying to assist this House and I know that I have been impeded in that regard. But in any case --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You have to go through the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Through the Minister then, Sir. And with your and his leave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying before Mr Chiam stood up, in England there are numerous occasions when a Court of Appeal decide and in the reports you have three judgments. This is no criticism. But to direct the three judges write does not make a difference because what you will have, as has often happened in England, is one major judgment and the other two judges appear in the report with two lines saying, \"I have read the illuminating reasons of my Learned Brother and I entirely concur.\" And that is a judgment, Sir. So if you direct that all three judges will write, this is a possibility, and really it does not make any sense. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it might be a possibility but we should ensure that everybody knows what each judge really thinks. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> I would have thought, Sir, that as soon as the decision comes out as a unanimous decision, it does not make any sense for two more judges to say that it is a unanimous decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my reply to Mr Chiam is very simple. What he said in February can be interpreted only to mean one thing, that he had favoured completely cutting off \"the apron strings\" immediately because he said it was high time. What we have done is, we have taken the approach which at least retains some appeals for the reasons given by many Members in this House. In other words, if he had come to this House completely cutting off appeals, he would have supported it. But because we have not gone the full length, he is opposing it. I want to know whether I am right in that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Privy Council appeals, my statistics are there were six show-cause disciplinary proceedings during this period: 1988 one case allowed; 1985 two cases, both withdrawn, in other words, not decided by the Privy Council; 1984 two cases both allowed; 1981 one case dismissed. So really three allowed. That is the record I have. If he gives me further information I can check on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Under the Amendment Bill, Singapore motorists will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500. For this purpose, I draw the attention of the House to clause 2 of the Bill. The regulation will not apply to foreign registered vehicles which hold valid permits to enter and remain in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has been concerned for some time now over the increasing number of Singapore motorists going across the Causeway to fill up with petrol which is cheaper in Johor. This action undermines the Government's use of petrol pricing as one of the measures to curb car usage in Singapore. The main purpose of the Bill is therefore to ensure that the use of petrol pricing to control the usage of roads in Singapore is not bypassed. Additionally, loss of duty on petrol is estimated at around $2 million a month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to curb the rise of road congestion in Singapore, the Minister for Communications and Information is studying measures to control car usage instead of just car ownership in Singapore. The use of petrol pricing is one of the measures being considered and if petrol duty has to be revised upwards as a result, motorists can simply beat the measure by buying their petrol in Johor. That was what actually happened in 1985 when the ad valorem duty on petrol in Singapore was raised from 50% to 60% in March that year. The volume of Singapore registered cars crossing daily to Johor immediately doubled, from an average of some 3,000 per day to over 6,000 per day. In September 1985, the ad valorem duty was brought back to 50% as a counter recession measure and the volume of cars crossing to Johor immediately fell back to some 3,400 per day. For most of 1986 and 1987, the Causeway crossings fluctuated between 3,000 and 4,000 per day, reflecting normal car travel to Johor on business, shopping or leisure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year, there has been a steady rise in the number of daily crossings again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> They now average more than 6,000 per day and on holidays, sometimes more than 10,000 cars cross over into Johor in a single day. No doubt other factors, unrelated to petrol prices, have contributed to this increase. Many Singaporeans now visit Johor to enjoy the beaches and entertainment and to take advantage of the cheaper shopping and seafood and these attractions will continue to draw Singaporeans into Johor. But part of the traffic clearly results from the difference in petrol prices, which is now 25 Singapore cents per litre cheaper in Johor. This price difference makes it worthwhile for some Singapore motorists to visit Johor just to buy petrol and for others who are already there to top up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would emphasize that the purpose of the amendment is not to discourage Singaporeans from visiting Johor. Indeed, the opposite is true in that the Government is committed to the development of economic relations with Johor and to cooperate in the development of the tourist industry in Johor. There are many attractions which draw Singaporeans to visit Johor for their leisure and the Government wants to encourage this trend. Work has started on increasing the number of clearance lanes at the Woodlands Checkpoint in order to speed up traffic clearance. The existing Causeway is already being widened. A ferry link to Southwest Johor will soon be established. A second road-link is under consideration. We can expect, and indeed we want, more Singaporeans to go to visit West Malaysia, just as we welcome more Malaysian visitors to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision on the control measure to be used was only made after careful consideration of its impact on Singapore visitors to Johor. The measure had to be simple to operate, should not inconvenience the motorist unduly or cause traffic congestion which would affect the flow of traffic to Johor. The half-tank measure was chosen because it satisfied all these requirements. Many alternative measures were examined and Members may be interested in a few which were considered but not accepted for a variety of reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The imposition of a levy on every Singapore registered car either entering or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> leaving Singapore was considered seriously. The levy would be adjusted periodically to offset the price advantage of buying a tankful of petrol in Johor. For example, the present difference in the price of petrol between Singapore and Johor is 25 Singapore cents per litre. If a typical 1.6 litre car with a fuel capacity of 52 litres tops up with 40 litres of petrol in Johor, the savings to the motorist would be $10. An exit or entry levy of $10 would therefore offset this price difference. A levy would be the simplest scheme to implement. But we decided against it because we did not want it misunderstood that the Government was indiscriminately opposed to Singaporeans visiting Johor. However, if the half-tank regulation should prove to be ineffective, a levy may have to be reconsidered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The imposition of excise duty on petrol purchased in Johor and imported into Singapore was another measure which was considered. On the surface, this would appear to be a fair and equitable control measure as it would only affect motorists who actually bought petrol in Johor. Unfortunately, it is unworkable in practice because there is no simple way to identify petrol bought in Johor from petrol bought in Singapore when they are mixed together in the same tank. To do so would require the addition of chemical tracers to petrol sold in Singapore. It would require the draining of petrol from fuel tanks of cars entering Singapore and the analysis of this petrol. The procedure would be hazardous, time consuming and would lead to massive traffic congestion at the Woodlands Checkpoint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Another measure considered was to require all Singapore registered cars to top up their fuel tanks at designated petrol stations near the Woodlands Checkpoint before they are allowed to cross the Causeway. This would have been an effective control measure but is likely to cause severe congestion at these designated stations and traffic hold-ups along the approach road to the Woodlands Checkpoint, particularly during peak holiday periods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the regulation will be carried out with the least inconvenience to the motorist and in a manner \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which will avoid interrupting the smooth flow of traffic at the Woodlands Checkpoint. Under the proposed regulations, when a Singapore registered vehicle passes a specified point on the road approaching the Woodlands Checkpoint, its fuel tank must contain more than half of its total capacity of motor spirit, failing which, any person in charge of such a vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500. Mr Speaker, Sir, the more than half-tank requirement is proposed for practical reasons, even though a full-tank requirement would have been much more effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers from the Customs and Excise Department will carry out random visual checks on the fuel gauges of vehicles which have passed the designated point and this will be done when the motorists are queueing up for immigration clearance. I would emphasize that in the initial stages, the officers would use their discretion in enforcing the regulations and would, wherever possible, give motorists the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that if the control procedure proposed should prove ineffective, other more stringent measures may have to be introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full details of the control and operating procedures will be released after the Amendment Bill has been approved by Parliament and has received Presidential assent. My colleague, the Minister for Communications and Information, will also be presenting amendments to the Road Traffic Act later today, on matters relating to motor vehicle fuel gauges, insofar as they affect the implementation of the control measures proposed under the Customs (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 20/89). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in speaking on this Bill, my objective is really to reflect some of the views that have been gathered from grassroots leaders, businessmen, executives, housewives, taxi-drivers and hawkers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the people I talked with felt that this \"half-tank\" measure is really not necessary and they gave many reasons to support their view. Before I go into the reasons, I would like to make one comment, in that this Bill was widely discussed after the First Reading without the benefit of a full explanation which normally comes through at the Second Reading, which we just heard from the Minister. The single statement from the Government was obviously not sufficient. In fact, the explanation was ineffective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let us look at the reasons as to what causes unhappiness with some of the Singaporeans we talked to. Firstly, many believe that checking of the cars at the Causeway, however minimal, would cause traffic jams and hence inconvenience. Without these checks, the time taken to cross the Causeway during weekends and public holidays is already bad enough. These new checks, however random it may be, will only add to the existing jam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, as a control measure on car usage, this new measure will not be a totally effective mechanism. Singaporeans can still enter Johor with a half tank and fill it up to a full tank before returning to Singapore. As a measure, this is only a \"half measure\" and many Singaporeans find it very difficult to understand why Singapore Government has now gone for half-measures. Sir, why not insist on a three-quarter tank or better still, a full tank. And I am glad to note that the Minister is prepared to consider if the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thirdly, many Singaporeans also felt that this measure is another attempt to restrict movements of Singaporeans and they are quite unhappy. One person even went on to say that this measure is being introduced out of envy of Singaporeans having a good time in Johor Baru. Many Singaporeans go to Johor for seafood, shopping, recreation because of the exchange difference and not merely for the sake of buying petrol. This requirement of \"half-tank\" is viewed by some Singaporeans as Government interference in their free movement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth and last reason is that this measure will affect our relations with Malaysia, and in particular with Johor. In this respect, I also share my own concern on this area. I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether this is a good neighbourly act. I concede on the arguments about leakage and revenue loss, especially when the Minister for Communications and Information had indicated in this House that further hike on petrol prices is imminent. Is this leakage really such a big drain on our coffers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our relations with Malaysia are at the best possible level at this point of time, and I fear that mischief makers will exploit this \"half-tank\" measure to disrupt this level of relationship. Do we want this to happen? Why are we creating an opportunity for such mischief makers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this action of ours shows us as being rather petty and that we always want to be on top. Once we are at a disadvantage, we tend to over-react. In a way this reminds me of the Malaysia Singapore Airlines/Mercury Singapore Airlines episode. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that we have good grounds to go ahead with this measure. I hope the Minister for Finance, Minister for Communications and Information and the Minister for Foreign Affairs can assure this House that this \"half-tank\" measure will not generally affect the good relations between Singapore and Malaysia. These relations have been built at all levels from the Prime Minister, Ministers and civil servants downwards, and this should not be nullified by a simple half-tank measure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hong Hai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hong Hai (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last week's Straits Times carried an article about the collection of short stories by Singapore author, Catherine Lim. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stories is about a civil servant called Mr Sai Koh Phan. Sounds like \"sycophant\". Mr Sai contracts a strange crippling disease because of following too zealously all the rules and campaigns of the Government. I have not read the story, but apparently the cure for him and other civil servants was to find private opportunities to spit, to litter, to stop eating frozen fish without feeling guilty, and so on. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> story has a happy ending. The right therapy was found when the Government bought a piece of land in Johor for civil servants to let their hair down, break some rules. I guess if Catherine Lim were to write her story today, she would also give them the personal satisfaction of buying cheap petrol over there, after Parliament passes the Customs (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is not a frivolous one. I think it is a sign of a more grown-up society that a noted local author is able to write a gentle satire on our disciplined society. It cannot be denied that we live under fairly regimented conditions. But it is also a fact of life that some discipline is essential to our economic progress and our quality of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such dicipline has its costs. Occasionally, government intrusiveness in our lives gets to some of our people, particularly the young and the educated who have not experienced the alternative of an undisciplined society and therefore may not appreciate as much what we now have. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this context that we should view the irate reactions of the public to the two Bills. The reaction has been vehemently negative even among those who never go to Johor. Government has been accused of being picky, petty, and petulant. The so-called \"half-tank\" Bill has sometimes been called a \"half-brain\" Bill, as well as a number of more graphic names that cannot be repeated in this Chamber. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last three weeks I have personally conducted an informal survey of motorists, grassroots leaders and professionals. Their grouses are genuine and their apprehensions are sincere. I would like to highlight three of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they concede that Government has the right and the duty to collect petrol taxes and close tax loopholes when these are serious enough. Tax loopholes are a fact of life, here in Singapore as in other countries. Clever lawyers in Australia and America make a good living out of helping people exploit tax loopholes. The question is: Is the problem of petrol from Johor serious enough to justify such severe \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> measures? Are we trying to kill a fly with a sledge-hammer? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new measures can potentially cause great inconvenience to motorists. It could lead to traffic jams near the Causeway. And it raises the spectre of nasty Customs officials peering into cars to check fuel meters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Bill is unfair to people who go to Johor mainly for entertainment rather than to buy cheap petrol. These people may be victimized because they happen to have faulty fuel meters in their cars or they inadvertently fail to have more than half a tank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these complaints appear to be well-founded. But let us examine them a little bit more carefully. Consider the last two objections: congestion at the Causeway and inconvenience to motorists. Are we going to have long queues near the Causeway as a result of this new law? In my view, this scenario is improbable. To start with, most of the time the average car in Singapore already has more than half a tank of petrol. The reason is quite simple. Most of us fill up our petrol tanks long before it goes empty. It is prudent and gives us peace of mind. We do not want to run out of petrol while on the road. If we tend to fill up at, say, a quarter tank rather than wait for it to be empty, then most cars would have between a quarter tank and a full tank or, on average, about 63% full tank. Mathematically, this means 63% of the time, we already have half a tank or more. Queues at petrol stations near the Causeway are therefore unlikely, especially after people get used to the new rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, furthermore, I believe that Customs will simply not have the manpower to check too many cars entering the Causeway. The checks would have to be done on a low sampling basis. I doubt that there would be congestion as a result of random checks. The bottleneck will continue to be the immigration points in Johor, not petrol meter checks by Singapore customs officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that motorists who go to Johor for entertainment and shopping will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be slightly inconvenienced by this new measure. They have to take care that the tanks are at least half full. But this only means occasionally a need to top up, and this need not be done at the Causeway. The time it takes is insignificant compared to the queueing time for going through customs and immigration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for meters that are inaccurate or occasionally faulty, it is necessary for the ROV to exercise prudence and consideration in dealing with these cases. Only those who clearly tamper with their gauges or who are grossly negligent in not repairing the obviously faulty meter, should be subject to severe penalties. There is a fine line between a meter that is faulty and one that is inaccurate. In practice, no meter can be totally accurate. I hope that the Minister for Communications and Information will prevail on his officers to be flexible and not to be overly stringent in handling such cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the first objection, and to me the potentially more serious one. Is the tax leakage serious enough for such strong measures? The Minister for Finance has explained the economic rationale for discouraging motorists from buying petrol in Johor. His is an unpleasant task and he has my sympathy. The Minister has a job to do. It is also his duty to close obvious tax loopholes and to see that fiscal measures to discourage road usage are not undermined by cheap petrol from across the Causeway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How serious is the problem? If the figure of $2 million a month is correct, then it is a substantial leakage and effective measures are indeed called for. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is indeed high. According to the Ministry of Finance's statistics, petrol duty amounts to some $300 million a year in Singapore. A leakage of $2 million a month amounts to $24 million a year or 8% of petrol revenue. This is equivalent to 1 in 12.5 Singaporeans filling all their petrol requirements in Johor. If you consider that the average person may fill only half his requirement in Johor, this is equivalent to 1 in 6 Singaporeans going across the Causeway to fill petrol. This I must say is a surprising figure. I would be much obliged if the Minister could reassure us of its accuracy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the figure was exaggerated, there may still be a case for taking these measures. Petrol duty is going up, and the gap will widen and this will exacerbate the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the Government position on closing the tax loophole is logically defensible. Why then the furore over the half-tank Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the reaction of the public has been, in my view, of an emotional nature, a release of pent-up resentment over too much state tinkering with their lives. It is a symptom of a wider problem that this Government faces. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to suggest that on a matter like this which affects people's pockets and could raise emotional reactions, the Government takes more pains to explain the reasons for the proposed new measures to the public before formally presenting it to Parliament. True, once a bill is presented, our parliamentary system does not permit the bill to be explained until the second reading. But this does not mean that it cannot be explained to the public informally before the first reading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government could gain prestige and public support if it could conduct a more active public relations programme on such matters. The logic behind the two bills is difficult to fault. The Government can and will win the logical argument against the protesters. But we are not in the business of winning arguments. We are in the business of persuading people and winning support for good policies. I believe that in this instance we might have better prepared the ground by presenting the arguments for the bills up front before sentiment against is allowed to build up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministers for Finance and Communications and Information will reassure the public that their officials will not be over-zealous in the administration of the new laws; that the benefit of the doubt be given to those whose meters are not totally accurate through no fault of their own, and that every effort will be made not to inconvenience motorists who want to enjoy their weekends in Johor. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CUSTOMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I follow up some of the remarks made by Mr Chandra Das who has expressed his concern. It would appear that sometimes the Government's right hand does not really know what its left hand is doing. Recent events have confirmed that. The Government often says that we should strengthen ASEAN solidarity. And in this respect, our First Deputy Prime Minister has gone to Indonesia to cement friendly relations. That is good. Yet, on the other hand, the Government amends the Immigration law, and abruptly and unceremoniously sends packing thousands of so-called illegal Thai workers, all going home bitter and resentful. And in the process, the Government has soured relations between Singapore and the Thai people. That is no good. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now even before tempers have really cooled down, we have this Customs (Amendment) Bill, which will certainly cause a great deal of unhappiness in Johore and throughout Malaysia. The Minister has said that it is not meant to discourage people going into Malaysia, and even cited examples of Singapore promoting tourism in Johor. But questions have already been asked, and the Singapore High Commissioner to Malaysia had to make conciliatory statements in an attempt to allay apprehensions of the people in Malaysia. And similarly, our Minister for Trade and Industry had to speak of incentives for Singapore businesses that expand into Johor in order to appease injured feelings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the damage has already been done, and it may well be some time before the damage is repaired. Is that how Singapore hopes to improve and strengthen friendly relations with ASEAN countries, and especially with Malaysia? By doing something that would harm the interests of friends \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and neighbours as well as the interests of Singapore motorists? It sounds so unbelievable as some of the speakers have already said. It is as if our Government has been afflicted with schizophrenia, saying something nice and good in its saner moments, but doing something bad and irrational when it becomes moonstruck and wacky. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other explanation is there forsuch a Bill that is both irrational and absurd, contrary to what Dr Hong Hai has said? Is it intended merely to save $2 million a month revenue that Government says it has been losing? However, since the Bill makes it an offence to cross the Causeway without at least half a tankful of petrol, the motorists from Singapore can buy at most another half tankful of cheaper petrol. Therefore, the revenue loss is halved, to only $1 million. And if we deduct also the extra expenditure incurred for the manpower and machinery needed to check the petrol gauges of vehicles, it can be seen that the sum saved by this Bill will be much less than $1 million a month. Surely that paltry sum saved is nothing compared to the goodwill that would be lost if such a half-tank rule Bill is passed and becomes law. Is the Bill really worth it? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this Bill is that although our Ministers often speak of the benefits of free enterprise and free market forces against the harmful effects of protectionism, Government is nevertheless actively pushing a policy of protectionism. That is what many people in Singapore are saying, and I agree with them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protectionism, Sir, comes in many forms, in the form of tariffs, quotas, import controls, non-tariff barriers, export self-restraint and so on. The Bill before us proposes a form of import control, by way of legal or administrative restriction to the free flow of goods, namely, the free flow of cheaper petrol bought by motorists returning from Johor. It wants to protect the sale of petrol in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In defence of its action, Singapore may well say that it is merely adopting measures in connection with Singapore customs and duties. But what's in a name? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> They say that a rose by any name smells as sweet. And so protectionism via the Customs (Amendment) Bill is still protectionism. We must not forget that in the past Malaysia had adopted analogous measures that had prevented or discouraged the development of the free flow of goods across the Causeway. Would the Government be able to assure the House that this half tank rule will not trigger off another round of retaliatory measures taken by the Malaysian government in the future? If not, should we then legislate something that can and probably will provoke retaliation from our neighbours and friends in ASEAN? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policies are certainly irrational. Also irrational is the statement by the Minister for Trade and Industry. While in Johor, he said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When they [ie, the motorists] buy cheap petrol in Johor to bring back to Singapore, they are circumventing the traffic congestion control policy and [almost as an afterthought I think] a loss of revenue [that is unimportant].' So the Government's excuse for the Bill would be that cheap petrol from Johor causes traffic congestion in Singapore. We must remind the Minister, as the Minister himself has also said, that people have been going to buy cheap petrol from Johor ever since 1985, after the big increase in petrol duties in Singapore. When it realized that it was losing revenue because motorists were buying cheaper petrol in Johor, the Government was forced to reduce petrol taxes in 1986 by about 40 cents or so. After that, of course, fewer motorists went to buy cheaper petrol in Johor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since one year or more ago, the exchange rate in favour of the Singapore dollar has been rising steadily. Today, the exchange rate is around 70 cents to one Malaysian Ringgit. In the circumstances, it is only natural that motorists would like to take advantage of the favourable exchange rate to buy much cheaper petrol in Johor. Yet, during all these years, from 1985 to 1989 today no one has suggested that cheap petrol from Johor has caused traffic congestion in Singapore. And this is simply because cheap petrol has nothing to do with traffic congestion in Singapore. But now when the half-tank rule is being \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> introduced, such an illogical argument is suddenly being advanced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common sense tells us that we cannot easily follow such PAP logic. It is very difficult. Common sense tells us that if the average motorist goes to buy cheaper petrol, it is because he hopes to save money. He would certainly want to conserve and economize on the use of petrol, and not foolishly waste it by unnecessary use of the vehicle on the road. But now the Minister wants us to believe that the motorist would waste his money by using the vehicle on the road, and so cause congestion in Singapore. I wonder if the Minister is really serious. And does he really believe in such illogical logic? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is congestion, it is already present before the motorists go to Johor to buy cheaper petrol. And topping up half a tank with cheap petrol cannot add to such congestion. So how does filling half a tank with cheap petrol \"circumvent the traffic congestion control policy\", as the Minister claims? If it is congestion on the Causeway, that is another matter. But if the Bill is passed, checks on the petrol gauges on the Causeway is certain to worsen congestion. It is the Bill that will cause congestion, not the cheap petrol. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I must point out, as has already been pointed out by Mr Chandra Das, that the restriction imposed on motorists going across the Causeway is a grave violation of the basic right of freedom of movement enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He does not believe in it! I say that the people have a right to travel freely inside and outside the country, whether they have half a tank or full tank in their vehicles. But now the Bill takes away that right. What other rights may be taken away the next time? Today, the restriction is on the buying of cheap petrol. Will it mean that tomorrow a person will not be able to cross the Causeway to do shopping, to do marketing or to enjoy a cheap seafood meal? Is this Bill intended to be a forerunner of more restrictions on human rights and freedoms in the days ahead? One can never be certain with the PAP Government, Sir, with its shocking record of violations of human rights in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Straits Times Forum Page published a letter from a reader not so long ago. He asked: A motorist may go across the Causeway with less than half-tankful and return to Singapore without buying any petrol. Is that an offence under the law? The reader concludes that the Bill is illogical. We must ask: what is the Minister's answer? If the answer is yes, it shows that such a law is an ass. If the answer is no, it shows that the proposed Bill is also an ass. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, the Bill is both illogical and irrational. It is a reflection of the illogical and irrational thinking of a Government afflicted with schizophrenia. It must be remembered that the Causeway is not a barrier but a bridge - a bridge that facilitates a free flow of trade, goods and movement of friendly peoples between the two territories. Imposing any form of restriction on the Causeway will certainly harm the interests of the people of both countries. The proposed Bill should be scrapped. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Lee Yiok Seng)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill because it helps the Government to effectively control the increase in the number of vehicles. It is not designed to restrict singaporeans from going to Johor Bahru. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as our people get more affluent, their desire to enjoy material things is also greater. Everybody wants to possess more material things, enjoy a better living and to be comfortable. Therefore, when the people want to join the car owners class, it is a good sign. It is not wrong. Therefore the Government should not prevent them from doing that. But Singapore is a small island state with limited land space. We cannot allow the vehicles to occupy too much of land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, 10% of our total land area is used for transportation purposes. In addition to this, land is also used for the building of car parks and other related facilities. So this is a problem every Singaporean should be concerned with. If from now we do not have a good plan and measures to control the increase in the number of vehicles but allow the people to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> freely possess cars, then there will come a time when people with cars will not be able to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to visit Woodlands Checkpoints as it is within my constituency. I cannot help noticing the traffic congestion at that place. If there comes a day, in Singapore, where there is a widespread traffic congestion, I think we will be be very disappointed and will be confronted with a lot of problems. The future of Singapore will also be adversely affected if there are traffic jams everywhere. Singapore will no longer be as good, as beautiful and as attractive as it is now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling the increase in the number of cars is something that nobody is actually willing to do, but to a responsible Singaporean it is something that he has to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the measures taken by the Government do not restrict Singaporeans from owning cars. The taxes and regulations are to make the prople pau when they use their cars. I personally feel that these measures are not all the measures that could be adopted. In future, depending on the actual development of the situation, ney measures may be intorduced. I really do not know what they might be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, singaporeans want to become a middle class society. to do so, they must learn to always balance their family income and expenditure. The monthly budget should be well planned. Middle income people like to acquire material things. They must know that to acquire an extra item, they have to prepare for its monthly maintenance and expenses. If the budgetting is wring they may be tempted to ge more income through some other means. But such methods are not reliable. Some may even bing about financial problems upon their family. Some people have to go to Johor Bahru to buy cheaper petrol in order to be able to maintain a car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to become a middle class society, we must have our principles and we must stoutly uphold them. If we want to enjoy more material benefits, we must depend on our own ability and our own \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> efforts to acquire and maintain such material things. We should never try to depend on luck or manipulate any loopholes or expect the Government to give some subsidy to acquire such things. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept this principle, after the amendment is passed, the Bill will be seen, not a punishment, but as a lesson in principled living. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance will remind the officers under him to implement the law fairly and not to take every driver to be a criminal, quibbling over minor differences with him and taking him to court to be fined heavily, thus making the Bill a new means of revenue for the finance Ministry, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the bill is passed, it may help relieve traffic congestion at the woodlands Customs Checkpoint. As more and more Singaporeans like to go to Johor Bahru or other places in Johor for sight-seeing or to spend their holidays, this measure will help to increase more tourist establishments at these places to attract them. Of course, there are also many people from Johor who like to come over here for a vacation. This movement of people across the Causeway will be mutually beneficial. The availabiliy of cheaper petrol in Johor Bahru has worsened the traffic congestion at Woodlands Checkpoints so much that people who want to cross the Causeway to spend their holidays there are put off by the congestion. So they simply do not want to go over there and the people in Johor Bahru are also reluctant to come over here. Tourist business facilities over in Johor Bahru are also reluctant to come over here. Tourist business facilities over in Johor Bahru are also affected adversely, not being fully utilized. On both sids of the Causeway normal business arrangements are also upset because of changing sizes of visiting crowd. The traffic congestion has also caused inconvenience to the residents of Woodlands New Town. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that after this amendment Bill is passed, people who go over to Johor Bahru just to fill up their petrol tanks will no longer be interested to go over there because it may not be worth the effort. We need not worry too much for our Johor friends, because other than petrol kiosk operations, the business community there generally do not benefit from and so do \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not welcome these petrol purchasers because these people go over to Johor Bahru only to buy petrol. Besides, they add to the traffic in Johor Bahru. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the passage of the bill, they will not go there any more. This will reduce the traffic pressure at the Checkpoints' vicinity so the traffic situation will be improved and people who want to go over to Johor Bahru or the other way round will find it more convenient to travel. Everybody will benefit from this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to remind the Minister that in carrying out the inspection and checking of petrol tanks, the methods used should not add to the traffic congestion at the Woodlands Customs Checkpoint. If it does, it will cause even more unhappiness to many people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can speculate about how effective this Bill will be. But it appears to have caused Dr Lee Siew-Choh a lot of indigestion already. I do not know whether indigestion leads to fantasy, but I do know that if one proceeds on certain assumptions about the behaviour of the Government, one can certainly fantasise about all kinds of motivations and ill-effects of policies and I can see why it is so easy for Dr Lee then to assume that the Government is stupid, inconsistent, schizophrenic, illogical, and so on and so forth. I believe, Sir, it is safer, easier and saner to assume a rational Government. If one proceeds on that basis then let me suggest a hypothesis why this Bill is being presented to Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the $2 million loss of revenue per month is acknowledged by everybody to be a small amount, then surely that loss by itself cannot be the real reason for the introduction of this Bill. But if one can look further down the road and see a further strengthening of the Singapore dollar vis-a-vis the Malaysian dollar or an increase in petrol tax in Singapore, then one can see why such a Bill might be put into effect. I think the Minister hinted at this when he referred to the earlier experience when we did put on too big a petrol tax and the price differential between Singapore petrol and Malaysian petrol was so large that it led to long queues at the Causeway. So I do not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> believe that the intention of the Bill right now is to prevent people from going to Johor Baru because all the other attractions of Johor Baru are still there. It is still possible for motorists to go across the Causeway even with slightly more than half a tank and fill up there and refill there many times as long as they are motoring throughout West Malaysia. They can still enjoy the seafood regardless of the indigestion. They can do the shopping and do other things in Johor Baru. I believe that what is important for us is that we do not preclude ourselves the option of setting our own national policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may agree or disagree with the petrol price increase to curb the use of motor vehicles in Singapore. But if that is deemed to be necessary, then it would be logical to have such a Bill to ensure that should such a tax increase come, then there will be no real congestion at the Causeway and real and very serious loss of revenue consequent upon that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Dr Lee Siew-Choh was trying to deceive this House and the people of Singapore when he said that the price of petrol has got nothing to do with traffic congestion. It is obvious to everyone that when petrol is cheaply available one would tend to use the car more. How can he then say that the price of petrol has got nothing to do with traffic congestion? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our land transport policy seeks to maintain the congestion-free mobility of people and goods in Singapore through the control of car usage and the growth of car population. This policy requires that a combination of a number of measures, such as road tax, registration fee, ARF, road pricing and petrol tax, etc. be adopted. I believe Singaporeans have come to accept the necessity of such measures and are convinced of the benefits they will bring to Singapore. However, the use of petrol tax cannot effectively serve its purpose if Singaporeans can continue to buy cheaper petrol in Johor. Any increase in petrol tax would, in fact, attract more Singaporeans to do so. This Bill therefore seeks to ensure the effectiveness of the petrol tax measure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue loss of $2 million per month at present is an indication of the extent to which the petrol tax measure is compromised. This amount can expect to increase, as Dr Augustine Tan has mentioned, should the Singapore dollar appreciates in value against the Malaysian Ringgit or should the Government decide to increase the petrol duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support the objective of this Bill because it would otherwise deprive us of an useful measure to control car usage. However, Sir, I am not comfortable with the means adopted in this Bill for two reasons. First, why should it be an offence when a person leaving the country has without more than half a tank of petrol in his motor vehicle? How can the law presume that he is going to buy cheaper petrol in Johor without giving him the opportunity to prove that he is not? Second, the Bill does not prevent a person from buying up to half a tank of petrol. As such, it is only half effective as far as achieving the objective of the petrol tax is concerned. The revenue loss can,in fact, increase substantially depending on any future increase in petrol tax. Thus, the Government may have to look for alternative measures if the problem continues to exist. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that administrative problem in implementing this Bill is one of the main considerations by the Government, including not to cause traffic congestion at the Causeway. In this respect, it seems that levying a tax on every vehicle leaving Singapore is the most effective means with the least administrative problem. This measure, however, will have the following drawbacks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will be seen to be discouraging Singaporeans from going to Malaysia. Second, it will have an adverse effect on our business cooperation with Johor and, third, one may ask why he should be made to pay the tax if he does not intend to buy petrol in Johor. Sir, I suggest that the Government look again into the feasibility of adopting the universal practice of customs declaration. There are ways to streamline the operation and keep the administrative problem and traffic conges- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion at the Causeway to the minimum. Every Singapore registered vehicle leaving Singapore can be given a card on which the person in charge of a vehicle will be required to mark the petrol level of his vehicle. Random checks can be done to enforce that no false declaration is made. When the vehicle returns from Malaysia, the card can be collected back and again random checks can be made to ensure that the petrol level of the vehicle does not exceed what has been declared. For those who lose their cards or do not wish to display their cards, a tax can then be levied on them. A heavy penalty can be imposed on those who violate the law. Sir, I hope that the Minister will consider this suggestion when he looks for alternative solutions in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister thinks that people want to go to JB to buy cheaper petrol. He may be correct to a certain extent but I believe most Singaporeans disagree. The majority of Singaporeans going to JB are actually taking advantage of the lower Malaysian Ringgit and this is beyond our control. I think buying cheaper petrol is a fringe benefit. If the dollar differential is small then more Singaporeans will flock across and in turn will bring back cheaper but higher grade lead content petrol. What if the revenue loss is more than $2 million, say, $3 million? Will you then change the law to say that Singaporeans will have to fill up to three-quarter tankful before leaving the Republic? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the different grades of petrol as a more serious problem because it will negate your anti-pollution effort to bring down the lead level in the atmosphere. This perhaps is a more valid and acceptable reason in disallowing Singaporeans to buy petrol in JB. I hope the Minister for the Environment will agree with me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the many points raised by my fellow Backbenchers, like traffic jams, administrative headaches, and our relationship with Johor, I want to ask a very fundamental question. Is it a crime to have less than half a tankful of petrol? The imposition of a fine means it is a crime. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> It is an offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> An offence has been committed. If I can prove to you that my tank was not topped up in JB, will I be excused? If you want to impose this rule, then you must be prepared to implement this in a fair manner. Your assumption that Singaporeans going to JB to buy petrol may not be totally true. Why should I inconvenience myself to pump up my petrol tank just to satisfy you? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> It is inconvenient. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes, it is inconvenient. My purpose of going to JB is to enjoy myself, so why should I have to go and fulfil a requirement by the Ministry? How can you assume that I am going to commit a crime of buying cheap petrol? You are assuming that I have the intention to cheat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, please refer to the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I am so sorry. I was thinking of the Minister for Finance. But this is serious. I am asking for a fairer implementation of this rule. If you can conceive such an idea, you must be able to implement this fairly. If your idea of introducing this Bill is to curb usage of cars, I think it is not going to work well. It is only a half-measure. Singaporeans, if their intention of going to JB is to buy cheaper petrol, can still continue to bring in half-tankful of petrol. Many think that this is a revenue-orientated move. If this is so, how significant is the $2 million loss in revenue in terms of the percentage of the total petrol used? Is it significant enough to have such an impact that this Bill must be introduced? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Shanmugam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Ayer Rajah has already pre-empted me in my basic views on this Bill but I would set them out anyway. I can see the principle behind the amendments to the Customs Act. The basic philosophy is that petrol sold in Singapore is taxed so anyone bringing in petrol also has to pay the tax. But the problem with the proposed amendment is that it seeks to achieve administrative efficiency at the expense of some basic notion as to what ought and ought not to be an offence under our legal system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not long ago that this House was reminded that we should perhaps be more careful in our pursuit of administrative efficiency at the expense of some perhaps fundamental values. There is obviously an automatic reaction to this Bill because it is seen as a further imposition of Governmental control on the way people order their lives. I can see that $30 million tax is lost per year. But could we not achieve the same purpose in imposing some form of tax on cars leaving the country with less than half a tank without making it an offence? What I would suggest is having a separate avenue for cars which leave Singapore to Johor Bahru or elsewhere where they declare whether they have half tank or less and if so pay a surcharge. I do not see that it imposes a greater administrative burden and, if it does, it causes a queue among cars queuing up in that lane where they have to pay a surcharge and that will be a motivating factor for people to top up anyway before they leave the country. The principle is that it is not made an offence. That is all. You can have the same effect but do not make it an offence because if you start making relatively simple things like having half a tank or less of petrol an offence, then there could be the question arising as to what else would be made an offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to distinguish between tax measures and offences and if people queue up in the wrong lane and purport to say that there is more than half a tank of petrol when they have less than half a tank, that can be made an offence because there they are attempting to cheat. So subject to that, I would ask the Minister to consider whether he should not reconsider this Bill and ensure that we have a mechanism not to lose out in tax revenues. In fact, the surcharge payable by cars leaving can be left to the discretion and not put in the Act, so that the Minister can increase the surcharge as and when the differential between the Ringgit and the Dollar varies or the petrol prices in Singapore go up, and there is no offence created. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to that comment, Sir, I would support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Amendment Bill. Some of my colleagues in this House have given their views; likewise some Singaporeans say that Government loses only $2 million per month on petrol tax, so it is not necessary for the Government to implement this half-tank oil requirement. Some Singaporeans even say that it shows that the Government is very stingy and also ungentlemanly and this regulation will also affect Malaysia/Singapore's friendly relationship. But I would say that this kind of view is very superficial and subjective! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By implementing this half-tank measure, just as what the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Lee Yiok Seng has pointed out, it will not only save the Government $24 million a year's loss in revenue, but also help in our effort in checking traffic congestion and what is more important is that it will help promote the spirit of cooperation amongst Asean countries and the mutual good relationship between Singapore and Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the reasons that I am going to give, I support this amendment. Half-tank measure is based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit between Singapore and Malaysia and also in keeping with the cooperative spirit of Asean countries. When there is benefit or revenue, each country shares one-half. What we will implement is only half-tank stipulation and not full-tank stipulation. Therefore, we are not what Dr Lee Siew-Choh said, implementing protectionist measures. Moreover, Malaysian citizens coming to Singapore will not be affected by this stipulation. This is another expression of good relationship between Singapore and Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is: Travelling, sight-seeing and shopping in Malaysia should not be concenrated solely on Johor Bahru but should be extended to places such as Penang, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur and Kuantan. In this way, we would be helping in the overall development of tourism in Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By congregating at Johor Bahru, we have caused a steep rise in their rate of inflation. Malaysia citizens residing in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Johor Bahru have in fact, complained to their Central Government as it is affecting their living standard. As such, it could be seen that more problems have been created and those who have been actually benefitted are the minor group of businessmen and shopkeepers only. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point: The stipulation of half-tank petrol will not affect Singaporeans who genuinely go to look up their relatives or to do business there. Filial and warm-hearted Singaporeans and serious businessmen who have businness perspective and acumen will not be deterred by this half-tank stipulation. This measure will have no effect on such bona fide people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point: it is a known fact that petrol with a high level of lead content is detrimental to vehicles and also causes air pollution. This is only a small matter. However, some have used \"filling up petrol\" as an excuse for them to frequent the night-spots in Johor, thus endangering their otherwise happy families and also lowring their morals. In no time, Johor Bahru would become a second \"Haadyai\". This would be unethical to Malaysia and to the residents in Johor Bahru, as well as dis-respectful to a Muslim state. The half-tank petrol measure will have great effect on such people. I think this measure is necessary. This does not mean that the Government is petty or being ungentlemanly, but because we understand a Chinese proverb which means \"Do not do unto others what we ourselves do not want others to do unto us\" which means what we do not want, do not give to others. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no doubt that this amendment Bill will fulfill the Government's desire to reduce the revenue lost through Singapore motorists buying cheaper petrol in Johor Baru. Because of the good relations we have with Malaysia, we must ensure that the decision is not based on economic considerations alone. I have a hunch that this amendment Bill may bring about a series of consequences which may be unfavourable to us if this decision is based purely on economic considerations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always spoken against protectionism in any form. This is understandable because we started with entrepot trade and we will continue to depend on it. This policy has made Singapore what it is today. I have no doubt that this policy will still be with us. To require our citizens to have half a tank of petrol before entering Johor Baru can be misunderstood as a subtle form of protectionism. This misunderstanding is already confirmed by Dr Lee when he said that it is a protectionist policy. We must address this issue very carefully, otherwise it will weaken our position when we next speak against protectionism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that we should be concerned with is the possibility that this amendment may spark off a series of subtle measures and counter-measures by both countries. Malaysians travel to Singapore and spend their money in our shopping centres and restaurants. We must be prepared for the day to come when the Malaysian government may impose some form of restrictions on their people's spending power in Singapore. If this materializes, the net result is one which will not be good for all of us. It will be good for us even at this juncture to imagine how we will feel if the Malaysian government were to impose this measure. What will we do if this happens? A vicious cycle of counter-measures can exist. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is our source of natural produce, such as vegetables and fruits, not forgetting water. We must not assume that because they have vegetables in abundance and there is a big market in Singapore, vegetables will keep on coming to Singapore. If relations are affected because of this caption amendment, there can come a time when they may stop the supply of vegetables on political grounds. This has already happened in other countries where natural foods were not allowed to be exported on political grounds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that we ought to be mindful and be more long-sighted when we come up with measures such as this. Sometimes to pay a small economic price may be in the longer interests of Singapore. As it stands now, it seems like we may win the battle but we may lose the war. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be brief. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Good. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> As the Minister has recounted, cheap petrol in Johor Baru puts a cap on the petrol tax the Government can impose. Thus the Government has been unable to use the petrol tax as one of the measures to regulate car population and car usage effectively. I would like to point out another side effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the monthly fuel cost of operating a car in comparison with the car price, insurance cost and road tax has remained relatively low. One of the reasons is, of course, the soft crude oil market and the other is the petrol tax which has remained unchanged. This relatively low fuel cost has led to a growing trend amongst Singaporeans to buy bigger cars with higher capacity engines. While the drivers obviously enjoy greater comfort, such cars consume more petrol for the same distance travelled compared to smaller cars. They spew out more pollution, poison our air more, and eventually making the Singapore environment a poor place to live in for all of us, the majority of whom do not own cars. Furthermore, bigger cars also mean greater dependency on imported oil. When the price of oil increases in future, Singaporeans will find it very difficult to give up a luxury that they have become accustomed to, namely, bigger and more comfortable cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's intention to raise petrol tax in future. Of course, before the Government can do so, it must plug the escape route via the Causeway. However, there are several things about this Bill I have reservations about. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, under the Bill, leaving Singapore in a car with less than half a tank of petrol becomes a punishable offence when it was not so in the past. On top of that, to remove the temptation to tamper with the fuel measuring system, the Minister for Communications and Information will be moving the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill imposing substantial punishment for doing so. Before this amendment Bill, no one in his right mind would ever think of fooling around \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with the fuel gauge. After all, it is always better to drive around with an accurate meter than one that shows more fuel in the tank than otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the Bill becomes law, there are two more things in life that Singaporeans should not do. These things are not serious by themselves but they do nag at the subconscious, and this is a matter highlighted by my colleague, Dr Hong Hai. As such, I am in favour of the levy system mentioned by the Minister which will produce the same result without creating and imposing these two additional punishable offences. I am glad the Minister has agreed to keep the option open. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will also be brief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first heard about the intentions of the Government to make it mandatory for all cars leaving Singapore for Johor to have at least half a tank of petrol, I was at first incredulous. The reasons have already been outlined by my colleagues such as, it seems like an unfriendly act towards our neighbours. It also seems like an intrusion into the privacy of motorists. And thirdly, inconvenience to motorists crossing the Causeway to Johor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as one thinks about the basic objective of this Bill, which is to alleviate the problem of leakage of petrol tax and allow the Government to continue to use the petrol tax to control the usage of cars, there seems to be no better alternative. On second thought, therefore, this law seems to be another one of those creative, novel but nevertheless effective way of resolving our traffic problems which our Government is now known worldwide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the initial reservations I had, and probably most motorists in Singapore have, regarding this policy. Most motorists agree that the move away from high taxation solely on ownership of cars towards more taxation on usage is in the right direction. In principle, therefore, we must accept that a high petrol tax is preferable to higher ARF, road tax or registration fee, as it is a better proxy for usage of our vehicles. Greater usage, however, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> does not necessarily mean greater contribution to congestion on the roads in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of electronic road pricing and other technology that will enable us to tax users based on the congestion they cause, a higher tax on petrol seems to be the next best alternative. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow the use of petrol tax to be effective, the two markets of Singapore and Malaysia must be kept separate. The half-tank measure is one way. A toll at the Causeway seems to be another simpler way. This toll can be adjusted accordingly when the need arises. However, the toll may be more costly to motorists who do not go to Johor Baru with the sole intention of filling up their tanks. And from the feedback I have received so far and the press reports I have read, this seems to be the case, ie, most motorists do not go to JB just to fill up their tanks, except for some people I hear living in Marsiling or Woodlands New Town. If this is the case, then this new law would not be such a deterrence to tourism in Johor. It would also not unduly penalize tourists and businessmen who visit Malaysia for all the other kinds of things she can offer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the intrusion into privacy and further inconvenience to motorists, I am glad to hear from the Minister that only spotchecks would be conducted and this would be done as unobstrusively as possible. And also in case of doubt, the benefit would also be given to the motorists. But what I would like to suggest is that the authorities should also consider allowing motorists the option to pay a fee. The fee can be $5 or $10 or it can be varied as and when changes in the tax is introduced, in the event that some motorists genuinely forget to fill up at least half a tank before leaving for the Causeway, or for those who are in too much of a hurry to do so. To qualify for this payment, motorists must declare this before the spotcheck point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, road congestion in Singapore is caused by all motor vehicles, irrespective of whether they are registered in Singapore or in Malaysia. The measures the Government has introduced so far, however, apply mostly to Singapore cars. I would like to take this opportunity to ask \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Minister how many Malaysian vehicles visit Singapore regularly, whether they contribute significantly to the congestion on our roads, and whether the Government plans to introduce new measures to control their usage in Singapore, especially by Malaysians working in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I realize that this Bill is not going to be a popular one. However, if the Government is receptive to some of the suggestions Members have brought up, there should be minimal inconvenience and misunderstanding between the motorists and the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Sir, what I intend to say has already been covered. So I will be extremely brief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that if one makes an economic choice in the purchase of goods which are not illegal, the consequences must be economic. But in this Bill, we have gone beyond that. We are making it an offence to purchase products, the purchase of which is not illegal, if that purchase is not made where and when the Government dictates. Where I buy my petrol is my business. If I make that choice by buying cheaper petrol outside Singapore, then I must bear the consequences for it, which is, the payment of duty. If I evade that duty, then I must bear the consequences of the evasion, which is, I must pay a fine or go to prison for tax evasion. But to turn into potential offenders everyone who drives out in a motor vehicle but who has no intention to purchase petrol outside Singapore is something which I am concerned with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences are created to deal with behaviour which is socially and morally wrong. At this stage of our development in Singapore, I do not believe that the purchase of petrol in Malaysia can be considered to be morally reprehensible. But if one goes beyond that and evades duty, then it is wrong and there ought to be an offence for that as there is. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I have reservations even on the suggestion that a levy be introduced because it does not distinguish between those who do actually purchase and those who do not. In those circumstances, may I recommend a system which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> may entail some administrative hassle, may I recommend a system of one declaration. That means upon every car leaving Singapore, the person makes a declaration that he either has in his tank less than half or more than half. If he makes a false declaration, it is proper to make that an offence. If he returns with more than half, then he pays a flat rate. If he returns with less than half, there is no need to impose any duty on him. And it is an honest system. You do not have to check every car against every declaration, just one declaration. People driving off will know that there is a possibility that their declarations will be checked against the tank when they come back. And the risks of non-compliance are minimal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage with this system is that only those who leave with less than half a tank and come back with more than half a tank pay a duty, and that duty is a flat rate. I would ask the Minister to consider that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, some Members have expressed concern about the effects of this Bill on our bilateral relations with Malaysia. I would like to address this concern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not about to do something that will affect bilateral relations with Malaysia. Our relations with Malaysia have not been warmer or better now than in the past. People, I think, should give us credit for working out a scheme or a Bill like this to deal with a specific problem, and, at the same time, preserve the relationship that we have established so painstakingly over the last so many years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our problem? Our problem is the car population and how to regulate the usage of cars in Singapore. Today, the differential in petrol price between Singapore and Malaysiamay be 30%. But if and when we use petrol duty as an instrument to regulate car usage, that differential will widen. And as the Singapore Dollar/Malaysian Ringgit exchange rate also widens, that differential will be wider still. Therefore, the price difference of petrol between Singapore and Malaysia will be much wider than what it is now. and if we allow it to continue, it would definitely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> defeat a policy that we want to establish, ie, the control of our car population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our relationship with Malaysia must be seen in a wider context. It is not just narrowly based, and on one issue. Our relationship is much broader based, wider in scope. Singaporeans have had business dealings with their Malaysian counterparts for years. Singaporeans have relatives in Malaysia and there are other forms of contacts. Politicians and Ministers have exchanged visits also over the last few years. Sensitive to the fact that a Bill like this may be misunderstood by the Malaysians, whether the leadership in the government or the people, during the last few months when there were Ministerial visits between Malaysian Ministers coming to Singapore or Singapore Ministers going to Malaysia, we have taken the opportunity to explain our intent, so that when we introduce a Bill like this in Parliament, it will not be misunderstood. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Encik Ghaffar Baba, came here with his colleague, the Housing and Local Government Minister, Mr Ng Cheng Kiat, our First Deputy Prime Minister took the opportunity to explain to both of them why and when we are introducing this Bill. The First Deputy Prime Minister also explained the intent of the Bill to the Mentri Besar of Johor because Johor will be the most affected state when this Bill is introduced. When Minister Rafidah came to Singapore a couple of months ago on a visit programme, she met the Minister for Trade and Industry, BG Lee. On that occasion, the Minister for Trade and Industry also explained our purpose of introducing this Bill. When the Education Minister, Encik Anwar Ibrahim, came, the purpose of introducing the Bill was also explained. When there was a comment heard by our High Commissioner from the Defence Minister in Kuala Lumpur, our High Commissioner also took pains to explain to the Minister why we are introducing a Bill like this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are fully aware of the effect on bilateral relations this Bill will have between Singapore and Malaysia. Therefore, we are not so stupid as to do something to hurt this relationship that we have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> built up. All these Malaysia Ministers have expressed an understanding as to why we are doing this. They understand. They also understand that every government has a right to introduce laws to deal with the specific problems of the country. We have done so in this particular Bill to deal with a problem, and that problem will continue to grow in time if we do nothing about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relationship will continue to grow with Malaysia because we continue to encourage our businessmen to invest in Malaysia. We have joint projects to develop the tourism potential in Johor. And we have also improved our links with many of the Malaysian leaders. So let me assure this House that this Bill will not affect the bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for disposing of some of the questions which have been raised on the impact of this Bill on our bilateral relations with Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there were 14 speakers. Obviously, this is a subject of great emotional interest. I therefore propose to take a little more time on it than I would normally do because of the large diversity of subjects which have been raised. But before doing so, I will dispose of one main misapprehension which has been raised by Dr Lee and several other Members here. This is that this half-tank regulation - I think that is going to be a common name now - will in fact result in restriction of the trade and is against the rules of free trade which we ourselves support. This is totally untrue and I will explain why. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically every country in the world levies substantial excise taxes on products like petrol, tobacco and liquor, for reasons either to control its usage or in most other cases for revenue collection. Therefore, practically all countries in the world restrict the duty free import of these products. I think everybody knows that. In the case of liquor and tobacco there is a limitation on how much you can bring in duty free into every country in the world. I think it is 200 sticks of cigarettes and one bottle of hard liquor or the equivalent. And \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that applies equally to the case of Singapore for imports of these goods from countries other than West Malaysia. In the case of West Malaysia, duty free imports of these goods are totally disallowed by mutual agreement with the Malaysian Government because of the large numbers of people who move between Singapore and West Malaysia daily, by car and by plane. Neither country can afford the massive duty loss which will result if there were even a token allowance of duty free imports of these products. Therefore, this practice of restricting duty free imports of these specific three classes of products is universally practised and in no way represents restriction of free trade or choice. No one has the right to buy tobacco from the United States because it happens to be very cheap there and import it freely into Singapore? What is the difference between that and petrol? So this red herring should be totally disposed of right from the outset. In the case of Singapore, other than these three products, we do not levy import duties or excise taxes on, practically anything else, which is not the case for most other countries in the world, including Malaysia. And we do not object because every country has a right to impose excise taxes for its own internal reasons and these have to be respected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the individual remarks. Mr Chandra Das was concerned about relations with Johor but this has been adequately answered. He has asked: why should we not impose a three-quarter or full tank requirement. That seems more logical. Why half-tank? The reason is a practical one. The fuel gauge is not a very accurate instrument, except in the middle. Therefore, a three-quarter tank rule would be very difficult to implement because the three quarter point mark is either missing altogether or very near the full mark. Why not a full tank? I have explained earlier in my speech that a full tank rule will require topping up or using a dipstick because there is no way you can tell from the reading of the meter whether it is full because between three-quarters and full the meter reading is almost the same. So the half-tank rule was chosen for practical reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked whether we are not being petty? Is the revenue loss serious? I have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> said at the outset that the reason for the Bill is not revenue. Revenue is important but not the primary reason. The primary reason is to allow Government to control car usage through petrol pricing and we cannot allow motorists to avoid this by merely nipping across to Johor. I think the Malaysian Government recognizes this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the question of revenue, our estimate is a revenue loss of $2 million a month and I will explain this because it answers Dr Hong Hai's question: how do you arrive at this figure? Is it a reasonable figure? Or is it perhaps exaggerated? The estimate is based on actual Customs checks on Singapore registered cars crossing the Causeway over extended periods. The Customs does this regularly to monitor the position. I have explained in my speech that the current level of car crossings is about 6,000 per day, peaking at over 10,000 to 15,000 on holidays. We can assume that the typical car which crosses the Causeway is of 1.6 litre engine capacity (which is the average car in Singapore) with a fuel tank capacity of 52 litres. I think the average Singaporean is a logical person, if he is going to be there anyway, why not buy. This is perfectly legitimate. So if we assume that, he buys 40 litres and about half the people who cross over would buy, ie, 3,000 a day. 3,000 times 40 litres times a duty of 50 Singapore cents per litre times 30.5 days, which is the average month, comes out to about $1.8 million. Round it up, about $2 million. So that is how the figure is derived. So it is neither a hypothetical nor an exaggerated figure. It is not unreasonable to assume that half of the cars which cross the Causeway do buy petrol, because any sensible Singaporean who happens to be going there for whatever reason, would arrange to buy some petrol and not to do so would seem to be quite insensible. So I think the assumption is not invalid. About 50% would buy about 40 litres each. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the sum significant? Well, everything is relative. $2 million a month is roughly the tax which we would collect if we increased the PUB bill tax by 15%, or is also equivalent to the tax we would collect if we increase Telecoms bills by 15%. I leave it to you to decide which is preferable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered most of the questions put by Dr Hong Hai. He was supportive in other areas but he was more concerned about the grouses which he has picked up. Indeed there are many grouses which I have picked up myself from my talks with my community leaders. These are fairly common. I think they are grouses which arise partly because we have not been able to fully explain the application of these regulations. The reason for this has been explained, but Dr Hong Hai has suggested that it may be helpful if we spend some time now to explain to Singapore motorists why we are introducing these rules so that they may be more willing to accept the regulations. I am suggesting that the best way to convince the motorist is for him to actually experience this at the Causeway. He will find that it is not inconvenient at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that if the regulation works effectively, there should be no concern whatsoever. In fact, the regulation need not be applied at all. Why do I say this? Because all that it involves is for anyone who wants to go to Johor Baru merely to glance at his petrol meter occasionally. If it is less than full, top up along the way, pick up one or two gallons; it is petrol that he is going to use anyway. So what is the inconvenience? Once he has done that, the regulation does not exist any more. So what is the problem? I really do not understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Dr Lee Siew-Choh now. I am afraid his performance is pretty typical of him, except he was smiling most of the time. So I have to assume that he really meant it tongue-in-cheek because what he said was totally absurd. He is the one who is irrational, schizophrenic, absurd, illogical and so forth. I can only presume he made all these statements because he was not listening to my speech and it appears to me he was reading from a set piece which he had written before my speech. Therefore, he was in no position to react to what I said because most of what I said directly contradicted everything he was charging the Government with. He even mentioned the fact that the duty loss somehow works out to be $1 million a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> month from the $2 million we have announced previously. I am not quite sure how he manages this division of 2, but that is typical of the Opposition's handling of statistics, don't you think? He has attacked the Government on principles of free market flow of goods, protectionism, and so forth. I have already explained this. I shall not go into it again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked whether this might not trigger retaliation by the Malaysian Government. My colleague has already explained this but I will elaborate slightly on this. I do not expect any retaliation because the Malaysian Government has been enforcing rules on the import of dutiable goods all along. We have never retaliated because it is their perfect right. I will give you an example. A few years ago, smart Malaysians were coming down to Singapore to buy tyres because Singapore tyres were very much cheaper than Malaysian tyres. They came down in cars fitted with the oldest tyres they had and switched to a set of brand new tyres and brought them back to Malaysia tax free. This soon came to the attention of the Malaysian Government. Thereafter, tyres on cars returning to Malaysia were inspected visually. If they looked new they were deemed new and were taxed as if they were new. This was a perfectly legitimate reaction on the part of the Malaysian Government to stop a duty leadage. We never complained. Why should we? Furthermore, the Malaysian Government imposes import duties on goods bought in Singapore by their citizens who visit Singapore and return to Malaysia. This is applied universally against all products which are dutiable. Again, it is a perfectly legitimate operation. We have no objections and it has not created any problems. So I think this measure we are introducing now ought not to excite the Malaysians who should understand. They have a larger problem in that they have many more dutiable goods than we have. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Yiok Seng has been supportive. He has suggested, however, that the regulations should be applied with discretion so as not to annoy our motorists. I entirely agree and the Customs officers have been told to act as inconspicuously as possible. Very few Customs officers will probably be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> deployed because we do not want to spend a lot of money policing this Bill. The Bill, a relatively high fine as a deterrent. We are hoping that no motorist need be caught at all. The intent of the Bill is for motorists to observe an honour system similar to the green lane at airports where if you have nothing to declare you merely drive through. I think it is no inconvenience at all because, if motorists have no intention of buying petrol in Johor, what is the harm in topping up beyond half a tank? If all Singaporean motorists enter into the spirit of the regulation, there should be no problem whatsoever. We might even be able to withdraw the Customs officials eventually! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the suggestion by some Members for an alternative system whereby motorists declare their tank contents before they leave and declare again when they return. The objection to this proposal, which may be legally more logical than the method we are proposing is that it is likely to cause more problems in practice. I would emphasize, that the method of regulation proposed was chosen for practical reasons because it is likely to cause the least inconvenience to motorists. The reason why a declaration is difficult difficult is because it involves two operations. You have to fill in a form, hand it over. When you come back we have to check you. How do you check to ensure that the form is correct? You will have to dip the tank. And you cannot dip it effectively. In fact, you have to drain the tank in order to establish the quantity, otherwise the Customs officers will be forced to accept the declaration on face value with no means of checking. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Fuel gauge. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Fuel gauge, no. I said earlier that fuel gauge is not accurate enough and therefore there will be endless disputes on the quantity of we are talking about. The problem, I assure Members, has been thoroughly argued within Cabinet. We accept that it is not a perfect system and we would like to suggest that Singapore motorists should accept the Bill in the spirit in which it is intended and allow it to work and see how effective it is. If it does \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not work, we will be forced to introduce other more stringent and more painful measures in order to ensure that the use of petrol pricing as a method of controlling car usage is not bypassed. I would therefore ask Singapore motorists to allow this rather painless procedure to work, in which case, we need not do anything more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh and Mr Shanmugam have raised questions on the legal implications of the bill. Whilst I recognize their concern I have explained that the bill was drafted to provide a practical solution to a difficult problem. I believe I have covered the majority of points raised by Members except there was a final question on how many Malaysian cars visit Singapore. I do not have the exact figures but my recollection is that more Malaysian cars cross the Causeway into Singapore than the other way round. They are here mainly on business, holiday and so forth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would urge, all Singaporeans to accept the Bill in its spirit, check their meters before they cross the Causeway and there should be no need to apply any of the sanctions as there would be no offences. For the benefit of Mr shanmugam and Mr Davinder singh, I would say that it is not an offence if you do not commit the offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 7, to leave out \"with less\" and insert \"without more\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment is to make it clear that the amount of petrol a vehicle must carry should be more than half the contents of its fuel tank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, after line 12, to insert - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(a) where a motor vehicle is driven past the Customs gantry before the departure bay of the Immigration Checkpoint at Woodlands, the person in charge of that motor vehicle shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have attempted to leave Singapore in that motor vehicle;\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain the reason for this amendment? The amendment is to assist in the enforcement of the new law and to remove any possibility of any argument as to when a person has attempted to leave Singapore without more than a half tank of petrol. It will also be useful to motorists who will be able to know exactly at what point the law will be enforced against him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> Consequential amendments to be made to the marginal note and to re-letter paragraphs (a) and (b) as paragraphs (b) and (c) respectively.

This Bill, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is meant to enhance the effectiveness of the former Bill. The House has already just passed a moment ago the Customs (Amendment) Bill requiring drivers of motor vehicles leaving Singapore to have more than half a tankful of petrol. Let me go into the details of the present Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Act to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> empower the Minister to make rules on the use and proper maintenance of fuel-measuring equipment in motor vehicles. The objective is to ensure that fuel gauges are kept in proper working condition at all times, providing a true reading of the quantity of petrol in the fuel tank of the vehicle. Anyone using a vehicle with a faulty fuel gauge shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 makes it an offence to alter any fuel-measuring equipment of any motor vehicle for the purpose of preventing it from registering the true indication of the amount of petrol in the vehicle's fuel tank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also seeks to create a rebuttable presumption that the person using or owning a motor vehicle with artificial or mechanical means that alter the fuel gauge has abetted in the altering of the fuel gauge. Any person who alters or abets in the alteration of the meter shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to an imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two Bills, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill together with the Customs (Amendment) Bill, will help us contain the problem of evasion of duty on petrol and will enable petrol duty to be used as one of the restraint measures on the usage of cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to respond to a point raised earlier by the Chairman of the GPC for Communications and Information, where he has made the plea for officials, both Customs officials as well as the ROV officials, to be flexible and not create undue inconvenience to motorists. That is the intention of these two Bills, to make it as easy and as convenient for the motorists as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Yeo Ning Hong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STATUTORY CORPORATIONS (CONTRIBUTIONS TO</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>CONSOLIDATED FUND) BILL</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Second Reading. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Finance (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1987 Budget Statement, the Finance Minister announced Government's intention to require statutory boards to transfer accumulated funds which are in excess of their future development needs to the Consolidated Fund. In addition, statutory boards would be required to make annual contributions from their operating surpluses to Government revenue. These arrangements would ensure that statutory baords have adequate but not excessive funds to finance their operations and development plans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $1.5 billion was accordingly transferred to the Consolidated Fund in FY87 from the accumulated reserves of the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the Port of Singapore Authority, the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. A further $311 million is expected to be credited to the Consolidated Fund in FY88 and this amount is pegged at 20% of the operating surpluses achieved by 12 self-funded statutory boards in FY87. In FY89, self-funded statutory boards are expected to contribute $380 million to Government revenue based on their projected FY88 surpluses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions by statutory boards to the Consolidated Fund have so far been made administratively. As such contributions are significant in magnitude and would be a permanent source of Government revenue, it is necessary that legislation be introduced vesting in the Minister for Finance authority to require statutory boards to make contributions from time to time to Government revenue. The Statutory Corporations (Contributions to Consolidated Fund) Bill, 1989 seeks to do this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(1)(a) of the Bill authorizes the Minister for Finance to require any speci- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fied statutory board to pay into the Consolidated Fund the whole or part of the surplus of that statutory board in any financial year. This clause effectively provides a means of \" taxing\" the surpluses of statutory boards without formally invoking the normal income tax machinery. There is no advantage in using income tax procedures as this would be more time-consuming and costly as statutory boards would then have to prepare a separate set of accounts for tax purposes. However, as and when part or the whole of the operations of any statutory board is privatized or hived off into a company, then such a company would be subject to normal taxation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(1)(b) of the Bill authorizes the Minister for Finance to require any specified statutory board to pay into Government revenue the whole or part of the accumulated funds or reserves of surpluses of that statutory board which, in the Minister for Finance's opinion, is not required by the board for performing its functions and duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the amount of funds or reserves available for transfer to Government revenue, \"trust\" monies received by the Board are specifically excluded. This is stipulated in the definition of \"funds\" and \"revenue\" in clause 2 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(2) regularizes all past contributions by statutory boards to the Consolidated Fund as having been made in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory boards covered by the provisions of the Bill are specified in the Schedule to the Bill. All self-funded statutory boards other than the Central Provident Fund Board, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore and the Singapore Totalisator Board are subject to the provisions of this Bill. The CPF Board is excluded as its receipts are largely trust monies belonging to account holders. As for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Currency Board and the Totalisator Board, existing legislation and administrative arrangements already allow for the transfer of their surplus funds to Government revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill authorizes the Minister for Finance to amend the Schedule to the Bill from time to time through orders published in the Gazette. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a technical Bill and my explanation is necessarily a little lengthy. So I beg Members' indulgence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Companies Act was last amended in 1987. Representations made to the Select Committee on the 1987 Bill highlighted the need for a thorough review of the prospectus requirements of the Act to serve the twin objectives of clarifying the law in this area and of liberalizing the requirements to promote the development of Singapore's securities markets. The greater part of the Bill is devoted to these objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains a number of amendments aimed at strengthening the statutory means to prevent and detect company fraud, particularly with respect to public companies. These are aimed at reducing the risk of another Pan-Electric type failure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous amendments aimed at improving or clarifying existing provisions in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly dwell on the main provisions in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 24 are aimed at clarifying and liberalizing the prospectus requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospectus requirements have been in the Companies Act since it was introduced in 1967 and no changes of substance have been made to them since then. With the rapid developments that have taken place in the securities markets worldwide, there is a need for Singapore to keep abreast with these developments to ensure that our bond and equity markets remain accessible, effective, efficient and competitive. It is against this backdrop that the amendments to the prospectus requirements should be viewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general policy thrust behind these amendments is to liberalize the prospectus requirements for the issue of shares and debentures where this can be done without compromising investor protection. The underlying objective, as I have said, is to foster the development of the bond and equity markets, both with regard to domestic and international issues, and thereby to enhance Singapore's position as a financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendments in this respect are clause 3 and clause 10. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes it clear that a prospectus is not required in the case of an offer to the public of existing shares or debentures which are of a class of shares or debentures already listed on an approved stock exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 is a major amendment with regard to prospectus requirements. The amendment introduces a new Division 5A to Part IV of the Act. This new Division provides for an exemption from the prospectus requirements under certain specific circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conceptual underpinnings of new Division 5A are not new. The existing Act under section 4(6) has always recognized that for certain types of public offers, full prospectus protection is not warranted, as for example, in an offer made to brokers, or in a \"rights issue\" offer. This has facilitated transactions by issuers for these limited categories of investors. New Division 5A can be viewed as an extension of this theme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, new Division 5A provides for public offers to be exempt from the prospectus requirements under the following circumstances: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers made by a company to its employees under an employee share investment scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers made to banks, insurance companies, the Government, statutory boards, licensed investment advisers, pension funds, unit trusts, closed-end investment companies and other bodies declared by the Minister to be exempt investors. These categories of investors, which are mainly institutions, are presumed, by reason of their business activities and resources, to be capable of evaluating as well as demanding information from an issuer equivalent to a prospectus. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers made to non-professional but sophisticated investors who by reason of their income, wealth or relationship to the issuer are presumed to be sufficiently sophisticated not to warrant prospectus protection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers of new shares or debentures where the shares or debentures are of a class that are already listed on an approved stock exchange and the offer is to be made through the facilities of the stock exchange. As these are new issues, the offer would nevertheless have to be accompanied by a Statement of Material Facts, a disclosure statement providing relevant basic information about the issue but which is less onerous to prepare compared to a prospectus. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers of debentures made by a body incorporated outside Singapore, and where the offer is made to various pre-specified institutional, professional and business investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers of debentures made by or guaranteed by the Government or an international financial institution of which Singapore is a member, such as the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Division 5A also confers power on the Minister to grant dispensation of a prospectus in circumstances either where the cost of providing a prospectus outweighs the resulting protection to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> investors or where it would not be prejudicial to the public interest if a prospectus was dispensed with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is always a risk that some of these exemptions may be used as a conduit to avoid the prospectus requirements, the new Division 5A also provides in the proposed subsections 106E, I, J, K and L various regulatory safeguards designed to check possible abuse and to ensure public availability of pertinent information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Division 5A is not the only part of the Bill aimed at facilitating debenture and share issues. Clause 4, for example, extends the nonmenclature permitted of debentures to allow for greater flexibility in marketing them internationally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, public offers which cannot gain an exemption from the prospectus requirement under the exemptive provisions mentioned above will continue to be subject to the prospectus requirement. Even so, there is a weakness in the Companies Act in that there are presently no provisions in the Companies Act for the Registrar to refuse registration of a prospectus in circumstances where the issuer or the issue is of doubtful integrity. It is intended to change this in the interests of the man-in-the-street investor. Clause 6 accordingly amends section 50 to extend the grounds on which the Registrar can refuse registration of a prospectus, the object I repeat, being to shield unsophisticated, small-time investors from issues or issuers of doubtful repute or quality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20, 21 and 22 attack the problem of the detection and prevention of company fraud in a three-fold manner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 provides for the mandatory establishment of a system of internal accounting controls in public companies to ensure that their assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly authorized and recorded so as to permit the preparation of true and fair accounts. This is based on a recommendation from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants, formerly known as the Singapore Society of Accountants or SSA. As this is not a particularly onerous requirement, the proposal is to extend it to all public companies of which there are approximately \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 700 out of a total of 58,000 locally-incorporated companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 amends the Act by inserting a new section 201B. This section obliges every Singapore-incorporated listed public company to have an audit committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, audit committees are internationally recognized as being one of the most effective influences minimizing fraudulent financial reporting. In the UK many public companies, both listed and unlisted, have voluntarily appointed audit committees. Proposals have also been made for legislation to make it mandatory for public companies to have audit committees. Although not mandatory in the US, it is nevertheless a requirement of the New York Stock Exchange that any company listed thereon must have an audit committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of an audit committee is essentially threefold: first, to watch over management to ensure that there is no management override of established prudential financial practices and procedures; second, to assist the board of directors in discharging their responsibilities for financial reporting and third, to provide an impartial channel for complaints concerning the management and direction of a company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendment, an audit committee shall consist of at least three members, the majority of whom must be independent directors of the company. One of these independent members will be the chairman of the committee. Subsection (5) lays down the functions of an audit committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Institute of Certified Public Accountants had recommended that audit committees be made mandatory for all public companies, it is intended that this requirement be confined to the listed public companies for the time being, for three reasons. Firstly, there is a dearth of people in Singapore with the standing and qualification to competently discharge the duties and responsibilities imposed upon audit committees. Second, the cost factor. Because non-executive directors sit- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ting on audit committees will expect to be adequately remunerated for their efforts and responsibilities. Third, the need for audit committees to act as watchdog over full-time management and executive directors is greatest in the listed public companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are presently 342 listed public corporations in Singapore. Of these, only the 148 incorporated in Singapore will be required to have audit committees. These companies will be given a grace period of 12 months from the time the legislation comes into force to set up their audit committees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 places a responsibility on the auditor to report corporate fraud. New subsection (9A) makes it mandatory for the external auditor to report to the Minister where he has reason to believe that an offence involving fraud or dishonesty is being or has been committed. Although there are some who view this as a compromise of a fundamental principle of company law whereby auditors are appointed by shareholders in general meeting and therefore owe allegiance only to shareholders, it is in the overriding public interest that such a provision be made. I would like to assure the House, however, that this provision is not intended to alter the role of auditor from that of watchdog to one of bloodhound. Instead, the provision is intended to allow the auditor a lawful basis to report fraud to the authority without fear that he may in the process be contravening any duty owing to shareholders. New subsection (9B) gives this protection to the auditor. This statutory duty on an auditor to mandatorily report fraud to the authorities is not without precedent in our legal system as the Banking Act, the Finance Companies Act, the Insurance Act and the Securities Industry Act all impose this duty of reporting fraud to the appropriate authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other clauses in the Bill which are aimed at improving or clarifying certain sections of the law. Together with the amendments which are of a drafting nature or consequential to the principal amendments described above, they are sufficiently referred to in the explanatory \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> statement. The only other provisions in the Bill worthy of special mention at this late hour are clauses 14 and 25. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 149 which provides for the disqualification of unfit directors of insolvent companies. The amendment makes it clear that persons automatically disqualified under the old section 149 can apply for leave of court to continue acting as director. The amendment is a transitional one intended to preserve, under the new section 149, a right that existed under the repealed section 149. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 25 inserts a new section 409B. This provision confers upon officers of the Commercial Affairs Department police powers to investigate offences under the Companies Act and the Securities Industry Act, as well as offences under any other written law disclosed in the course of investigations under these Acts. Police powers of arrest, seizure and so on are essential to the efficient and effective working of CAD officers, who have hitherto relied on police officers seconded from the Police Force for these powers. In the exercise of these powers, CAD officers would be subject to the control and direction of the Public Prosecutor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the technical nature of the Bill and its implications for the legal and financial communities, I recommend to the House that the Bill be committed to a Select Committee for further debate and to hear representations from the professions and the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Sir, I shall be brief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the proposal to make the formation of audit committees, particularly in listed companies, mandatory. I think it is a step towards specialization in a board room. It permits closer examination and analysis of financial reporting areas by a few board members. It will also enhance public confidence in the credibility and objectivity of financial information released to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three observations to make and if the observations are too detailed and technical, the Minister of State may wish to refer them to the Select Committee. The first observation relates to the function of the audit committee. The Bill empowers the audit committee to nominate an auditor for the company. I wish to ask the Minister of State if the powers conferred on the committee include the fixing of audit fees. In other words, since the audit committee is in a position to decide who is the best auditor for the company, should not the committee be thrust to decide on the fees to pay to this auditor? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation concerns the procedure regarding convening of meetings of this audit committee. The Bill is silent on the number of meetings the committee should have per year. In order to ensure proper functioning of the committee, I think there should be a minimum of two meetings a year of this audit committee. One is to discuss the six month interim results, and the other to consider the final and annual accounts. Should not the Bill also stipulate the minimum number of meetings the audit committee must have per year? This is necessary in order to avoid a situation where companies may form audit committees just to comply with the Act, but no meetings actually take place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third observation relates to section 207 (9), clause 22 of the Bill. This section requires that the auditor in the course of his or her performance reports fraud or other dishonesty committed by officers and employees of the company to the Minister. My concern here is the extent of dishonesty that the Minister wants the Auditor to report. Surely the Minister does not want to be bothered with reports of petty dishonest acts by employees of the company, eg, an employee making false claims on transport or entertainment. I think the report to the Minister on dishonesty should be confined to serious dishonest acts by officers of publicly listed companies, especially those matters that pertain to misrepresentation of accounts to deceive the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister care to comment on these observations? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I propose to take the Member's points in the Select Committee. Firstly, because it is rather late in the day. But that is not the principal reason. More importantly, I think these are issues which are best discussed with members of the professions and with representatives from the business community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Companies (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.54 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund Act to enable the Central Provident Fund Board to establish and run the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme (DPIS). The Scheme will insure active CPF members against the risk of permanent incapacity or premature death before the age of 55. They will be insured for a sum of $30,000 which is equivalent to about three years' wages for the average worker. The scheme is optional. Those CPF members who do not wish to be insured under the scheme are free to opt out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premiums will be deducted yearly from the Ordinary and/or Special Accounts of the insured member. I will now ask the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Clerk of Parliament to circulate an Annex (Cols. 111 - 112) showing the annual premium for different age groups. The annual premium will be $30 for a member below 35 years old. It will increase in four steps with age as mortality risk rises with age. For the oldest age group of 50-54, the premium will be $190. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890407/19890407-HA-0540111.htm\">Annex (Cols. 111 - 112)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the key provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to create a new Part IVA in the principal Act consisting of 12 sections, sections 37A to 37L, to provide for the main features of the Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37B authorizes the CPF Board to establish the DPIS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37C provides for all new CPF members and all existing active CPF members (ie, those for whom a CPF contribution has been made in the six months prior to the commencement date of the scheme) to be automatically covered under the DPIS if they are citizens or permanent residents. Unless they opt out, they will be covered up to the age of 55 years. Those who opt out may subsequently apply to rejoin the scheme subject to conditions to be imposed. Members who are not automatically covered may also apply to join the Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37D gives the Board the power to cancel the insurance cover of those who are already permanently incapacitated or suffering from terminal illness before joining the Scheme. Any premium paid will be refunded to their CPF accounts with interest if they have not made any false or misleading statements to the Board. This is to safeguard the interest of the vast majority of healthy CPF members. Otherwise, the DPIS will become a huge charity scheme at their expense. The DPIS is meant to insure CPF members against the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> risk of being afflicted with permanent incapacity or premature death in future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further safeguard, section 37E requires those members who join the DPIS after its inception to sign a health declaration, and if necessary, to undergo a medical examination. However, for practical reasons, existing active CPF members will not have to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37F provides for the annual premium payable to be prescribed under regulations and to be deducted from the member's Ordinary and/or Special accounts. Those who have insufficient balances in their accounts to pay the full premium will be given pro-rated cover, unless they pay the balance in cash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37G provides for the establishment of a Dependants' Protection Insurance Fund into which all premiums will be paid and out of which the insurance benefits will be met. It is intended that the DPIS will be run at cost. The premium rates and the operation of DPIS will be reviewed periodically and any surplus above a minimum level will be distributed to participants of the Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 37I provides that if an insured member stops contributing to CPF, he will continue to be covered for three years after his last contribution provided he pays his premium. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the death of the insured member, the insured sum will be paid to his nominees. For those who die without any nomination, the laws of intestacy will apply. For permanent incapacity cases, the insured sum will be paid by monthly instalments over a period not exceeding three years. This is to ensure that the incapacity is genuine and permanent. The instalments will stop if the insured member recovers from the incapacity and is able to return to work. These provisions are contained in section 37J. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as commonly found in other insurance cover, the DPIS will not cover claims arising from war or warlike operations and from persons who participate in a riot. This is provided in subsection (4)(d) of section 37J. There are, however, no such provisions under the Home Protection Insurance Scheme (HPIS). My Ministry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> has decided that similar provisions should also be made in the HPIS. Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme is wholly laudable and deserves the full support of Members of this House. We are aware that many workers are still not insured and if a CPF member should unfortunately be permanently incapacitated or pass away, then his dependants may suffer financial hardship. This is particularly so for the lower income workers because this is the group of workers who are most likely not to have taken up insurance cover for themselves and for their families. So we should thank the Minister for moving this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few technical questions I would like to ask the Minister. First of all, why is the cut-off at age 55 years? Perhaps the Minister wishes to reinforce the point that the withdrawal age of CPF remains at 55 and therefore it is a convenient point to draw the cut-off age. However, we are encouraging the raising of the retirement age to 60 and beyond if it is possible. So there is a case for the cut-off age to be raised at least to 60 years. We should also take into account the fact that many Singaporeans marry late and have their children late. So when they reach the age of 55 years their children may still be in secondary school or may be in a tertiary institution. So if they should be permanently incapacitated or should pass away, then the dependants are doubly hard hit. So would the Minister consider raising the age of this scheme to 60 years, if not now, perhaps after review at a future date? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether the CPF members will be notified when they are covered by this DPIS. I think it is important for the beneficiaries to know that there is this cover so that they can claim from this scheme if they are aware that they are entitled to claim. Will it cover all the permanent residents, because we know that there are different types of permanent residents, and some of them do not carry the blue Singapore identity \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> card. How many CPF members will benefit from this scheme as of this moment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister why does the scheme continue to cover the CPF member for three years after he has stopped contributing to this scheme or to the CPF because this is a departure from the normal insurance practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, in fact, offers protection to the dependants of families from becoming destitute. Ultimately it is a form of social security through contribution by members. My concern is basically the large number of self-employed workers who may not be CPF members. I would like to know firstly, what steps will be taken to ensure that this group of self-employed workers are protected, and,secondly, whether the premiums will be the same for those self-employed workers who want to join the DPIS scheme. Thirdly, whether the Ministry will be taking various other steps to encourage particularly those lower income workers who are not CPF members to participate in the scheme? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise merely to add my small voice from the Opposition in support of this Bill, and I also congratulate the Minister for having proposed this Bill because it will help people who may become very dependent when the time comes. But my only concern is that although he says that the scheme will operating at cost, nevertheless the premium could be a bit high for certain people. I think the Minister should find ways to reduce some of the premiums if CPF members complain that the premium is a too high. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken in support of the Bill. In particular I note that Dr Lee has also supported the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to answer the various questions raised briefly, starting with the questions raised by Mr Lim Boon Heng. He asked why the scheme stops at age 55. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, most \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> CPF members will have sufficient savings and also homes fully paid for at age 55. So there is less need for them to have an insurance scheme of this kind at the late stage in their lives. The other reason is that premiums for older members, those above 55, will be more expensive. It will be higher than the $190 per year for those between 50 and 55. So since members can withdraw their CPF at 55, they may wish to decide for themselves whether they wish to use the money for insurance or for other purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we may consider raising this to age 60 in future, I suppose the door is not closed but we will have to review this periodically. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether we will notify CPF members when they are covered by the scheme. The answer is yes. When the scheme comes into operation within a month or so, CPF Board will be sending out letters to all those active members who are covered under the scheme. Together with the letter will be an option form in case some members wish to opt out of the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for permanent residents, the intention is to cover all the permanent residents. However, there are some permanent residents who do not have blue Singapore identity cards and we may not be able to trace them in the CPF record. So if these people do not receive the notification letters and wish to be covered, they should inform the Board and apply to come in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question concerns the number who will benefit from this scheme. The number is about one million active members who will enjoy the protection against the risk of premature death or permanent incapacity. Of course, nobody wishes to come across or to meet with these calamities. But every year perhaps 1,000-2,000 members may suffer from these calamities and they will be able to draw upon the sums insured. The scheme will be most beneficial to the young widows who have relatively low savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question: why does the scheme continue to cover for three years after the member has stopped contributing CPF? Members stop contributing after \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they drop out of the job market or it could be that they have become seriously ill and too ill to work. So the thinking is that it will be unfair to stop the insurance cover just when they most need the cover. That is the reason for this feature. But if there are members who feel they do not want to have the insurance, they can inform the Board and they can opt out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the questions from Dr Vasoo, he is mainly concerned with the self-employed workers. The intention of my Ministry is to try and bring as many of these people as possible under the CPF umbrella. So we are working on these measures. But we will allow those self-employed who want to join the scheme to come in and do so at probably the same premium rates. But we may have to require that they have a health declaration or go for a medical check up because obviously we do not want to end up with all the bad cases coming to us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is from the Non-Constitutency Member. He supports the Bill but expressed some concern about the premiums. The premiums are very low. We have tried to keep them as low as possible. For 60% of the members who are below 35 years old, they need only pay $30 per year or about $2.50 per month from their CPF. So it is really very small. For the older members the premium is higher because the risk of death increases with age. We have done it this way by different age groups to reduce the extent of cross - subsidy between the different groups. But the intention, as I have said, is to operate the scheme at cost. So if, say, after two years of operations we find that the premiums are too high, we will refund the money back to the members. They can be assured that this is the cheapest possible form of insurance that can be offered because the CPF has a machinery already in place and they can just check off all these amounts from the computer records. There is no cost involved in selling the insurance as in the case of private insurance. So it is only possible for the CPF Board to operate the scheme in this manner at cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES (RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>6.12 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year my Ministry proposed an overseas investment incentive to encourage local companies to invest abroad to gain access to technology as well as overseas markets. This incentive is basically an extension of the Venture Capital Incentive which was announced in the 1986 Budget Statement. It will now cover all types of overseas investments that yield market, technology and/or economic benefits, besides investments in new technology. It was approved by the Ministry of Finance and announced in the \n  <br>\n  <br>1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incentive allows a company to deduct up to the full amount of investment, any loss arising from the sale of shares in an approved overseas investment project. The major provisions are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It will be available to any local resident company that invests in an approved overseas project which would (i) provide access to technologies and/or overseas markets; and/or (ii) promote or enhance the technological or economic development of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Within a period of eight years from the date of approval, any loss arising from the sale of shares or liquidation of the approved overseas project can be offset against the company's other income; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Relief would be given on the difference between the purchase of the shares and the fair market value of the shares at the time of sale or, in the case of liquidation, the purchase price and the proceeds from liquidation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend Part XIIIA of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act on \"Venture Capital Incentives\" to implement the incentive.
