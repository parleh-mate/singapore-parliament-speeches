Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will report to the House on the discussions he has had with the British and United States governments on matters concerning and touching Singapore on his recent visits to the United Kingdom and the United States of America. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's bilateral relations with both Britain and the United States are excellent and there were no bilateral political or economic issues that were contentious or required detailed discussion. Both visits were opportunities to renew contacts at the highest levels of the British and American governments, to strengthen existing ties, and to exchange views on issues of mutual concern. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of the American economy was a major subject. The prolonged recession in the United States is being increasingly felt in Singapore and I registered our concern. The leaders in Washington want to tackle the problem at its roots, which is to cut down social security spending under the \"entitlements\" programme, which are indexed or linked to the consumer price index. However, my impression, gathered from talking to several leading members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, was that in an election year, the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Congress could not contemplate legislating such welfare cuts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Reagan's top aides were confident that there would be an economic recovery later in the year, and that social spending cuts would become possible after the mid-term Congressional elections. I was particularly encouraged by Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge's commitment to free trade and of his stand against protectionism. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought abreast American and British leaders on developments in South-east Asia, in particular, the dangers arising from Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. I explained the circumstances which finally led to the successful formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to combine all patriotic Cambodians to oppose Vietnamese occupation. American and British leaders were aware of the implications for ASEAN of Vietnam's continuing occupation of Cambodia. Both governments will continue to support ASEAN's efforts to find a political solution by a Vietnamese withdrawal and the holding of a UN supervised elections under the terms of the UN resolution at the International Conference on Kampuchea (ICK) in July 1981, to allow the Cambodian people to freely elect their own government. I was also reassured by America's commitment to Thailand's security and America's obligations to Thailand under the Manila Pact. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the other reportable items of my discussions with individual leaders have already been reported immediately after the meetings, by the news agencies and by several Singapore newsmen who accompanied me. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PREMATURE SCHOOL LEAVERS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Raising of literacy and basic skills)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (a) the number and percentage of persons by any convenient age groups between 6 and 14 years of age who are now not in schools or in any other educa- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tional institutions; and (b) whether there is any firm plan by the Ministry of Education and the Vocational and Industrial Training Board to introduce compulsory education or to require all premature school leavers to undergo some form of vocational-technical or work-related training, to ensure that entrants into the workforce have got a minimum level of literacy or basic skills to cope with a more advanced technological work environment in the 1980's. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Minister of State of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister of State of Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the first Part of the Member's question, I provide a Table (Cols. 199 - 200) obtained from the Department of Statistics from the Population Census of 1980. I would like to ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute this Table to Members of the House. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820831/19820831-HA-0420199.htm\">Table - Non-Schooling Population (Cols. 199 - 200)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies handed in and distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Table gives the percentage of children at each age level from 5 to 14 who are not attending school or an educational institution of any kind. These figures need some explanation. Most of those at the age of 5 or 6 are either attending kindergarten or are in school. But, as to be expected, a percentage of them are not yet in any kindergarten or school. From age 7 onwards, the great majority, i.e. over 99%, are in school. Those who are not attending school at ages 12 to 14, as shown on the Table, are those who have dropped out of school, mainly at Primary 6, on failure of their PSLE or on being overaged. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the second part of the Member's question, Sir, I appreciate and share the Member for Boon Teck's concern that all premature school leavers should undergo some form of vocational or work-related training before they join the employment market, This problem will become more acute as the effects of world recession begin to reach us. In any retrenchment resulting from recession, the first to go will be the unskilled workers. Although we do not yet have much retrenchment in Singapore, among the 1,652 workers who were retrenched during the second quarter of this year, 8 out of 10 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> were without skills. This underlines the importance of having a skill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and VITB have carefully considered whether it is feasible to introduce legislation for compulsory education. Our conclusion is that at the present time it is not necessary nor desirable to legislate for compulsory education. I am aware that there are many countries which have compulsory education both in their academic as well as their vocational schools. This measure has, however, not necessarily ensured that all their children will leave school educated or skilled. In fact, it is well-known that compelling unwilling and unmotivated pupils to stay in school leads to increased problems of truancy, discipline and delinquency. In the United Kingdom, for example, special officers have to be employed to enforce compulsory schooling to make sure that truancy cases are followed up. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of legislating for compulsory education, my Ministry and VITB will try out an alternative approach based on automatic registration. Under automatic registration, all school leavers from the monolingual stream and all premature school leavers from Primary 6 and above will automatically be registered for vocational training at VITB. Although the final say will still rest with the parents, automatic registration should see many more premature school leavers joining VITB than at present. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first batch of those leaving the monolingual stream at the end of 1984, VITB is preparing a special Pre-Vocational Training Course for them. This course will provide the pupils with project work to develop basic vocational skills. It will also include classes on language and numeracy skills, work attitude development and physical education. Monolingual pupils who go through Pre-Vocational Training can go on to Basic Engineering and NTC-3 trade courses at VITB. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who join VITB after PSLE or from the secondary schools will go into the Basic Engineering Course which leads to NTC-3 and NTC-2 skill courses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment details are being worked out between my Ministry and VITB for direct entry into the NTC-3, NTC-2, and ITC \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> courses for pupils who have completed their Certificate in Secondary Education (CSE) as well as those with some 'O' level passes. The details of these will be released by VITB in the near future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic registration will not achieve a 100% transfer of premature school leavers from schools to VITB, but it should ensure that the majority will be placed in a course at the VITB. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that the prospects of skill training are well understood by school leavers, VITB is working on publicity materials, including audio-visual presentations on vocational training. These materials will be specially directed at schools where there are pupils in the monolingual and extended streams in primary schools and at the normal stream in secondary schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are expanding VITB from its present enrolment of 11,000 to more than 24,000 by 1985. Many employers, especially those of high technology industries, prefer workers who have a skill to offer. This should motivate many of our school leavers to seek vocational training. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>HINDU STUDIES IN ENGLISH</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education why Hindu Studies, which will be one of the subjects offered under the Religious Knowledge Courses proposed for Secondary Ill and Secondary IV students, will be offered only in English and not in Tamil as well. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am replying to this question on behalf of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hindu Studies is made available as one of the Religious Knowledge subjects in 1984, it will be taught in English. At a later stage, if there is sufficient demand from students and parents, it can also be offered as an option in Tamil. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that out of 4,330 Indian students in Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 in 1982, less than half or only 46% are taking Tamil as a second language. Most of the rest are taking Malay as \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> a second language, On the other hand, all Indian students study English. The teaching of Hindu Studies in English should therefore enable more Indian students, many of whom are not Tamil speaking, to take up the subject. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of English is well recognized. The use of English for teaching of Hindu Studies should help the students to improve their English. In contrast, the second language poses few problems for the majority of students and does not need as much encouragement as English. In the case of Tamil as a second language, 87.3% passed it at 'O' level in 1981 compared with 40% for English. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Hindu Studies course will be a new and an untried one, the Hindu Advisory Board, with whom we are in close consultation, has agreed that the course should first be offered in English. They have further cautioned that the new syllabus as well as the textbooks should be thoroughly tested in the schools. Until the teething problems of the new textbooks are sorted out, the Hindu Advisory Board feels that it would be premature to offer the course as an option in Tamil. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also pointed out that mainstream Hindu thought in India today is studied and taught in English at major Hindu centres of learning rather than in any of the Indian languages. Most of the great Indian scholar-thinkers who led the modern Hindu renaissance were men like R. Tagore, Aurobindo Gosh, M. K. Gandhi, S. Radhakrishnan and Swami Vivekananda. Their major works were in English. The study of Hindu Studies in English would give the students access to these great works. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Tamil parents should not worry that their children will lose touch with the Tamil language by studying Hindu Studies in English, nor should they worry that their children will become unfamiliar with Hindu literature in the Tamil language. Tamil, as a second language which their children will study for 10 years from Primary 1 to Secondary 4, includes many passages and poems taken from the Hindu classics. Approximately 60% of the materials studied in the TL2 course consists of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> moral education passages and religious poems taken from Hindu literature.

Depending on the outcome of the consultant's visit, it may be possible to start the PE College sometime next year or 1984 at the latest. It is envisaged that the College will take in 'O' and 'A' level students and award a Diploma in Physical Education after a three-year course. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been concerned for some time about how to improve the standard of physical fitness of our pupils. We recognize that a well-run compulsory PE programme in our schools would be the way to improve physical fitness. To achieve this, we need to provide our schools with enough trained PE teachers. There is, however, an acute shortage of such teachers. At present, only 50 of our PE teachers have diplomas, certificates or degrees in PE while the rest have partial or no training. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 10 years we will need at least 70 to 80 trained PE teachers each year for our secondary schools and junior colleges. The proposed PE College will not only train PE teachers for our schools but also PE instructors for the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Sports Council, People's Association and other organizations. We have neglected PE in our schools for far too long. The starting of the PE College and a PE programme in our schools should rectify this neglect. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PROHIBITION OF SMOKING IN RECREATION CENTRES</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>: To ask the Minister for the Environment whether his Ministry has been successful in enforcing the prohibition of smoking in cinema halls and lifts and if he will consider extending such prohibition to bowling alleys and other recreation centres. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo Choo Kok. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (Paya Lebar):</b> Question No. 5, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very few people are found smoking in cinemas, buses and lifts nowadays.

I had explained then that the Police could not proceed to build more police stations as there was a divergence of views between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Home Affairs over the concept of police stations and the policing system. Although the Ministry of Home Affairs had proposed in 1976 to increase the police divisions to 10 with each having a Police Headquarters Station, it was not able to obtain approval for this. To break the impasse, it was decided to bring in foreign experts to study our policing system and to make recommendations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate this year, I disclosed to this House that a Japanese and a British team were studying our Police Force. The Japanese Study Team was invited to study the feasibility of introducing Koban type of policing system in Singapore with the object of improving police-community relations. The Japanese Study Team recommended that the Koban system could be introduced here, subject to modifications to suit local conditions. A network of 91 police posts was recommended with each constituency having at least one post to work closely with the CCCs, CCMCs and RCs. The larger constituencies would have more than one Police Post. This Police Post System would provide the police presence in housing estates. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Study Team also came to the conclusion that a community based scheme of policing such as the Koban system is feasible and can be phased into our reorganized policing system. Recommendations were also made by the British Study Team for a new deployment strategy involving:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the re-demarcation of police divisional boundaries; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the addition of police stations; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the upgrading of the communication system; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the increase in the establishment of police officers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the recommendations of the two Study Teams. We are therefore pressing ahead with the implementation of the recom- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> mendations. The British Study Team had recommended that there be 10 Police Headquarters Stations by 1985, 13 by 1991 and 15 beyond 1991. Preparation work has already begun on six new police stations. They are for the proposed two new police divisions and four replacements of existing old stations. The six stations are as follows:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Woodlands (for new division) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Clementi (for new division) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Bedok (replacement for Joo Chiat) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Ang Mo Kio (replacement for Paya Lebar) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Cantonment (replacement for Central) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Geylang (replacement for Beach Road) \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundaries of our police divisions will be re-drawn to be contiguous with constituency boundaries. No longer will Members of Parliament have to deal with two or three OCs as at present because their constituencies cut across police divisional boundaries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before implementing our new Neighbourhood Police Post System modelled on the Koban system, we will first carry out an evaluation phase. This is to evaluate operational procedures and gauge public acceptance of the system. The evaluation phase will be carried out in one police division in October next year. 'B' Division has been chosen for this purpose and architects are already working on plans for nine police posts, one in each of the constituencies in the division except Boon Teck which will have two posts. They will be built mainly in HDB void decks. The evaluation phase will be one year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Neighbourhood Police Post System requires a radical change of attitudes of our Police officers to be more community-oriented. An orientation programme for the serving officers has begun. New police recruits will not only be trained on neighbourhood policing methods, but will also be inculcated with the spirit of good police-community relations. A team of Japanese experts has been in Singapore for the last two months to conduct training \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> courses for our instructors at our Police Academy. They are imparting their personal experiences and knowledge of the Koban System to our officers. Japanese experts will also be helping us in the preparation of the evaluation phase as well as to evaluate its results. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elaborate programme is being drawn up to brief community leaders and grassroots organizations on the new Neighbourhood Police Post System. The discussion with the community leaders will centre on the workings of the system, how they could be involved in it so as to maximize the benefits to the community. Initially this will be confined to the constituencies under the evaluation phase. Once the system is ready for full implementation, the other constituencies will be involved. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of this new Policing System, policing in Singapore will take on a new dimension by being an integral part of the life of the neighbourhood. We should then be able to drastically reduce our crime rate in all our neighbourhoods. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>12-HOUR SHIFT SYSTEM</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Implementation)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (a) how many companies in Singapore have implemented the 12-hour shift system; and (b) if the Ministry of Labour has examined the merits and demerits of such a system and whether or not the health and safety of workers have been taken into consideration. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Dr Wong Kwei Cheong) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to information available to the Ministry of Labour, five companies have implemented the 12-hour shift system in certain sections of their companies.

I will, therefore, discuss the Scheme with various civic organizations and other relevant bodies before finalizing it. As it is, three talks with 150 CCC members are planned for next month. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, therefore, not be able to furnish full details of the Scheme today. I will, however, outline my Ministry's thinking on the subject. At present, the combined CPF contributions from an employer and his employee amount to 45% of the worker's salary. This rate is expected to be raised to 50% within the next three or four years. A portion, equivalent to 6% of the salary, will be reserved to form a Medisave Account. The Medisave Account is an individual savings account to meet hospitalization expenses; it belongs to- the particular employee. It is not an insurance account. The contribution is, therefore, not an insurance premium. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the combined contributions to CPF are subject to a ceiling which, at present, equals to $1,350 per month, the 6% contribution to Medisave will also be subject to a ceiling at $180 per month. The employer and the employee will contribute equally, i.e. 3% each. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the employee be hospitalized and incur a hospital bill, he may withdraw \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> from his Medisave Account to pay for the bill. The Medisave Account also extends to his immediate family members (spouse, parents and children). In other words, he can also withdraw from his Medisave Account to help pay the hospital bill incurred by any of his immediate family members. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deriving at this contribution rate of 6%, my Ministry took into account:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the frequency of hospitalization actually experienced by Singaporeans over the last 10 years; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the length of hospitalization, and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the services rendered to the patient while in hospital. \n  <br> \n  <br>A detailed study of past hospitalization records shows that more than 90% of Singaporeans were hospitalized only twice or less during the last 10 years. 44% were hospitalized only once, 12% twice and 35% never. 5% were in hospital three times and only 4% more than three times. The hospitalization incidence includes admissions of mothers at the 0 &amp; G wards. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We calculate that at a contribution rate of 6% of salary, most households will have sufficient savings in their Medisave Accounts to cover their expected hospitalization expenses. Our calculations were based on charges for treatment in Class C wards. Class C will continue to be heavily subsidized in this decade to ensure that Singaporeans can afford basic hospital care should they need it under the Medisave Scheme. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that some Medisave Accounts may not have sufficient funds to cover hospital costs at the time of hospitalization. For instance, a young worker who has just started working may not have accumulated sufficient savings in his Medisave Account. If he or his family member falls sick and requires hospital care, we may allow his Medisave Account to go into the \"red\", i.e. giving him the equivalent of a bank overdraft. He will pay it back through subsequent contributions to Medisave. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second part of the question, we know that at present:- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) not all employers provide medical benefits to their employees; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) very few employers extend medical benefits to the dependants of the employees; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) not many employers extend medical benefits to their employees beyond retirement age. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave Scheme covers all family members. It takes into account the employee and his spouse's hospitalization needs after retirement. For most employees, it is, therefore, an improvement over their present medical benefits scheme. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave Scheme is not intended to replace the current medical benefits schemes provided by employers. It does not cover outpatient treatment, for example. Employers who currently provide medical benefits to their employees may, however, consider modifying their medical schemes to take into account Medisave. For instance, an employer may stipulate that his employee must be responsible, through his Medisave, for the first few dollars of his hospital bill. The employer will take care of the rest. This will provide the employee with an incentive to stay well. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible modification is for the employer to upgrade the ward-eligibility status of the better workers. For example, an employer may require all his employees to pay for hospitalization in Class C wards out of the latter's Medisave Account. He may then put the better worker in Class B or Class A wards and paying for the extra charges. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may take me a few more months to finalize the Medisave Scheme. To be sick and unable to afford basic medical treatment is utter misery. We want to ensure that such misery does not befall any Singaporean. There are now many more aged sick who find themselves abandoned by their families because they have become a burden to them. With Medisave most Singaporeans will in future be able to pay for their basic health care with dignity long after they have retired. For those who cannot, they will still be treated. Medical treatment will not be denied to anyone, young or old, on the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ground that his or his family's Medisave Account has run out. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand the Minister, the plan is to enable an employee to pay for his medical care out of his savings with the CPF. Would the Minister say what plans his Ministry has for those who do not make any contributions to the Central Provident Fund? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for those who are not working, their hospitalization expenses will have to come from the working member's Medisave Account. As for the self-employed who do not have a CPF account, our present thinking is that they too must voluntarily have a Medisave Account. This can be done by perhaps charging these people a fee on a cost basis unless they have a Medisave Account, in which case they will get a rebate on the cost which they have incurred for staying in the hospital. This will provide the necessary incentive for the self-employed to start a Medisave Account. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if a member's Medisave Account is in the red, is he required to pay interest? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, if his Medisave Account earns interest, then if it goes into the red, he has to pay interest. If the Medisave Account does not earn interest, then, of course, he will not be charged any interest. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the current practice is that the employer provides more or less the same amount of hospitalization benefits to his employees irrespective of their wages. In other words, a worker earning $300 a month is covered to the same extent as a worker earning $1,000 a month. Under the Medisave Scheme the amount of the employer's contribution to the Scheme is based on the salary of the worker. So a worker who earns $300 a month would only have $18 a month in his Medisave Account and he is the one who probably could not afford the medical bills; whereas a person who earns $3,000 a month - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question, Mr Goh? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Coming, Sir. Whereas a worker who earns $3,000 a month is credited with $180 a month in his Medisave Account. May I ask the Hon. Minister whether it would not be more equitable and sensible to ask the employer to contribute a fixed amount to the Medisave Scheme irrespective of his employee's salary or, alternatively, could a minimum amount be stipulated for the benefit of the low income group? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a contradiction in the question posed by the hon. Member. He has mentioned that at the moment employers provide medical benefits to their employees regardless of their wages. In other words, if an employee has to go to the hospital, whether he earns $200 or $500 a month, he would be reimbursed or be given the same benefit. The Medisave Account is not intended to replace the employer's medical benefit scheme. So if the employer were to pay a fixed amount to the employee regardless of his earning capacity into his Medisave Account, the employee would in effect be given double medical benefits. He is already enjoying fixed medical benefits under the present medical benefit scheme and if at the same time he is to enjoy a fixed amount, it could come up to 20% or 30% of income for the lower income worker. The Scheme which we envisage can be modified, however, by employers. Good employers may wish to top up beyond the 6% envisaged for their good employees. There is nothing to stop them from doing so. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his suggestion that we consider a minimum, I think that is a valid suggestion. If the income of certain workers tends to be on the low side and is unlikely to increase over time, perhaps a minimum would help the employee to build up his Medisave Account.

The remaining 1,292 cases are still under consideration. Assuming that these remaining cases are also eligible, there will be a total of 5,235 applications to be granted priority, i.e. their applications will be advanced by three years. These cases represent only about 5% of the total applicants on the waiting list to purchase HDB flats. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the grant of priority to these multitier applicants, the waiting time for ordinary applicants will be increased as follows. 13,998 applicants (or 14% of those remaining on the waiting list outside the Multi-tier Scheme) will not have their waiting time increased at all. 81,409 applicants or 85% will have their waiting time increased by less than three months and 738 applicants or about 1% will have their waiting time increased by three to six months. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank the Minister for clearing up a misconception among HDB applicants that their waiting time has been prolonged by the Multi-tier scheme by more than one year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, is the Minister aware that each time his Ministry announces a priority scheme, those waiting in the queue are upset and frustrated for two reasons - (1) having to wait longer for the flats and (2) likely to suffer more from the price hikes for their flats. What if tomorrow HDB decide to have another priority scheme? How will these people feel? While recognizing that priority should be given to certain categories of people, HDB should make a distinction between emergency priority and non-emergency priority. Resettlement, for example - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a very long supplementary question, is it not? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I will come to my supplementary question. Resettlement, for example, in an emergency, and like any medical emergency, should be given top priority. On the other hand, the other schemes are not emergency schemes and therefore should be treated differently. I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether he would consider the proposal that HDB keep two separate registers - one Priority and one Ordinary - and then allocate flats on a quota basis, i.e. for a certain number of flats allocated to those on the Ordinary register, one priority case could be allowed. In this way the pain of having to wait longer will be lessened for the ordinary applicants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other supplementary question is his. Will the Minister of State assure those whose waiting time has been prolonged, hat they will not have to pay more for heir flats should the price of flats go up by he time they are allocated theirs? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, concerning the first question, the HDB is aware of the frustrations felt by ordinary applicants as a result of the various priority schemes. We will only introduce priority schemes when there are good reasons for doing so, for example, to encourage families to live together. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be aware that the HDB already has quotas for the various priority schemes. For resettlement cases, the quota is 50% of the flats available for balloting. And for other schemes like the SAF, Police, HDB staff and so on, we have also set quotas. So I think, through the quota arrangement, we have already satisfied the proposal that he is making. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the second question about assuring applicants that they will not have to pay more, I do not know whether the Member is serious.

The amount collected between 1st March, 1981 (as required in the Question) and 15th August, 1982 is $12.6 million. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of installing pig-waste treatment plants varies, depending on the system of treatment adopted as well as the ground condition of the farms. The capital grant of $100 per pig by the Government is expected to be sufficient to cover the construction costs of most systems. However, in some cases, farmers may choose to install more expensive plants if these plants cost less to operate and provided these savings more than compensate for the higher capital cost. Owing to economies of scale, the larger capacity plants cost less on a per-capita basis to construct. The actual costs will only be known after tenders have been awarded to the most competitive bidders. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, as the Minister of State rightly points out, the subsidy based on per head of pig would mean that the larger farmers would receive a larger quantum of subsidy to enable them to construct waste treatment plants.

So \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> small farmers should really get together and upgrade themselves, and my Ministry will be only too happy to provide them with the necessary technical assistance. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Is there a minimum number of pigs which a farm must have before it qualifies for the subsidy? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no. The pig farms in the designated pig farming areas will be required to treat their waste to the required level, i.e. to bring down the BOD (Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand) from above 4,000 to about 250 milligrams per litre by December 1984. So they will have to decide whether they want to comply with this requirement or to give up farming altogether. There is no minimum requirement in terms of number of pigs that they have. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>BOON LAY HOUSING ESTATE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Improvements)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for National Development, in view of the assurance given that improvements will be carried out to the Jurong Town Corporation Estates which have been taken over by the Housing and Development Board, (a) if the HDB has finalized plans to replace all the unserviceable lifts in Boon Lay Housing Estate; and (b) what other improvements have been made to this Estate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the taking over of JTC housing estates in May 1982, extensive repair and improvement works have been carried out on the lifts in these estates, including Boon Lay.

When all repair and improvement works have been completed, the number of breakdowns is expected to be further reduced. If the performance of lifts continues to be unsatisfactory despite these repairs, they will be replaced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has also been carrying out a series of improvement schemes to upgrade the condition of JTC housing estates \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to equal that of other HDB estates. In Boon Lay Estate, the performance of cleaning contractors has been improved through the implementation of HDB's work specifications and by encouraging these contractors to mechanize cleaning operations. Repairs have also been carried out, for example, the replacement of broken rubbish chute doors; the repair of all broken drains, pavements and floors; the over-hauling of all water pumps; and the repainting of dirty lift landing doors and staircase walls. The condition of the open areas in Boon Lay Estate has also been improved by the provision of additional foot-paths and drain crossings, pruning of overgrown trees and the returfing and replanting of landscaped sites. Round-the-clock lift rescue services and repairs to essential services have also been provided by HDB's Essential Maintenance Services Centre. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the HDB has drawn up plans for long-term improvements to all former JTC housing estates including Boon Lay. These improvements include the replacement of secondary roofing, the resurfacing of car parks, the enlargement of refuse bin centres to accommodate all refuse containers awaiting collection, and the provision of additional lifts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have with me some photographs showing the marked difference between these facilities before and after repair, if Members would like to see them. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>KAKI BUKIT ESTATE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Summonses under State Lands Encroachments Act)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B.

These are formal notices to the squatters that they have to vacate the site.

However, the squatters need not attend court in person to answer the charge of unlawful occupation of State land if they plead guilty by means of a standard written statement supplied by the Resettlement Department which provides assistance and advice to the squatters to complete this legal process unless they wish to contest the charges in court.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Report contained in Paper Parl. 3 of 1982, and that Mr Speaker do reprimand Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, Member for Anson, for his dishonourable conduct and contempt of the House and do warn him. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this Motion in my capacity as Leader of the House. I am also a Member of the Committee of Privileges whose Report is before the House for its consideration. It is my duty, unpleasant as it is, to ask the House to endorse the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> recommendation of the Committee that we should pass censure on one of our Members. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time that such a Motion has been brought before this House. That is some consolation to those of us who are jealous of the honour of Parliament. That does not, however, make today's task any easier. The circumstances in which this matter arose emerge clearly from the Report of the Committee of Privileges which has been circulated amongst Members. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Member for Anson is a practising advocate and solicitor. As such, he had acted for five persons who had been detained under an Order made by the Director, Central Narcotics Bureau, under the Misuse of Drugs Act. At the Sitting of Parliament on 19th March last he raised in this House matters relating to the detention of drug addicts. He should have disclosed that he had acted as advocate and solicitor in those cases, but he did not. At the time one of these cases was still pending in the High Court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee found that it was improper for the Member to have raised the matter in Parliament without first disclosing his interest which was, in the view of your Committee, a direct personal pecuniary interest in the matter. As for punishment, the Committee are inclined to take a lenient view as the Member is new and has not been for long in this House. The Committee feel that it will suffice if the Member were to be reprimanded and warned by you, Sir, and so recommend. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on this Motion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, Mr Speaker, Sir, wish to reiterate in this House the reasons which I had advanced before the Committee why, in my view, there was no question of my having any direct personal pecuniary interest in the matter on which I spoke in this House. In support of my view, I referred, as the Committee says in its Report, extensively to rulings in the United King- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> dom House of Commons and I did this, as I said earlier at the last Sitting of this House, only because our own Standing Orders provide that when it comes to the question of construction of the Standing Orders then regard shall be had to the practice in the UK House of Commons. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee nevertheless have expressed the opinion that I had a direct personal pecuniary interest. The Committee's opinion would seem to be that the action in court constituted my direct personal pecuniary interest in the matter on which I spoke in this House. The opinion assumes that as a direct result of my raising the matter in Parliament I stood to gain in some way in the action in court. This was how the Minister put his case, Mr Speaker, Sir. Without attempting to be disrespectful to the Committee, may I say it is unfortunate that the Committee's Report does not say what the gain to me is and how it would arise. I confess that I still cannot see how I stood to benefit in the action in court by raising the matter which I raised in this House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it appears from paragraph 43 of the Minutes of Evidence before the Committee, the Leader of the House spoke of his intention to recommend to the Committee that the Committee should seek the views of the Law Society on the question before the Committee. I confess that, before the Committee, I did not see the need to seek the views of the Law Society on what I thought was a matter for this House. But on further reflection, I am inclined to think that it might have been a good thing to have sought their views because the question is the interpretation of what is meant by the phrase \"a direct personal pecuniary interest\" which is, after all, a question of law. I see that in the end the Committee did not seek the views of the Law Society. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is all I wish to say on this question that I had a direct personal pecuniary interest. I have said enough and I will accept the decision of this House. It may be said that I have no choice but what I wish to say is that I will accept it gracefully, Mr Speaker, Sir, and bow to the ruling. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I sit down, may I touch on two matters of fact. The Committee in its Report observes in paragraph 4 (page ii) that I did not inform the House that I had acted, be it noted, that I had acted for the applicants in Originating Motions Nos, 47 and 48 when I read the affidavits filed in those cases. I would ask Members to believe me when I said that I did not mention that fact because I thought it might amount to advertising myself if I drew attention to my having acted for these men in question. Members will recall that in those applications the men were released by the court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the action for damages still pending when I spoke, as I said in this House when the Minister raised the matter, it had completely escaped my mind at that time that there was that action for damages by this man Subramaniam s/o Marie still pending before the court. It is, believe me, Mr Speaker, Sir, simply not possible for an advocate to ramble all his cases in court. I would again like to assure the Members of this House, if any further assurance were needed, that it was not for the purpose of any pecuniary gain that I raised the matter in the House. The thought of any pecuniary gain was never present. I spoke because of my concern that innocent persons might be wrongly detained and I wished to draw the attention of this House to the danger as I saw it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that the Committee had not considered in its Report the question whether two Members of the Committee should have sat in the deliberations of the Committee on this matter that was referred to the Committee. You may recall, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I saw you after I had first appeared before the Committee on this matter. It is true that when I appeared before the Committee I did not raise this, but again it was simply because it had escaped my mind that I had acted against two Members in the Committee in my capacity as advocate and solicitor. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I wish to say, Mr Speaker. Thank you. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will bear with me for a few moments. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, as he has said, referred extensively to resolutions and reports of the House of Commons. But these resolutions were not entirely in his favour. Nor did he cite a case in the House of Commons where an advocate and solicitor spoke on matters concerning his clients and was brought up for a breach before the Committee of Privileges. It is obvious when you are an advocate and solicitor and you have acted in several cases in the High Court that, if you raise these matters in this House, you would be well advised to declare your interest. If you do not do so, then you are exposing yourself to a breach of privilege. What was there to prevent the hon. Member declaring his interest? We do not want to muzzle him. He is free to speak provided he declares his interest, whether it be a direct personal interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He questioned why we did not send these proceedings to the Law Society. In Committee, I asked him whether we should. He replied that we should not because the Law Society or the Committee of the Law Society is more concerned with the etiquette of the Bar rather than a breach of privilege in this House. But if he so desires, there is nothing to prevent this House sending a copy of this Parliamentary Report to the Committee of the Law Society for its comments, if any. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, he spoke of two Members in the Committee whom he objected to because, he thought, they might be prejudiced against him. Sir, the Members of the Committee of Privileges were appointed soon after the General Elections, long before the Member for Anson took his seat in this House. All I can assure him is that these Members were not prejudiced against him. In fact, the decision of the Committee was a unanimous one. All Members were for this Report and for the recommendation.

All he had to do was to tell the House that, due to an oversight, he had forgotten the requirements of the Standing Orders relating to the declaration of personal pecuniary interest in any matter raised in this House and to apologize to the House. I am sure hon. Members of this House would have taken a lenient view of it and, due to the fact that he was a new boy, would have just cautioned him and let him off. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, listening to the Member for Anson a few minutes ago, it is quite clear that he is recalcitrant. He is not prepared to withdraw or he is not prepared to own up that he might have been at fault. He still stands by what he had said before the Committee of Privileges - that what he had done was not wrong, that he had not derived any personal pecuniary interest in those cases that he had raised in this House - and invited the Committee and also this House to pronounce once again as to whether what he had done was right or wrong or whether what he had said before the Committee was, in fact, true or false. The finding of the Committee unfortunately amounts to this, Mr Speaker, Sir: that he had not told the truth before the Committee. The Motion as it stands lets him off lightly. I think we are treating him with unnecessary leniency but I would support the Motion as it stands. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Report contained in Paper Parl. 3 of 1982, and that Mr Speaker do reprimand Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, Member for Anson, for his dishonourable conduct and contempt of the House and do warn him. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordered, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam do attend in his place forthwith. - [Mr E W Barker]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker then called Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam by name, and Mr Jeyaretnam standing up in his place, Mr Speaker, sitting in his Chair, delivered the following reprimand: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has expressed its agreement with the Committee of Privileges in their Report contained in Paper Parl. 3 of 1982 and has decided that you are guilty of dishonourable conduct and contempt of the House under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act (Chapter 49) for having raised a matter in the House in which you had a direct personal pecuniary interest without first disclosing the extent of that interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the instructions of Parliament, I reprimand you for your dishonourable conduct and contempt of the House and warn you against committing similar breach of privilege in the future. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>JUDGES' REMUNERATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.55 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was announced in Parliament in March 1982 that officers in the Administrative and Professional Services would have their salaries revised from 1st April 1982 and that the gross salaries of Superscale officers in the Civil Service would be rounded up, It is the practice at the time of such revisions for the salaries of the Chief Justice and the other Judges also to be revised on the same basis as for the Super-scale officers. However, salary changes for the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court require to be formally effected through amendment of the Judges' Remuneration Act (Chapter 7 of the Revised Edition). This Bill is now being introduced into Parliament for these salary adjustments for the Chief Justice and the other Judges. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional cost of these adjustments will come to about $5,730 a year with rounding up of the gross salaries of the Chief Justice from $18,767 to $18,800 per month and of the other Judges from \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> $13,526 to $13,600 per month following consolidation of the National Wages Council awards for 1978 to 1981 into their salaries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek a clarification from the Hon. Minister? I do not know whether I have got it all wrong but I see that the salary of the Chief Justice is being increased from an annual pensionable salary of $156,000 to $225,600 and the annual pensionable salaries of the other Judges of the Supreme Court are being increased from $112,440 to $163,200. If that is correct, I am afraid I am at a loss to understand that the extra financial expenditure is only of the order of $5,730 per annum. May I have a clarification from the Minister on that? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not quite clear where the figures come from, which the Member has quoted. The figure in clause 2 is the annual salary of $225,600 for the Chief Justice. As I have stated in my Second Reading speech, that is $18,800 a month, which means he has an increase of $33 a month, from $18,767. And in the case of the other Judges, the increase has been from $13,526 to $13,600 which is an increase of $74 a month per Judge. I do not know how many Judges there are, but if you add them all up, you will find that the figure is correct. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what this Bill proposes to do is to delete the present section 2 of the Judges' Remuneration Act and to substitute it with this new clause. But the present section, unless it has been amended before I came to this House, is that the Chief Justice shall be paid an annual pensionable salary of $156,000. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> How was that brought in? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That was brought in in 1981, last year. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Something is obviously wrong. What is happening now is that we are consolidating this figure, which the Member for Anson quoted, plus the National Wages Council increases which altogether come to $18,767 per month for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the Chief Justice, and we are rounding this up, as I have shown. So we are already paying the National Wages Council increases over the years. What we are doing is to consolidate this figure and then add on a certain small sum to round up the figure to $18,800 a month. I hope this explanation is satisfactory. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to the Minister for the explanation. It is a pity that the Bill does not explain that because the previous Amendment spoke of the Chief Justice's salary as being at $156,000 per annum. It is a pity that the explanation in the Bill does not say that they are taking into account the NWC awards and are bringing them into the annual pensionable salary now. But be that as it may, I am indebted to the Minister for the explanation which was, in turn, not evident to me looking at the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I speak on the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Go ahead. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Before I do that, may 1, in view of your directions to me to be very careful in future, say that I do practise before the Judges of the High Court. I am there in my practice of the profession as an advocate and solicitor. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say quite clearly that I am in support of the principle and of the need for our Judges to be paid a salary befitting their responsibilities and their powers and the dignity of the office that they hold. I would, however, draw the attention of this House to one or two things, and that is, that our Judges - I am not saying for one moment that they do not deserve the salaries but they are being paid far higher than any other Judges in this region. I have with me a comparison of the salaries that are being paid to Judges in Australia, for example. The Chief Justice of Australia is only getting a salary of S$195,300. And if we go across the border to our nearest neighbour, Malaysia, we find that the Lord President of the Federal Court is only drawing a salary of S$76,022, about one-third of what the Chief Justice in Singapore is being paid. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, commend to Members of this House that it would be wrong \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to think that the independence and the authority of the Judiciary can only be reflected in the salaries that are paid to them. The Judiciary has a very important role to play in our society. They are, along with this House, one of the organs upon which society rests for the attainment of law and order within it. There are, besides payment of salaries befitting the Judges, their position and their responsibility. There are one or two other things that must reflect the dignity and the authority of the court, and this is where I would urge the Government to pay full regard not only just to the salaries paid but to other aspects that reflect the dignity and the authority of the court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the appointment of Judges. It is of the utmost importance, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Judge should hold his post without any fear as to his tenure. That was the position when we inherited the 1958 Constitution - that a Judge appointed will hold office as a Judge of the Supreme Court until he reaches his retiring age. In 1969 this principle was breached, the principle that a Judge should hold office until he retires or he is removed for misconduct, without any fear for his tenure. In 1969 Mr Speaker, Sir, there was introduced into the Constitution the provision, by Article 52B I think, that the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister may appoint someone who is qualified to sit as a Judge, to act as a Judge of the Supreme Court, and the appointment may be for a specified period. Following that, we had one Judge who sat as a Judge of the Supreme Court for a number of years but whose tenure depended on it being renewed every time it came to an end. I think his appointment was for two years at a time. At the moment, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seven Judges sitting in the High Court, of which four hold office permanently until they reach their retiring age and three of them hold office under this power - the President to appoint them for stated periods. Two of the Judges holding office under this power, of course, are Judges who have reached retiring age, but there is one other Judge who has not reached his retiring age and whose appointment is on a year-to-year basis. May I, Sir, commend to this House that it is undesirable that Judges should be made to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> hold office or that their tenure should depend upon it being renewed from time to time. It breaches the principle of the independence of the Judiciary, which is so vital in any society. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other matter, and that is, the upholding by the Executive of its determination to maintain the authority and dignity of the court. I am sorry to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I have found that this Government has not always striven to maintain the dignity and authority of the courts. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, this Bill is on the remuneration of the Judges. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I realize that, Mr Speaker, Sir, but we are talking about the Judiciary. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not in the Bill. This Bill is on salaries for the Judges. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I accept your ruling. If you say that I should not proceed, I will not. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps you can bring it up some other time as a Question for Oral Answer, or something like that. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You say I should not speak. All right. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Anson has raised questions about the appointments and salaries of Judges. I think it would be odious to make a comparison of how much our Judges are paid with how much Judges in Malaysia or Australia or England are paid. Conditions are different. There was a time when our Judges were paid very low salaries. That was when I joined the Government. Ministers too were paid very low salaries. But wages have increased over the years. As for Judges, it is difficult to get Judges who qualify to sit on the Bench. That is because, as the Member knows, advocates and solicitors in Singapore make so much more money than Judges do. The last Judge who was appointed earned at the Bar about four or five times more than what he is being paid now. It was a sacrifice for him to leave private practice and be appointed to the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Bench. There are not many who are willing to sacrifice their income at the Bar to sit on the Bench. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that the independence of the Judiciary should not be related to their salaries. Of course it should not. It has never been, nor will it be. As for the appointment of ad hoc Judges, he says that we have breached the cardinal principle of our Constitution. In fact, he said it as long ago as 1969 when the Ministry of Law issued a statement in reply. If you will bear with me, Sir, I will read the statement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam alleges (Straits Times, 1st September) that the Government is weakening the Judiciary by amending the law to appoint Judges from year to year. This amendment was passed recently at the specific request of the Chief Justice. He felt that he could not recommend one of the District Judges as a permanent Puisne Judge until after he had been given a chance to prove that he was qualified to be so. The main reason for this unsatisfactory state of affairs is because many senior members of the Bar who were offered appointments to the Supreme Court Bench by the Prime Minister, after consulting the Chief Justice, have refused to accept the appointments. They said that they could not afford it since their earnings at the Bar are five to 10 times what the Supreme Court Judges are paid and they had heavy family commitments.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was in 1969. The position has not changed, not as far as advocates and solicitors wanting to sit on the Bench or not wanting to because of their high incomes at the Bar. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned three of four Judges who were appointed on a yearly basis. I think I had better correct that wrong impression. There is only one Judge at present who has been appointed on a yearly basis. The others had retired when they reached the retiring age of 65. But because we were short of Judges and because they still had their wits with them, they were appointed either from year to year or on a two-year basis. The particular Judge the hon. Member referred to was appointed on a year-to-year basis from 1969. He retired five years after retiring age. Retiring age is 65. He was so useful that he was only retired at 70 years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to prolong the debate. But may I ask the Minister for Law apropos his state- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ment that leading members of the Bar had declined invitations for appointment to the Bench. May I know whether they were offered appointment as permanent Judges or whether they were merely offered appointments for fixed periods for one year or two at a time? One can understand the reluctance of members of the Bar accepting appointment under such conditions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is wrong and it is fallacious to try to equate the Judges' salaries with the salaries of those commanding high figures at the Bar. For one thing, they are two different things. A Judge of the High Court carries with him a prestige and a position of authority and responsibility that no money can buy and he is in a completely different position from a member of the Bar who may be earning five times or 10 times more. A Judge remains a respected member of the society, a man who is making his contribution and a man of responsibility and authority, whereas a member of the Bar can only be regarded as one who is eminent in his practice. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, to the first question, the offer was for permanent judgeship, not on year-to-year basis. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his second point, I do not argue with the Member. We cannot afford to pay our Judges the amounts that are being earned in private practice. We do raise their salaries but that is absolutely no comparison to what a private practitioner can earn at the Bar. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>CHARITIES BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.22 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charities in Singapore are normally registered as companies limited by guarantee or trusts or societies. They are under the supervision and control, when necessary, of several authorities, namely, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Public Trustee, the Registrar of Companies, the Registrar of Societies and the Ministry of Social Affairs, each with limited scope and powers. There is no single supervisory authority to ensure the effective use of charitable resources. There is also no uniform policy or set of rules to govern the setting up of charities or to regulate their activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the activities of charities are in consonance with their declared objectives because charities receive indirect Government subsidies through income tax and estate duty exemptions. Many charities also receive annual grants from the Government or contributions from the public. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charities Bill, 1982, seeks to make provision for the registration and the better administration of charities. It establishes the office of the Commissioner of Charities and confers upon him a wide range of powers over charities. It is based essentially on the United Kingdom Charities Act, 1960, with modifications to suit circumstances in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the appointment of the Commissioner of Charities and other officers to assist him in the discharge of his functions, while clause 4 specifies the general functions of the Commissioner. His main function is to promote the effective use of charitable resources by encouraging the development of better methods of administration, by giving charity trustees information on matters affecting the charity, and by investigating and checking abuses. However, he is not empowered to act in the administration of a charity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner is required under clause 5 to establish and maintain a register of charities. Every charity is required to be registered with the Commissioner, unless it is an 'exempt' charity or is otherwise excepted from registration by regulations. An exempt charity is one which is exempt from the supervision and control \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> of the Commissioner. It is incumbent upon the charity trustees to register the charity, if it is not exempt or excepted from registration. A fine not exceeding $2,000 will be imposed on any trustee of a registrable charity who fails to register with the Commissioner. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 allows persons who are or may be affected by the registration of an institution as a charity to object to such registration. Appeals against the Commissioner's decision to enter or not to enter an institution in the register of charities are to be made to the High Court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner is empowered under clause 7 to institute inquiries into charities other than exempt charities. Such inquiries can be made either for general or specific purposes and may be conducted either by the Commissioner himself or a person appointed by him. The Commissioner can also under clause 8 call for documents and search the records of any charity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charity trustees are required under clause 9 to submit annual statements of accounts of their charity to the Commissioner. This does not apply to exempt charities and those which are excepted from this requirement by regulations. The same clause also empowers the Commissioner to have the affairs and accounts of any charity investigated and audited and to charge the expenses of such investigation to the charity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 incorporate the cypr6s doctrine and specify the circumstances under which the doctrine of cypr6s can be applied so that an intention to benefit charity which cannot be literally fulfilled will be effectuated in a manner nearest to that indicated by the benefactor. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 provides for the vesting of charity property in the Public Trustee by order of the High Court and for its subsequent discharge. The property may be vested in the Public Trustees with or without powers of management. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 gives the Commissioner concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court for \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the purposes of establishing a scheme for the administration of a charity; appointing, discharging or removing charity trustees, or removing officers or servants; and vesting or transferring property. However, such a jurisdiction can only be exercised with the consent of the Attorney-General. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 empowers the Commissioner to act for the protection of charities. He may remove or suspend a trustee in cases of misconduct or mismanagement and prevent the operation of a bank account. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 specifies the persons who can institute legal proceedings in relation to a charity. All proceedings in the High Court must have the approval of the Commissioner, except those taken by the Attorney-General. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 allows the Attorney-General, under certain circumstances, to apply for the winding up of a charitable company. It also prevents a charitable company from changing its memorandum and articles to enable it to attach new trusts to property, other than subscribed or guaranteed capital, acquired before the change. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charity trustees are required under clause 20 to keep proper books of account regarding the affairs of the charity and to preserve them for at least seven years. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 specifies how notices of charity meetings are to be given, and clauses 22 and 23 deal with the orders of the Commissioner and their enforcement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 provides for rules of court to be made regulating appeals against orders or decisions of the Commissioner to the High Court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations under the Charities Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>4.30 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Charities Bill introduced by the Minister for Finance. As pointed out by the Minister, the control and supervision of charitable \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> organizations and their activities have all along been shared by various Government departments. We cannot therefore correctly and fully assess the extent of activities of all our charitable organizations - the amount of donations collected by them every year, and how these sums are distributed or used. This Bill seeks to provide for the registration of all charitable organizations other than exempt charities such as educational and religious institutions and hospitals established by an Act of Parliament or any institution as may be declared by the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for the appointment of a Commissioner of Charities with considerable power to supervise and control charitable organizations and their activities. Because of the power vested in him, the Commissioner can more effectively carry out his functions, and also more effectively enable donations and funds collected by charities to be distributed and applied more efficiently and equitably. At the same time, the Commissioner will also be able to collect relevant statistics and information on the charities and their activities and report to the Minister and Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the advantages of administration and the collection of information, clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill also empower the Commissioner of Charities to investigate accounts, to institute inquiries and to call for documents and to search records relating to any charity. In this way the Bill will prevent any undesirable elements from claiming to be a charity under false pretences and so deceive members of the public for their ulterior motives. Indirectly, the Bill also protects the reputation of genuine charities from being soiled or damaged by the fishy activities of such undesirable elements. I hope the Commissioner will, in his yearly report, include items on any incidents of any abuse of charities and the results of investigation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise relates to the definition of \"charity\". Clause 2 defines \"charitable purposes\" as purposes which are exclusively charitable according to Singapore law, and \"charity\" as any organization established for charitable \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> purposes. We all know that charity is a virtue. According to the international Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, St. Augustine regarded charity as a virtue which unites us with God. Thomas Aquinas also regarded charity as the foundation or the root of all virtues, while \"ren\", namely, humanity or kindness, the supreme concept of virtue of Confucian thought, also connotes charity. However, religious and ethical concepts and considerations about the term \"charity\" are rather abstract and general. They may not be applicable in the legal field. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, subclause (2) empowers the Commissioner of Charities to decide whether or not an organization is a charity and to be registered as such. If there is dissatisfaction with his decision, sub-clause (3) provides an appeal to the High Court. But it would be far better for the Commissioner to formulate guidelines on these terms after consulting some charity organizations rather than leaving it to disputation in court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about charities, it reminds me of the Spyros tragedy that occurred on 12th October, 1978. Many members of the public voluntarily came forward generously to donate towards the aid of the victims and their families. The two major Chinese newspapers, Nanyang Siang Pau and Sin Chew Jit Poh, within one month collected $3 million which was transmitted to the Ministry of Labour. The two newspapers are cultural organizations and they are also registered companies. I wonder whether this Charities Bill will be applicable to them in similar cases in the future or whether they need to get the written permission of the Commissioner of Charities before they are allowed to collect by proxy such donations. Many an ordinary man in the street has a soft spot in his heart, sympathy and compassion. Whenever necessary, he will come forward with donations and make contributions to show his care for the society, unlike certain opportunistic politicians who can only shout empty slogans. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether the Minister is willing to formulate certain regulations for the guidance of such non-charitable \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> organizations to help them continue participating in charitable acts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that while clause 10 mentions that the Commissioner -has the power to exchange information with various Government departments, it has singled out the Department of Inland Revenue. Perhaps this is due to the fact that supervision and control of charitable organizations and work have a lot to do with the checking of accounts, donations, and their distribution. In order to avoid too much red tape and to increase efficiency, I would suggest to the Minister that a certain senior officer of the Inland Revenue Department be appointed Commissioner of Charities, in addition to his own post in the Department. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister may wish to clarify why this Bill has been withheld until now. Some people might want to claim credit for themselves, saying the Bill is finally introduced by the PAP Government because of their representations and arguments for it. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chin Harn Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Charities Bill which is now before the House. My reason for supporting this Bill is that the provisions of this Bill could not have been more timely. Trade unions in Singapore have increasingly directed their attention to the plight of Singaporeans who are less fortunate than their members. Consequently, an increasing portion of every trade union's programme of activities is devoted to promoting among union members and among other workers a greater awareness of their social obligation to their less fortunate fellow citizens. The involvement of trade unions in charitable activities may take the form of either charitable and welfare work by the unions and their members or contributions and donations to existing charities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing charities in Singapore seem to be well organized and properly run. There seems to be no particular need for enacting the provisions of this Bill. Yet I strongly support this Bill not because there is a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> need for it but because the Bill would be helpful to the charities themselves and to the people who run or support charities as well as the people whom the charities are meant to benefit. The Bill helps the charities and all these people by reinforcing among the public the feeling of assurance and confidence that whatever contributions and donations made to charities will be properly used for the purposes for which they are intended. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have any criticism of this Bill, it is that the Bill seems to be wholly concerned with the safe custody and proper application of funds and properties of charities. I have no quarrel with that. At the same time, I think perhaps the Bill should have dealt with the question of the collection of funds by charities. For example, clause 6 of the Bill provides that a charity registered under the Bill, unless specifically exempted, would be deemed to be as such. This obligation to register under the Bill is not tied up with any particular benefit. I should have thought that the right to solicit and receive contributions and donations as a charity should be restricted to selected organizations. The organizations should be charities registered or exempted under the Bill. There seems to be no prohibition under the Bill against any organization soliciting and receiving funds as a charity when it is not so registered or exempted. For the benefit of the public who support charities, I should think charities should be required to state clearly and prominently the fact of their registration or exemption under the Bill. Imposters or frauds can then be prosecuted more easily if they dare claim such registration or exemption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seems to presume that charities function independently of any public support. This presumption is to be implied from the fact that under the Bill some charities do not have to account for what they do with the donations and contributions they receive from the public, even to the Commissioner of Charities. There may be good reason for so doing. But any charity which solicits and receives contributions and donations from the public should be required to inform the public who support it at least the gross sum and the net sum collected. The difference between the gross and net collections \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> would serve to indicate to the public how much of the contributions go to the charitable purposes they support. The difference between the gross and net collections would also serve to remind the public of the need for volunteers to man the cause of charities. If charities have to depend more on paid workers, proportionately more of the contributions and donations from the public would go towards paying wages and other expenses and not the objects of the charities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, therefore, of the view that this Bill should be adopted by this House since it is in the interest of the charities as well as the people who support, run or benefit from the charities to have such a Bill enacted into law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.45 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 4 of the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 1978, an office-holding Member must satisfy the following conditions to qualify for the grant of a pension: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) he must have a minimum period of eight years' reckonable service as an office-holding Member; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he must have attained the age of fifty years; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) he must have ceased to hold office. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, subsection (3) of this same section says that the pension shall not be payable in respect of any period during which he is again an office-holding Member. At the end of that period, the pension shall again be payable and shall be recomputed with the addition of that further period to the period of his former reckonable service as an office-holding Member. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions have the unintended effect of penalising the longer serving office-holding Members. Maximum pension of two-thirds of the office-holding Member's highest annual salary is earned when he has given a total of 18 years of service. Service beyond the period of 18 years does not earn more pension despite the provision for recomputation. In fact, as he continues to serve, his expectation of life decreases and the value of his pension benefits which are suspended falls progressively. Should he die in harness, the value of his pension benefits decreases to zero. I hope this will never happen but unfortunately it is more than a possibility for the older office-holding Members. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One remedy is for office-holding Members to retire after they have qualified for pension and take up if they want, non-Parliamentary or private jobs. Several former Ministers like Dr Toh Chin Chye, Mr Lim Kim San, Mr Jek Yeun Thong and Encik Othman Wok have done this. They are able to enjoy their pensions in addition to what they are paid in their new jobs. But several office-holding Members are needed by the Prime Minister to serve beyond 18 years. They should not be penalized for continuing to discharge their public office. Therefore, a more positive solution, to achieve equity, is to remove the financial disincentives for staying on. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Government pensioners re-employed by Government, their pensions do not cease to be paid during their re-employment. There is no valid reason why Parliamentary pensions for office-holding Members should not also continue to be paid to such re-employed Members. The Bill before this House seeks to remedy this by enabling an office-hold-ing Member to draw a pension when he has a total of eight years' reckonable service as an office-holding Member and attained the age of 55 years even though he is still holding office. When he ceases to hold office, his pension will be recomputed taking into account his further period of reckonable. service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for a former office-holding Member who is drawing a pension to continue drawing the pension should he serve again as an office-holding Member if he has attained the age of 55 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> years. If he has not attained that age when he serves again, then he will continue to draw pension upon reaching that age. In short, this Bill will place those office-hold-ing Members who have qualified for the grant of an office-holding Member's pension in a position similar to that of Administrative Officers who are re-employed after their retirement at 55 years of age. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to ask what is the need for this Bill at this particular moment. We have heard from the Prime Minister not very long ago of the grim years ahead for all Singaporeans, not just for Singaporeans but for most of the world. Steps have been taken in other countries to curb public expenditure, particularly in the form of salaries paid to Ministers and others in the public service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this Bill proposes to do, for all practical purposes - although it is paid in the form of a pension - is to increase the salaries that are already paid to those who will qualify under this Bill for the payment of pensions. If we take the case of the Prime Minister, what it will do is, for all practical purposes, to increase his salary by a sum of $132,000 annually. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the First Deputy Prime Minister, what it will do is to increase his annual salary by a sum of $114,000. If we take the Second Deputy Prime Minister, what this Bill will do is to increase his annual salary by a sum of $103,995. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to Ministers who have served 18 years or more, what it will do is to increase their annual salary by a sum smaller than that of the Second Deputy Prime Minister, but not very much lower. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a minute, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not begrudge the Ministers the salaries paid to them. They have earned their salaries and they have done well for Singapore. But the question still has to be faced whether, in the present state of our financial situation, this Bill should be presented to Parliament to add on to the public debt the payment of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> an increase in salaries, because that is what it amounts to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, I have with me, for the information of Members of this House, by way of comparison the salaries that are paid to Ministers, again, in Australia and in our nearest neighbour that is over the causeway. In Australia, the Prime Minister is paid S$253,470. This is his annual salary. The counterpart across the causeway in Malaysia is paid a sum of S$127,443. The Prime Minister of Singapore is paid $230,016, not very far below what is paid to the Australian Prime Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Sir, that the Australian Prime Minister's salary that I have given here is the recommendation of their Remunerations Tribunal, which was made recently I think, and this is the salary that has been recommended for him for the future. But I read in one of the papers that, on his submission, this recommendation has been deferred for three months in view of the situation facing Australia. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Bill is passed, what it will do is to increase the salary of the Prime Minister from $230,000 to $362,000 a year for all practical purposes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if we look at the Deputy Prime Minister's salary, byway of comparison, in Australia the Deputy Prime Minister is paid a sum of S$208,320. This is, again, the recommendation of this Tribunal which has not been implemented yet. The counterpart across the causeway is only paid S$116,361. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the First Deputy Prime Minister is paid a sum of $203,016. All these figures that I give include the allowance paid to the Ministers as Members of this House. The Second Deputy Prime Minister in Singapore is paid $188,016. So the result of this Bill, if passed, will be to add, for the First Deputy Prime Minister, a sum of $114,000 annually to his present salary, and to the Second Deputy Prime Minister a sum of $103,995 to his present salary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Cabinet Ministers, again, by way of comparison, in Australia a Cabinet Minister is paid S$173,670. The counterpart across the causeway is paid S$105,279. In Singapore it is $170,016, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> again, inclusive of the allowances paid as Members of this House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you move further down to Ministers and Ministers of State, what do we find? In Australia, they are paid S$163,380. In Malaysia they are paid S$88,656 and in Singapore a Senior Minister of State is paid $127,176 and a Minister of State is paid $109,896. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have for comparison purposes not taken salaries paid in other countries in this region. I have not, for a minute, tried to compare the salaries paid in Singapore with the salaries paid, for example, in India. I have taken, I thought in fairness, the salaries paid in Australia. But one must remember that the salary structure in Australia is quite different. There, the salaries are generally much higher for employees and workers and the salary structure is different. Yet we find that what we propose to do in Singapore, if this Bill is passed, is to pay our Ministers far in excess of what they pay in Australia. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, I do not begrudge the Ministers, for a minute, the salaries that they should be paid. But it is a mistake to think that the only attraction for public service is the salaries that will be paid or the pensions that they will be able to draw. It may, may I say respectfully to this House, attract the wrong sort of persons because one comes into this public service not for what one can get out of it but what one can give to his country and to his fellow men. That, I am sure, must have been the motive which led our Prime Minister and his team, when they entered politics in 1959, to guide the destiny of this country. So I think it will be a folly to think that because they are Ministers, they carry responsibilities, and therefore they must be paid very high salaries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point of whether the Government in Singapore is costing the taxpayer perhaps a little too much. The high cost of government, I find, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in salaries alone paid to Ministers, going down from the Prime Minister to the Ministers of State, is an annual sum of nearly $4 million. This is in payment of salaries alone to Ministers in the Government. We have, unique to Singapore, two Deputy Prime Ministers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> One of them is, of course, in full-time charge of a Ministry. The other would appear to be a supernumerary, super-annuated. And his main task, as I see it at the moment, seems to be to write long letters to the press as the political propagandist for the Government and the People's Action Party. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this Bill; whether it is right that the taxpayer should be burdened with these additional sums. They are not small sums. They are quite large sums particularly, I repeat, when the Prime Minister has drawn the attention of Singaporeans to the bleak future facing this country for the next year - I do not know how many years - and for the need to tighten our belts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have had NWC recommendations and this year's NWC recommendations, I need not remind Members of the House, are $18.50 plus 2.5% to 6.5%. The salary increases that are offered for our workers are very, very meagre compared to what increases (i keep saying \"increases\" because that is what it really amounts to) that are being offered to our Ministers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is wrong, if I may say so, Mr Speaker, to try and equate service in the Government as a Minister holding a political office with that of the Administrative Service. It is wrong. For one thing, they are two different things. In the Administrative Service, the officer is paid to do a job and he does not enjoy the authority, the prestige, and the dignity that go with the appointment to a political office. So it will be wrong, in my submission, to try and equate service in the political field with that of service in the Administrative field. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken about the high cost of government in Singapore today. I have mentioned about the salaries. I have tried to tot up the sum that is provided in the estimates for Administration, just pure administration of this country of over 2 1/4 million people. I would like to know what the exact figure would be from the Minister, if he is able to give that answer. The figure that I find is staggering, and I would urge the Minister to consider whether it is time that we examined Government \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> expenditure, particularly in the salaries, and other economies that may be effected. I would propose to the Minister that this Government should give serious consideration to the appointment of a commission now in Singapore to examine Government expenditure to see and to recommend what economies can be effected in Government spending without reducing efficiency. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Mr Speaker, Sir, in our society unfortunately people who need welfare, people who find it a burden to pay their hospital bills, people who are unemployed and who do not get any unemployment benefits, and people who are aged. I was reading in the Straits Times (I think it was yesterday) the speech made by a Minister about the plight of the aged in Singapore. In my view, it should be possible for some of these savings in Government expenditure to be directed towards caring for the needy and the less privileged in our midst. That is a deserving cause. We should not merely attempt to look after those in our society who are able to look after themselves, who can earn for themselves, sufficient to keep themselves. We should concern ourselves with those who are unable to do this, and we should see whether, with the funds and money available, this can be done. And I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it can be done if a serious attempt is made by this Government to examine Government expenditure to see what economies can be effected. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose this Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have been listening very patiently to the Member for Anson what he has been speaking on this Bill. May I remind him that this is a Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Bill and not the budget. I thank him for his advice on how to run a surplus in the budget. But let me assure him that I am able to find from the budget enough money to pay for the parliamentary pensions that are proposed in this particular Bill. I am also able to find the money to pay the Judges, whatever is considered proper to them. Civil servants who have had revisions of their salaries need not fear that there will be no money in the budget \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to pay whatever it is that have been awarded to them. My own feeling is that civil servants are worthy of their hire and that they should be paid whatever is due to them. That also goes for the Prime Minister, the First Deputy Prime Minister, the Second Deputy Prime Minister, and so on. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, these are matters which are irrelevant. In this particular case, all I am asking is that persons who have served Parliament for at least eight years as office holders should be paid parliamentary pensions and which would be due to them if they retire, as he has suggested. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I want to answer any point on what salaries are being paid in other jurisdictions to Ministers or Prime Ministers. They are totally irrelevant to this Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask a point of clarification from the Member for Anson. Am I right in interpreting that he is not against pensions being paid to Members of Parliament and Ministers? In other words, what is his stand on pensions being paid to Members of Parliament? I want that point to be clarified first. Leaving aside this particular Bill for the time being, what is his stand on pensions being paid to Members of Parliament or Ministers? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel at all with the payment of pensions to Ministers and Members of Parliament if they have served the requisite number of years in Parliament when they cease to hold office. But what this Bill proposes to do is to pay them pensions even while they are still in office, i.e. while they are holding office or have not ceased to be Members of Parliament. This is why I say that, for all practical purposes, what this amounts to is an increase in the salary that is being paid at the moment. Call it pension if you like, but what does it matter? It puts so much extra into the pockets of the Ministers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers who have earned pensions, having served the required term, were to retire and a new Prime Minister and Ministers are appointed, they too will be earning a salary. So, is there any saving at all to the Budget? Pensions will be paid to the Minis- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ters and the Prime Minister who have retired and new Ministers and a new Prime Minister will be earning a new salary. So there is no saving whatever to the total Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am trying to pin the Member for Anson down on his point that, given the grim picture which he has painted about the economy, Ministers should not enjoy what is due to them because it adds a cost to the Budget. The point which I am making is that if you were to argue logically, if Ministers who have earned their pension under the Parliamentary Pensions Act were to resign, new Ministers have to be appointed and be paid salaries. So the argument that there is a saving is not logical. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know quite exactly what the Hon. Minister intends by his question. Of course, if a Prime Minister should cease to hold office, then under the existing Act he will, of course, be entitled to a pension. I am not asking for a repeal of any provision in the Act. We are talking about this Bill which says that even whilst a Minister is holding office he should be paid a pension. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, precisely. If the amendment is not effected, then we are actually asking the Ministers and the Prime Minister, who would have otherwise earned a pension under the existing Parliamentary Pensions Act, to personally sacrifice a large sum of money which is due to them. They would have earned the pension under the Parliamentary Pensions Act if they were to step down from office. Have I put the point across? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may repeat, under the existing Parliamentary Pensions Act, certain Ministers would qualify for pension if they are not office holders, that is, if they step down from Ministerial office. So what we are, in fact, asking them to do is to make a personal sacrifice of what they would have earned, because they could now retire as Ministers, enjoy the pension, get a job outside; and new Ministers have to be appointed in their place. So there is no saving whatsoever on the Budget. We are, in fact, asking the Ministers who have worked very hard for the benefit of the country to make a sacrifice which is not \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> very proper.

The prohibition will take effect from 31st May, 1982, the date when an announcement was made in the Press regarding the introduction of such a prohibition. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HUDC flats have been sold to Singapore citizens and permanent residents under the Middle Income Housing Scheme. This is to help Singapore citizens and those with permanent ties in Singapore to own their homes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provisions of the Residential Property Act, 1976, only prohibit foreigners from purchasing flats in buildings of less than six storeys unless they have obtained the prior approval of the Controller of Residential Property. Many of the HUDC housing estates have buildings higher than six storeys and the prohibition in the Act does not apply to these high-rise buildings. Under the leases issued by the Housing and Urban Development Company (Private) Limited to the owners of the flats, the flat owners are not allowed to resell their flats within five years from the date they occupy their flats. After this 5-year period, these flat owners will be entitled to sell their flats without having to seek the prior approval of the lessor. The amendment to the Act will restrict the sale of HUDC flats by their present owners to Singapore citizens. Persons who are not Singapore citizens can only purchase these flats if they have the prior consent of the Controller of Residential Property. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also introduces amendments to the Residential Property Act, 1976, for the purpose of overcoming practical difficulties encountered by the Controller of Residential Property in the administration of the Act.

The existing provisions of the Act permit foreign persons to purchase flats in buildings of six or more levels of units in condominium developments. The new section 3A seeks to replace the existing subsection (3) of section 2 of the Act, which is being repealed. The new section 3A seeks to clarify that whilst foreign persons are allowed to purchase flats, not being HUDC flats in buildings of six or more levels of units in a condominium development, the approval of the Minister must be obtained if a single foreign person wishes to acquire all the flats in all the buildings consisting of six or more levels in a particular development or all the units in a condominium development.

In other words, a single foreign person may lease all the flats in a high-rise building or all the units of a condominium development for a term not exceeding seven years, including any farther term which may be granted by way of an option for renewal. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 17 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TRUSTEES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.34 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S.

The Registrar will also be empowered to cancel the registration of any instrument disposing of such a flat or unit if it has been inadvertently registered. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also introduces other amendments to the Land Titles (Strata) Act for the purposes of - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) changing the requirements of strata title plans to be filed with the Registrar of Titles; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) making changes in the practice and procedure affecting the issue of strata titles and the filing of schedules of strata units in respect of the share value to be allocated for the strata units in a subdivided building.

Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Home Affairs, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Vigilante Corps (Amendment) Bill, 1982, is to provide the Vigilante Corps with additional powers to deal with members of the Corps who commit disciplinary offences. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps was started in 1964 mainly as a volunteer service to assist the Singapore Police Force in maintaining law and order. In 1967, part-time national service in the Vigilante Corps was introduced and the Vigilante Corps Act was enacted to regularize the position of the volunteers and to allow the enlistment of the national servicemen into the Corps. Given the nature of its duties, the disciplinary powers given to the Corps then were not stringent and were adequate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, full-time Vigilante Corps was introduced together with the Police National Service (Full-time) Special Constabulary (PNS(F)SC). The Police National Service (Fu ll-time) Vigilante Corps (PNS(F)VC) are subject to the Vigilante Corps Act, whilst the PNS(F)SC are governed by the Police Force Act. In 1981, the Corps was assigned wider responsibilities in Civil Defence which included the setting up of the Vigilante Corps (Construction Brigade) and other civil defence units. In view of its important role in emergencies, and to ensure an effective and reliable civil defence, there is now a need for stricter discipline to be maintained in the Corps. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces the following additional disciplinary powers: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) detention for a period not exceeding 40 days; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) fine of up to $200; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stoppage of leave for a period not exceeding 28 days; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) restriction of privileges for a period not exceeding 14 days; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) extra duty or drill for a period not exceeding 7 days. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other powers provided by this Bill include: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the ordering of payment of compensation up to $100 by a member of the Corps, to third parties who suffer damage or loss by reason of the offence; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the provision for deductions from his pay, for every day of absence without leave or desertion, for every day of detention, and for every day in hospital on account of sickness caused by an offence committed by him. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of offences punishable under the Act is also increased from 12 to 27. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new powers sought under this Bill are based mainly on those available to the SAF under the Singapore Armed Forces Act. This will ensure that the Vigilante Corps can maintain a level of discipline as high as that prevailing in the SAF. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise for a clarification from the Minister on clause 4 of the Bill where it says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where an officer is found guilty of any of the offences specified in the Schedule to this Act by any person authorised by regulations made under this Act' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know from the Minister who is the person who has been authorized by regulations?

If he looks at the Act as a whole, he will find that powers are given, for instance, in amended section 17, \"where a subordinate officer is found guilty by a disciplinary officer\", in which case it will be an individual. So to determine the persons authorized, one will have to refer to the entirety of the Act which defines specific cases of who is the disciplinary officer authorized to do so. But I specifically refer him to the amended section 17 which talks of a disciplinary officer with respect to specific different sections of the Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof Jayakumar]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.50 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, the Postal Services Department is responsible for the conveyance of letters, postcards and parcels both within and outside Singapore. On the other hand, the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore is responsible for the provision of domestic and international telephone, telex and telegram services. The idea of merging these two organizations into a single organization responsible for both postal and telecommunication operations arose a few years ago. It was then recognized that with the advent of electronic mail in the near future, the transmission of messages over vast distances by electronic means would soon be faster and cheaper than that by post. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this development, the functions performed by the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Autho- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> rity of Singapore would overlap to some extent. It would be administratively neater for the postal and telecommunication functions to be performed by a single authority. Merger would also reduce competing demand for scarce technical staff and enable the two organizations to concentrate their efforts to provide the most efficient and cheapest service to the public. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will benefit from the merger of the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. Scarce resources, especially manpower, would be deployed more efficiently. For example, one person could deliver letters and postcards, as well as telegrams, instead of two persons, one to deliver letters and postcards and the other to deliver telegrams. Vehicles belonging to both organizations could be pooled together with resultant savings in fuel and reduction in the number of vehicles, drivers and mechanics employed. The existing network of 72 post offices all over Singapore could also serve as outlets where various telecommunication services could be provided. The public will then be able to send letters and parcels, buy stamps, make international telephone calls, send telegrams or bring telephone sets to be repaired or replaced - all these at a post office. Separate telephone area offices in land-scarce Singapore would therefore not be necessary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual for one organization to be responsible for both postal and telecommunication services in a country. After all, postal and telecommunication services complement one another. Anyone wishing to communicate with another person could either make a phone call or send a letter. He could, of course, do both. This is acknowledged, perhaps implicitly, in countries such as West Germany, Japan, Switzerland, New Zealand, Brazil and the Netherlands where postal and telecommunication operations are handled by a single organization. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks-to effect the merger of the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore into a single statutory board. The present name \"Teleommunication Authority of Singapore\" or Telecoms, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> for short, will be retained for the new organization. The public has accepted the name \"Telecoms\" as synonymous with efficiency and technological progress. I do not wish to change the name for the time being because I want the new Telecoms to maintain the tradition of providing the best possible service at the cheapest cost to the public. I am confident that it will be able to do so. Steps will be taken to publicize that the new Telecoms will be responsible for both postal and telecommunication operations in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now go through the main sections in the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Bill, 1982. The Bill is basically an amalgamation of the Post Office Act (Chapter 84) and the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Act, 1974. Editorial changes have been made to bring in line similar provisions in both Acts and to combine them into one provision whenever possible. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Telecoms will continue to be given the existing exclusive privilege of operating and providing information communication systems in Singapore. The term \"information communication\" will cover the modes of post and telecommunication, which are used for communicating information from one place to another. The only exceptions are the telecommunication systems operated by the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Police Force as well as the broadcasting system operated by the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. All others wishing to operate or provide postal and telecommunication services in Singapore must apply to Telecoms for a licence. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All postal and telecommunication officers will be transferred to the service of the new Telecoms on terms no less favourable than those currently enjoyed by them in their respective organizations. In the case of common-user employees in the Postal Services Department, provision has been made for those who wish to remain in the Civil Service to do so. Those officers wishing to remain in the Civil Service will be posted to other departments on the same terms and conditions of service. All postal employees transferred to the new Telecoms who wish to remain on the pension scheme may also do so. The \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> others will be emplaced on the Central Provident Fund Scheme. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Telecoms will be run by a Board consisting of a Chairman, the Chief Executive and up to seven other members. All Board members, including the Chief Executive, will be appointed by the Minister. The Board shall be responsible for submitting a report on the activities of the organization to the Minister every year. The report in turn will be presented to Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new organization will be fully responsible in meeting its financial obligations. It may, with the approval of the Minister, borrow money by issuing debentures, shares or stocks of various classes or raise capital from banks and other financial institutions in Singapore or abroad. Any operating surplus will be used to finance capital expansion so as to improve the level of information communication services and upgrade existing facilities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the easy availability of more and more sophisticated telecommunication equipment all over Singapore, we must be constantly vigilant to ensure the proper use of such equipment. The existing power of seizure for the illegal use of radio-communication equipment has therefore been extended to include telecommunication equipment and attachments. Such seized equipment, if not claimed by the owners after two months, may then be disposed of by the new Telecoms in any manner considered desirable. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also authorizes the Chief Executive or any officer authorized to act for him to arrest or search any person or to search any place if there is good reason to suspect that an offence under the Bill is being committed or is about to be committed. The organization is also empowered to compound certain offences so as to avoid having to go to court on minor offences. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the major highlights of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Bill, 1982. In seeking to effect the merger of the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore, I must stress that skilled \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and experienced manpower in the field of information communication technology in Singapore is very limited. Our limited manpower resources will be stretched to keep up with the ever-increasing pace of technological advancement in this field. It is, therefore, sensible that we merge the two organizations and pool their resources together so that the new Telecoms is able to develop Singapore as a communication and information centre more effectively. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>6.02 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill will create a large public corporation which will assume the existing functions and powers of the Postal Services Department and the existing Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. This merger can indeed promise a more efficient and effective use of resources. However, the quality of the information communication services which the new Corporation will provide will depend greatly on the quality of its workforce and the work environment in the Corporation. Sir, I would like to draw attention to the following: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>(a) Human aspects of the merger exercise</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large organizations can become impersonal structures with little compassion for their workers. It is essential for the new Corporation to guard against this strenuously. Clauses 28 and 29 of the Bill provide for the transfer of employees to the new Corporation and for the protection of their conditions of service on transfer. It is important here that the workers are not taken for granted and the transfer treated as a mere perfunctory exercise. In the merger exercise the new Corporation must be sensitive to the feelings of the workers. Their fears regarding their role and their future in the new Corporation must be quickly allayed. In general, workers will be motivated to contribute to the best of their ability and will be committed and loyal to organizations which clearly demonstrate their care and concern for them. Hence, the decision-making process of the merger should take careful account of the human \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> aspects of the transfer. The Corporation must have a \"heart\". We must always remind ourselves that organizations are about people who have feelings and who want respect and dignity and not about work digits or work horses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to training and skill development of workers in the new Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>(b) Training and Skill Development for Workers in the new Telecommunication Authority of Singapore </i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are witnessing rapid developments in the field of information communication. We must keep pace with the developments and the technological changes associated with them if Singapore is to remain as an information communication service centre. To enable the workers in the Corporation to cope with the technological changes, their training and skill development needs must be given high priority. It is natural for workers to become apprehensive of changes, especially when they occur at a rapid pace. Changes have an unsettling effect. The main reason for this is the lack of information as to how these changes will affect them and their jobs. This is perhaps more so for workers who see the introduction of computerization, automation and robotization and so on as having a direct effect on their jobs, and they fear that they may become obsolete and be discarded. However, if they are given adequate and timely information on the changes and the steps that are taken to prepare and train them so that they can continue to play a useful role, they will be only too willing to respond responsibly and will help to usher in the new technology confidently. The new technology will help to make them more productive and will enable them to enjoy a better quality of life. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that steps are taken quickly to gear up the training and skill development of the workers in the new Corporation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I submit that it is the quality of the human resources in the new Corporation which will ultimately determine how successful it will be in the future. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, may I express my support, in principle, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> for this Bill. I think it is commendable that the Postal Services and the services provided by the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore should come under a single body. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only observation, and I say this without any reflection on the Hon. Minister who is going to be in charge of this Corporation, is that whilst he sets up the Corporation and appoints the Chairman and several members, it would appear from my reading of the Bill that they are really unable to do anything without, first of all, getting the approval of the Minister. It seems to me that too much power, again may I say without any reflection on the Minister, is vested in the Minister and not really in the Corporation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, would this not bring about a lack of confidence in the Chairman and members of the Corporation? There are several sections where it would seem to me that the Minister's power is unlimited, and I wonder whether it is advisable that the power of the Minister should be unlimited. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at clause 10, this deals with the appointment of the Chief Executive and other employees of the Corporation. We have, of course, the First Schedule which deals with the appointment of members of the Corporation. If I may take the First Schedule first, it would appear that the appointment of the Chairman and other members of the Corporation shall be by the Minister. I have no qualms about the judgment of the Minister, but I would like to know whether, in the appointment of the Chairman and members of the Corporation, the Minister would be guided by anybody, would he seek the advice of the Public Service Commission on these appointments, or would it just be left to the discretion of the Minister alone. I think it is necessary that in setting up a Corporation to undertake such vast undertakings as the Postal Services and the services provided by the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore, the people who are appointed should be capable people who can discharge the functions effectively and satisfactorily. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, again, the power given to the Minister to remove all or an of the mem- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> bers of the Corporation. There is a qualification, that is, \"necessary in the interests of the effective and economical performance of the functions of the Corporation . . . . There, again, is the power to remove members of the Corporation left to the sole discretion of the Minister. Will the Minister be guided by anybody else on this matter? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is what would appear to be a carte blanche power to the Minister to remove members of the Corporation or any member of the Corporation in the public interest. Now we find \"public interest\" power given to the Minister in other sections as well. Is the Minister to be made the sole judge of what is in the public interest, or would he again seek the advice of anybody else outside himself before he exercises these powers? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the appointment of the Chief Executive. Again, one finds that although the Corporation is empowered to appoint a Chief Executive, it may only do so after seeking the approval of the Minister. So much for the powers given to the Minister for the appointment of members of the Corporation and the Chief Executive. I think it is desirable, and I hope the Minister will see that it is desirable, that perhaps the Public Service Commission or any other body should be drawn into the appointment even if it be in an advisory capacity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is clause 18 on which I would like some clarification from the Minister. It talks about the investment of funds. I see that funds may be invested: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in securities in which trust funds may, by any written law for the time being in force relating to trustees, be invested . . .'. \n  <br> \n  <br>We can find out what are the investments that trustees can make. But then there is this: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'for the development of information communication service whether in Singapore or elsewhere.' \n  <br> \n  <br>I do not quite understand what is intended by this. Is it intended that funds of the Corporation should be used to finance development of information communication services outside Singapore? Would that give the Corporation an equity in the other information service, or would it be by way of an outright loan being granted \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to the other undertaking outside Singapore, and before any such investment is made, whether there would be obtained the approval, I would say, of Parliament? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is clause 22 where one finds the \"public interest\" powers of the Minister. This is in subclause (6): \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(6) On the occurrence of any public emergency or in the public interest the Minister may, by order in writing, direct that - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the operation of any telecommunication . . . should be subject to the control of the Government, and may - \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n               xxx       xxx       xxx\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) provide for the taking of, the control of or the usage for official purposes of, all or any such telecommunication system and' \n  <br> \n  <br>and then, finally, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) provide for the stopping, delaying and censoring of messages and the carrying out of any other purposes which the Minister thinks necessary, . . .'. \n  <br> \n  <br>So we have, here again, wide powers given to the Minister to stop, delay and censor messages, if he considers that the public interest or public emergency requires it. And sub-clause (7) says:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(7) if any doubt arises as to the existence of a public emergency or as to whether any act done under paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (6) was in the public interest, a certificate signed by the Minister shall be conclusive evidence of the matters stated therein.' \n  <br> \n  <br>In other words, the Minister is made the sole judge again of what is public emergency or when a public emergency exists or what is in the public interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would counsel against such wide powers being given just to the Minister, again without any reflection on the Minister who is introducing this Bill. We are talking about the principle of the Bill and whether it is advisable that powers should be vested in just one man. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if I may talk about the transfer of employees. Concern has been made by an hon. Member for the employees who are being transferred. What I would like to know from the Hon. Minister is about the protection of the present employees of the Postal Services Department who are public servants, the protection that is given to them under the Constitution which says that before their services can be terminated or they can be reduced in rank certain procedures have to be \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> followed. Will that protection be safeguarded when employees are transferred from the Postal Services Department to this new Corporation? Because if we look at clause 29, it says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Until such time as regulations are drawn up by the Corporation, the regulations relating to the schemes and terms and conditions of service in the Government . . . shall continue to appIy . . .\" \n  <br> \n  <br>But what will be the position when regulations are drawn up by the Corporation? Will they in any way detract from the protection given at the moment to the employees in the Postal Services Department? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in clause 71 you will find that it seeks to punish persons who do a number of things but there is an exemption, and that is this. You will find it in paragraphs (b) and (e). Clause 71, paragraph (b) says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'except in obedience to an order of the Minister or an employee specially authorised by him to make the order, wilfully omits to transmit or intercepts or acquaints himself with or detains any message or part thereof or deliberately causes a call or connection to be disconnected or not to be connected;' \n  <br> \n  <br>he shall be guilty of an offence. So if the Minister orders this, then he is exempt. He is immune from any prosecution. In effect it gives the Minister very wide powers to detain any message or to acquaint himself with any message or part thereof. When we come to paragraph (e) of clause 71, it says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'except in obedience to an order of the Minister or the chief executive or the direction of a court, wilfully opens or causes to be opened contrary to his duty any mail bag or postal article in the course of transmission by post or wilfully detains or delays or causes to be detained or delayed the mail bag or postal article;'. \n  <br> \n  <br>I am glad to see in this clause there the provision of \"the direction of a court\". I should have thought that in all these cases there should be the direction of a court. I can understand that sometimes it may be impractical to seek the direction of a court before powers to stop or to open any mail, letters, or telegrams are exercised, but one must recognize the right to secrecy and that it is something that should not be openly infringed without adequate reasons and security provided. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the accounts of the Corporation. I see, by the Third Schedule, the third paragraph provides for the auditing of the accounts of the Corporation \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'by the Auditor-General or by an auditor appointed annually by the Minister in consultation with the Auditor-General.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the reason for including in this paragraph the appointment of an auditor outside the Auditor-General. I would commend to the Hon. Minister that accounts of all statutory boards (and this Corporation will be a statutory board) should, in principle, be audited by the Auditor-General, and no power should be given to the Corporation or anyone else to appoint any other auditor to audit the accounts of the Corporation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I wish to say on this Bill, Sir. \n  <br>6.22 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, before I support this Bill, I wish to seek the Minister's clarification and assurance on certain items of the Bill. These items are more basic, down to earth, and they will directly affect the welfare of the staff in the Postal Services Department as well as the service to the general public. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the written objective on this Bill, it is an Act to give effect to the merger of Telecoms and the Postal Services Department. I feel this may be an administrative convenience because a merger is usually between two equals or two near-equals. However, in this case, taking only the net revenue for the last year based on the published reports, Telecoms had a net revenue of $264.4 million while Postal Services Department had a surplus of $41.5 million which represents only 15.7% of Telecoms' net revenue. Therefore, looking at the financial statements, it is apparent that this is not a merger but a take-over. I am not against take-overs because they can be good for both parties and also provide for greater benefits to the public as can be seen with the previous merger between Telecoms Department and the Singapore Telephone Board to form the current Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS), though that was a reverse take-over in personnel terms. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with take-overs, or paper mergers, certain implications arise and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> this is what I would request for clarification and assurance from the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this merger can be a means of eliminating competition. If this is so, then the general public who is used to a certain level of postal services will suffer. I base this on the statement made by the Chairman of Telecoms in his annual report 1980/81, and I quote: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With this merger, it is anticipated the services such as electronic mail can be implemented more efficiently and expeditiously.' \n  <br> \n  <br>I trust that the Minister is aware of a debate going in other countries as to whether electronic mail can and should supersede postal mail. Therefore, does the Chairman's statement mean that now that Telecoms have eliminated or at least contained the Postal Services Department and the competition in postal mail with this 'merger', we (Telecoms) can now go ahead and implement electronic mail and the public will pay us as they will have no alternative? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this is not the case. But I do want an assurance from the Minister, especially more so when Part V of the Bill states that Telecoms will have \"exclusive privilege with respect to information communication system\". It means there might be a danger of the cost of Postal services becoming more expensive. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if this is a take-over as it appears to be, will the staff of the Postal Services Department suffer? The Member for Geylang Serai has spoken on this topic. Usually in take-overs, the current staff of the take-over organization is given terms and conditions of employment which might be less favourable than they have now. This is not so. I am glad that the Minister has assured us of this, especially when the staff of the Postal Services Department are a hard-working and dedicated group of people who have delivered our mail and provide other services under difficult conditions of heavy workload without complaint. If at all, I would like to see that they are given better terms and conditions whenever possible but certainly not less favourable than what they have currently. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another implication of a take-over is for funds to be siphoned off. In other words, I \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> hope Postal Services Department with a surplus of $41.5 million last year alone will not be viewed by Telecoms as a cash-cow which can be milked for years to come to finance all the other activities in Telecoms, including electronic mail at the expense of the general public. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the Bill, there appears to be no indication of the financial arrangements in regard to the transfer of assets and liabilities. Questions in my mind are things like: what are the estimated savings in annual recurrent expenditure affecting the Government budget, especially when the Minister spoke about the pooling of resources, and, of course, economies of scale and more advanced technology. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on, Sir, but with all due respect and consideration to the Chair, I will summarize by saying that, all in all, the cardinal issue here is the need for a clear assurance from the Minister that our Postal Services Department, which has been providing an excellent counter service all these years because its objective is to provide efficient service, is not in any way buried in the mass of Telecoms, especially when Telecoms may tend to emphasize other priorities than service. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, recently I had the privilege of visiting the Postal and Telecoms facilities to look at how things were done. I was indeed very much impressed with the efficiency and the high morale of the staff in these two organizations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years ago the Post and Telegraph Services were under one body. The Telegraph Department later merged with the Cable and Wireless to form the Singapore Telephone Board which subsequently was converted into the TAS. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek some clarification from the Hon. Minister, in particular, on the postal facilities. I was given to understand that the present postal facilities at Nelson Road will be moved to a temporary larger and better facility at the former Rollei factory. A new one will also be constructed in Eunos Estate. May I seek a clarification from the Hon. Minister whether this is a prudent move, as this will \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> no doubt involve immense costs in removing two or three times. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us do recall that the TAS has, on account of its efficiency, been able to maintain the costs of telephone services and telecommunication services to the public and even in one service managed to reduce the cost. I am therefore quite confident, after viewing the facilities, that the services of the postal services will be further increased and I think it is our hope that the costs of sending mail will not be increased unduly because of the merger and arising out of this a more efficient service can be rendered to the public. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank the various hon. Members for their support of the Bill. I cannot agree with the Member for Geylang Serai more on his statement that the quality of the information communication services which the new Corporation will provide will depend greatly on the quality of its workforce and the work environment. This is one of the reasons why the Government thought it would be prudent for the postal facilities at Nelson Road to move over eventually to the new complex which will be built in Eunos Estate. We have heard of complaints from the postal staff and also from the late Mr P. Govindaswamy, the previous Member for Anson, years ago when he brought up the plight and complaints of postal workers about the poor working conditions at the Nelson Road Mails and Parcels Centre. The facilities have been improved from time to time but that was only a temporary measure and it was done on a piecemeal basis. We hope we will eventually give them a proper and permanent workplace. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the statement made by the Member for Geylang Serai is concerned, I am sure the present Telecoms and the Postal Services Department are fully aware that the quality of service depends greatly on the quality of its workforce. The Member is also concerned that the new Corporation, because of its size, may become impersonal, with little compassion for its workers. I must say that it all depends on management. Some smaller organizations are more impersonal than larger organizations. So it all depends on \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whether the management is an enlightened one or not. It is in the interest of the Corporation itself to win over the trust and loyalty of its employees and motivate them into giving of their best. An enlightened management must surely understand this. I am sure the management of the new Corporation will do the necessary in line with Government's policy to develop its human resources to its fullest potential so that the new Telecoms can provide a more efficient postal and telecommunication service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that upon merger plans will be made to design and conduct training courses to help staff, both clerical and uniformed staff to upgrade their skills. A traineeship scheme will also be introduced for the postal clerks, similar to the one for the Telecoms clerks. Courses will also be developed to enable staff, particularly postmen, to undergo upgrading courses so that they will be able to apply for higher grades in their merged organization, either within the postal services or the other services in the organization, such as artisans and technicians. In-service courses would also be provided to prepare staff to operate the various machines and equipment that will be installed in the future. This will also ensure that they will not be redundant with the introduction of mechanization and automation, besides widening their job responsibilities. All staff of the merged organization will be eligible to apply for training awards, if they have the prerequisite qualifications, which can benefit their career in the new Telecoms. These training awards will enable such selected staff to do part-time courses at the Vocational and Industrial Training Board, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic and the National University of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has a number of observations. First of all, it is about clause 10 on the appointment of the Chief Executive. He claims that the Minister's power is so unlimited that it appears that the Board would not be able to do anything without the permission of the Minister. I assure the Member that such powers already exist in the present Telecoms Act and the present Telecoms has been able to provide an efficient service - which he has admitted himself - so far with this provision in the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Act. I assure him that the Minister does not appoint the Chief Executive himself. The Chief Executive is recommended by the Board and appointed by the Board. Seeking the approval of the Minister is only an additional safeguard in case there may be other factors which may not be known to the Board. The same applies to the appointment of the other members of the Board. The provision for appointment of members to the Board by the Minister also exists in the present Act, and the Minister is normally guided by the Public Service Commission and by the other Board members who come to know of individuals who are conversant and competent in the field of telecommunications and they are nominated and appointed accordingly. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised about the content of clause 18 regarding investment of funds elsewhere other than in Singapore. This relates to investment of the Authority on submarine cables outside Singapore, on telecommunication satellite that goes outside the territory of Singapore. I hope that clears the point. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is not clear to me. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Clause 18 says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any funds of the Corporation may be invested from time to time in securities . . . be invested or for the development of information communication services whether in Singapore or elsewhere.' \n  <br> \n  <br>I think the phrase \"in Singapore\" is quite clear. He is referring to \"elsewhere\". \"Elsewhere\" means investment in submarine cables, for example, linking Singapore to other countries. For example, in the submarine cable linking Singapore to Indonesia, the cable will have to be laid from Singapore to somewhere outside Singapore in order to be connected to Indonesia. This is what is meant by \"elsewhere\" insofar as this investment of funds is concerned. Is it clear now? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I quite well understand about expenditure of money on submarine cables because that would be providing information services for Singapore. That is not my point. The clause would appear to give the Corporation power to invest any funds. It is a question of investment. We are talking about surplus funds for the development of information communication services whether in Singapore or elsewhere. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wanted to know was: does this envisage the Corporation taking an equity, for example, in information services undertaken in other countries? It is not the laying of submarine cables between Singapore and other countries but development of information services. For example, in Indonesia there is an undertaking there. Does this mean that the Authority may also join in in that undertaking and invest its funds there and will it get an equity? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not a lawyer but I thought the last but one line of the clause is very clear on this point. It says that it is the investment of funds \"for the development of information communication services whether in Singapore or elsewhere.\" I am here referring to the investment in submarine cables or satellite telecommunication systems outside Singapore. This is a capital expansion in order to upgrade the level of telecommunication services. This is to cover that part of the investment. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is wider than that. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, would you please not interrupt. If you want to speak, please do get the Chair's permission. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is just that the Hon. Minister was directing questions at me, so I thought I could answer. But I beg your pardon. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> This particular clause is to make provision for that sort of investment. I am sure the Member for Anson understands that the satellite is not in Singapore. It is somewhere up in the sky. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 71 is necessary to protect the public who uses the services of Telecoms in respect of the privacy and confidentiality of the information which is being transmitted. So I do not understand the point of the Member's objection. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 and 29 refer to the transfer of staff from the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Authority of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Singapore to the new Telecoms Corporation. I assure the Member for Anson and the Member for Telok Blangah that the interests of these employees will be safe-guarded, as explicitly stated in clauses 28 and 29. As I have explained in my speech earlier on, they will be employed on terms no less favourable than what they enjoy now. If Members were to read clause 29 carefully, they will find that all the safeguards are there. All the various options can be exercised by these employees, whether they want to remain under the pension scheme or otherwise. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Third Schedule, paragraph 3, raised by the Member for Anson on the appointment of auditors, the Corporation would be happy to engage the Auditor-General as the auditor. Unfortunately the Auditor-General may not be able to accept the appointment because of man power shortage. My personal experience is that first preference is usually given to the Auditor-General to be the auditor for statutory boards. For example, the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation wanted the Auditor-General to be the auditor, but the Auditor-General was unable to accept the appointment and suggested that the Corporation engage external auditors instead. This clause provides that if the Auditor-General is not able to do the job, the Corporation may, after consultation with the Auditor-General, appoint an external auditor. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah seems to have the misconception that this is a take-over Bill. If this is a take-over Bill, then we need only to amend the existing legislation. This is a new legislation for a new corporation. This Bill seeks to effect the merger of the Postal Services Department and the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore into a new statutory board, and not a take-over of one by another. The Member for Telok Blangah need not fear hat there will be no post offices or postal services after merger. We will continue to have post offices and postal services. As clearly stated by the General Manager, which he quoted correctly, with the merger it is anticipated that the services, such as electronic mail, can be implemented more efficiently and expeditiously, not to replace postal services nor to make \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the cost of postal services more expensive. As regards the arrangement for transfer of assets and liabilities, these are day-to-day manAgement matters.

Therefore, work permit holders, other than those who are likely to be absorbed into our permanent workforce, will gradually be phased out over that period. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those foreign workers who are not likely to be part of our permanent workforce, there is no need for them to contribute to the Central Provident Fund. However, to exempt these foreign workers from the CPF Scheme will make it cheaper for employers to hire such foreign workers. To discourage employers from indiscriminate recruitment of cheaper foreign workers instead of upgrading through automation and mechanization, a new Levy Scheme for foreign workers was announced early this year, and implemented with effect from 1st April, 1982. Under this Levy Scheme, employers are required to pay a monthly levy of 30% of the monthly wages of their foreign workers subject to a minimum of $150 per month. The minimum levy, however, does not apply to domestic help. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the move to discourage indiscriminate recruitment of foreign workers, it is logical to step up enforcement against illegal employment and enhance the penalty for such offences. The present penalty for employing a foreign worker without a work permit and for working without a work permit is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both such fine and imprisonment. This penalty was fixed 16 years ago. It is no longer adequate to deter employers and illegal workers from contravening the Act and must therefore be enhanced to serve its purpose. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is therefore to provide for the imposition of a levy on employers and contractors employing certain classes of foreign workers and to enhance the penalties for employing foreign workers without work permits and for working without work permits. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to enhance the present penalty for employing a foreign worker without a work permit and for working without a work permit to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both such fine and imprisonment. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to empower the Minister to make an Order to provide for the imposition of a levy on employers of certain classes of foreign workers. Any \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order made by the Minister can apply to employers who employ foreign workers with work permits as well as those who employ foreign workers without work permits. This is to ensure that employers do not avoid the levy by employing foreign workers without work permits. The clause also seeks to provide for the imposition of a penalty interest on any employer who fails to pay the levy within the prescribed period. The penalty interest shall be calculated at the rate of 2% per month, or the sum of $5, whichever is the greater, but the total penalty shall not exceed 20% of the amount of levy outstanding. Any levy and penalty due from and payable by an employer can be recovered as a debt to the Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Wong Kwei Cheong] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>BUILDINGS AND COMMON PROPERTY</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT)</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>7.10 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, purchasers are allowed to take possession of the premises when the Temporary Occupation Licence is issued by the Development and Building Control Division and before titles are issued and management corporations formed. This leads to a situation where developers are required to manage and maintain the buildings for a period of time. Purchasers will only be responsible for maintenance when strata titles are obtained and management corporations formed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the present system of sale and purchase of residential and commercial properties is maintained, we will have to take measures to ensure that deve- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> lopers maintain the buildings properly before the purchasers can manage the buildings themselves. From time to time, we have received complaints about the poor maintenance of buildings by developers. This could be due to insufficient funds for maintenance, incompetent management, or indifference on the part of the developers. There are also instances of unscrupulous developers trying to make a profit from the maintenance of the buildings. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some purchasers are also to be blamed for the dilapidated state of their buildings and the common properties in such buildings. Without legal backing, developers face the difficult task of compelling some of the recalcitrant residents or owners to pay maintenance charges. As a result, the common properties are left in a state of disrepair and the building rapidly becomes dilapidated. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill before the House seeks to ensure that buildings intended for strata subdivision are properly maintained by the developers during the interim period when such buildings are ready for occupation and before they are handed over to the management corporations for maintenance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments are:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A developer must set up a maintenance fund for each development which has more than four units sold to more than two purchasers and is intended for strata subdivision. All maintenance charges collected from purchasers of the flats and the income derived from the common property must be paid into this fund which shall be used to manage and maintain the common property and other approved expenditure. The developer will act as trustee of the fund for the purchaser's benefit and any surplus money will be transferred to the management corporation for the development when it is formed. The developer is obliged to keep proper accounts of all income and expenditure relating to the fund. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The purchaser of a flat who fails or refuses to pay the maintenance contributions within 28 days of the date of receipt of a written demand from the developer under the terms of the contract for sale \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and purchase, will have committed an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and to a further fine not exceeding $50 for every day during which maintenance fees remain unpaid after conviction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Commissioner of Buildings is empowered to appoint a managing agent if he is satisfied that the developer is not satisfactorily carrying out the management and maintenance. The managing agent must lodge with the Commissioner a bond for a prescribed amount to make good any loss resulting from his failure to duly account for monies received or held by him. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The developer of a building with more than four units intended for strata subdivision must deposit a sum which the Commissioner may utilize towards the expenditure incurred to rectify defects to the common property discovered within the maintenance period. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The developer shall maintain a register of all the flats containing particulars of the proposed share value, the floor area, the purchaser and his solicitors. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other minor amendments which are incidental and include definitions of the terms \"development\"p\"flat\", \"maintenance fund\", \"stratum\" and a more comprehensive definition of \"common property\" for the purposes of the Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on this Bill, I can claim to speak with some experience on this subject as I work in a building in which the occupiers have to sort out numerous problems with the developer regarding its maintenance. This Bill could not have come at a better time. With so many new buildings being built all over Singapore, it is only fitting that we enact legislation to ensure that buildings in the private sector are properly maintained. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of building maintenance normally arise as a result of, firstly, when \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the developer of the building fails to manage and maintain the development satisfactorily and, secondly, when tenants and subsidiary proprietors of units in the building fail to pay their maintenance fees for some reason or other. This Bill will therefore require a developer to set up a maintenance fund with all maintenance charges collected from purchasers of units-in the development, and it also makes it an offence for any purchaser who refuses to pay his share of the charges. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting about this Bill today is that the duties and responsibilities of the developer with regard to the maintenance of the building are now clearly defined. Clause 4 of the Bill states very clearly what the maintenance funds collected must be utilized for. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, developers are known to neglect their responsibilities by: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) failing to maintain the common property in the development in good condition; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) failing to provide a satisfactory standard of cleaning and security services; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) failing to repair damages occurring in structural fixtures and fittings; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) failing to provide adequate insurance to cover the development against damage. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the areas where irresponsible developers can willingly or unwillingly cause their buildings to deteriorate. If a developer is interested only in making quick money through the sale of the units in his development, he will not pay attention to its maintenance. Then the general condition of the building deteriorates and, in the end, purchasers suffer from poor maintenance and consequently the values of their properties are not enhanced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the blame falls on developers. Sometimes purchasers or occupiers refuse to pay maintenance fees. Very often they refuse to pay on the ground that the developer is not doing his job properly. This Bill therefore makes it an offence for any occupier refusing to pay maintenance fees. It is a fair principle. Purchasers must pay the charges and developers must get the job done. Failure on the part of either \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> party to carry out his obligations under the Act is an offence. No one can quarrel with the rationale underlying this Bill. We all want a clean Singapore and we do not want our buildings to degenerate into modern slums. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final point, Sir. In Singapore today there are many buildings where Temporary Occupation Licences have been issued, and there are many examples of such buildings where the state of maintenance is at a poor level. What I would like to ask the Minister is whether he would, as provided for under clause 4 of the Bill, by way of Gazette notification bring such buildings under the ambit of the Act and thereby require the developers to meet the obligations as provided and, if so, when he intends to do so. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the hon.

Under the existing Act, the Commissioner has to serve a written notice to the owner of the property requesting him to remove any plant which is likely to be a fire hazard or a source of danger to the public. If the owner failed to act immediately, the Commissioner could only proceed to remove the plant after the expiry of the notice. This delay is unacceptable in situations where any tree or plant is imminently dangerous to life or property and immediate measures have to be taken. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further amendment is a provision prohibiting the parking of vehicles on turfed areas beside public streets or on other turfed open spaces which are maintained by the Commissioner. In the past, many motorists park their vehicles indiscriminately on the roadside green verges in areas such as the East Coast Park. This causes extensive damage to the turfed areas and the Parks and Recreation Department has to expend public funds to repair the turf. The amendment will allow the Commissioner to take enforcement action against the offending motorists. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate enforcement of the Act, the Amendment Bill will also empower the Commissioner to require the vehicle owner, who is suspected of an offence under the Act or Rules, to furnish the identity and address of the person who drove the vehicle at the material time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine for such offence committed under the Act or Rules is increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and the Commissioner's power to compound any of the offences is also enhanced from $200 to $400. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to provide an additional mode of service of notices by the Commissioner, namely, by affixing such a notice conspicuously to some part of the premises or to some object on the premises. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Education (Mr Ho Kah Leong)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, credit must be given to the Parks and Recreation Department for its contributions towards making Singapore a garden city that is well-known throughout the world. Over the past 10 to 20 years we have planted trees in almost every place possible. As a result, on every Tree-planting Day, we have a problem looking for suitable sites to plant trees. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea to cover our island Republic with trees but matching the trees with the environment is another problem we have to consider. Of course, we would like to plant as many types of tropical trees as possible so that there will be variety. However, I observe that some of the trees grow tall and slim. There is no beauty in them at all. As a matter of fact, they are rather horrifying to see at night. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Amendment Bill seeks to give the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation wider powers to remove trees. I hope the Parks and Recreation Department will seek the advice of landscape artists to get rid of ugly-looking trees. Clause 3 of this Bill gives the Commissioner wider powers to remove any tree or plant without having to obtain the prior consent of the occupier. Of course, trees which pose imminent danger to life or property should be removed immediately. However, will the Hon. Minister kindly enlighten this House as to what measures are available to prevent the Commissioner from removing trees and plants in a private garden at his whim and fancy? Furthermore, the cost incurred in the removal of such trees will be thrust upon the occupier. How can the Hon. Minister ensure that the Commissioner will not charge an exorbitant fee for the removal of a tree? We all know that the spirit of the law lies in the fact that any piece of legislation passed or amended will not subject any law-abiding citizen to undue penalty. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision in the Bill to punish car owners for parking their vehicles on the road-side turfed areas. We all know that the Parks and Recreation Department has put in a lot of effort to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> construct the road-side grass verge. Car owners should therefore refrain from damaging the turf just for the sake of their own convenience. By damaging these turfed areas, these inconsiderate motorists are certainly committing an act no different from that of vandalism. Notwithstanding this, have we considered what measures there are to prevent motorists from committing such offence? Why can we not construct kerbs or low iron railings around the turfed areas? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to increase the composition fine from $200 to $400. This appears to be excessive. For an ordinary traffic offence, the composition fine ranges from $30 or $50 to $100. Will the Hon. Minister kindly enlighten us as to whether an offender will be fined $400 once he commits an offence? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I support this Amendment Bill, in principle. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the hon. Member for Jurong for supporting the Bill in principle. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has raised various points on the work of the Parks and Recreation Department. On the question of landscaping parks and beautifying our streets and various open spaces, the Parks and Recreation Department has the services of several landscape architects, and I would like to assure him that the staff of this Department have tried their very best to provide the best possible landscape architecture in the various areas. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of landscape architecture and landscape gardening, of course, different people have different opinions. While one person may consider a certain landscape architecture to be beautiful, another person may have a different opinion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cutting down trees, I would like to assure the hon. Member for Jurong and the House that the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation will definitely not indiscriminately cut down trees in private gardens. He will only cut down the trees which he considers are a danger to the public. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of providing road-side kerbs to prevent motor vehicles from parking on the grass verge, I have, in fact, put this question to the Public Works Department: that if the expenditure is not too high, we should provide more road-side kerbs so that motor vehicles will not easily get on to the turfed areas and so damage the turf. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of compounding the fines imposed on motorists who have committed offences, although the Bill provides that the Commissioner can compound a fine up to $400, he will not normally impose it except for serious offences, for example, when people give misleading information, such as the wrong name and address of the car owner - this sort of mischievous information. For this type of offence, the composition fine will be high. For simple offences, say, parking a car on the turf, I think most probably the composition fine is likely to be between $20 and $50 and not $400. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>7.37 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading of the construction industry is one of the tasks that we have set ourselves in this decade. The industry relies heavily on labour and lags seriously behind the other sectors of the economy in mechanizing its operations. Considering the slow growth in indigenous labour \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> supply and our policy to reduce reliance on unskilled foreign labour, the industry must move quickly towards mechanized methods of construction, if we are to keep down the costs of public housing and other construction work. To accelerate the pace of mechanization in the industry, an investment allowance incentive scheme for construction companies was introduced in the 1982 Budget Statement. Under the scheme, capital expenditure incurred by construction companies with more than 50% local share ownership may qualify for investment allowances of up to 50% of the expenditure incurred. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill seeks to give effect to this investment allowance incentive for the construction industry. The Bill amends Part VIA of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, specifically sections 46A, 46B and 46C. In the present Act, an investment allowance is granted only to companies which carry out projects for the manufacture or increased manufacture of any product; or for the provision of specialized engineering or technical services, or for research and development. The present Bill will extend the scope of the investment allowance incentive scheme to companies carrying out projects for construction operations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken in the Bill to make slight consequential amendments to the principal Act in conjunction with the amendments to be made to section 19A of the Income Tax Act. The latter amendments are to give effect to the accelerated depreciation allowance scheme for capital expenditure on computer and approved energy-saving machinery and equipment incurred by non-industrial enterprises. These were incentives presented in previous Budget Statements. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>RECLAMATION</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Pulau Busing)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br>7.42 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S.

The types of allowances provided for are: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Disability pension. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b Allowances for constant attention, applicable only to cases of 100% disablement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c Allowance for lowered standard of occupation, applicable only if the disablement renders the serviceman incapable of following the regular occupation before his service, and of following any other occupation of an equivalent standard. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d Treatment Allowance, for approved treatment, provided the sum of this allowance and the disability pension does not exceed the rate of pension payable for total disablement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e Allowance for wear and tear of clothing resulting from the use of artificial limbs or similar reasons. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f Child education allowance if the totally disabled serviceman has children. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Serviceman who is disabled due to service is entitled to free medical and rehabilitative treatment for his disablement at Government clinics and hospitals even after his release from National Service. Disablement equipment and aids such as wheelchair and artificial limbs are also provided free. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the serviceman's unit and the Central Welfare Fund play their part in the welfare of disabled servicemen as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Regular hospital or house visits. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b Hardship grants and ex-gratia payments, depending on the needs of each case. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c Re-assignment of jobs and vocations as appropriate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation terms have been improved over the years, the more important milestones being: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Replacement of the Federation Army Regulations, 1961 by the SAF Pensions Scheme Regulations, 1971. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b Inclusion of lump sum compensation along the lines of the Workmen's Compensation Act with effect from 1st October, 1975. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c Providing lump sum compensation for disabled servicemen whose degree of disablement is not serious enough to warrant discharge. Previous to October 1977, such compensation was given only to servicemen who were discharged. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d Incorporation with effect from 2nd January, 1981 of the new ceilings of lump sum compensation introduced by the Workmen's Compensation Act then. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disablement benefits are under review to keep them in tack with changing socio-economic conditions in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary case of 100% disablement in the period 1977-81 involved a National Serviceman private who was paralysed waist-downwards when the 3-tonner he was \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> travelling in overturned on 30th September, 1981. He was given medical leave with full pay until his release from National Service on 16th June, 1982, after he was confirmed as 100% permanently disabled. After his discharge from hospital, a wheelchair with foam seat and a toilet commode were purchased for him. Subsequently, a ripple mattress was supplied him on the recommendation of the Rehabilitation Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1982, the SAF Central Welfare Fund gave $10,000 as temporary financial relief to the family. Following his discharge from National Service on 16th June, 1982, the following benefits were given: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a A lump sum disability compensation of $20,000. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b A lump sum of $15,000 for constant attention. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c A monthly allowance totalling $300 as disability pension and allowance for lowered standard of occupation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>KAKI BUKIT ESTATE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Summonses under State Lands Encroachments Act)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for National Development why his Ministry had served summonses under the State Lands Encroachments Act on occupiers of properties in the Kaki Bukit estate before they were allocated alternative accommodation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> I must point out that when State lands or acquired lands are to be developed, the Resettlement Department has to follow prescribed legal requirements and procedures to clear the land. The Honourable Member for Kaki Bukit has previously raised this matter with my Ministry. He has been told the reasons for this legal process and he has reassured the affected residents in his constituency that the Government's intention is not to inconvenience them or to evict the eligible residents before alternative accommodation is available. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the benefit of the Member for Anson, who appears ignorant of the legal requirements, I shall now describe the various steps in the clearance process. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices to Remove or Notices to Quit are first issued against squatters on the land. These are formal notices to the squatters that they have to vacate the site. Upon expiry of the notices, legal action has to be instituted under the State Lands Encroachments Act for the issuance of summonses. However, the squatters need not attend court in person to answer the charge of unlawful occupation of State land if they plead guilty by means of a standard written statement supplied by the Resettlement Department which provides assistance and advice to the squatters to complete this legal process unless they wish to contest the charges in court. Invariably more than 90% of the squatters follow this procedure and are therefore not inconvenienced. In the case of Kaki Bukit, 98% of the squatters accepted this procedure. The purpose of the legal proceedings is to enable the Resettlement Department to obtain Warrants of Dispossession to enforce removal of the squatters from the State lands, if it is necessary subsequently especially in cases where irresponsible persons, including politicians, incite squatters to resist clearance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, parallel action is taken to offer alternative accommodation to squatters according to their eligibility and the availability of such accommodation. I must stress that alternative accommodation is an ex-gratia benefit and may be offered to squatters at any point during the legal clearance process. Accordingly, some summonses may have been served prior to the offer of alternative accommodation to the squatters. While the service of notices and summonses constitutes part of the legal clearance process, the Warrants of Dispossession made by the court against the squatters are not enforced until the Resettlement Department has offered alternative accommodation to those squatters who are eligible. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearance of Kaki Bukit follows the normal procedure adopted for the clearance of all other State lands. They are treated no differently from all other squatters facing clearance action elsewhere. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820831/19820831-HA-0420199.htm\">Table - Non-Schooling Population (Cols. 199 - 200)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br>  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
